1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 A woman marries a ghost pirate and is shocked when things get spooky,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 and then we take a look at a very special story to me.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:20,000
 It's a personal story involving true crime, gang warfare, drugs, and the loss of someone very important to me.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,500
 I call it "The Ballad of Jeff Ray" today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, and I hope it leads into a great weekend.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So I have a favor to ask you guys though.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,500
 I'm trying to get this podcast into phase two.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
 I had a dream the other day about the podcast.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 This actually might have been the first time I dreamt about the podcast.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,000
 And it was about getting the podcast ready for the next level.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So what I would like you guys to do, if you have the time I would really appreciate it,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 you can contact me on Twitter @DeadRabbitRadio.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 You can email me at deadrabbitradio@gmail.com

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 or you can hit me up in the YouTube comments that works as well,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
 Facebook @DeadRabbitRadio on Facebook as well.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,000
 But I would just like a little information.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,500
 It's nothing personal, it's nothing marketing or anything like that.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000
 I would just like to know how long you've been listening to the show,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,500
 what you like about the show, and what you think could be improved.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,000
 I would like to get your feedback is basically what I'm looking for.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,500
 And it would be helpful if it was kind of in that structure,

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,000
 how long you've been listening to the show, what you like about the show,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 and what you think can be improved.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So everything has a good and a bad to it.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And I would like to hear your version of both.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And that will allow me to kind of fine tune the show

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 because really for a year and a half, almost over a year, I guess I should say,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,500
 I've just been doing it by the seat of my pants.

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 There's no real books on how to do this,

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 there's no resources on how to run like a solo podcast

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 or a daily podcast or anything like that.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
 And as far as I know, everything is going great.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 But I would like to get feedback from you guys.

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
 I would really, I really appreciate your guys' opinion

38
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
 and whatever way you can reach out to me, that would be great.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
 So I'm going to be talking about this obviously on today's episode

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
 and then each episode for the rest of the week,

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 because not everyone listens to every episode.

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 And we're going to start doing a big marketing push

43
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 and we're going to see what the show's strengths are

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,000
 and what the show's weaknesses are and so on and so forth.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,500
 I'm actually thinking about buying ad space in college newspapers.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 I think that would be a great audience for us.

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
 But before we start really growing the show,

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,000
 I want to know what my core audience, you guys, think about it.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,500
 Before we start bringing in everyone else,

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,000
 a lot of you guys have been listening since episode one.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 A lot of you guys have gone back and listened through the entire series through

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
 and I really appreciate that.

53
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
 Even if you just listen to one episode, I appreciate that as well.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But I want to know how I'm doing.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 This is basically a report card.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 So I would really appreciate that information

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 and let's just go ahead and get started with the episode.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Now, this episode I'm going to format a little bit differently

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 because the main story I'm going to do first,

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 because it's quite depressing

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,500
 and I thought we could end on a fun note for the weekend.

62
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 But it was a story that I've been thinking about doing for months and months

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 and not to get metaphysical or weird or anything like that,

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 but today I was sitting here.

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 I had an entire other episode planned and I thought,

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
 "I need to do this episode today."

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 I hope this episode, this first segment speaks to you.

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 It might actually save you from doing something really, really stupid.

69
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 If not, just enjoy as much as you can

70
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,000
 because it is quite depressing, but enjoy the story that I call the "Ballad of Jeff Ray."

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Now, Jeff Ray was my uncle.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 He was born into a family of five.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Well, seven? Do you count the parents when you say that?

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So I'll try to keep this as lighthearted as I can,

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,500
 but mom and dad, obviously, and then five brothers and sisters.

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 He was the youngest of them and he was a powerhouse.

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
 He was six foot three.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,500
 His hobby was lifting massive amounts of weights.

79
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 He was this bulky dude, very, very muscular man,

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,000
 good looking guy from what I can gather.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,500
 But the father, his dad, was abusive, very abusive man.

82
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,000
 And I've heard stories about my grandpa and his abuse for years and years growing up.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,500
 He had passed away.

84
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 My biological grandfather had passed away before I was born,

85
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 but he was a total, I'm going to say this is going to be hard for me to control my cussing too,

86
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,000
 but he was a total jerk. We'll put it that way.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,500
 Just to give you an idea of the type of situation that my family,

88
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 my mother's side of the family grew up in,

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 their biological father would, for punishment, make them stand on the,

90
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 so coffee used to come in big tin cans, like a big tin Folgers can.

91
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 It had like a plastic lid.

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,000
 You take it off and then you'd have like a giant tin can.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
 If you got in trouble, you'd have to stand on that barefoot.

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 So the rim of the tin can would kind of cut into your feet.

95
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
 He was a raging alcoholic.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I guess I should have said that first.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,500
 So his behavior was absolutely unpredictable.

98
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,000
 One year, someone, one of the kids made a slight error,

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 disrespected him, did something wrong, whatever.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It was Christmas time.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So he thought the best revenge, because that's truly what it was.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
 It wasn't punishment.

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,000
 The best revenge was for all the kids to open up their Christmas presents,

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 look at them and then throw them into the roaring fireplace.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,500
 This was the family that Jeff Ray grew up in.

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
 The mother, my grandma, my amazing grandma, Ida, who has passed away now,

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 she did her best to shield the kids as she could,

108
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
 but her husband was just a raging lunatic.

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 She wasn't allowed to drive.

110
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 She wasn't allowed to do anything outside the house without his permission.

111
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,000
 He was such a bad alcoholic.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
 I always thought this story was kind of funny.

113
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,000
 Again, I don't mind laughing at him because he was such an asshole,

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 but one day he got so drunk he passed out on a railroad track,

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 and the train came and chopped his leg off.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,500
 So I think that's kind of funny because, you know, shouldn't be picking on kids.

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 Yeah, like I said, it's a pressing episode,

118
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 but anyways, then he hobbled around and he got a new, like, wooden leg or something like that.

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 Eventually he fell down, he got so drunk he fell down, hit his head on the table, and died in his sleep.

120
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 My grandma, Ida, went on to marry an amazing man named Cliff Miller,

121
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 who's also passed away now, but they had, I don't know, 30 years of marriage,

122
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 and that was the grandpa that I knew, a very loving man.

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,000
 But Jeff Ray mostly grew up in the environment of his biological father,

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,500
 not a good environment to be in.

125
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,000
 But Jeff Ray is a teenager. It's the 1970s.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 He's just out having fun with his friends, his brothers, his extended family.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 This all takes place in Orangevale, California, which even today seems like a tight-knit community.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,500
 Now it's pretty much been encroached on by Sacramento.

129
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 All of the suburbs have sprawled and become one mass, but back then Orangevale was a lot of rural area.

130
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 Like all teenagers, he kind of starts getting into bad stuff,

131
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,000
 and especially with his background, it's no surprise that he started getting into a little bit of petty crime,

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,500
 and then not so petty crime.

133
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,500
 One thing they do is Jeff and his brothers start growing weed in my grandma's backyard.

134
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 There's very, very nice soil back there.

135
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,000
 My grandpa eventually turned it into an actual vegetable garden, but in the '70s they were growing weed.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And one day they went out to check their crop, and it was gone.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Someone had jumped over the fence and stole like two or three plants, two or three marijuana plants.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Now to my new listeners, or I shouldn't say new listeners, to my younger listeners,

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 that was an extremely valuable, I guess it's still valuable now,

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,500
 but now that you can pretty much just go to a store and buy marijuana, it's completely night and day.

141
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 Somebody came over your fence and stole your weed.

142
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 It was the equivalent of them stealing your business.

143
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 Like someone not just breaking into your business and stealing cash,

144
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
 someone actually stealing your storefront from you.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,500
 This is how you made your money and then reinvested in more weed to grow.

146
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 So my brother and his friends who had been cultivating these plants were furious that this had happened.

147
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 Absolutely furious.

148
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,000
 And they knew, or at least they thought they knew who did it.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It was a man and his crew, known as Dominic, not the whole crew,

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,500
 the whole crew wasn't known as Dominic, but the main guy's name was Dominic.

151
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,000
 These kids start rumbling throughout the streets of Orangevale, sharks and the Jets.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Except instead of snapping their fingers and dancing around,

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 they're beating the hell out of each other.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,500
 One day my uncle comes home and he's just totally beat up.

155
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
 And he's very upset. He's crying a bit.

156
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
 My grandma thought it was so bizarre.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,500
 Not just that he was beat up, 'cause you know, that's kind of normal.

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 You live in Orangevale, but that he was upset about it.

159
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 She's like, "What happened?" And he goes, "I got jumped."

160
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 And he didn't even, there was no word for that back then.

161
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
 You would fight one-on-one.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,500
 More than one person attacking you at a time is being jumped.

163
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,000
 There wasn't a word for it back then.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
 He didn't even know how to describe it.

165
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 He goes, "I was walking on the street.

166
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 A bunch of guys came out of nowhere and they beat me up.

167
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 And I couldn't fight them all off."

168
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 And it shocked and outraged him that people could be such cowards

169
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,000
 that you could actually be attacked by multiple people at once.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,500
 He had never experienced that before.

171
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 A new phenomenon to him.

172
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
 There's always hand-to-hand, or maybe a baseball bat or a chain every once in a while,

173
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,000
 but it was combatant versus combatant.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He would have never thought of bringing his friends to jump one person.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And that enraged him.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And whether or not he was right that Dominic stole the plant

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,500
 and whether or not he was right Dominic had actually organized the jumping,

178
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 Jeff believed that Dominic was responsible for both.

179
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,000
 Now at this point, my new grandpa, Grandpa Miller, is in the picture.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,500
 And he worked for a construction company for many, many, many years.

181
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:57,000
 So Jeff gets the bright idea to go to his work site and steal dynamite.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,500
 And he thinks it would be not only kind of funny, but a perfect final move against Dominic.

183
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 He was going to throw dynamite in Dominic's front yard,

184
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,500
 make a massive explosion, a huge crater, and that should scare Dominic off

185
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
 from coming after Jeff ever again.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Because Jeff didn't want to kill him.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 He just wanted to scare him.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So one night, Jeff and his buddies are driving through Orangevale.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 They find Dominic's house.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Tssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:04,500
 And he was terrified of Jeff at this point.

192
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 He was petrified that someone would throw an explosive in his front yard

193
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,500
 by his house and cause a massive explosion.

194
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 One day, Jeff and his girlfriend are driving through Orangevale.

195
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:24,000
 There's a little jack-in-the-box on Greenback.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I don't remember exactly what the cross street is.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It's still there today, though. It's past the cemetery.

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So if you know the area, if you're driving down Greenback, headed towards sunrise,

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 there's a cemetery on the right. If you go about two more blocks up, there's a jack-in-the-box.

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It's still there today.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 My uncle and his girlfriend were driving around town.

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 They decided to go get some jack-in-the-box late at night.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

204
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

205
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

206
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

207
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

208
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

209
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

210
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 They were driving through the street, and they were driving through the street.

211
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,000
 My uncle was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

221
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

222
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

223
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

224
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

225
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

226
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

227
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

228
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

229
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

230
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

236
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

240
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

241
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

242
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

243
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

244
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

245
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

246
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

247
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

248
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

249
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 He was driving through the street, and he was driving through the street.

250
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,000
 Because if you say the word "gun" in California, you get five years minimum.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Back then, you could shoot a guy with a sawed-off shotgun, which is an illegal shotgun.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 He did not get prosecuted for it.

253
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Dominic, though, didn't have a happy ending.

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Just to let you know what type of class act this guy was,

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 you may go, "Well, you know, he did get dynamite thrown in his front yard,

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 and escalation of violence, and stuff like that."

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Which is true. Which is true.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,500
 In a vacuum, that is true.

259
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,000
 But just to let you know a little bit how Dominic is,

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 he later did get arrested and go to prison.

261
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,500
 Because he lived in an apartment complex, and then he went to the apartment complex below him,

262
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,000
 raped a woman, and then left her his name and number and says,

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 "If you ever want this again, give me a call."

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,500
 She made a call, alright, to the police.

265
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 He ended up doing seven to ten years in prison.

266
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,000
 This is where I really entered this story.

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Growing up, I spent a lot of time with my grandma and my great-grandma.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And after my parents got a divorce and my mom remarried,

269
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I stayed in Sacramento while everyone else moved away.

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 So I lived with my grandma from about age 17 to like 24.

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And that's where a lot of my ghost stories take places,

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 at my grandma's house, where I've talked about the shadow people invasion and stuff like that.

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I loved being around my grandma and my great-grandma, my extended family.

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,500
 I'd hang out with my cousins and my...

275
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 They were all cousins, but they were very in ages,

276
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 because all of my cousins were having kids,

277
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,000
 so I was like, my grandma was babysitting them,

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,500
 so we'd just hang out and watch, like, I don't know what was on back then.

279
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,000
 Ben Force, what's that? Ben, alien dude?

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
 Ben 10, Ben 10. I guess that was later.

281
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
 But anyways, I'm getting off the court.

282
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 The point is, is that I lived in my grandma's house for quite a while after my parents separated.

283
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 My grandma had to put Uncle Jeff in a home,

284
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
 because he was six foot three, he was super muscular.

285
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,000
 Now, obviously his muscles had started to wither at this point,

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,500
 but he was still a large guy, a still very like lean, giant guy.

287
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,000
 And my grandma could not take care of him, just physically couldn't take care of him,

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 so she put him in a home.

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 But every single holiday,

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 she drove the two hours, three hours to go pick him up from the home, bring him back for the weekend.

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Mother's Day, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Arbor Day, Flag Day.

292
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I mean, he was there all the time.

293
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Sometimes she would just call him up and say, "Hey, you want to come out for the weekend?"

294
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Now, it's funny that I say that, I was just about to imitate his voice.

295
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Because he only had a limited vocabulary, he would repeat the same words over and over again,

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,500
 but you could actually totally understand what he was talking about.

297
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,000
 It's funny because you don't need many words to talk about.

298
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
 And he would go.

299
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 He'd always say, "Man."

300
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 So, grandma would be like, "You want to come home this weekend?"

301
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 "Yeah, man, yeah. Go. Fun, man. Fun."

302
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
 And that was all he needed to say.

303
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,000
 It's almost like, I don't want to say like a Frankenstein monster,

304
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,500
 I almost feel like that's kind of making fun of him, but that's just his speech pattern.

305
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,000
 And he would come out and all we would do is watch movies.

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Because it's something that you can sit and watch.

307
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And we'd be watching a movie, we'd be watching an action movie, and a song would come on,

308
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 like an AC/DC song, and he'd go like, "AC/DC, Psalm, twice, man.

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Twice, Psalm. Loud, loud, man."

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And that's all you need to know.

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 He wouldn't say, "AC/DC, live, twice."

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 They're really loud.

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 He loved heavy metal music, he loved action movies.

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 We watched all sorts of movies, though.

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,500
 We were watching War of the Worlds once, and I looked over at the beginning when the tripod was evaporating everyone.

316
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
 I looked over at him and his eyes were super wide, and I go, "This is kind of scary."

317
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 He's like, "Yeah, man. Scary."

318
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 But anyways, those are funny memories, but then we would always watch the credits.

319
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 And see, this is how he was still cognitive.

320
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 We would watch the credits of the movies, right?

321
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 And it's just lists of names.

322
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 To you and me, meaningless stuff.

323
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 I mean, not meaningless.

324
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
 Maybe you see who was in the movie, but he would watch the credits and he'd go,

325
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,000
 "Doug, man. Doug. Dead. Dead, man. Dead."

326
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,500
 Because one of his stepbrothers, Doug, had died before he had.

327
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 And he would look at this list of names, and it would remind him of all these people he knew.

328
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
 All of these people he knew would pop up.

329
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 But every so often, his father's name would pop up.

330
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,500
 And he'd go, "Dad. Dad. Hate him. Hate him, man. Hate him. Dead."

331
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 It would be uncomfortable because just this simple name would pop up all these memories of his father.

332
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 I don't remember.

333
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
 And the reason why I haven't said the father's name is I can't remember it.

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,500
 But he obviously remembered his father's name, and he would just watch the credits and go,

335
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 "Dead, man. Dead."

336
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,000
 A lot of great memories hanging out with him. Really, really loved him.

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The ending, though, is tragic.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He ended up getting cancer, and it was fast-acting cancer.

339
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Within six months of being diagnosed for it, he died.

340
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Passed away.

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And it was sad. Sad, obviously.

342
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,500
 My grandma said, "I've already lost him once, and really don't want to lose him again."

343
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,000
 But I feel like he will be at peace.

344
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I'm not a crier. I'm not someone who cries often.

345
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And when I do, the rare times I do, it's not in public.

346
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I very, very, very rarely cry around people.

347
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 People have known me for 10, 15 years, never seen me cry.

348
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I'll get choked up, maybe a little teary-eyed sometimes, but actually crying was super rare.

349
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I remember after my uncle had passed, they had sent home his belongings from the home he was in.

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,500
 Now, I think you guys know me over the course of 273 episodes.

351
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,000
 People who know me in real life know this is about me as well.

352
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I'm not a materialistic person.

353
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 What people own doesn't matter to me.

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 You own a time machine? Yeah, sure. That's cool.

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 But I'm not a ownership.

356
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I don't believe like whoever has the most toys wins, or even you need toys.

357
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Like, I just believe that people can be themselves without having to own all this stuff.

358
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And it might even be more beneficial to not own a lot of things.

359
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Experiences, Trump owning things. Things like that.

360
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And I remember walking through the kitchen and on this little shelf,

361
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 this little old timey like 1800s sewing machine that my grandma put a tablecloth over

362
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 and used as like a little decorative thing.

363
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 There was a little Ziploc baggie that contained like a gold watch and, I don't know, a paradise key.

364
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And I lost it. I lost it.

365
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I got so upset seeing that.

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And I just started like wailing. It was just like I couldn't comprehend it.

367
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And my grandma comes out of the bedroom and she goes, "What's going on?"

368
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And I said, "This is all he owned. This is all he owned."

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 His entire life, he died when he was about 42, around my age, where I'm at right now.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So this is all he owned ever.

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Everything he owned could fit in a Ziploc bag.

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Now, the reason why I'm telling that story to you guys is because I know I have an audience of a lot of young people.

373
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And I want this story to be a cautionary tale to you.

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 The escalation of violence. And I'm going to keep the sermon short and we'll get on to the ghost pirate story.

375
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 But I just want to say this. The escalation of violence is not romantic.

376
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Okay? If you guys are having trouble with somebody out there, please don't do anything stupid.

377
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Please don't. Because it never ends well.

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 If you succeed, you're most likely going to go to prison.

379
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 If you fail, you most likely may die.

380
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Or, and a lot of people go, "Hey man, that's okay. Like, just how it is living on the streets. Like, sometimes you die."

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Or you end up like my uncle Jeff.

382
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 He was surrounded by people who loved him and I have a lot of happy memories with him.

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 But the reality is he was trapped inside a broken body.

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 It may be romantic to go out there and fight to the death and lose and then people remember you and they wear your face on the shirt and stuff like that.

385
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 But the reality is there is a high likelihood that if you lose the fight, you can be horribly damaged.

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 So be careful out there, guys. And just don't do stupid things.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 The news is full of people doing stupid things. Just think.

388
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Because at any point, my uncle could have not thrown that piece of dynamite.

389
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 You know, obviously I blame Dominic for the shooting, but my uncle was a better man than he was.

390
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And at any point, he could have just let the feud end and lived a normal life.

391
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 So I'm putting that on you guys.

392
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I don't know why I've been compelled to record this episode today, but if this episode speaks to you, then it speaks to you, okay?

393
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Okay. Let's go ahead and move on to a funny story here.

394
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 This episode may run a little long. We're just going to go with it, okay?

395
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 This is a special episode. A special Friday episode.

396
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Which I don't like doing long episodes because I know people have a certain amount of time, but let's get through this one.

397
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 This one's a funny story and this one was a story recommended by Merrick via Facebook.

398
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Merrick's been sending us a lot of good stuff.

399
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So let's go ahead and leave behind those sad memories.

400
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 We are hopping on the Carpenter Copter and we are going to Northern Ireland.

401
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I just said that wrong, but I said that right. Just pronounce it weird.

402
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 We're going to Northern Ireland. We're going to Belfast.

403
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 We're going to go watch a YouTube concert on the roof.

404
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And then we are going to meet Amanda Larch.

405
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Amanda Larch. That is not a name that Bart Simpson calls up.

406
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Moe. That is a real person's name.

407
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And this story starts off kind of tragically.

408
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Well, it's very tragically. So that sucks because I'm trying to get something funny.

409
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But Amanda Larch, mother of three, married, ends up losing her three month old baby to sudden unexplained death syndrome.

410
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 It was a big crib death, basically.

411
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 It breaks her heart. It breaks her heart.

412
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 She ends up leaving her husband and she moves to Belfast.

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So at this point she was somewhere else, but now she's in Belfast.

414
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And you're like, Jason, come on. This story is depressing too. No, no, no.

415
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Now we're getting into the good stuff. I just had to set that up.

416
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 As tragic as that is, the rest of the story is ridiculous.

417
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 So anyway, she's in Belfast and it's your 2009.

418
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And someone goes, hey, have you seen this new movie? It's really cool.

419
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It's about this pirate running around a Disney attraction.

420
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And she's like, what? She sits down over the very first time she watches Pirates of the Caribbean.

421
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 The first one, the only good one.

422
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And she immediately discovers this connection to Captain Jack Sparrow.

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 She loves Captain Jack Sparrow. She's endeared by Captain Jack Sparrow.

424
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 You're like, hey, Jason, I like Captain Jack Sparrow too.

425
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Do you have his tattoos? Do you have gold teeth put in your mouth the way Captain Jack does?

426
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 See, you thought you were a fanboy, but she's a fanboy.

427
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 She ends up becoming the first female Captain Jack impersonator in Ireland,

428
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 which I mean, that'd be like just being the first Captain Jack Sparrow impersonator on any continent.

429
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 How many are there out there? I know there's a bunch in Hollywood.

430
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 But anyways, then things get weird.

431
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 So this woman has completely changed her life to what she calls quote unquote, the pirate lifestyle.

432
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 This is her definition of the pirate lifestyle.

433
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 It is a lifestyle of freedom, doing what you want to do when you want to do it,

434
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 being independent and not relying on others for your happiness,

435
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 experiencing different lifestyles.

436
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I'm going to quit reading the quote.

437
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 She's basically explaining a hobo on the water.

438
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Like she's basically explaining a homeless person who has a boat.

439
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 It's the exact same thing.

440
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 But anyways, she becomes a pirate.

441
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 She starts living the pirate lifestyle.

442
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 She dresses like Captain Jack, matching tattoos, all that stuff.

443
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Walks around in Captain Jack gear all the time.

444
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 But then things get spooky because one night she's laying in bed.

445
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Something crawls next to her.

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 She's like, wakes up. She's like, nothing's there.

447
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Go back to bed. Something's still rustling.

448
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I don't know if it's that dramatic.

449
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 But anyways, what she said was,

450
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 in the middle of the night in her bedroom appeared the ghost of a 300 year old pirate.

451
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Name, John Robert Teague.

452
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And she's like, oh my God.

453
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And she says that they talked for months and months and months.

454
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 This ghost kept coming to her.

455
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Now, she starts to think that John Robert Teague was the inspiration for Captain Jack Sparrow.

456
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 John Robert Teague is a real pirate who was executed for being a pirate back in the day.

457
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But she believes that he's the inspiration for Captain Jack Sparrow.

458
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 So basically now she's imagining a real guy as a ghost based on a fictional character.

459
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 So she's basically just imagining a fictional character.

460
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 People have said, no, no, no, no.

461
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Jack Sparrow is not based on that pirate.

462
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 But they do share the last name, not Sparrow,

463
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 but like Captain Jack Sparrow's last dad's last name is Teague or whatever weirdness.

464
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Anyway, she becomes convinced that this fictional character that she is, that she loves,

465
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 is basically this ghost that she's talking to.

466
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 How convenient, too.

467
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Like no one, the ghost of Megatron didn't show up in her bedroom.

468
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 It was the ghost of someone she wanted to see a ghost of.

469
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So that's, again, a little convenient.

470
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 She ends up, after about six months talking to this dude,

471
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 she ends up realizing, oh my God, I'm in love with the ghost.

472
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And you remember that was a famous T-Pain song, but this was real.

473
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 This was real.

474
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 She actually falls in love with the ghost.

475
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 However, she did make this statement.

476
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 "I told him I wasn't really cool with having casual sex with a spirit,

477
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 and I wanted us to make a proper commitment to each other."

478
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Uhhhhhhh.

479
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I- there- okay, listen, guys.

480
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Girls, you can shut the podcast off for a second.

481
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Hey guys, come on.

482
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Girls always say this, and it always sucks,

483
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 but I would expect if I was a ghost, I'd get a little more action.

484
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 You can't turn me down. I came from the other side.

485
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I penetrated the veil.

486
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Like, why is this dude getting blocked?

487
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 He's a ghost.

488
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 It's been 300 years since he got laid, and you want to take things slow?

489
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 It's been three centuries.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Okay girls, you can turn the podcast back on.

491
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 So, everything I said was very respectful towards women, too.

492
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 But don't rewind it, don't rewind it.

493
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So anyways, he ends up saying, listen dude,

494
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 if I got to get married to get laid, let's get married.

495
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And she's like, oh my god, you really love me?

496
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And he's like, yeah, uh, love you.

497
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 That's the thing, also girls, turn the podcast back off.

498
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 When girls make an ultimatum like that,

499
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 generally a guy will be like, okay, let's settle down.

500
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Because if my choice is no sex or pretending I'm in a relationship with you,

501
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I'm gonna choose pretending to be in a relationship with you to get the sex.

502
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Okay girls, turn the podcast back on.

503
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Oh, but anyways, so they do get married.

504
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 They get married in international waters.

505
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I thought this was so funny.

506
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 They go out into international waters and she gets a medium.

507
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 So basically there's a guy there going,

508
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 "Uhhh"

509
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 She's kind of like bobbing his head around,

510
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 looking at a crystal ball throwing tea leaves.

511
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 The minister's like, do you Amanda Large?

512
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And he double checks the name.

513
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 He's like, oh, I guess that is his real name.

514
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Do you Amanda Large take points to nothing?

515
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And the medium's like, "Uhhh"

516
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And the medium said, I do.

517
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Oh, spirits are flying out of his mouth.

518
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Snopes ran an article on this.

519
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Snopes is just ridiculous.

520
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Anyways, but Snopes ran an article on this and they said,

521
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 "Did a woman legally get married to a ghost pirate in the year 2016?"

522
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 or whatever like that.

523
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And they said, "FALSE!"

524
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 No, they didn't.

525
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And they wrote up a 2000 word essay and they said,

526
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "You can't legally get married to a ghost."

527
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 So no, it's not true.

528
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And I'm thinking, it's not true because one, nobody knows if ghosts exist.

529
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And two, nobody knows if this particular ghost exists.

530
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 This particular ghost is a fictional character turned into a ghost in the mind of a woman.

531
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So that's why it's false.

532
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 It's not false because the law doesn't recognize a ghost marriage.

533
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 It's false because nobody knows if ghosts exist.

534
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Super bizarre.

535
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I was waiting for them to put that somewhere in there,

536
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 but they're like, "No, if we look at legal precedent."

537
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 I was like, "I don't care about legal precedent."

538
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 This is a woman saying that Jack Sparrow is floating around her bedroom.

539
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Anyways, they get married and for two years everything's fine.

540
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Everything's happy.

541
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 But, ladies and gentlemen, if you can believe it, they've actually gotten a divorce.

542
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Amanda Large and her ghost husband have gotten a divorce.

543
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 But not because of your reconcilable differences,

544
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 not because he doesn't hold her enough,

545
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 because he's a ghost, arms go through her.

546
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 It's because, this is creepy,

547
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 it's because she said that her health began declining once they got married.

548
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 She said that over the years she began to get sicker and sicker.

549
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 She felt like her life was being drained from her

550
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and she said it was almost like he was stealing my life force

551
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 for his own selfish intentions, i.e. every marriage ever.

552
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 But she thought it was more physical.

553
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 While usually your spouse just emotionally drains you,

554
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 this ghost was actually physically draining out her health.

555
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 So she left him.

556
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 She's decided to get a divorce.

557
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 She decided to get a made-up divorce for her made-up marriage to this made-up ghost

558
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 and she said, this is smart, this is smart of her,

559
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 she said I think that I don't just need a divorce,

560
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I think I need an exorcism,

561
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 because then you can get a ghost fully out of your life.

562
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 When real relationships go bad,

563
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 you can just stop answering the phone or move away if things are particularly bad.

564
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Get a restraining order, that's probably in the middle of those two.

565
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Stop answering your phone first, then get a restraining order

566
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 and if things still don't work, you know, move away.

567
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 But how would you do that?

568
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 If a relationship goes bad with a ghost, they are immortal.

569
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 They can follow you anywhere,

570
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 they can watch you when you're not looking at them.

571
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I guess that's everybody, everyone can watch you when you're not looking at them.

572
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 They can be invisible and watch you.

573
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Every time you're watching a good show, you can turn it off.

574
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 You meet a new man, ghost could be waiting.

575
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Oh dude, what if the ghost possessed the new dude and pretended it was him

576
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 and he's like, how do you feel about casual sex before the first 200 years?

577
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And she's like, no, it's John again, has to perform an exorcism.

578
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 A relationship going bad in the physical world sucks

579
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 and can have terrible consequences,

580
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 but a relationship going bad in the spiritual world can be the worst.

581
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Because here's the thing,

582
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 even if she performs the exorcism and John leaves and can't come back,

583
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 he's banished from being part of her life.

584
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 And she goes on with her life, everything's fine.

585
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Eventually though, she will die.

586
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And when she goes to the other side,

587
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 that horrible spirit that tried to devour her soul while she was here,

588
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 now she's on his turf, now she's playing by his rules.

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 She may soon learn that the saying, till death do us part,

590
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 is meaningless if your partner's already dead

591
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 and have years and years to prepare for you to join him forever.

592
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And ever.

593
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And ever.
