1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 Some people believe that marijuana actually slows down your perception of time.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,640
 But does it do something even more drastic every time you toke?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:19,360
 And then we take a look at the man known as Tesla, world famous inventor who died in abject

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
 poverty.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,320
 Pretty famous dude, there's a car named after him.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,360
 But did you know that this guy also is from Venus?

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:40,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,880
 I hope you guys have a lot of fun things to do today.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
 Not tomorrow, just today.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,480
 I hope you cram in all the fun stuff and then you take a nap tomorrow.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,400
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Matt Sprinkle.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,400
 Everyone give a round of applause to Matt Sprinkle doing cartwheels while he enters the

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,760
 room doing little bow, doing little bow.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
 It's a little ostentatious.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,360
 Matt, that's okay.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
 You deserve it.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
 You're a Patreon supporter.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,400
 Matt, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,120
 If you can't support the Patreon guys, that's fine too.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,880
 Just help spread the word about the show.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,400
 Really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,200
 So Matt, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jet, give you a little pair of

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,720
 aviator glasses I throw them and you catch them all cool and put them on.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,320
 The top of the Jason Jet, fly us out of here, Matt.

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,480
 We are going to a secret government facility.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,840
 Somewhere in the middle of America.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
 We get there.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,080
 We're wearing our lab coats, walking around and we notice that all the other scientists

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,640
 are just kind of like sitting there.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,040
 They're just all kind of sitting there.

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,560
 All the scientists are just kind of chilling out.

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
 We notice that like the laboratories, some of their equipment's been cleared out and

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
 there's like beanbag chairs everywhere.

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,920
 Like this is a guy, he's looking at a lava lamp through a microscope.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 He's like groovy dude.

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,760
 We hear someone coughing in the distance of the laboratory.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,760
 We round the corner and we see a couple of scientists with a big fat joint in their hands

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,880
 and they hold it to us like a 3D movie.

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,040
 They're holding it right at the camera.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
 They're like, "Want a toke, bro?"

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,680
 A little cliffhanger, a freeze frame, a little cliffhanger.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,360
 We know that marijuana use, one of the side effects of it is that it slows down time.

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,920
 What it does is it speeds up the user's measurement of time.

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,800
 It doesn't actually slow time down.

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
 Don't go play baseball.

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,600
 It'll be like, "Oh, I can totally catch this ball now."

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,280
 Time goes quote unquote normal.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,800
 It's fairly relative, but time will move at a normal pitch for everyone around you.

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,080
 But for someone who's high, everything seems to go by much, much slower.

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
 And this is something that scientists have actually tested.

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,160
 I'm sure the scientists are like, "I'll be in the group.

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,200
 I'll volunteer my body for science."

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,120
 You get stoned and then you have to gauge how long you've been in that room.

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,600
 They've even done it to rats.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,520
 They've gotten rats high, which would be an amazing job as a scientist.

59
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,720
 You can go into school for six years and you're just blowing smoke, your hot boxing mice.

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,680
 You're like, "Dude, they get the rats high."

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,000
 And they said, they had this thing set up where the rats, let's say three minutes,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,240
 it was a timed interval.

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,480
 Every three minutes, the rat could walk up, hit a button, and food would roll out.

64
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,160
 And the rat was trained that they could hit the button as much as they wanted, but it

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,480
 only come out after, say, three minutes.

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
 So the rats started to learn, "Oh, I'm hungry.

67
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,800
 I wish you have to eat your food every three minutes.

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,400
 There's supposed to be the fattest rats in the world."

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,040
 They're like, "No more experimentation."

70
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,880
 But anyway, so these rats were trained that food would only come out every three minutes,

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,920
 so they only started hitting it once every three minutes, so the food would come out,

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,440
 because otherwise it was useless.

73
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,480
 When they got the rats stoned, though, they kept hitting the button again, like hitting

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,920
 it, thinking that three minutes had passed.

75
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,480
 It wasn't like they were like, "Come on, give me food.

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,200
 I'm sure they have the munchies, too."

77
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,040
 But they would hit the button and wait for the food to come out, and it would dawn on

78
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,000
 them, "Oh, dude, maybe it hasn't been three minutes yet."

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,480
 So he'd walk away, and then he'd come back.

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,800
 He's like, "Oh, man, I'm so hungry.

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
 It's been three minutes.

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
 Ding."

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 Nothing.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
 He's like, "Oh, man, no.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Next time it'll..."

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,960
 And basically, it slows down time perception and mice.

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,040
 So marijuana does affect your ability to perceive time.

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,540
 So my theory is this.

89
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,480
 That's kind of a long preamble, but my theory is this.

90
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 I'll wrap this up.

91
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
 I have a theory.

92
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,080
 So weed messes with time perception.

93
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 What is time but perception?

94
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,080
 Now sure, you can buy a pumpkin and watch it rot.

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
 Isn't that a passage of time?

96
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,840
 Yeah, but you can take a big enough object and actually warp time.

97
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,760
 Time isn't this constant thing.

98
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,880
 It's actually pretty gooey, really.

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,120
 So here we go, guys.

100
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,960
 If you've smoked weed, you'll know that the earliest times of smoking weed are super,

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
 super strong.

102
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
 And then as time goes on, you actually seem to get less stone.

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,760
 Now there's a couple caveats there, but hear me out.

104
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,320
 For the most part, you start smoking, the weed kicks a lot harder, assuming you're smoking

105
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
 anything decent and not bammer that you bought from your cousin.

106
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
 Good stuff.

107
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,120
 You get totally blazed, but as time goes on, the weed doesn't kick like it used to.

108
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,920
 Eventually, you taper out because the return of investment isn't worth it.

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,560
 You're like, "I'd rather drink a beer or rather ride a bike or go running or something

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
 like that."

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,200
 Or do nothing just sit there too lazy to smoke weed?

112
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,760
 My theory is this.

113
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:23,440
 The first time you get high, time distorts so much that you are smoking with every future

114
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,040
 you that's smoking.

115
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:35,080
 So you take that hit and 10,000 other yous hitting that joint, ripping that bong, eating

116
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
 that edible.

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,040
 However else you do it, there's only three ways I know.

118
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,360
 I'm sure now you can inject it or something like that.

119
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
 Topicals.

120
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
 The first time you get high.

121
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,600
 It's every future you getting high.

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,640
 But as time goes on, there's less future versions of you to get high with.

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,840
 So eventually you're like, "Yeah, it just doesn't kick like it used to.

124
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,560
 Just doesn't kick."

125
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,600
 Because the future you has already stopped smoking.

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,040
 So by the time you're in your late 20s, in the future you stopped smoking at age 32.

127
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,800
 It just doesn't hit that special button inside of you.

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,840
 I don't know any other analogies.

129
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
 It's like, "Boo!"

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
 Hits a little button.

131
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,200
 But you go, "Jason, that's just because of tolerance buildup."

132
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,640
 You can actually take a break from weed for a year or several years.

133
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,120
 I used to smoke a lot when I was in my early 20s.

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,280
 Took a break, smoked again in my early 30s.

135
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,720
 Haven't smoked in years.

136
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,560
 But even then after that tolerance, I didn't take a tolerance break.

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,720
 I just didn't want to smoke anymore.

138
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,200
 When I started smoking again, it wasn't as strong as it was when I was younger.

139
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,240
 It was still good, but it wasn't as strong.

140
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,880
 You go, "Jason, I've smoked weed for 40 years and it's never gotten less."

141
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,640
 Like sure I've had to up it a little bit or I've taken a break here and there to kind

142
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,080
 of reduce my tolerance, but I've been smoking for 40 years straight.

143
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,840
 I'm only 43 years old, Jason.

144
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,640
 That's because the future yous keep smoking.

145
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
 You are a lifelong pothead.

146
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,080
 No, no, it's all intended there.

147
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,520
 But you're just one of those people who are going to smoke like Willie Nelson until the

148
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,600
 day you die.

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,720
 So you don't have future yous running out.

150
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,560
 The weed high stays.

151
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,040
 You go, "Jason, I actually, that doesn't make sense at all because I smoked, I don't

152
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
 know, three or four times in college.

153
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
 I absolutely hated it.

154
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,520
 It wasn't because the future yous stopped smoking after four or five times."

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,920
 Marijuana may distort time so much it breaks it.

156
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,960
 But really the only difference between you now and future you is little clicks of an

157
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,640
 atomic clock.

158
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,920
 But if future you was standing on the edge of a black hole, first of all, I'm sorry that

159
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
 that happened to you.

160
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,840
 Whatever chain of events got you to stand on the edge of a black hole, time is not the

161
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,160
 same anymore.

162
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,160
 Even on a planet that's bigger, that distorts the time space continuum, the time space plane,

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,640
 things are going to be different.

164
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,080
 So time is super malleable and your brain can already do so much amazing things.

165
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
 Who's not to say?

166
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,600
 And you're like, "Jason, there's a lot of people who would say that smoking weed doesn't

167
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
 let you reach across time."

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 But I don't know.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,360
 I don't know.

170
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
 Think about it.

171
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,280
 Think about it the next time you're getting stoned if you still smoke weed.

172
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,120
 I think that it made distort time so much it's not just a matter of you going, "Dude,

173
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,560
 we've been playing Super Smash Bros. for like hours, but I just looked at my watch.

174
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,120
 First off, I have a watch for some weird reason and then that one of four started smoking

175
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
 tonight.

176
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,640
 I just looked at my watch and we've only been playing for five minutes.

177
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,880
 That's pretty normal with smoking weed.

178
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,360
 But then you turn to your buddy and you look and that buddy is you 30 years from now.

179
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,880
 A joint hanging out of their mouth, a gleam in their eye, going, "Get wrecked, noob."

180
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,720
 Apparently they're a total dork and they're using that phraseology 30 years from now.

181
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,200
 But they beat you at the game is what I'm saying.

182
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,280
 So I think that's my theory.

183
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,640
 When you smoke weed, you're smoking with future versions of you.

184
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
 Here's a question actually.

185
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,840
 When you get super stoned next time you do, you might be super stoned right now.

186
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,840
 You think to yourself, "Future me, what are you doing?

187
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,200
 What are you doing right now?"

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
 And I wonder if you can send a message in the future.

189
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,440
 Actually that's just opening yourself up to a bunch of goats showing up.

190
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,600
 Don't do that.

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,720
 But Matt, let's go ahead and leave behind this laboratory of a bunch of stoners.

192
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,640
 All in that carbonar copter we are headed out to New York City.

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
 We were just here yesterday.

194
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,440
 We have to make a return to the Big Apple.

195
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,800
 Land that carbonar copter in the middle of Times Square.

196
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,200
 As we're landing we all yell at the same time, "Hey, we're landing here!"

197
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
 And we laughed ourselves.

198
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
 The streets are empty actually.

199
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
 I think they're in another lockdown right now.

200
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,000
 We can land the helicopter wherever while Matt is hot wiring a parked car so we can

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
 drive us around New York City.

202
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,080
 I turn to you guys and I say, "This is a really interesting story."

203
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
 A quick overview though.

204
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 Quick overview.

205
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
 Nikolai Tesla was a contemporary of Thomas Edison, a genius inventor.

206
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,760
 A lot of people felt he was ahead of his time, way ahead of his time.

207
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,280
 He invented a remote control boat in like 1920 or 1930 or something like that.

208
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,760
 Some of the other people, they would seem magical.

209
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,000
 I don't know if I didn't think they had radios back then.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,520
 People are trying to listen to like Howdy Doody and it's like they just hear boat engines

211
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,040
 coming over their radio.

212
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,400
 But he had all this crazy stuff.

213
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,840
 We'll get into more of it later because it'll play a part in the story.

214
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,440
 But he's now become a cult figure.

215
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,880
 There was a long period of time where Nikolai Tesla was truly a fringe scientist.

216
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
 He died destitute.

217
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
 Thomas Edison hated his guts.

218
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,440
 Was constantly sabotaging him.

219
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
 He died.

220
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,800
 He was basically getting a $500 monthly allowance from Czechoslovakia, which $500 back then,

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
 that's not money to sneeze at.

222
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
 That's pretty good money.

223
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,600
 He died poor anyways because he had a bunch of, you know how much it cost to buy bolts

224
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,480
 for rings and monsters neck?

225
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,520
 By those mad scientist wigs cost a lot of money.

226
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,440
 Tesla for a long time was considered like fringe.

227
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,440
 He wasn't somebody a lot of people knew about.

228
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,960
 Basically you had to be Uber nerd or a paranormal nerd to know about Nikolai Tesla.

229
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
 Now he's very famous.

230
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,440
 There's movies and cartoons and comic books made about him.

231
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,280
 There's a car made about him.

232
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,400
 Now when someone has a shirt that says I love Tesla, you know that shirt doesn't mean there

233
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,000
 a fan of the car company.

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Maybe they are.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,720
 But it's most likely a reference to this Uber nerd geek scientist stuff like that.

236
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,480
 So he has kind of, I guess now I'm feeling, now I'm kind of being a hipster.

237
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,000
 I'm like I knew him before he was cool.

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Obviously I've been researching this stuff for decades.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,080
 I was aware of Nikolai Tesla stuff.

240
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,960
 That's why I'm brushing over a bunch of it.

241
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,280
 I imagine you guys have a passing knowledge of Tesla at this point, either through pop

242
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,280
 culture or actually doing research on him.

243
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
 But did you know?

244
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,960
 Fair traveler.

245
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,400
 Matt finally has the taxi cab hot wired.

246
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,640
 He's giving us a ride around.

247
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,600
 Did you know that Nikolai Tesla, well I'm going to let the headline speak for itself.

248
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,880
 This is the headline from howunwise.com.

249
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
 FBI vault.

250
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
 Nikola Tesla.

251
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:17,960
 Nikola, Nikola, I think it's actually, I don't know why they added that last part.

252
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,080
 I don't think they did like a Hail Mary pass and through an earth.

253
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
 FBI vault.

254
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,600
 Nikola Tesla was brought to earth by Vesuvians, by Venetians, by people from Venus.

255
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,320
 Okay the point is is that the FBI vault had a document saying that Tesla, this episode

256
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,840
 is going off the rails.

257
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,160
 Tesla was brought to earth from Venus.

258
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,800
 Now I got to say this too again really briefly because we have a ton of stuff to cover.

259
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
 The FBI vault.

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,080
 We see this happen all the time.

261
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,360
 The FBI vault, someone will find a document and they'll say FBI says, or FBI has a document

262
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,600
 claiming that Mars used to have a bunch of people on it.

263
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,920
 That the Adam and Eve story took place on Mars.

264
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,840
 There was remote viewing on Mars.

265
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 Da da da da.

266
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,400
 The FBI is not saying that.

267
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,280
 FBI has documents from the Monroe Foundation which we've covered before.

268
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,400
 That say that.

269
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,800
 The FBI has never gone on the record whether or not there are secret bases on Mars from

270
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,560
 300,000 years ago.

271
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:22,880
 The FBI vault just gobbles up and any information they think may be important that day or 100

272
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
 years from now.

273
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,200
 They simply gobbled all this stuff up and at a certain point they do a Freedom of Information

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,280
 Act and so they dumped a bunch of documents that FBI had on Tesla.

275
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,880
 So they're not actually saying that.

276
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,120
 That would be the equivalent of someone coming over to your house seeing a Spider-Man comic

277
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,760
 book and assuming you are Spider-Man.

278
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,000
 Or at least you know him because you have documents pertaining to the existence of Spider-Man.

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
 It's the same thing.

280
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,640
 This claim that Tesla came from outer space actually came from a document that's in the

281
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
 FBI vault.

282
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,240
 It's from the Interplanetary Sessions Newsletter dated June 14th, 1957.

283
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,280
 So way after Tesla has passed away they have this document.

284
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,520
 Margaret Storm is writing a book about Tesla called Return of the Dove.

285
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,360
 Now when she was writing this book she got access to what's known as a Tesla set.

286
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,880
 It's one of the many inventions he was working on.

287
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,240
 The Tesla set was something that he had diagrams for but he was never able to invent himself.

288
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,880
 He drew it out in 1938.

289
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,480
 He died in 1943.

290
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,440
 It wasn't until after his death that they actually were able to build this.

291
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,360
 And using the Tesla set they got this message from Space Aliens.

292
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,400
 Also known as the Space People which is like the most generic name but apparently they're

293
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,200
 good at communicating with aliens but not good at naming them.

294
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 This is the story.

295
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,960
 Tesla was born on Venus and then he was brought to Earth and given to Mr. and Mrs. Tesla to

296
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
 race him.

297
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,960
 That's why all of his inventions are so weird because he's actually not from this planet.

298
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
 So we have that.

299
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
 We have this interesting story.

300
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
 Tesla is from outer space.

301
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,360
 That's why he was so ahead of his time.

302
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 Fine.

303
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
 Whatever.

304
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
 But you have to take this document in context.

305
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,920
 This document also says.

306
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,400
 We don't know if Margaret Storm will be able to finish her book by June 30th.

307
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,360
 This newsletter was coming out June 14th, 1957.

308
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,680
 Why is it so important for her to have her book finished by June 30th?

309
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,920
 July 1st, 1957.

310
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,680
 Do you guys remember reading about this in the history books?

311
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
 From 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.

312
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,640
 Massive UFO fleets hovered over every major city in the United States.

313
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,520
 Do you remember that?

314
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,840
 You remember that?

315
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,320
 Because that's what this newsletter is actually predicting.

316
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,280
 On June 14th, the author is saying, "Listen guys, I hope she has this book done by June

317
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,200
 30th because by July 1st, we'll all know the truth.

318
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
 There'll be UFOs everywhere."

319
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,200
 And he makes these predictions that at 9 a.m. first they're over like Washington, D.C.

320
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,960
 and then like at 3 p.m. they're over a couple other cities and I don't know where they're

321
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
 taking their time.

322
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 They're an alien fleet.

323
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
 Time war is different.

324
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 For them, they're super stoned.

325
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,680
 But he does give this caveat.

326
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,880
 Obviously, that didn't happen.

327
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,520
 He gives this caveat like everybody make the predictions.

328
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,440
 He goes, "The alien fleets are coming down.

329
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,760
 They're tired of us having nuclear weapons, polluting the environment, all that stupid

330
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
 nonsense."

331
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,480
 And then he goes, "But, but, if you don't see any UFOs, that's because the government

332
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
 chased them away.

333
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
 Chased them away."

334
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,680
 So, I mean, that's a, I mean, here's the thing.

335
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,000
 You could go, "Jason, maybe there were UFOs and the government chased them away."

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,280
 I don't remember reading in history books either about every fighter jet in the United

337
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,200
 States being launched on July 1st chasing them away.

338
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,440
 But anyway, so that's a good out, right?

339
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,720
 Make a prediction that's going to happen two weeks from now.

340
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,120
 Get everyone riled up, but also say, "You know, it could be wrong.

341
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,960
 It could be wrong, but not because of me, not because I'm making this up.

342
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,560
 It's because of some sort of external force."

343
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,040
 That's the article that is written on howandwise.com.

344
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
 But that's not the whole story.

345
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,960
 This is so weird.

346
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
 I don't know why.

347
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,800
 I know why howandwise.com, and I know why a lot of websites would focus on that particular

348
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,200
 story because it's sexy with aliens and stuff like that, and little Tesla coming down from

349
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
 Venus.

350
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:14,280
 But in that same dump of documents, the same FBI dump of documents, this is what I found.

351
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
 This is no joke.

352
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,240
 This is 100% real.

353
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,060
 Actual FBI memorandums written by special agents.

354
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,320
 We have a copy of a document made on January 9th, 1943.

355
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,920
 The document is addressed to a Mr. Foxworth, most likely Percy Foxworth, who was the chief

356
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,120
 of the FBI's Special Intelligence Service.

357
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,280
 Tesla had died on the 7th of January, so the document's only being crafted two days after

358
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,920
 Tesla died.

359
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:51,840
 So Tesla died on the 7th, and the day that he died, a Mr. A. N. Spanal contacts the FBI

360
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
 that rhymes.

361
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,740
 But this whole thing's not a Dr. Seuss thing.

362
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,780
 The agent in question was Special Agent Fred Cornels, and he's the one drafting this document,

363
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,220
 investigating this case.

364
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,020
 The day that Tesla died, Mr. Spanal called the FBI and said, "Listen, I don't know how

365
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
 much you know about Tesla.

366
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,140
 I don't know if you know how to pronounce his first name, Nikola Tesla."

367
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,620
 But he's been working on a lot of crazy stuff.

368
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,780
 And if that stuff gets into the wrong hands in 1943, when World War II is still going on,

369
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,820
 it's not going to be good.

370
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,400
 One of his distant relatives, one of Tesla's distant relatives, and someone who Tesla had

371
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:35,240
 told people that he hated was his nephew, Sava Kosanovich, from Czechoslovakia.

372
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,720
 Mr. Spanal says, "Listen, this nephew's coming here, and he's trying to get Tesla's notes.

373
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,820
 And I'll be honest, he's been in America for a couple months, but if he gets these

374
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,040
 notes, I think he's going to give them to the enemy."

375
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,840
 So you guys need to secure this location.

376
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,420
 I don't think you guys know what he's working on over there.

377
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,180
 Mr. Spanal explains, "Listen, I work for the government.

378
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,820
 Like an outsider, I work with the government.

379
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
 I work on science-y stuff.

380
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,060
 I know Tesla, and I know him through acquaintances as well.

381
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,060
 You gotta take care of this."

382
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,180
 And the special agent goes, "Yeah, okay, you know, we'll look into it."

383
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,860
 Hanks it up, special agent starts writing up the report.

384
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,820
 He doesn't really know who Tesla is.

385
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,540
 This guy's calling him, making these claims.

386
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,260
 The phone rings a couple minutes later, and agent Cornel picks it up.

387
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,460
 And it's Mr. Spanal again.

388
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,080
 And he goes, "Yeah, I remember how I told you how I worked for the government."

389
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
 And special agent's like, "Yeah."

390
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,760
 And he goes, "Yeah, I just talked to the vice president's personal assistant.

391
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,240
 You are ordered to go and secure that location right now.

392
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,600
 That's coming from the top."

393
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,720
 The FBI gets the ball rolling.

394
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,000
 The next day, January 8th, the FBI contacts, "Blois Fitzgerald."

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,280
 That's a great name, "Blois."

396
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,480
 "Blois Fitzgerald, who was Tesla's protege."

397
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,640
 They call him in for an interview, and they say, "Hey, so what's going on with this Tesla

398
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
 guy?

399
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
 We know he passed away.

400
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,220
 We're being told he has all these documents."

401
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,980
 And Boyce goes, "Oh, yeah.

402
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
 Yeah."

403
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,300
 He built a new type of torpedo.

404
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,460
 And they're like, "What?"

405
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,700
 He's like, "A brand new...

406
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,820
 This torpedo has never been seen before.

407
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
 It's this design."

408
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,060
 And the FBI just kind of ran it down.

409
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,140
 They're like, "Yeah, we don't want that falling into enemy hands."

410
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,180
 And Boyce goes, "He also has documents about wireless energy.

411
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,700
 It's a way that you can actually just transmit energy.

412
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,100
 No more plugs, no more outlets.

413
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,740
 Stuff could rove out in the middle of nowhere.

414
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,420
 You wouldn't need to recharge stuff.

415
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
 These things are constantly charging.

416
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,640
 The FBI is like, "Okay, that's kind of weird, but that would be helpful as well."

417
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,880
 And then Boyce goes, "Oh, yeah."

418
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
 And then the death ray.

419
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
 FBI is like, "What?

420
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
 Wait, what?"

421
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,920
 Boyce is like, "Yeah, he built a death ray.

422
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,200
 He basically built a beam weapon that can be put on planes, that can shoot down other

423
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,240
 planes, or it can just be put on the ground and shoot down planes.

424
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
 It can shoot down anything.

425
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
 It doesn't just shoot down planes.

426
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,400
 It's a death ray."

427
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,120
 Boyce also says, "Listen, I'll be honest with you.

428
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:49,700
 Sava got a locksmith, broke into Tesla's apartment, and got into his safe.

429
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,660
 That's one crummy locksmith, right?

430
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,380
 He's like, "I'll do whatever you want for a price."

431
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,780
 He got into the apartment, broke into the safe, and took out some of Tesla's documents.

432
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,500
 And Sava left the country."

433
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
 So Boyce goes, "Listen, I don't know what he took.

434
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,180
 Hopefully it wasn't too destructive, but you're not too late.

435
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:13,920
 You see Tesla actually has crates of just papers, of drawings and sketches and designs

436
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 and stuff like that.

437
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,360
 He kept some of them at a warehouse, other ones he'd kind of hit around town.

438
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,720
 I don't know the locations of all of them.

439
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,960
 I know where the warehouse is.

440
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,760
 That's what he was using some of the Czechoslovakian money for.

441
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,360
 But if you get a couple of those crates, that'll probably be a good start.

442
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,160
 And the FBI goes, "Okay, cool.

443
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,440
 You know how many crates there are full of documents and drawings and diagrams?"

444
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,120
 And Boyce goes, "There's 80 of them."

445
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,460
 Spread around the city like some sort of side quest on an open world video game.

446
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,380
 I don't know if they ever retrieved all 80 chests.

447
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,500
 There's possible that there's still a couple chests out there in some dusty New York basement.

448
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,420
 But they are able to secure the majority of them.

449
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,500
 So the FBI secures all the documents they can on January 8th, the day after Tesla dies.

450
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,780
 Sava took some of those documents and disappeared behind the slowly encroaching iron curtain.

451
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:09,880
 On January 9th, that memo goes out to Percy Foxworth, Chief of FBI's Special Intelligence

452
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,360
 Service.

453
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,780
 On January 15th, Percy Foxworth, Special Agent Dennis Haberfield, and 33 others are on a

454
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,080
 plane flying over North Africa.

455
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,960
 Percy Foxworth was ordered to go on a mission for General MacArthur.

456
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,420
 That plane disintegrated on January 15th, 1943.

457
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,960
 It has never been determined what the cause of that accident was.

458
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,460
 Here's a quote regarding this accident, "Although 35 people were onboard the aircraft, search

459
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,820
 teams were only able to locate sufficient remains to be placed in a single casket."

460
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,840
 Percy Foxworth was made aware of this situation on the 9th, and six days later, his plane

461
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,860
 and everyone on it was, for lack of a better word, disintegrated.

462
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:09,220
 And his group had just taken control of documents about building a death ray to shoot planes

463
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,700
 out of the sky.

464
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,500
 That story is honestly more interesting than the Venus one, because it's true.

465
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,740
 All of it's true.

466
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,780
 To wrap this up, let's go ahead and put our conspiracy caps on for a second.

467
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,540
 It probably is a coincidence, because the world is full of coincidences.

468
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:33,600
 A little over a week since Tesla had died, only six days after Percy Foxworth got the

469
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,720
 memorandum talking about Tesla's death ray and the race to retrieve those documents.

470
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,160
 Could just be a coincidence that six days after that his plane disintegrated in midair,

471
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,920
 which is one of the reasons why the death ray was made in the first place.

472
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,800
 Is it possible that Sava is the one who got the plans for the death ray, took them back

473
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 to Czechoslovakia?

474
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,820
 And in that short amount of time with those detailed blueprints, were able to construct

475
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,700
 a death ray and use it against the plane flying over North Africa.

476
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,940
 It may have been dumb luck that they hit that plane.

477
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,260
 Or they may have known that this chief of the FBI was personally entangled in collecting

478
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,660
 the documents that Tesla had left behind.

479
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:25,020
 They had to take him out and set the search back until they could retrieve even more of

480
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,760
 those crates around New York City.

481
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:35,860
 So dear listener, if you ever find a crate, open it up with a crowbar, it's full of documents

482
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,200
 you can tell from the handwriting that are written by a Czechoslovakian, why don't you

483
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,820
 just put that crate back where you found it and forget that it ever existed.

484
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:54,300
 It's quite likely that simply knowing these documents exist can put you in the crosshairs

485
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,460
 of a sci-fi weapon.

486
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,580
 And if they stopped investigating the possible murder of a chief of the FBI, what happens

487
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,420
 when you get evaporated?

488
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
 Or me?

489
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,100
 We just become another missing person case.

490
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,140
 And when the investigators come to try to get to the bottom of it, they don't notice

491
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,060
 that it looks like something's been moved recently.

492
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,820
 They don't notice that the crate you found you were so curious about is no longer sitting

493
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,580
 in your living room.

494
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,620
 You are gone, so are the documents.

495
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:47,940
