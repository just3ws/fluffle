1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 Two of the most bizarre, true crime tales we've covered so far.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,080
 First off, a man driving down the freeway at 10.30 in the morning dies in a car accident.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,460
 Simple tragedy, suicide attempt, the police don't know, but it is odd that both of his

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,520
 nipples have been cut off.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,600
 And then we travel to Spain to chase a truck full of sulfuric acid as it barrels down a

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,200
 winding mountain pass, eventually crashing and spilling acid all over the road.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,120
 But as cleanup crews and police investigators look at the scene, they realize that underneath

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,520
 the acid is a deeper mystery today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:01:00,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,520
 You know, I've had actually a great series of days and it's thanks to you guys.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,360
 It's actually thanks, well it's thanks to you guys in theory, but it's thanks to one

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
 of you guys in particular.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
 You know, a lot of times when I'm talking about the Patreon, I say, "Hey, if you can't

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,960
 support the Patreon, that's fine, just get the word out about the show."

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,080
 I've never supported a Patreon and I've been a rabid listener of a lot of podcasts.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,080
 I've just never really been in the position to have enough money to support them.

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,000
 So I appreciate it when people support my Patreon.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,800
 But if you can't support the Patreon, help get the word out about the show.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,200
 I pitch that all the time and I mean it very sincerely.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
 There is a Reddit thread recently about the conspiracy theory iceberg.

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,520
 There was a Redditor who goes by the name "AbsolutelyFat" and they said, "Hey, there's

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,360
 a guy who's done a couple episodes on this conspiracy theory iceberg and you should check

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 it out."

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,640
 And then someone asked for the link and he sent the link.

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,280
 So those two posts on Reddit within about 36 hours got me 500 new subscribers on YouTube

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,680
 and my podcast downloads doubled from a thousand a day to 2500 a day.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
 More than doubled.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
 Two posts.

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,160
 I blew the show up within 36 hours.

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,880
 So that's all it takes.

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
 That's so awesome.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,720
 And you know, if you don't use Reddit or you don't use computers at all, just get the

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
 word out about the show.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,760
 We got flyers you can print out from the show notes.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,840
 Talk to your friends.

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
 Talk to your family.

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
 Harass people.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
 Knock on doors.

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
 Really, really helps a lot.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,240
 Stewart and Meatball got banned from Facebook for three days for harassing people.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,920
 So again, you don't have to go to those links.

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,280
 But I really, really appreciate you guys getting the word out about the show.

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,160
 It really, really means a lot.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,480
 So absolutely fat.

47
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,200
 Today, we are going to give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy you're going to be driving

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,760
 us around this episode because this episode is interesting too because I normally don't

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,400
 go true crime heavy.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,560
 I normally only do one or two true crime stories a week, but both of these are so bizarre

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,640
 and they both are related because we're going to hit some horror on the highway.

52
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,720
 And so we're revving up the Jason Jalopy.

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,320
 Let's all hop inside.

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
 Absolutely fat.

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
 You got the keys.

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
 We are first going to San Antonio, Texas.

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,360
 The year is 2003.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,600
 It's a sunny spring morning, April 16.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,240
 Jason Jalopy does not sound like that, but I'm in a good mood.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,760
 Normally it's all, it barely works, but we got it souped up for this episode.

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,400
 By the end of the episode, maybe back to normal.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,840
 And you think if we're going to be hitting the highways, we're going to be going on

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,120
 these races, but first we have to make a stop.

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,920
 We're going to stop outside this house and we're just going to sit in an idling car.

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
 We're going to look.

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,960
 And there we see the house of Air Force Colonel Philip Michael Shoe.

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,360
 He's a 54 year old staff psychiatrist.

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,880
 He's drinking his coffee.

69
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
 Wife.

70
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
 Great coffee.

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
 Glug glug glug.

72
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
 He's sitting there, he's drinking coffee.

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,200
 And then he goes, you know what?

74
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,480
 Tracy, my wife, my beautiful wife.

75
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
 I have to go to work.

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
 And she's thinking, that's weird.

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
 It's an hour earlier than you normally leave, but she doesn't say anything.

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
 She doesn't say anything.

79
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,280
 Gives her husband a kiss.

80
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
 He leaves.

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 It's 5 30 in the morning at this point.

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,480
 He's like, we're like, you have to duck into the car as he's walking out of his car.

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
 He's like, that's weird.

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,120
 Why is it that old time he car sitting in my front yard?

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 Oh well.

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,840
 And he gets in his car, he starts driving away.

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,840
 Now we're not going to follow him because we don't know what happens for a while, but

88
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,280
 let's go into this past.

89
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,560
 So Phillip Michael Shue, Tracy's his second wife.

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,840
 He was previously married to this woman named Nancy.

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,040
 And there was an odd relationship.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,720
 She was also apparently like a psychiatrist and she specialized in people who were into

93
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,280
 S&M, which doesn't seem like something you'd go to the psychiatrist for.

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
 You're like, oh, I really enjoy rough sex.

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,000
 I got to stop this.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,520
 Like I don't know why you would go to the doctor for that.

97
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,640
 If only I could get over my crippling addiction to sweaty anal sex.

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,360
 I don't know why.

99
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 Is that a thing?

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,240
 Do people complain about that?

101
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,160
 I guess the person receiving it might.

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,880
 They're like, please make my husband stop.

103
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,320
 The point is, is that that was her specialty.

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
 And that's important.

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,600
 That may be important actually.

106
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,720
 Phillip was married to this girl Nancy before.

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
 The relationship was getting rough.

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,480
 Apparently the relationship was not physically rough.

109
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,760
 He's not coming home and getting whipped.

110
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,000
 Actually, we don't know.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
 It's an interesting thing.

112
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,240
 So she's a psychiatrist for this S&M stuff.

113
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
 He's married to her.

114
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,040
 He's a staff psychiatrist as well.

115
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,880
 He starts to have some paranoid issues.

116
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,920
 He starts to believe that people are after him.

117
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:41,680
 And a big component of that is that Nancy has a $1 million life insurance policy on Phillip.

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
 And he is like, that sounds a little dicey.

119
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,200
 It sounds a little weird, right?

120
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,760
 And he's also getting like threatening letters.

121
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 I'm going to get you.

122
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,160
 I'm going to totally like beat you up and tie you down and chain you and whip you.

123
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
 And he's like, what?

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,840
 These sound awfully familiar.

125
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,120
 But he's getting actually vague.

126
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,040
 It doesn't specifically say, read 50 shades of gray to find out what happens to you next.

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
 It wasn't specifically S&M stuff.

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
 But anyways, he ends up divorcing Nancy and saying, hey, you need to cancel that.

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,840
 I didn't know this was a thing.

130
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,600
 He goes, so we're not married anymore.

131
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,840
 You have to cancel your life insurance policy on me.

132
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,640
 And she goes, no, I'm not going to do that.

133
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,480
 So apparently I can take life insurance policies out on just random people.

134
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
 Is that a thing?

135
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,040
 Or I can like date a girl for a couple months, take out a life insurance.

136
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,960
 That would actually be a good thing.

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
 No, not a good thing.

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
 It would be a cruel thing.

139
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,640
 But what if you only dated girls who were in extreme sports took out life insurance policies

140
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
 on them?

141
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,720
 I'm not going to finish that sentence.

142
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
 But like you don't do anything.

143
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,600
 You don't like you're not put there again ready to base jump and you're like, whoopsie

144
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 and you push them off.

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,320
 I guess no, then they would have a parachute.

146
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,520
 But they'd be like, wee, thanks Jason.

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
 You know what I mean.

148
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,760
 Poke holes in their surfboard or whatever.

149
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
 That's even possible.

150
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,360
 This should be an Adam Sandler movie.

151
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,160
 He's trying to kill his extreme sports girlfriend, but she's just getting more and more extreme.

152
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,400
 She goes to a piercing parlor and he's like infecting the needles.

153
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
 He's like taking hobo blood.

154
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,880
 He's pours hobo blood all over the tattoo artist stuff and the tattoo artist doesn't

155
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
 notice.

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,720
 He's like giving his girlfriend a tattoo and then it turns out that hobo's blood actually

157
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,680
 had these awesome antibodies in it.

158
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
 She gets stronger.

159
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,920
 Adam Sandler's like foiled again.

160
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,080
 Not only do I not think that's an Adam Sandler movie, I don't think any film studio would

161
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
 ever make that.

162
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
 But if you do, James Wan, I know you listen to this show.

163
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,880
 If you do, give me credit.

164
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,040
 Anyways, the point is apparently you can have a life insurance policy on just random people

165
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,800
 or people you are in relationship with.

166
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,880
 So he divorces Nancy and he tries to get her to shut it down.

167
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
 She won't do it.

168
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,120
 He remarries Tracy and he...

169
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,200
 It's interesting because he dies.

170
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
 Spoiler alert.

171
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,680
 I think I mentioned that in the intro, but there's this huge psychological autopsy thing

172
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,360
 written on him because the military really had to investigate this.

173
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,440
 Really goes into a lot of detail like his mind states at certain points.

174
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,080
 I recommend you guys reading that if you want to get into the real nitty gritty.

175
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,320
 I'm glossing over a lot of the stuff that happens in between Tracy and Nancy.

176
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,480
 But anyways, now we're back with Tracy and we're back to April 16th, 2003.

177
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,080
 He left the house an hour earlier than he normally does.

178
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's now 8am.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 We're on a freeway outside of San Antonio.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,320
 So we're driving down the Jason's Lopi down this road and then all of a sudden...

181
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
 Car flies by us.

182
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,900
 Whoa, whoa.

183
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,800
 We almost get hit and we're watching it.

184
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,960
 We're trying to catch up to it.

185
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,080
 Apparently it's a TIE fighter now.

186
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,440
 It goes and it's like dodging cars and then it...

187
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,760
 You know like freeways normally have like the one lane and then there's like grass and

188
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 then there's the lane going the opposite direction.

189
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,200
 The car goes off the road, drives between two light poles, hits something in the median,

190
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
 goes airborne.

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
 Whee!

192
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,760
 Damn Duke boys on the run again.

193
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,360
 The car then crashes down on all four tires.

194
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,040
 The driver corrects it.

195
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,540
 Keeps going.

196
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,960
 You know there's no brake lights on at any point here.

197
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,360
 So we've basically just seen this guy do a Mad Max stun.

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,880
 The car's coming and it hits something, flies him in the air, lands.

199
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,720
 He's able to regain control of the car, keeps going, leaves the interstate again, smashes

200
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,760
 into a tree.

201
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,680
 Call 911 bro.

202
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
 We are you.

203
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
 You do it.

204
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
 Come on.

205
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
 Do it.

206
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
 Do it.

207
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
 Do it.

208
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
 Do it.

209
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
 Do it.

210
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
 The rest of us, you have to call 911.

211
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
 We have to call 911.

212
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680

00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
 We have to call 911.

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
 We have to call 911.

236
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
 We have to call 911.

237
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
 We have to call 911.

238
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
 We have to call 911.

239
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
 We have to call 911.

240
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 We have to call 911.

241
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
 We have to call 911.

242
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
 We have to call 911.

243
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
 We have to call 911.

244
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
 We have to call 911.

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
 We have to call 911.

246
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
 We have to call 911.

247
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
 We have to call 911.

248
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
 We have to call 911.

249
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
 We have to call 911.

250
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
 We have to call 911.

251
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
 We have to call 911.

252
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
 We have to call 911.

253
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
 We have to call 911.

254
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
 We have to call 911.

255
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
 We have to call 911.

256
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
 We have to call 911.

257
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
 We have to call 911.

258
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
 We have to call 911.

259
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
 We have to call 911.

260
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
 We have to call 911.

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
 We have to call 911.

262
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
 We have to call 911.

263
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
 We have to call 911.

264
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
 We have to call 911.

265
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
 This is what makes this story so weird.

266
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
 When they take him to do the autopsy,

267
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
 I don't know if they noticed it right there,

268
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
 because there's pretty much blood everywhere,

269
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
 and smoke, and all this stuff,

270
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,680
 but maybe one of the rescue personnel goes,

271
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
 "Hmm, that's weird."

272
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,680
 His shirt has two little bloody, bloody circles,

273
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
 right, where nipples would be.

274
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
 When they do discover this,

275
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
 he has, he doesn't have a head,

276
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
 or his head's bashed in,

277
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
 so that is what killed him.

278
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,680
 But this is what else they notice.

279
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,680
 He has, both of his nipples have been cut off.

280
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
 Not, and there's no car accident thing,

281
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
 unless he's like juggling razor blades

282
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
 while he's driving.

283
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 There's no way you're going to be in a car accident,

284
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
 and you're like, "Oh no, my nipples,"

285
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
 as like your seatbelt is like,

286
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
 "Sling!"

287
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
 Shafing them off.

288
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
 That's not possible.

289
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
 I mean, I guess in an infinite universe

290
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
 of infinite possibilities it is,

291
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
 but not in ours.

292
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,680
 He has a six inch long gash in his chest.

293
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
 Now, not six feet deep,

294
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,680
 because that would basically be through him.

295
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
 No, not six inches deep either,

296
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,680
 because I think, how big is six inches?

297
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
 I should know that.

298
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
 But, um, yeah,

299
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
 that would still probably be deadly

300
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,680
 if you had a six inch hole in you,

301
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
 for, you know, in your chest,

302
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
 is what I'm saying.

303
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
 So anyways, the point is,

304
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
 is that he had a big cut in his chest.

305
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
 That took way too long to figure out.

306
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
 Thirdly, which is possible,

307
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
 car accident, you know,

308
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
 thirdly, his pinky was chopped off.

309
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,680
 Now, again, you could be in a car accident

310
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
 and you could be like having your finger in the vent.

311
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
 You lost the penny in your heater vent.

312
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 You're trying to get it and you look up

313
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
 and you crash and you lose your pinky.

314
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
 But they could not find his pinky anywhere

315
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
 out of the crash thing.

316
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
 Or his nipples, by the way.

317
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
 Again, it wasn't like his nipples

318
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
 were just like floating around.

319
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
 They're like, "Oh, here they are.

320
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
 They're underneath this can of Mountain Dew."

321
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
 They're gone.

322
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
 His pinky's gone, his nipples are gone.

323
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,680
 And to make it even more bizarre,

324
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
 if that's not weird enough,

325
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,680
 because again, you could go, "Well, maybe like..."

326
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
 He was juggling raise-blade Jason

327
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
 and his nipples got cut off

328
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
 and they flew out both windows.

329
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
 And I don't know,

330
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,680
 seatbelt and the pinky just kind of disintegrated, right?

331
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
 You could possibly say that.

332
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,680
 But he also had duct tape wrapped around both wrists

333
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
 and around his ankles,

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
 like he broke free of something.

335
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
 So the police look at all this information

336
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
 and they go, "Hmm."

337
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
 So we know that this guy had a life insurance policy

338
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,680
 of a million dollars with a ex-wife

339
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,680
 who treated people with S&M, apparently.

340
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
 Again, they're like, "What? Really? That's a disease?"

341
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
 And, you know, sergeants like it.

342
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
 Some people don't like it.

343
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
 And then, easily bruisable people,

344
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
 bananas don't like it.

345
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,680
 And then, so they know that this guy looks like he suffered.

346
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
 It looks like he was tied up from somewhere.

347
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
 He left home early.

348
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
 Maybe he was having an affair.

349
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
 Maybe he went back to his ex-wife.

350
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,680
 She has this million-dollar insurance policy on him.

351
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
 We've got to keep bringing that up.

352
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
 Maybe something happened.

353
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,680
 However, the police look at all the available evidence

354
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
 and they go, "Oh, suicide.

355
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
 Why did we even investigate it? Suicide, obviously.

356
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 Stamp. They have a big stamp that just says 'suicide' on it.

357
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,680
 Hit the court document. Case closed."

358
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,680
 And his wife, Tracy, is like, "That's totally impossible.

359
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,680
 There's no way that this guy killed himself."

360
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
 Not saying that he couldn't kill himself,

361
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,680
 but how-- where are his nipples?

362
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
 Where are his nipples? Where is his pinky?

363
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,680
 So this is where we get into the psychological examination,

364
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
 the psychological autopsy.

365
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,680
 Oh, also, the duct tape had no fingerprints on it

366
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
 and there were no-- no gloves in his car.

367
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
 So whoever put the duct tape on it wasn't him

368
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
 or he did it and then threw his gloves away

369
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
 and then it was like, "Oh, it threw my nipples away too."

370
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
 As he's driving on the road.

371
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,680
 He was-- he was being seen by one of his colleagues

372
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
 and other psychiatrists at the area

373
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
 because he was dealing with some issues,

374
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,680
 but he had no suicidal ideation that at least was spoken of.

375
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,680
 He was planning on retiring in October of 2003

376
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
 and starting his own career.

377
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
 He was really looking forward to that.

378
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,680
 He actually told his psychiatrist six months before his death

379
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,680
 that he had this feeling or this dream that, quote,

380
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,680
 "His car went out of control on his way to work.

381
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
 Great violence was done to him."

382
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
 So it could be a premonition.

383
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
 It could be him setting the stage for something he was going to do.

384
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
 Obviously, the psychiatrist wasn't like, "Isn't that spooky?"

385
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
 The psychiatrist wasn't standing like that,

386
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,680
 but that could mean that to a rational person,

387
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,680
 that means he was setting the stage for his eventual suicide.

388
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,680
 But anyway, so the police ruled it's a suicide.

389
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
 No crime took place.

390
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
 This guy duct-taped himself and ripped his own nipples off

391
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,680
 and all this stuff and then purposely drove his car off the road

392
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
 into a tree.

393
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
 He didn't hit the brakes. It's a suicide.

394
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
 If it wasn't for all the missing body parts,

395
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
 it would just have been a normal suicide.

396
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
 Tracy, though, she can't really fight that.

397
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,680
 She sues Nancy and the insurance company to say

398
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
 she shouldn't be able to get the million dollars.

399
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,680
 She shouldn't be able to collect on the life insurance.

400
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,680
 She sues Nancy for just being Nancy.

401
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,680
 She sues USAA for not canceling the contract

402
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
 even though he kept telling her to cancel the contract.

403
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
 And the judge in this civil trials,

404
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
 they're going through the whole trial,

405
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
 Nancy's doing her stuff, Tracy's doing her stuff,

406
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
 USAA's doing her stuff.

407
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
 After the trial, the judge finally goes,

408
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,680
 "Okay, it's time for my verdict.

409
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
 You lose, Tracy. I'm not going to..."

410
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,680
 The USAA was in their right.

411
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
 This is apparently some weirdo policy

412
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
 where you can have a life insurance policy on someone.

413
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
 So you lose the trial.

414
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,680
 And Nancy, you will get your million dollars in life insurance.

415
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
 You will.

416
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,680
 Tracy, you get 1.2 million dollars

417
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
 in her life insurance policy

418
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
 that she had separately or something like that.

419
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,680
 And the judge goes, "He was murdered."

420
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
 Absolutely. This was not a suicide.

421
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 This guy was murdered.

422
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,680
 And everyone was like, "What? That wasn't even part of your trial."

423
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,680
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah. This guy was obviously murdered by somebody."

424
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
 And that's been it.

425
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
 The Attorney General of Texas goes, "No, he wasn't.

426
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
 We're not changing the ruling on his death certificate.

427
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
 It was a suicide. Case closed. We're not looking into it anymore."

428
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
 What I think happened,

429
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
 I know that you guys have been waiting with bated breath,

430
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
 is I think he went, he was either having an affair,

431
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,680
 he got into some S&M stuff, he was tied up.

432
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
 And I don't know if Nancy was involved in this,

433
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,680
 but I think he was probably having an affair.

434
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
 Don't haunt me, ghost of Philip Michael Shoe,

435
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
 but this would be my scenario.

436
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
 Probably having an affair.

437
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
 Got out of hand, he got tied up,

438
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,680
 he got his nipples off and he's like, "Hmm, this is going a little too far."

439
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,680
 And by the time they were like cutting his chest open,

440
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
 he broke out, "Ugh, I'm out of here."

441
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
 And he runs, he gets in his car, he's driving,

442
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
 and then one of two things happened.

443
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,680
 He succumbs to the 6-inch gash in his chest,

444
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
 which was probably unlikely. It wasn't like his guts were coming out.

445
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,680
 Or he could have realized that maybe it was even like a gay affair.

446
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
 It's one thing to cheat on your wife with another woman,

447
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
 like you can kind of tank that hit.

448
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,680
 You can be like, "Yeah, you know, whatever, I had a moment of weakness."

449
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,680
 But if you're a man and you're married to a woman

450
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,680
 and you have a saintomasticistic affair with a gay man,

451
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,680
 for a lot of people that's a lot harder to tank.

452
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 That's a lot harder to be able to excuse as just a dolly on.

453
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
 So he could have been driving on the road and he's like,

454
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 "Oh no, my nipples are missing, how am I going to explain this?

455
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
 I'm just going to kill myself."

456
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
 So in the end result, it may have been a suicide,

457
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
 but that's my take on it.

458
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,680
 I have no proof of that just based on the hour of research I did on this topic.

459
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,680
 I think it was a suicide, but...

460
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 Because I don't think like you're not like,

461
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
 "Oh, my nipples only got 10 minutes left to live."

462
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
 Like I don't think his wounds would have killed him.

463
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,680
 I think he's the one who eventually killed himself,

464
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,680
 but he killed himself because he was going to get found out.

465
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 Either he was having a heterosexual or a homosexual affair,

466
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
 and he was like, "I can't deal with this."

467
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
 So that's my personal take on it.

468
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
 But I do think it's weird that you can't cancel it.

469
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
 I can get insurance policies against people.

470
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,680
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

471
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
 Now for our next story, we're still on the freeway,

472
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
 but this time we're going to Spain.

473
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
 We're going to the mountainous region of Spain.

474
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,680
 And this one takes place in the year 1986.

475
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
 So I was a little kid when this one happened.

476
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
 I always think it's so weird.

477
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
 2003, that's not long ago.

478
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
 I mean, I was in college back then.

479
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,680
 But like 1986, I was like running around playgrounds

480
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
 when this story took place.

481
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,680
 Most of you guys didn't even exist, but I existed.

482
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
 1986, I was just child.

483
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,680
 I was about 10 years old, discovering girls for the first time.

484
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
 And this story happens.

485
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,680
 Now, this is 1986, it's June 25th.

486
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,680
 There's a truck full of acid, right?

487
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,680
 Which is obviously the best way you want to start.

488
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
 One of these stories.

489
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,680
 There's a truck, this guy is hauling acid up the SOMO Sierra

490
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
 mountain pass.

491
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,680
 It was a well maintained truck.

492
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
 I don't know why I'm making it sound like Frankenstein's

493
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,680
 in the engine, but this truck is going up this mountain pass.

494
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,680
 This is in Madrid, Spain, that area, headed towards the Basque

495
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
 region.

496
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
 So, woo, yeah, Basque people, let's go, let's go.

497
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,680
 So there's this, it's a try, it's not like a semi.

498
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
 It's a, I don't know anything about cars.

499
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
 This is what it is.

500
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
 It's a Volvo F12 truck.

501
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,680
 So I'm imagining it like a, not necessarily a pickup truck with a flat bed

502
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
 and there's just acid spilling everywhere.

503
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,680
 But I don't imagine it as a big semi in this story, but it is hauling

504
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
 an awful lot of acid.

505
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,680
 It's hauling 5,600 gallons of 98% pure sulfuric acid.

506
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 So it's a lot of stuff.

507
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
 This stuff is not watered down.

508
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,680
 This is not your, this is not your grandpa's sulfuric acid.

509
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,680
 This truck, I don't know why you make it sound like that.

510
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
 It goes up the mountain, right?

511
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,680
 And we're driving behind it and you're like, "Jason, do we really have to be behind?"

512
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
 I'm all like removing the windows.

513
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,680
 Like yes, smell the fumes, smell the fumes of the acid.

514
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
 The truck's going up the mountain.

515
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 It gets to the top and then it basically just starts barreling down the mountain

516
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
 and it's not a straight shot.

517
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,680
 It's not like a slalom or a solemn, you know, what skiers go down?

518
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
 Which a mountain.

519
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
 It's going down this mountain, right?

520
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,680
 And cars are like, "beep beep," they're like getting out of the way.

521
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,680
 At one point, a car gets ran off the road from this truck.

522
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
 It's just, "yep."

523
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
 Car gets ran off the road.

524
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,680
 And a white car, like a white van pulls up behind the car that gets run off the road

525
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,680
 and two people jump out of the car and they're like, "Are you okay?

526
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
 I just saw that truck almost ran you off the road."

527
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
 And the guy's like, "Yeah, that lousy idiot."

528
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
 The woman, so it's a man and a woman jump out of this van and they're like,

529
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
 "Yeah, yeah, I know, he totally sucks, right?"

530
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,680
 "I'm a nurse. I'm just one of the women," says this, not the dude.

531
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,680
 Not like it matters, but the woman goes, "I'm a nurse."

532
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,680
 The dude's like, "Mmm-mm, men aren't nurses.

533
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
 He has arms crossed. Uh-uh-uh."

534
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,680
 And the woman's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

535
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 I'm the nurse. I'm the nurse. Are you okay?"

536
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,680
 And the dude's like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, but just stop that truck."

537
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 So they jump back into these, man and this woman jump back into the van.

538
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
 They're driving down the road.

539
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,680
 Now, the truck also hits a car and knocks off its like side view mirror.

540
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
 Yeah, keeps going down the hill.

541
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 The white van stops, man and woman jump back up out again.

542
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
 Guys now wearing shirts. This is not a nurse.

543
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
 The woman's like, "Are you okay?"

544
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 So that car hit your car and knocked your mirror off.

545
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
 And then the guy's like, "Yeah, yeah, it really startled me."

546
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,680
 But stop that truck. That's the new game show in Madrid, Spain.

547
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,680
 Every week they get a truck full of sulfuric acid and just push it down a random mountain pass.

548
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
 Truck keeps going down the road.

549
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,680
 And eventually, it's like going 86 miles an hour, it's a windy mountain road.

550
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
 Eventually, everyone knows what's going to happen.

551
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
 The driver loses control of the car.

552
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:06,680
 It tips over and all over the roadway is 56,000 gallons of 95% sulfuric acid.

553
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,680
 Now, there are some shepherds in the area because it's the Basque region

554
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
 and that's the number one job over there.

555
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,680
 They're sitting there with their shepherd crooks hanging out, eating shepherd's pie,

556
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
 hanging out with some sheep.

557
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,680
 And are you a shepherd? Do they only do sheep?

558
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
 Is that what that name means?

559
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
 Can you be a shepherd of goats?

560
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
 Are you a goat herder at that point?

561
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,680
 Like shepherd, sheeper.

562
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,680
 Anyways, as they're debating that, they're like, "No, I swear.

563
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
 I swear I can start raising goats.

564
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,680
 You can raise goats, dude, but you won't be a shepherd."

565
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,680
 As they're having this conversation, they watch this truck full of sulfuric acid.

566
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,680
 Throw sulfuric acid everywhere.

567
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
 And basically, they're like, "Whoa, dude."

568
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,680
 The white van pulls up, man and the woman jump out of the van.

569
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,680
 They go to the wreckage of the car, of this truck that sulfuric acid is coming out of.

570
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,680
 They take a box out of it, jump back in the van, and leave.

571
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 The shepherds are looking at each other.

572
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
 They're like, "Hmm, that was interesting."

573
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
 Rescue crews show up.

574
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,680
 Now, at this point, sulfuric acid is completely leaking everywhere.

575
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,680
 Rescue crew has to wear respirators.

576
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,680
 Even then, you're having people who are having breathing problems.

577
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
 The acid's getting in their lungs.

578
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
 You have to be careful because I guess the fumes could ignite.

579
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
 It was this whole entire ordeal.

580
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,680
 They go into the cab and they see the driver.

581
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,680
 It's this dude named Andres Martinez, and his wife is also in the car, Carmen Martinez.

582
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,680
 They're both dead and they're both just bubbling and boiling away

583
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,680
 because a bunch of the acid came into the cab.

584
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,680
 The investigators are thinking, "Must have lost control of the truck."

585
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
 They died in the car accident.

586
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
 Hopefully, they died in the car accident.

587
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,680
 The acid is just doing what acid does best,

588
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 acid-ing stuff, eating them away.

589
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,680
 Obviously, it would have been much worse if they were like,

590
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
 "We survived that car accident."

591
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
 "Aha!"

592
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
 They're just as acid was filling up the cab.

593
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
 The investigators shut the door and they're like,

594
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
 "Don't look."

595
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
 They're telling the other investigators, "Don't look."

596
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
 And they're like, "It's totally gross."

597
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,680
 They're pouring lime, stuff, quick lime.

598
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,680
 And they're pouring sand to kind of help neutralize the acid and stuff like that.

599
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,680
 Everyone's clapping because they finally stopped that truck.

600
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,680
 This show's been going on for three seasons and no one ever done it before.

601
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
 They're putting it out.

602
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 Now, it gets to the point where their cops are like,

603
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,680
 "Okay, now we got to start notifying next of kin."

604
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
 These are the only people who died in this car accident.

605
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
 They get a hold, they find out who these people are.

606
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,680
 I'm assuming they look to their wallets because they're all gross.

607
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
 They're all acid-y, right?

608
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
 It's not like they can go, "Hey, I know that guy."

609
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,680
 And then you call up like somebody worked at Acme Chemicals and you're like,

610
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
 "Hey, I think your uncle died in an accident."

611
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
 And they're like, "Uncle Joker, no way."

612
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
 But no, they found...

613
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,680
 They didn't identify based on the horrible acid wounds.

614
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,680
 They found the driver's license or license registration.

615
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
 Somehow, that's not the point.

616
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
 Somehow they track down Carmen's mom.

617
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,680
 They make a phone call and they go, "Horrible accident."

618
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 She's like, "That's a hell of a way to start a phone call."

619
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,680
 I'm with the police department.

620
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,680
 Their daughter and her husband were driving down a road in a truck full of sulfuric acid.

621
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
 And they're dead.

622
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,680
 They died on impact and they have melted now.

623
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
 They're quite melted.

624
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,680
 And she goes, "So that's a hard phone call to make."

625
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,680
 And I'm sure he was a little less blunt than that.

626
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
 He was totally gross.

627
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
 Your daughter was all melted.

628
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
 Here's what's left.

629
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,680
 It's like a tune being dipped in acid.

630
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,680
 She's like, "No, my daughter was Betty Boop."

631
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,680
 Anyways, anyways, it's a horrible story.

632
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
 I don't know why I'm making all these jokes.

633
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
 Horrible story.

634
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:49,680
 So the grandma gets this phone call and then she says words that change the course of the entire incident.

635
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:57,680
 The grandma says this is a quote, "And the boy? Please tell me the boy is all right."

636
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:06,680
 The cop is like, "Uh, yeah, let me get back to you on that. Sorry, phone's breaking up. Reception's really bad. Hangs up."

637
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,680
 Turns to the other cops and they're like, "Did you see a kid in that car?"

638
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
 And cops are like, "No."

639
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,680
 Now, they're calling the next of kin within a couple hours that this is going on.

640
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:25,680
 So now they look over at the scene and there are pounds and pounds and pounds of sand and lime all over the crash scene.

641
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,680
 They're like, "Put your respirators back on, boys. We gotta dig and we gotta see if we can find this kid."

642
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,680
 Because when they looked in the cab, there was no kid.

643
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,680
 They also then they go, "Okay, let's see if the kid was somewhere else."

644
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,680
 Because he's a truck driver, all of his movements were tracked.

645
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,680
 He had this little tachometer in his car that like, "Show, it's this thing. I think in Europe, I know in Spain they have it."

646
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,680
 But it like, "Show's how the car's running and where it makes it stop."

647
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,680
 They're able to start doing all this investigation over the next three days.

648
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
 This is kind of what it comes about.

649
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,680
 In the first one, they go to a local restaurant and the guy's like, "Oh, no, no, no, they all three were here."

650
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,680
 The son was here with them. So they go, "Okay, so we know the son was with them very, very recently."

651
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:13,680
 And then they realized that when they were looking in the car, they saw kids' clothing and like music, like raffy music cassettes and stuff like that.

652
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,680
 And they're like, "No adult would ever listen to this garbage."

653
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,680
 So that was another clue that the kid was in the car.

654
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
 But where's the kid now?

655
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,680
 The first thing was maybe he's buried under all the sand and the quick lime.

656
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
 So they're digging all that stuff up. They can't find him.

657
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,680
 The second theory is that maybe he just melted.

658
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
 Maybe there was nothing left of him.

659
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,680
 And so they ran that by some scientists and basically got laughed out of science school.

660
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,680
 Because they're like, "It would take five days before the bones got eaten by acid."

661
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
 Like, acid doesn't work like that.

662
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,680
 Like, yeah, they actually said if you took him and put him in a pit of nothing but acid,

663
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
 it would take five days.

664
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,680
 If you just had him in a car and he got splashed with acid, there's not even a chance he's going to melt.

665
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,680
 You're going to find hair, you're going to find teeth, you're going to find most of them in the amount of time they've been talking about.

666
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,680
 Another theory is that he didn't have a seatbelt on.

667
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,680
 They could say that based on where he would have been sitting, he didn't have a seatbelt on.

668
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:16,680
 It's possible he got, when the car crash happened, he flew out of the car and landed somewhere and then simply got up and walked away.

669
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,680
 That one, they go, "It's... okay, actually."

670
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,680
 They think he might have gotten thrown out of the car and like fell in the river and died, or just like fell down a ravine and is still there.

671
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
 That is a theory.

672
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,680
 The other one is that he could have gotten thrown out of the car and survived and just walked away.

673
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
 Because that has happened.

674
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,680
 Now they said due to the violence of the accident and the copious amounts of acid,

675
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:49,680
 he wouldn't have walked away and been like, "Oh, I don't remember who I am, but I'm going to become a blacksmith in this village and just build this new identity."

676
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,680
 He would have been like, "Oh, I don't know who I am. Also, ah, my face!"

677
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,680
 As I'm covered in acid and even if he did wander to the next village, they'd be like,

678
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,680
 "He's not like, 'Here, I don't know who I am. I want to be a blacksmith.'"

679
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
 He'd be like, "Hey, I don't know who I am."

680
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
 "Ah-ha, and they'd take him to the hospital."

681
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
 So they don't really know.

682
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,680
 The weirdest thing is the people in the van.

683
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,680
 So the people in the van appear to have been following this truck.

684
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,680
 It stopped when the one car got ran off the road.

685
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,680
 It stopped when the car got hit and the rearview mirror got knocked off the site.

686
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,680
 And then it stopped and it retrieved a package from the ruckage before things got really acid-y.

687
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
 It got out of there.

688
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,680
 And the police, that last story, what happened was police were saying,

689
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,680
 while they were investigating this, people were like, "Oh, yeah.

690
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,680
 I talked to these two shepherds like right after the accident."

691
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,680
 And they said the car stopped and these people got packaged out and then they took off.

692
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
 And they're like, "What?"

693
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
 And then other people were like, "Yeah, yeah.

694
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
 There was two shepherds who were up there and saw that."

695
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,680
 When the police went to question the two shepherds, they questioned every shepherd in the area

696
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,680
 and none of them said that they saw that.

697
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
 Which means one of two things.

698
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,680
 It was some weird urban legend that started within hours after the accident.

699
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,680
 Or the two shepherds who saw that disappeared.

700
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,680
 There's a lot of French theories about this.

701
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,680
 One is that they were being pursued.

702
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,680
 That white man was actually chasing the acid people.

703
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,680
 And maybe they were dealing drugs or, and that was the package that was retrieved.

704
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
 Possibly.

705
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,680
 I think if you were pursuing a mental thing, you would stop at each side.

706
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,680
 You would be a really terrible drug dealer if you're chasing down someone who's stolen your drugs

707
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,680
 and then they mildly inconvenience someone and then you jump down and you're like,

708
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,680
 "Hey, look at my face and look at the license plate of the car I'm driving."

709
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,680
 You're like, "Okay, perfect. I'm gonna go fight these other drug dealers. See you later."

710
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,680
 Like that would be a really bad tactic for a drug dealer.

711
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680
 But did they take the kid?

712
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
 Like where's the kid?

713
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
 What was the car doing following it?

714
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
 It's such a bizarre story.

715
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,680
 And it's so bizarre I don't really have an explanation for it.

716
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,680
 Like if the kid was last seen weeks before the accident, you could think maybe something,

717
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,680
 maybe they accidentally did something to the kid or hurt the kid or left the kid

718
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,680
 and they were so guilt-ridden they decided let's just commit suicide.

719
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
 Because he wasn't breaking when he was going.

720
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,680
 And that's the thing, people describe the truck as being out of control

721
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
 but when they started looking at the tachometer of the truck, they're like,

722
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,680
 "He was totally in control of the truck. He seemed to be meaning to drive that fast down that road."

723
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
 The brakes worked perfectly fine.

724
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
 He just wasn't using them.

725
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,680
 It's possible that the white van had already done something to the kid

726
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,680
 and was chasing the family to finish off the job.

727
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
 Who knows? Really, who knows?

728
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,680
 We just know that two people are dead and a child is missing.

729
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:39,680
 I think the best case scenario is that that little dude, his name was Juan Pedro Martinez,

730
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
 is still alive.

731
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:46,680
 That he got thrown clear of the vehicle and like, there was like a pillow.

732
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,680
 There's like an old dirty mattress just out of sight of all the investigators.

733
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
 He's like, "Ugh."

734
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
 I mean that would be the best scenario.

735
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,680
 Worst case scenario is something awful happened to him before the events of this day.

736
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,680
 I think the middle-play scenario would be he gets acid on him.

737
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
 "Ah!"

738
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,680
 And then he jumps out of the car and runs before the white van shows up

739
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,680
 and then he like, rolls around in the dirt to like, neutralize the acid.

740
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
 He's like, "Ah!"

741
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,680
 And then he looks and he sees the white van and they're like,

742
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
 "Ha ha ha ha ha."

743
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,680
 Because they caused the accident is what that implies.

744
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,680
 And then they take a package and he's like, "No, not the package."

745
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
 This little boy.

746
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
 And his parents are dead.

747
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:30,680
 And then he wanders through the like, grasslands of Spain and he's training every day.

748
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,680
 He's like picking up, he has these weights full of sulfuric acid.

749
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
 He's just like lifting them.

750
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,680
 And it's good because if he drops them, then he gets more acid on them.

751
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,680
 So it makes it so he doesn't drop the weights like plant a fitness.

752
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
 And he's just like, "Ugh yeah."

753
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
 And he's like working out every single day.

754
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,680
 And then he basically like, a sheep herder.

755
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
 Those two sheep herders, they meet him and they're like,

756
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,680
 "Hey dude, you look all messed up."

757
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,680
 And he's like, "I know, I know, but help me train."

758
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
 So then he learns the ways of the sheep.

759
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
 He learns the fighting styles of the sheep.

760
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,680
 All of his fighting styles are just head butts.

761
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
 He just head butts people.

762
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,680
 And he's building up to the day where he's going to find these people in the white van.

763
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,680
 He's going to get revenge against them for killing his family.

764
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,680
 So his costume is just all wool.

765
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
 It's all wool.

766
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
 It's all wool.

767
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,680
 But he doesn't never hides the scars on his face.

768
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
 Because he wants those two people.

769
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,680
 He wants that guy who doesn't think men should be nurses.

770
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,680
 And the woman nurse to recognize him when he shows up.

771
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
 And then he can head butt him.

772
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
 So after eight years of training, he's going to turn 18.

773
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,680
 And now he's ready to go out and seek out vengeance.

774
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
 And his weapon is a shepherd's crook.

775
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,680
 And one night he's like crawling around on a rooftop.

776
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,680
 And there's like a big she-glass window.

777
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,680
 And he sees there's a white van parked in this drug dealers headquarters.

778
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
 And these guys are like, "Ha ha ha!

779
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
 We've cornered the acid market.

780
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
 Sofiric acid.

781
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
 You have to use this stuff to make gold."

782
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
 And then he knows he's at the right spot.

783
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,680
 And then he jumps through the stained glass window.

784
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
 It's not stained glass.

785
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
 It is now.

786
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
 It's a church.

787
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
 The Vatican's involved in this.

788
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
 Shhh.

789
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
 He jumps down.

790
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
 The Pope's like, "Oh no!

791
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
 It's the acid dude."

792
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
 He doesn't have a name yet.

793
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
 He's fought some low-level crooks.

794
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
 No one knows who he is.

795
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
 He starts throwing his shepherd's crook around.

796
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
 He's throwing it around people's necks.

797
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
 And then he pulls them towards him and he head butts him.

798
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
 And then he head butts the Pope.

799
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
 And the Pope's like, "Oh my hat!"

800
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
 And it falls off in his hat.

801
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
 Actually, it had a bunch of acid in it.

802
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,680
 And then the end.

803
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
 I think that would be...

804
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
 I basically...

805
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
 I don't know.

806
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
 I hope Juan's alive is basically what I'm saying.

807
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
 And having a life full of adventure.

808
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
 Maybe not headbutting the Pope.

809
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,680
 It might have been too much.

00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
