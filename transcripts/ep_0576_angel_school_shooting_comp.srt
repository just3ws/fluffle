1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
 A man out on an evening hunt becomes hunted by extraterrestrials.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,720
 And then we meet a couple who have come up with the ultimate moneymaking scheme.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,120
 Take over an entire school and ransom the students off one by one.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,800
 Into another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Dennis.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
 Dennis is running in.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,520
 He's like, clapping for himself.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,680
 He's doing a little clap, but everyone's clapping with him, so it's totally fine.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,800
 Dennis, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
 You can't support the Patreon.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,760
 You totally understand, just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
 a lot.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
 You done clapping, Dennis?

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,280
 He's nodding his head.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,080
 And I'm gonna throw him the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,680
 We are going to Italy.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,000
 Durgible is flying through the night sky.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,160
 Specifically, we're going to a place known as the River Poe.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,920
 We don't know exactly what location he's at with this story.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
 We don't even have the man's name.

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,760
 So, you know, those are usually, those are usually signs that someone's going to be

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,760
 in something, may not be entirely on the up and up.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,760
 However, let's just pretend it is.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,040
 Let's just pretend it is.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,720
 This is from, think about it docs.com and they've given us a lot of really good stuff

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
 in the past.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,840
 So, and they got it from an author known as Maurizio Virgo.

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,880
 So as Dennis is flying that Durgible, it's super dark outside.

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's all night time and stuff.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 There's a moon.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,080
 Dennis is flying us by the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

37
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,600
 We are going to do a quick and quiet parachute out of this thing.

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,440
 We're not going to take a chance to land the Durgible because we are going to hostile territory.

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,840
 So everyone's got their parachutes on.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
 We descend into the forest floor below.

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
 And through the foliage, we see a man.

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
 We're going to call him Jack.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,800
 We don't have his real name.

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,400
 Jack has his rifle at the ready.

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
 He's moving through the brush.

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,840
 He's looking for something to hunt.

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,120
 He's looking for something to kill.

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,640
 Scanning the forest for any movement.

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
 He'll, at this point, it's been a long day.

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
 At this point, he'll shoot anything.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
 He'll shoot a leaf.

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
 That means he gets to kill something.

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,560
 What he does is he starts to see a thick fog roll in.

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,200
 And inside the fog, he sees about five people standing around some sort of large gray object.

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,600
 And he's kind of looking through the fog.

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,800
 In a bazaar, imagine you're in that situation.

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,240
 You're in the middle of the forest.

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,480
 You see five, you see a spooky fog.

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,120
 That should be your first sign that something's up.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,560
 Then you see five people.

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,000
 There's always that hesitation there, because really what he's seeing is five humanoids

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,440
 standing in the fog surrounding a gray object.

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,000
 What do you think it would be?

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,480
 Obviously, you're hearing this on a paranormal podcast, so you know where it's going.

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,400
 But for whatever reason, he thinks it's five incredibly short people looking for their

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
 dog.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,280
 There's no part of that makes any sense unless their dog is a metallic oval.

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,440
 I think they're good, bro.

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,680
 But anyways, he goes, "Oh, they must be looking for their dog, because I have no concept of

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,000
 what a dog looks like."

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,240
 He pulls out his dog whistle, his ultrasound dog whistle, and he's thinking, "Oh, I'll

72
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,640
 just blow this whistle, then everything will be okay."

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,720
 So he goes, "You can't really hear the dog whistle, but your dog just went crazy."

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,560
 And then he sees a bright light shining towards him, like a guy is moving a spotlight into

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 position.

76
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 "Okay, fine, whatever.

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
 You're going to put me in the spotlight.

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,320
 I'll give you a little hat and cane, do a little dance for you."

79
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,320
 That's what you would think, again, not if you were in the forest, surrounded by a spooky

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,720
 fog and an oval metallic dog.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,680
 Finally, he comes to his senses.

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,680
 As they're putting this beam on him, he gets his gut reaction to fall to the ground.

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,560
 He doesn't know exactly what that is, but something in him, some instinct in him says,

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,200
 "That's a weapon."

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,520
 He jumps to the ground and as he's laying on the forest floor, he hears the dog whistle,

86
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:37,520
 "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

87
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
 like alien presence.

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,920
 He gets his gun ready, takes aim, and shoots where the light is, because he knows someone's

89
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
 holding it.

90
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,400
 He knows whoever is holding it is trying to do some bodily damage.

91
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,920
 When he shoots it, there's actually an explosion.

92
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,280
 And he's like, "Okay, job well done.

93
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,680
 I may have just killed five people looking for their dog who had a really loud light,

94
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,040
 or I've just stopped an alien invasion."

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,680
 Three more beams of light shoot towards him.

96
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,480
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is a firefight now.

97
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,280
 He begins shooting at those lights as well.

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,320
 And each time he's able to hit near one of the lights, there's an explosion.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,880
 When he finally hits the third light, when he's finally blown up their third weapon,

100
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,680
 he notices that three of these little dudes are now running through the forest towards

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
 him.

102
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,040
 It's going to get hand to hand here in a second, but he's not rolling hand to hand.

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,680
 He readies that rifle.

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,920
 He opens fire and these three little dudes are running towards him.

105
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
 And when I say little, they're like four feet tall.

106
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,720
 They're not like, they're not Smurfs.

107
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,040
 He's not blasting brain, he's smurfing the stomach.

108
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
 He's like, "Ugh."

109
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,080
 As these three guys are running towards him, he just blows one of them away.

110
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,480
 He just shoots one of them right in the chest.

111
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,760
 "Ugh."

112
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,040
 And he falls backwards.

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,880
 Now, it didn't seem that he killed him.

114
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,160
 The term that was used that it stopped him.

115
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
 So I don't think he like exploded.

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,960
 He exploded and disappeared, but he definitely took the shot.

117
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,840
 And whatever the damage may have done to him internally, as a rifle round you think would

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,000
 do to a living organism, he seemed to be in one piece.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,680
 He wasn't having the best day, but his other two comrades picked up this little guy and

120
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,840
 began dragging him back to the ship.

121
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,400
 So what does Jack do?

122
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,800
 Jack has now engaged these alien forces.

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
 He blew up their weapons.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,360
 He shot one of them square in the chest.

125
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
 Now they're retreating.

126
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,280
 "Yay, this is Earth first, right?

127
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,120
 Jack's not gonna let it in right there."

128
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,040
 He begins to open fire on their vehicle.

129
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,760
 At this point he's starting to realize, "That's not a dog.

130
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
 It's probably UFO.

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,960
 Those were most likely aliens shooting at me with laser guns."

132
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,800
 He begins to open fire on the vehicle itself, because he's just open to blows up.

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,040
 And then he can take his time.

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,200
 The real hunt will have begun.

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,560
 He'll hunt the deadliest game in the solar system, which is aliens.

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,920
 Where the deadliest game on Earth?

137
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,840
 He begins shooting at the UFO and starts to hear a "Pting!"

138
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
 "Pting!

139
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
 Pting!

140
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
 Pting!"

141
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,280
 As bullets are reflecting off its metallic hull, the aliens, if they can pee their pants

142
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,440
 or pee in their pants now, they get inside the UFO, they get everything powered up.

143
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
 "Pting!

144
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
 Pting!"

145
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,520
 And the UFO flies away.

146
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,280
 So that story took place on November 26, 1972.

147
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,840
 I forgot to mention that in the beginning, so I'm mentioning it after the story, after

148
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,040
 you've already pictured it, with him wearing modern-day clothes.

149
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 He's wearing FUBU.

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,680
 No, it was in 1972.

151
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,880
 I think it's an interesting story.

152
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,720
 I always love stories where humans open fire on aliens.

153
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,620
 I wish it happened more often.

154
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,960
 You have to wonder what would happen if he hadn't had his gun.

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,440
 I mean, he probably would have gotten away if he wasn't blowing his dog whistle.

156
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,480
 And actually, that's an even more interesting point.

157
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,680
 Usually with aliens, they overpower humans pretty easily, especially when you're talking

158
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
 about five to one.

159
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,320
 We've talked about stories where you have like 30 KGB troops versus five aliens, and

160
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,240
 the five aliens just mopped them up.

161
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,480
 We recently covered that story with those Russians on that island that were having a

162
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
 firefight with aliens.

163
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,400
 And the Russians retreated, because the bulletproof giants showed up.

164
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,320
 So that's the most intriguing description that you can give for that story.

165
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
 Check it out.

166
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
 I don't remember what episode it was.

167
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
 It was KGB versus aliens.

168
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,160
 KGB versus ET part two.

169
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
 I'll put it in the show notes.

170
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
 But you have this.

171
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,600
 That's really weird that he was able to engage them.

172
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,640
 I'm wondering if the hypersonic whistle, if the dog whistle disoriented them.

173
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,440
 We've talked so much about aliens having sonic powers, having the ability to actually disrupt

174
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
 your vibrations the way your mind think.

175
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,120
 We covered that in an episode.

176
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,480
 Are gray aliens actually evolved dolphins in the future?

177
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,560
 I'll put that in the show notes as well.

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,560
 And the fact that the dolphin uses that sonic attack to freeze you, and we know from Alien

179
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,920
 lore that aliens can freeze you in place.

180
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,000
 The idea was it was some sort of sonic attack.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,680
 What if a dog whistle eliminated all of that?

182
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,520
 What if a dog whistle actually disoriented them?

183
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
 Interesting.

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,680
 I didn't think about that when I was prepping this story.

185
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,560
 Maybe that should be a new UFO thing.

186
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,880
 Everyone, if you're a real UFO investigator and you listen to the dead rabbit radio because

187
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,720
 the two go hand in hand, I think we should all start wearing dog whistles.

188
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 That'd be super dope.

189
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
 People are like, "Hey, why do you have that dog whistle?

190
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
 Are you looking for a dog or something?"

191
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
 And I'll go mind your own business.

192
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,960
 Mind your own business first off.

193
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,920
 Secondly, yes, I'd love a dog if you have one.

194
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 A little puppy maybe?

195
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,280
 Or an old rescue dog.

196
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
 I'm not picky.

197
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,400
 And then three, then you put your hand on their shoulder and you go in three.

198
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,920
 It's a UFO thing you wouldn't understand.

199
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,040
 They're like, "I don't understand anything you just said.

200
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,480
 I definitely don't understand the UFO thing, but none of it makes sense."

201
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,360
 Maybe you walk away all quiet.

202
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,960
 As we're walking away, Dennis, call in that carboner copter.

203
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,000
 We are headed out to Cokeville, Wyoming.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
 Helicopter's flying.

205
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
 Dennis is the first one to have an official dead rabbit radio dog whistle that's emblazoned

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
 with the logo.

207
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,000
 I don't even know how much those things cost.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
 It may be a couple hundred dollars.

209
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,320
 But Dennis has bought one already.

210
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
 He's blowing it the whole time.

211
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,080
 We're like, "Ah, it's not a dog whistle."

212
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,720
 It's a regular whistle he has his headphones on, his helicopter pilot headphones on.

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
 He can't hear us.

214
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
 We're like, "Uh-huh."

215
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,640
 But eventually Dennis is done torturing us.

216
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,880
 We're flying out to Cokeville, Wyoming.

217
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,200
 Now I came across this story in a roundabout way.

218
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,440
 Yesterday's, no, no, it was Tuesday's episode.

219
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,280
 I talked about the insane asylum in Millageville, Georgia.

220
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,880
 And in that episode, somebody said, "Weird America," weird America to make it short,

221
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,520
 said that once there was a school shooting where a teacher put a bullet in backwards

222
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,560
 and the guy's gun and then the kid's -- it was super bizarre.

223
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,880
 And I wasn't able to verify it that that's ever happened in human history, that someone's

224
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,120
 ever taken a gun from someone, put a bullet in backwards, handed it back to the guy, and

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
 then a bunch of kids beat the guy up.

226
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 I'm going to verify that.

227
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,720
 But I did start looking -- I looked for it.

228
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
 I looked really hard for it.

229
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 And I found some interesting factoids.

230
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,760
 They're small facts about school shootings, stuff that I had never known before.

231
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,880
 And then we're going to get into a truly bizarre tale of a ransom event at an elementary school.

232
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
 I found this website.

233
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,600
 Again, it's a website that you wouldn't think you'd find this information on.

234
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,160
 It was k12academics.com.

235
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
 It was a website about school stuff.

236
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,680
 And you can understand they'd have stuff about like school shooter safety.

237
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,760
 But this one actually had a list of every notable school shooting.

238
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,440
 And they're like, "Jason, that makes sense too because people are going to look at the

239
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
 psychology of it."

240
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
 Yeah.

241
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,080
 So when the list starts in the year 1764, they're going way back.

242
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,640
 This is a list of every United States school shooting.

243
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,240
 And obviously it's not really everyone.

244
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,800
 Because when I went to high school in the Bay Area, it was pretty common.

245
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,920
 But it was never in the news because it was gang related.

246
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,160
 So people just got shot.

247
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,720
 So here's some interesting factoids about this stuff before we get into this other story.

248
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,280
 The very first school shooting, like I said, was in 1764.

249
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:16,080
 July 26, 1764, where Green Castle, Pennsylvania is now, four members of the Lin Ape tribe

250
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,400
 went into a school house and killed a teacher and 10 kids.

251
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
 That's considered the very first school shooting.

252
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,120
 Even though it was like territorial war and things like that, they're like, "This is the

253
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,520
 first time you ever had a school targeted in the United States."

254
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
 It became an issue.

255
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
 Not so much.

256
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,760
 There were a couple school shootings in between that and 1866.

257
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,560
 But the big problem was all the kids were bringing guns to school.

258
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,240
 So much so that the New York Times ran an article in 1866 saying, "Hey, listen, your

259
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,040
 kids can't be bringing guns to school.

260
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,120
 That's not something that we should allow as a civilized society.

261
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
 We get it.

262
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
 Everyone has a gun.

263
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
 They're out squirrel hunting and stuff like that.

264
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,720
 But don't bring them to school."

265
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,720
 And then the New York Times adds, "Or if the other students' parents aren't going to

266
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,040
 restrict their gun use, no joke, it gives us advice to parents.

267
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,400
 It's saying if the other kids are packing guns, we have this."

268
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,800
 "We advise them to seek that their own boys are properly armed with the most approved

269
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,040
 and deadly pistol, and that there may be an equal chance, at least, of their shooting

270
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,520
 as of being shot."

271
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,120
 So if you can't beat them, smoke them.

272
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,920
 Basically, it was what the New York Times was saying.

273
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,880
 If you can't control other people's kids, arm your kids up.

274
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,600
 And one more factoid, in case you're ever on a really bizarre episode of Jeopardy.

275
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,760
 In 1987, the American School Health Association did a survey of boys in America bringing

276
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,560
 weapons to school.

277
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,840
 In 1987, 3% of all boys admitting to bringing a gun to school at least once in the school

278
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
 year.

279
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,040
 And 1% of all American boys brought a gun to school daily.

280
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,640
 So I don't know if those stats still hold up.

281
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,680
 Again, a lot of times when we look at school shootings, we look at mass shootings.

282
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,880
 But gang-related shootings happen all the time.

283
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 They just don't make the news.

284
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,640
 Unfortunately, because they're so common.

285
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,440
 There's also, if you look at this list, I'll have it in the show notes, there's a lot of

286
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,640
 girls and that's another thing that gets left out of the psychology of a school shooter.

287
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,760
 A ton of girls are doing this as well.

288
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,840
 Mass shootings and just targeted shootings.

289
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,400
 Going in killing their boyfriend, going in and killing a girl who made fun of her hair,

290
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,480
 happens a lot.

291
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,080
 But Dennis, we are done with our factoids about these horrible events.

292
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,520
 Now we're going to take a deep dive into one of them.

293
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,360
 Sorry, Dennis is like, "Oh, dang it."

294
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:43,240
 Dennis calling that carpenter copter, we are headed out to Cokeville Elementary School.

295
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,640
 As Dennis is landing the carpenter copter and we're hopping out, we see people standing

296
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,200
 outside of the Cokeville Elementary School.

297
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,000
 We see David Young, his wife, Doris Young, and their daughter, Penny.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,040
 They're standing outside the school and David appears to be pushing some sort of shopping

299
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,920
 cart in front of him.

300
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,280
 We see a brief interaction between David, who's 43 years old and Doris, his 47 year

301
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,360
 old wife.

302
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,440
 We see an interaction between them and their daughter.

303
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,200
 After a brief conversation, they leave the daughter outside.

304
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
 She's a young teenager.

305
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,520
 Doris and David walk into the school.

306
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,640
 Penny thinks about it for a second.

307
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,600
 She's going to go back to their van, but instead she decides to alert authorities.

308
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,400
 She takes off running through the town of Cokeville.

309
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,240
 A long time ago, in Cokeville, David was a cop.

310
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,680
 He was actually the only cop on the beat.

311
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,120
 It's not the biggest town in the world.

312
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,720
 Otherwise, he would be the burliest man alive if he could patrol the streets of San Francisco

313
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,840
 all by himself.

314
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,880
 But he got fired after only six months for misconduct.

315
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,720
 So after he gets fired from there, he goes out to Arizona and he meets Doris, who already

316
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,880
 has the daughter, Penny.

317
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,600
 And he tries to start a new life for himself, but he can't let the past lights go.

318
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,920
 Plus he needs money.

319
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,960
 So he comes up with this plan.

320
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,760
 But he has to test it first.

321
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,920
 He somehow comes into possession of a school bus and blows it to pieces.

322
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,680
 A hot steamy Arizona desert night is lit up by an explosive fireball.

323
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,880
 David now knows that his plan will work.

324
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,040
 And here's his plan.

325
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 Go back to the town that fired him.

326
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,040
 Bring this type of bomb into a school and take the entire place hostage.

327
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,160
 Two million dollars per student, he tells Doris.

328
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
 Parents are going to pay.

329
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,960
 And if the parents don't pay, the government will pay.

330
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,640
 In fact, not only do I want two million dollars per student, I want a personal phone call

331
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
 with Ronald Reagan.

332
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
 Doris is like, "What does that have to do with anything?"

333
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
 He's like, "I don't know.

334
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
 I just think he's cool."

335
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 And I want to talk to Ronald Reagan.

336
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,480
 I want two million dollars per student.

337
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
 This is totally going to work.

338
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Let's get Penny in on this.

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,160
 Let's make it a family activity.

340
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,920
 Now they do recruit Penny to do this, but when they get to the school, she's like, "No,

341
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
 I'm good.

342
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,360
 I don't want to do anything that involves a bomb or you lunatics or possibly hurting

343
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,560
 these kids."

344
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
 So they leave her there.

345
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,880
 I'm assuming they thought she would be more loyal than running down the street to get help.

346
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,320
 May 16th, Doris and David walk into the school and David is pulling his little shopping

347
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
 cart.

348
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
 It wasn't like a full on Walmart shopping cart.

349
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,120
 It was like one of those things you see old ladies or homeless people push.

350
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,920
 It's like half a shopping cart.

351
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,440
 He pushes that into the school and while he's walking in, Doris just kind of takes off into

352
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,480
 the school and starts going, "Hi guys.

353
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
 Hey everybody.

354
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
 There's a surprise at this classroom down the hall."

355
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,040
 And the kids are like, "Yay, surprise."

356
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
 1986, right?

357
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,960
 I didn't have any security stuff.

358
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,840
 You could just show up at his school and go, "Surprise."

359
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,960
 And everyone liked it.

360
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
 She began emptying classes out.

361
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,720
 "Guess what guys?

362
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
 There's a surprise down the hall."

363
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
 And they're like, "Yay."

364
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,080
 And the teacher's like, "Yeah, love surprises.

365
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
 This isn't suspicious at all."

366
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,960
 She ends up rounding up 136 students and 15 staff members into this back room.

367
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,040
 David on the other hand is talking to the office people and he has a zine.

368
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,360
 Again, 1986, he published his manifesto called Zero Equals Infinity and he throws it down

369
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 on the counter.

370
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,720
 And he begins giving this bizarre speech about his life mission, which happens to be connected

371
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,600
 to the bomb he's carrying in the little cart.

372
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,680
 But he just then takes off through the school as well towards that back classroom.

373
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,640
 There was 136 kids, 15 staff.

374
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,480
 There was three other people there who didn't work out of the school, who just happened to

375
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
 be passing by.

376
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
 One of them was a UPS driver.

377
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,080
 Someone was there just applying for a job.

378
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,880
 By this point, Penny has reached town hall and she has alerted authorities.

379
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,440
 "My parents are nuts."

380
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,280
 I mean, to say the least, they built a bomb.

381
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,360
 They're in the school right now.

382
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,680
 The authorities are rushing out to the scene.

383
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,080
 And again, 1986, they didn't have the rules before Columbine was you secure a perimeter,

384
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,320
 you negotiate with the people inside.

385
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,960
 Columbine was the active shooter.

386
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,240
 It was just someone trying to cause as much chaos as possible.

387
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,720
 So now they go into the scene.

388
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,080
 But this does follow the thing where they surround the school and in this situation, it is a hostage

389
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
 situation.

390
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,440
 They do want to negotiate.

391
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,960
 They want their $2 million per kid.

392
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
 That's a lot of money.

393
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
 That's a ton of money for any kid.

394
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
 Richie Rich.

395
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,320
 Richie Rich's dad would be like, "You can hang out there a little bit.

396
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
 Let me figure some stuff out.

397
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,560
 Maybe we can talk them down to like $750,000."

398
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,400
 They're there for two and a half hours.

399
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,360
 And there's one thing about taking a bunch of children hostage.

400
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,480
 They're scared, obviously.

401
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,880
 Everyone's scared.

402
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,000
 But they're kids, so they're super bored.

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,800
 They're like, for the first 10 minutes, they're like, "Oh no, oh no, existential dread."

404
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,560
 And then after that, they're like, "Ugh, come on, come on, we play.

405
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,160
 Can we invent a Nintendo Game Boy and then play it?

406
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
 Can we watch a movie?

407
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
 They didn't have VCRs.

408
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,400
 They didn't have VCRs in schools back then.

409
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
 Oh, come on."

410
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
 The teachers are all reading them science books.

411
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,720
 They're all, "Boo, boo, they're super bored."

412
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,560
 They're super bored because they're all trapped in this one room.

413
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,880
 And yes, they are scared.

414
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,280
 But at the same time, two and a half hours to a kid is like two and a half years to an

415
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
 adult.

416
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,880
 And in a hostage situation, everything's like two and a half years because you're just super

417
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
 stressed.

418
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 But the kids are super bored.

419
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,920
 The teachers are trying to figure out games to play while there's a bomb in the room because

420
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,240
 they're like, "Can we play hide and go seek?"

421
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,440
 They're like, "As long as you don't hide behind the bomb, Jimmy."

422
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,120
 He's like, "Oh man, that's the best hiding spot."

423
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,560
 The bomb, and let me explain this to you.

424
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,160
 The bomb was created to destroy school buses.

425
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
 It was incredibly powerful.

426
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,720
 But that wasn't all.

427
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,600
 You had a milk carton full of gas.

428
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,200
 It was basically designed to spread flame.

429
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,360
 It was a very, very personal destructive device.

430
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,640
 It did blow up that bus, but it was mostly just to cause flame to come shooting out in

431
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
 all directions.

432
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,680
 It was a milk jug full of gasoline.

433
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,840
 And then underneath it, it was wired up to these two tuna cans that were filled with

434
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
 aluminum powder and flour.

435
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,760
 So when the bomb ignited, it would spread the flour and the aluminum dust, and it would

436
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 actually make the flame more sticky and spread easier.

437
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,240
 It's not just a bunch of flame.

438
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
 Gasoline's just kind of...

439
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
 This would actually spread fire to all the walls.

440
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,280
 If you've got the powder on you, you're not having a good day, especially if it's on fire.

441
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,640
 It's all wired up, and then there's a wire going from the cart to David's hand.

442
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,200
 He's wearing a dead man trigger on his hand.

443
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,280
 So you got to be very careful.

444
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,000
 If he starts moving his hand too much, if he starts doing the robot, he's like, "Kids,

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 you bored?

446
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,320
 Let me show you my dance moves."

447
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 He couldn't do that.

448
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
 It was a dead man switch.

449
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,400
 If he moved his arm too far up, it would actually detonate the bomb.

450
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,040
 It was a safety measure, but that way if he got injured, he could still trigger the bomb.

451
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,880
 So he has this dead man switch on.

452
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,040
 Kids are not allowed to hide around the bomb.

453
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
 Kids are getting super bored, though.

454
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,680
 So the teachers are having to come up with games to play in this room.

455
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,200
 And at one point, one of the teachers goes, this is just kind of a creepy moment and a

456
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
 very creepy story.

457
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,680
 The teacher goes, "Hey, does anyone here have a birthday?"

458
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
 I actually don't think she said that.

459
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,880
 She was like, "What's the most depressing thing that can ring up right now?

460
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,720
 Was anyone born today?"

461
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,920
 She does realize that one of the kids had a birthday that day.

462
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,520
 They're like, "Okay, let's just have a normal day here.

463
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
 Happy birthday to you."

464
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,920
 And all the kids are singing, "Happy birthday to you."

465
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,000
 And as the class is singing this song, all of a sudden they hear, "Happy birthday dear

466
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Jimmy."

467
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
 And the class gets a little quiet.

468
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:54,560
 David and Doris are now singing, "Happy birthday to you."

469
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,680
 And that would be terrifying.

470
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,760
 They're trying to have this sense of normalcy and they're singing this song and then the

471
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,520
 two hostage takers are like, "We know the words to this song."

472
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,240
 Talk about a ruined birthday.

473
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,980
 You got a lot of stuff going on here.

474
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,080
 They're making the phone calls.

475
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,680
 They've made their demands.

476
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,320
 $2 million per kid plus a phone call to Reagan, who I most assume was napping at this point.

477
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,960
 Now one of the things, this was a design of the bomb.

478
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
 It was supposed to leak gasoline.

479
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,320
 So the whole time it's just dropping little droplets of gasoline.

480
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,880
 So again, it could make the fire spread because you carry it around the classroom.

481
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,280
 You push it around the classroom, it's spreading gasoline.

482
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,600
 But in a contained room for two and a half hours, the smell is starting to get to people,

483
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,960
 especially little kids because they're closer to the ground.

484
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,600
 Like an adult can stand up and go, "Oh, that gasoline is six feet away from me.

485
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
 I'm okay.

486
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 Little kids are sitting down."

487
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,200
 They're like, "Ugh, it's nap time, isn't it?

488
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
 It's nap time."

489
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
 And they're like, "No, no, no, don't fall asleep.

490
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,520
 Don't fall asleep, Jimmy."

491
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,160
 The teachers are like, "Dude, it totally smells like gasoline in here.

492
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,640
 These kids are getting too many fumes.

493
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,680
 Can we open some windows?

494
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,760
 Can we open some windows?"

495
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,320
 And David and Doris kind of look at each other and they go, "Yeah, it's kind of getting

496
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
 a little woozy in here."

497
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,360
 Once those bats showed up and I had to fight them off with a candy cane, I realized I'd

498
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,840
 probably been inhaling too much gas.

499
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,280
 So yeah, go ahead and open the windows."

500
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,840
 So the teachers kind of look at each other.

501
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,480
 They know a little more about science than these two guys.

502
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,560
 They're like, "Okay, great, we'll open the windows."

503
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,160
 David goes, "You know what?

504
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,840
 It's been two and a half hours.

505
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,760
 You know me, Doris, every time I see happy birthday, I have to go to the bathroom.

506
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,280
 It's just a weird quirk of mine.

507
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,360
 I got to go to the bathroom, but I can't take this bomb in here with me.

508
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,400
 So I'm going to give you the dead man trigger.

509
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,600
 Put it on your little finger there.

510
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,840
 You know the drill.

511
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,120
 If they start shooting, you can detonate the bomb.

512
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,280
 You can kill all these kids.

513
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
 Bye, kids.

514
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
 See you guys later.

515
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
 I got to go poop.

516
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,880
 The kids all laugh because he said poop and then they get all scared because, you know,

517
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
 the bomb, he goes in and he's pooping.

518
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,800
 And the kids are getting restless.

519
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,600
 They've run out of games to play.

520
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
 They're super bored.

521
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
 They are scared.

522
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,880
 They start kind of like pushing each other closer to the bomb.

523
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
 They're like, "You go there.

524
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
 No, no, no.

525
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
 You go there."

526
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
 The teachers are trying to get him to calm down now.

527
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,840
 And a lot of schools, they have this thing, elementary schools, where if you're, instead

528
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,240
 of trying to talk over the children and get louder and louder over the children, you do

529
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
 a hand signal.

530
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,520
 So you put your fingers to your forehead.

531
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,640
 That's a really popular one.

532
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,880
 And then as the kids here, the room get quieter and quieter.

533
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,320
 They look at the teacher.

534
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,720
 Teacher has her hands on her forehead.

535
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,600
 It's usually like a two-finger salute, or they'll hold it up, and that way the kids

536
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
 will go.

537
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,200
 Instead of yelling at kids, it's a way to get kids to quiet down.

538
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,640
 So the teacher's doing that, and all the kids are holding their fingers up to their head.

539
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,800
 And Doris is sitting there, and a teacher is fanning herself, and she's like, "Oh my

540
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,920
 god, it's so hot in here.

541
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,840
 I don't know if it's the fumes or the gasoline, but it's really, really hot."

542
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,440
 And Doris goes, "It is hot in here."

543
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,520
 And as she either subconsciously, because everyone was doing it, or because the teacher

544
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,720
 put the thought in her head, or because the beads of sweat rolling down her forehead,

545
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:03,960
 Doris reaches up to wipe away the sweat, and the room goes pitch black.

546
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,600
 People in the room, they've done interviews with survivors of this.

547
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,880
 They said, "All light was gone in an instant."

548
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,480
 Because when this bomb exploded, obviously you have the sound, and you have the shockwave.

549
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,200
 But the first thing you realize is you can't see.

550
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
 The entire place is filled with smoke.

551
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,480
 The only thing you can see are flickers of flame around the classroom.

552
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,320
 You have the cops surrounding the building, who heard it, and again are assuming the absolute

553
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
 worst.

554
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,680
 But the people in that room, they don't have time to assume anything.

555
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,520
 Teachers just begin grabbing into the darkness, finding little people, and throwing them out

556
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,560
 the opened windows.

557
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,080
 Someone just grabbed a bunch of the kids and pushed them through a door into the hallway.

558
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,640
 Go, go, go, go, go, go!

559
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,960
 They were doing whatever they could do to get these kids out.

560
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,880
 After the explosion happens, David comes out of the bathroom.

561
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,560
 And even though it's pitch black in there, he knows what happened.

562
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
 He heard the bomb.

563
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,600
 He doesn't know why she detonated it.

564
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,360
 But when he comes out, sees that the bomb's been detonated, the plan's over.

565
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,120
 They're not going to get any money at all now.

566
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,560
 This turns and looks at David, and David shoots her, killing her on the spot.

567
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,720
 He then shoots a teacher in the darkness.

568
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,480
 He opens fire in the darkness.

569
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,120
 And after that, goes back into the bathroom and kills himself.

570
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,560
 Not a single student or staff member was killed during this event.

571
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,520
 You did have people get burned, but they were totally fine.

572
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,240
 You did have people get shot, but no long-lasting injuries.

573
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
 Nobody died because of this.

574
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,400
 An interesting note to the story, and this is where we start to see things kind of turn

575
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 a bit.

576
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,680
 You have all these kids jumping out of the window and running across the lawn.

577
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,680
 And when the cops are coming in and they're securing the area and they're interviewing

578
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,240
 people and they're surveying it, they find Doris' body on the lawn.

579
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,680
 They know that she was shot in the classroom.

580
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,360
 They know she was dead in the classroom, but she's on the lawn.

581
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,000
 Now you would think a teacher just trying to grab people and throw them out the window

582
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,520
 must have grabbed this adult woman and also threw her out the window.

583
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
 It's possible.

584
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,880
 That's the most likely scenario.

585
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,680
 Let's take a look at some of the other things that were surrounding this event.

586
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,040
 When the police went in and they were analyzing the crime scene, they took the bomb and they

587
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,920
 were able to reconstruct it as best as they could.

588
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,120
 They go, it definitely caused a lot of damage.

589
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,080
 It couldn't have been way worse.

590
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,880
 The containers of aluminum powder and flour, they didn't ignite.

591
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,060
 They said part of it was the gasoline was actually dripping on because the cans were

592
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,640
 opened up, was dripping on the powder so it was turning some of it into a paste.

593
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,400
 So it would have been harder to ignite anyways.

594
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,360
 But police also noticed a weird thing because he'd built this bomb before.

595
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
 He knew how to do it.

596
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:56,160
 The wires going from the milk jug to the tuna cans to ignite those had been cut.

597
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,440
 Both of them had been cut.

598
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,320
 And when the police asked everyone in the room, "Hey, did you cut them?

599
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,680
 Were you able to get a little pair of safety scissors?

600
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
 Little pair of plastic scissors?"

601
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,320
 And you're like, "Whoops, I tripped."

602
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
 And then you clip both of them.

603
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,480
 People in the classroom were like, "No, none of us were ever able to clip the wires of the

604
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,400
 bomb nor would we because we don't know what it would do."

605
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
 Penny didn't do it.

606
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,720
 The cops don't know how the bomb became sabotaged.

607
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
 But it was cut.

608
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
 It wasn't ripped.

609
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,400
 It wasn't worn out from the explosion.

610
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,000
 They could tell somebody snipped the line.

611
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,800
 Maybe Doris had a change of heart in the end.

612
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,080
 You could think that, but again, let's take a look at some of these other stories that

613
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,880
 happened inside this classroom.

614
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,920
 This is where it goes from just being a true crime story of two bumbling idiots who try

615
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,800
 to make some quick bucks at the expense of other people.

616
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,840
 And it's something a little more paranormal.

617
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,000
 As the children are being interviewed about this, they would say things like, "Yeah, I

618
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 was scared.

619
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,560
 I was scared at first, but then the angels showed up.

620
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,800
 There was an angel in the room and I knew nothing would happen to me."

621
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,960
 Angel children said that they saw angels in that room with them.

622
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,600
 Some of them said, "I could look over all of my classmates and each of them had an angel

623
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
 floating over their head."

624
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,960
 Some of them reported seeing just a beautiful woman in white standing in the corner of the

625
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,200
 room peacefully watching the scene.

626
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,480
 Some of them saw a beautiful woman in white standing against a wall.

627
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,040
 And she was beckoning to the kids, "Come closer to the windows.

628
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,400
 Come closer to the windows."

629
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,040
 None of the adults reported any of this stuff, but the kids all believed that guardian angels

630
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
 were there.

631
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,480
 And the kids who did move and sit closer to the windows, one were able to breathe more,

632
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:53,320
 which yes, as a skeptic, breathing gasoline for two and a half hours can make you hallucinate

633
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 angels.

634
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,400
 Being put in a skeptic's part aside, the kids who were sitting closer to the window,

635
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,200
 one got fresh air more often and two were able to get out quicker.

636
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,880
 And that was, I forgot to mention this detail earlier, when they opened the windows it actually

637
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,320
 diminished the power of the bomb because more gasoline was leaking out than just sitting

638
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,680
 in that room.

639
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:19,280
 In fact they said the bomb is capable of tearing up a school bus, but the way the classroom

640
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,920
 is not a school bus, it has just like a roof full of really cheap tile, probably a ton of

641
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,360
 asbestos above it.

642
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,720
 So the bomb just lifted the roof a bit, knocked a bunch of tiles down, set stuff on fire,

643
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,560
 but it didn't have that contained force.

644
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,880
 You had the windows open, you had a weaker structure surrounding the bomb.

645
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,160
 Had they done this in a portable, how do they done this in a more secure location?

646
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,520
 That could have been worse, in like a concrete tile locker room, it could have done a lot

647
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
 more damage.

648
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,320
 But this whole sequence of events that led these people to bring this bomb into this

649
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,200
 area and to be there for long enough people were complaining about opening the windows

650
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
 and all of that.

651
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,280
 You can obviously chalk up the angel visions to the gasoline, but that doesn't solve who

652
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,720
 snipped the lines of the bomb.

653
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,160
 We know it wasn't David, because it was his plan.

654
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,000
 We can be kind of sure it wasn't Doris, because why would Doris snip him?

655
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,680
 She was also in on this plan.

656
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
 But it could have been her.

657
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
 There's no one to say.

658
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,760
 But I have a, this put on our conspiracy caps here.

659
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,720
 An angel did it.

660
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,280
 An angel snipped those cables.

661
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,000
 Guardian angels led the course of events that day.

662
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,160
 Yes, it is absolutely tragic that it happened in the first place and you can say, well why

663
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,400
 didn't a guardian angel just give him a flat tire or have a cop randomly pull him over

664
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
 the...

665
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
 I mean sure, yes.

666
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,520
 But skipping that, are you on a side?

667
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,760
 The angels did it.

668
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,480
 They saved these children.

669
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,880
 They clipped those lines.

670
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,040
 They put in a sequence of events that led the bomb to being less powerful.

671
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,200
 Moving the kids closer to the window.

672
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,720
 More importantly, giving the kids hope that everything was going to be okay by seeing their

673
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,680
 angelic protectors above them.

674
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:15,080
 And honestly, I think maybe an angel was the one who threw Doris' body on the grass.

675
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,280
 Doesn't sound super angelic.

676
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,160
 The angel's like, take that.

677
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,680
 But you know what I mean?

678
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,720
 In the end, even Doris was being saved.

679
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,600
 In the end, Doris, yeah, she was a despicable human being.

680
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,720
 She shouldn't have went along with the plan at all.

681
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:39,120
 But the angel saw some sort of grace in her to spare her body from the burning embers of

682
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
 that school room.

683
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
 I didn't care about David.

684
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,400
 I didn't care about David.

685
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,320
 But carried Doris out.

686
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,960
 There's so much school violence, not just in America, but around the world for all sorts

687
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
 of different reasons.

688
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,560
 They're all terrible reasons, but there's all sorts of different motivations would be

689
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,160
 the right word.

690
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,680
 It happens so often that a lot of times we forget about it.

691
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,440
 Maybe that's the way it should be.

692
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,980
 Maybe we shouldn't want to remember these things because it can glorify the people who

693
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,560
 commit them.

694
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,540
 But at the same time, stories like this give us hope, where a man and his wife bring a

695
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:20,400
 bomb into a school and not a single hostage is killed, even though the bomb is detonated.

696
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,280
 It's a tragic event, it's horrific, and we all hope it never happens again anywhere.

697
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,000
 We all know that it will, unfortunately, though.

698
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,660
 We all know that it will.

699
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,080
 That school violence will continue.

700
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,600
 But stories like this give us at least a glimmer of hope that even in those darkest moments,

701
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:46,040
 when you can see nothing but the flicker of flames on the walls around you, there is a

702
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,840
 guardian angel beside you leading you to the safety of light.

703
00:34:51,840 --> 00:35:10,840
 [Music]

704
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:30,840
 [Music]

705
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,420
 (upbeat music)

706
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,000
 (upbeat music)
