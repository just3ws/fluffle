1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
 A woman heads off to the hospital to have her asthma treated.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,180
 Instead, she becomes a medical freak.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,740
 Then, what would you do if you were out running around with your dog in the middle of nowhere

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,140
 and he fell off a cliff?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,420
 Okay, that has a good ending.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,260
 That's just not the end of the story.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,620
 Don't want to give it away, but the dog does not continue a descent down 60 feet of cliffside.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,900
 The dog is okay.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:34,860
 And then we take a look at the story of a young mother and her son trying to evade alien abduction.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,180
 But it turns out they'll get you, no matter what.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,900
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:48,740
 [Music]

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,620
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,620
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,620
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,620
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,300
 Hope you guys have some fun plans for this fun upcoming weekend.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,820
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our newest Patreon supporters coming into

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,940
 Dead Rabbit Command with a big old smile on their face.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,940
 It's Lansing Loki.

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,500
 Everyone give a round of applause to Lansing Loki.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,300
 I'm laughing because I imagine it's Loki just getting just getting speared in the side.

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,140
 But I'm sure that's not what the name means.

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,180
 Lansing, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,540
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,540
 That's fine too.

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,260
 Help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,540
 And also don't forget guys, I have my TikTok @DeadRabbitRadio on TikTok.

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,140
 Now we're doing a lot of cool stuff there as well.

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,660
 So I'm trying to get them pushed out to Instagram and Twitter and things like that.

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,300
 I'll probably end up getting them on YouTube as well.

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,940
 I just don't want to pollute my YouTube channel.

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,100
 I don't want to give you guys too much content.

34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
 That makes sense.

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,100
 You're shaking your head like, "No, Jason, it doesn't.

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,100
 We want all the content."

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,620
 Lansing, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

38
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,260
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,780
 We are headed out to Pirano, Italy.

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:06,660
 And I wanted to give a shout out to Twitter user @DreathersCA, a long time listener of

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,940
 Dead Rabbit Radio, veteran of the Dead Rabbit Minecraft server.

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,300
 They actually recommended this story to me.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
 This is an edit in.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
 I forgot to give them credit.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
 I didn't see it in my notes.

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,020
 And @DreathersCA recommended this story.

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,380
 Thank you so much for sending this over to me, bro.

48
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,740
 It's March 8th, 1934.

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,420
 And we're at the Pirano Hospital.

50
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,140
 So there's a bunch of doctors walking around and nurses, and they're looking at clipboards

51
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,700
 and stuff like that.

52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,660
 And this woman gets wheeled in.

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,940
 And her name is Anna Morano.

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
 And she walks in.

55
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,860
 When I said she was wheeled in, I didn't actually say how she traveled.

56
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,940
 She's hovering around.

57
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,540
 Anna Monaro, 42 year old mother of 12.

58
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,940
 It's quite the feat.

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,580
 Mother of 12 and also an asthma patient.

60
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,780
 That's nothing to brag about.

61
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,020
 That's not a feat.

62
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,020
 That's a disability.

63
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
 She's an asthma patient.

64
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,020
 And she's in the hospital because of her asthma.

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,900
 And because she has 12 kids and she just needed a break.

66
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,260
 She's like, oh no, I'm getting sick again as the dishes are piling up.

67
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,900
 She's like, oh my asthma, I can't breathe.

68
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,700
 So she's at the hospital and all the doctors are like, oh, it's just another asthma patient.

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,580
 You know, in 1934, I'm sure asthma was like closer to a death sentence.

70
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,540
 Today it's just a minor inconvenience.

71
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,140
 If you're like in a zombie movie and you have asthma, you have to spend like 15 minutes

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,180
 of the zombie movie getting just one inhaler and that'll last you the rest of the apocalypse.

73
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,140
 All these movies are like, oh, we got to go get the inhaler.

74
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,500
 Anyways, in 1934, you didn't have to worry about zombies.

75
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 It could kill you.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,580
 She's in the hospital.

77
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,060
 She's having asthma.

78
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,380
 And the doctors and the nurses are just kind of walking around.

79
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,260
 And they notice something when they walk by her room.

80
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,380
 [MAKES SOUNDS OF THE B

81
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:57,380
 Now they don't hear anything, they don't hear anything, they don't hear anything, they don't hear anything, but that was a sound effect since it's a sound effect since it's a podcast. As they're walking by her room they would see these bright blue flashes and they would see these bright blue flashes in the darkness of her room.

82
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:07,380
 in the darkness of her room and they're like super weird.

83
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,380
 She's wide awake and a bright blue flashes are emanating from her chest.

84
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,380
 She's wide awake and bright blue flashes are emanating from her chest.

85
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,380
 She's like what is that. I was hoping you could tell me.

86
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,380
 I was hoping you could tell me because I'm trying to sleep and this woke me up.

87
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,380
 It's so bright it woke me up.

88
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,380
 The doctors could tell she was covered in blankets and they could see through the blankets.

89
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,380
 these bright blue flashes.

90
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,380
 would glow for about 3 seconds super super super bright.

91
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,380
 Sometimes they would have different shapes.

92
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,380
 Sometimes they would see a circle, sometimes it would be a cone, sometimes it would be a cone, sometimes it would be a different beam.

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,380
 But no matter what the shape or they were all neon blue.

94
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,380
 Neon blue is pretty dope.

95
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:07,380
 This is something that happened one night and one day back in 1934 when I was a nurse.

96
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,380
 I saw this. This was an ongoing thing. This was in the newspaper.

97
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,380
 Doctors were checking her out and they could tell that she was relatively healthy.

98
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,380
 I mean being hospitalized for the asthma.

99
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,380
 But when her body started shooting out these beams of light, her breathing and her heart rate doubled.

100
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
 Afterwards she appeared exhausted.

101
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
 She said they asked her so is this normal?

102
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,380
 I mean we know it's not normal for human beings to project a light.

103
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
 Human beams get it?

104
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,380
 She and the other doctor.

105
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
 The doctor is like trying to write stuff on the clipboard.

106
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,380
 He's like stop it. You're messing up my handwriting.

107
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,380
 We know that human beams can't shoot out beams but do you ever do this at home?

108
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
 And she goes no. I've never ever.

109
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,380
 I mean I think it would have went to the doctor earlier if I was having beams shoot out of my body.

110
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,380
 She said no. I've never had this happen before. It's only since I've been here.

111
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,380
 But she does remember something.

112
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,380
 She does remember something.

113
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,380
 This is what's weird.

114
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,380
 So doctors say hey has this ever happened to you before?

115
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,380
 She said no.

116
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:15,380
 But then she goes but now that you mention it, I don't glow when I'm home but I have a vague memory when I was 7 years old.

117
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,380
 Traveling to the local doctor.

118
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,380
 I mean if she was 42 in 1934, she would have been 7 years old.

119
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,380
 She would have been 7 years old a long time before that.

120
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,380
 So we're talking like late 1800s.

121
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,380
 She remembers traveling to the local doctor and she's just a kid.

122
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,380
 She's just 7 so she doesn't really know what's going on.

123
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,380
 And she remembers a conversation between her doctor and her parents.

124
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,380
 And the conversation was basically...

125
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,380
 He think you would have mentioned this the first time the doctor goes this is a 7 and 0.

126
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,380
 She goes I remember a conversation as a child, my parents and my doctor talking about me glowing.

127
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,380
 But I didn't really think anything of it at the time.

128
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,380
 I don't really remember what the context was.

129
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
 And then I've gone all these years.

130
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,380
 I've gone and let Jason do math 35 years without glowing.

131
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
 And now here I am I'm glowing again.

132
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,380
 Scientists, doctors and clergy from all over the region came to visit her.

133
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,380
 They all said the same thing.

134
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
 They said "Mom, am I?"

135
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
 This is not possible, but it was.

136
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
 People are seeing her glow.

137
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,380
 So this news gets out that she has this weird...

138
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,380
 Would you even classify it as an ability?

139
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
 It's like almost like a passive.

140
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,380
 Like there's no functional use to it.

141
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,380
 It's not like you would ever be able to use it in a fight or even use it to like find your keys at night.

142
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:39,380
 Because the bright lights are so sudden and they're gone quickly.

143
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
 It's like what would it be?

144
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,380
 It would just be kind of this weird thing.

145
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,380
 But the doctors are like letting everyone know they're totally gossiping about this moment's medical record.

146
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,380
 This is the reason why Hippolaws were created because of this case.

147
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,380
 Scientists and doctors and even clergymen from all over the region were coming to visit good old Anna.

148
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,380
 And she also says, "Okay, so the glowing thing I'm not really familiar with.

149
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,380
 However, I do have the ability to see ghosts.

150
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,380
 I'm in the hospital, so there's an awful lot of them."

151
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,380
 She also said, these are powers, right? Ability to see ghosts. That's pretty cool.

152
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:20,380
 But she also said she could see battles thousands of miles away while they were happening.

153
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:27,380
 And considering she lived in the late 1800s to the, at this point, 1934,

154
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
 there was an awful lot of battles for her to watch.

155
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,380
 Be like her own private Netflix, but she can't change the channel and real humans are dying.

156
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,380
 These bright lights went on for about three weeks while she was in the hospital.

157
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,380
 And eventually they just stopped and the doctors were like,

158
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,380
 "Okay, okay, you've been cured. Your asthma is just something you're gonna have to deal with,

159
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,380
 but we wanted to keep you around it. Take a look at these lights."

160
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,380
 Now, Anna was in this hospital the whole time and they didn't have social media.

161
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,380
 They really had media. They just had newspapers. They didn't have like television or something like that.

162
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:04,380
 I don't think they brought in a big radio so she could listen to, you know, like Harry Carver's trumpet noise, whatever band.

163
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,380
 So she gets out of the hospital and she learns very quickly she's a celebrity.

164
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:16,380
 Everyone, everyone knows that her boobs glow blue.

165
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,380
 And that really disturbed her. That really, really kind of freaked her out because she starts getting hounded.

166
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,380
 She starts getting hounded by blue boob brigade.

167
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,380
 Like you would want, you, on the one hand you want to respect people's privacy,

168
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,380
 but on the other hand, someone has the ability to shoot beams out of their body.

169
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,380
 You kind of want to see what's up, but she kind of disappeared in history after that.

170
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,380
 We really don't have any news of if this ability returned or how long she lived after that.

171
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,380
 At least I couldn't find. But here is the interesting footnote to this whole thing.

172
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,380
 "If the glowing human bodies wasn't enough for you, apparently there is film of this happening.

173
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,380
 Someone broke out an old film cam. Back then it was a brand new film camera.

174
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:06,380
 They're like, "Whoa, it's state of the art." And they recorded this on film, her glowing boobs.

175
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,380
 But it's lost media at this point. No one knows where it is, who has it, how long it lasted.

176
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,380
 It was Italy pre-World War II, so it could have gotten bombed to pieces.

177
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,380
 Could be sitting in some doctor's private collection. It could be in an attic somewhere.

178
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:31,380
 Just forgotten. But yeah, lost media. There is film footage of Anna Monaro with glowing blue boobs.

179
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:39,380
 But it's probably black and white, so... But again, you're like, "Jason, you can clearly see the woman's glowing."

180
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,380
 You're complaining that it's not neon blue? The woman's obviously glowing.

181
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,380
 But anyway, so that is a really cool story. I even wanted to tell that one.

182
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,380
 I actually started that one twice last season and wasn't able to get around for it.

183
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,380
 And I got that story from the Forty and Map. That's something we like to refer to on this podcast.

184
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,380
 I put that in the show notes if you want to look more at the weird events around the world.

185
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,380
 Lansing, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

186
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:11,380
 We are leaving behind Italy. We are going to row all the way out to Ontario, Canada.

187
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:22,380
 We row all the way out to Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we're headed to Alagonquin Park in Ontario, Canada.

188
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,380
 It's like a nature reserve. And we're walking around. We got our walking sticks. We're singing a jaunty tune.

189
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,380
 We're scared there's a bird watchers coming. They're like, "Dude, quit singing."

190
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,380
 You're making all the blue jays go away. They're jealous of your amazing singing voice.

191
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,380
 We're walking through even louder now because we know it's messing with the bird watchers.

192
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,380
 The reason why we're really not here to be bullies, the reason why we're here is I came across this story recently.

193
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:53,380
 Let's say this guy's name is Marcus. We don't have an actual name for him or a date or a time or any of this stuff.

194
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,380
 That makes this story legitimate. We don't have that. But let's talk about it.

195
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,380
 I think this is an interesting story. Marcus is on a family trip with the family dog.

196
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:10,380
 He's a little boy at this time. He has an older brother. He has his parents. And then little Marcus is walking.

197
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:19,380
 And their dog, let's call him Timmy, is a runner. Running around, running around.

198
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:28,380
 And Marcus would say Timmy would run all the way to the end of the trail. All the way to the end of the Appalachian Trail.

199
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,380
 So he'd run down the trail, then he'd run back and run past the family and run back down to where they were

200
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,380
 and just kind of run around and kind of jump and just a really fun, exciting running dog.

201
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,380
 But at one point, as they're walking to the trail, the trail actually stops.

202
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,380
 And there's like a lookout where you can sit and you can go, "Whoa, dude, look at all these trees."

203
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,380
 Well, that was more of a three hour hike. I guess we're going to go back home.

204
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,380
 Anyways, people do have a lot of fun and enjoyment on that. Whoa, look at this view.

205
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:06,380
 They get to the edge, there's this lookout. And Marcus and his brother are standing on the edge going, "Whoa, look at all these trees."

206
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,380
 "Whoa, there's another one. Dude, if I turn left, will there be slightly more trees over here?" There are.

207
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,380
 And Timmy has run all the way back. It's hanging out, running down the trail.

208
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,380
 And Timmy sees the two boys standing at the lookout and runs as fast as it can.

209
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:29,380
 And Timmy runs, Timmy doesn't realize that the trail ends and it's just a spot to take in nature.

210
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:39,380
 Timmy runs off of the trail. It's running so fast, it runs off of the trail and falls off a cliff.

211
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,380
 And it's a 60 foot drop. And the kids are freaking out, right?

212
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,380
 Because they assume that they were looking at all these trees.

213
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,380
 They assume they're going to look down and they're going to see that Timmy is not in the best shape.

214
00:13:51,380 --> 00:14:01,380
 But out of just a weird set of circumstances, as they look down, Timmy found the smallest ledge possible.

215
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,380
 It was actually like a Timmy-sized little ledge that you wouldn't even see if you were looking down.

216
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,380
 And the dog landed right on that. He fell about 10 feet and landed on this ledge.

217
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,380
 And then after that, there's another 50 foot drop now to the bottom of this cliff.

218
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,380
 And the boys are like, "Oh, great. What are we going to do?" Because our dog--

219
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:26,380
 10 feet is still on a cliff face, is still pretty far, and there's a dog at the bottom of it.

220
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,380
 How are you going to get this dog up?

221
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:36,380
 And Timmy is perfectly like motionless. Timmy knows, "I messed up. I shouldn't have been running so much. I'm never running again."

222
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:42,380
 Perfectly motionless on this ledge. Marcus says, "What happens then?" It's like out of the blue.

223
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,380
 A man appears on the trail behind them, and he has full climbing gear on.

224
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,380
 We didn't see him walking before. He's walking down the trail he has full climbing gear on.

225
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,380
 And this area he says that he's in-- he goes, "This specific area didn't have a lot of climbing locations."

226
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:08,380
 But here a guy was. He was walking by full climbing gear. He walks up to the lookout, looks down, sees the dog, begins setting up his gear,

227
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:16,380
 and he repels down, grabs the dog, and climbs back up, and then walks away.

228
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:25,380
 And he said the man didn't even stay long enough to give his name. He just rescued the dog and continued on his journey down the trail.

229
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:32,380
 An interesting story. Now you go, Jason, the obvious answer is that everything was there. That there was a guy climbing,

230
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:40,380
 and he saw a dog, and he went down, and he was quite rude. He doesn't like giving his name. Maybe he's a fugitive from the law.

231
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:48,380
 And that's obvious. That's the most likely answer. But it's also weird. It gives you that sense of being in the right place at the right time.

232
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,380
 And let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

233
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:03,380
 What if you're not there at the right place at the right time? Like, you're just not. So time makes you be there.

234
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:10,380
 You're like, "Jason, that's the same thing." No. No, listen up. So listen to me. Listen to me. Don't shut off the podcast.

235
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
 Don't shut off the podcast. I'm ordering you not to.

236
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:21,380
 Imagine that this trail was here, and the dog ran off. First off, the dog landing on the 10-foot ledge is...

237
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,380
 The ledge that was only 10 feet down is a miracle in and of itself, because this dog did seem quite stupid.

238
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:35,380
 But once it landed on the ledge, it realized the predicament it was in. But you have this situation where you have this dog that's on the 10-foot ledge.

239
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,380
 They're in the middle of nowhere. And how are they going to get this dog?

240
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:47,380
 And so then time goes, we need a person here. And then a man... I'm not saying the man magically appeared.

241
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,380
 I'm saying the man existed in a different universe. That's more believable, right?

242
00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:04,380
 I'm saying what if there was a man walking with climbing gear around Alagonquin Park, and then somewhere where he was going to go climbing,

243
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:12,380
 and then someone else, somewhere else, a dog falls off a cliff, and then reality takes that man and puts him there.

244
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,380
 Like, you know what I mean? Like, what if reality works like that?

245
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,380
 So when we think we're in the right place at the right time, we're actually in the wrong place at the right time.

246
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,380
 But then reality crumples, so that's what puts us in the right place at the right time.

247
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,380
 It's not some sort of dumb luck. It's not even fate. It's actually a correction in the universe.

248
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:42,380
 I was actually sitting at home eating Cheerios and watching Dream on YouTube, and then I'm pulling someone out of a burning car.

249
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:49,380
 And it's not like I think, wow, that's weird. I thought I was just eating Cheerios and watching Dream on YouTube.

250
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:56,380
 Time completely changed, so that's what I was doing. But then once this car was going to get in this accident,

251
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,380
 time goes, no, no, no, no, no. And then it made me wake up a little bit earlier and go, you know what?

252
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 I should go out for a jog. It's something I've never said throughout my 44 years of living,

253
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,380
 but this day I will go for a jog and I'm jogging. I find a quarter on the ground and it's rolling,

254
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,380
 and I keep chasing it. I keep chasing it because I'm Scrooge McDuck.

255
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,380
 And then a car gets in an accident because it's trying to avoid me grabbing this quarter.

256
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,380
 And they're like, oh no, look out. Scrooge McDuck and they crash, and then I pull the guy out of the burn wheel.

257
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:35,380
 You know what I mean? Like, what if that's it? You're like, you know, you know, hold that from the story.

258
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:43,380
 Of a man. The story's about a man who rescued a dog. And the only thing that's weird about it is that he's in an area

259
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,380
 that doesn't have a lot of climbing and he didn't give his name. There's real...

260
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:56,380
 I got this story from a nom alien. It is a paranormal website. I didn't find this on like Reader's Digest.

261
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,380
 I didn't find this on some normie grandpa website. And go, that sounds paranormal.

262
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,380
 I did find it on a paranormal website, but I guess really the only thing that's paranormal about it

263
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,380
 is that he was in an area that's not known for climbing and he didn't give his name.

264
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:20,380
 But anyway, so I do think it's an interesting story, but it might be less interesting than I made it out to be.

265
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:28,380
 Are you guys glad this podcast is back in production? This podcast is... it's like pure chaos sometimes.

266
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:37,380
 But I very much enjoyed. Okay. Lansing Loki. We are leaving behind Canada. We're leaving...

267
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:44,380
 We are headed out to... I'm going to touch the keys of the Carbenter Cofter. We are headed out to Kiev in the Ukraine.

268
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,380
 Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

269
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:56,380
 As we're flying out there, I want to give you guys a really quick Dead Ravva Recommends. I encourage you guys to watch this movie this weekend.

270
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:04,380
 It's a work of storytelling art. It's a werewolf movie. I'm not a huge fan of werewolves. It's a newer movie.

271
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:13,380
 It's called The Wolf of Snow Hollow and it is written, directed and starring Jim Cummings.

272
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,380
 That's always a bad sign. I'm going to say Jim Cummings is a bad sign.

273
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,380
 But whenever you have a movie that's written, directed and starring, it's usually a bad sign.

274
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:32,380
 But Jim Cummings expertly navigates this story. This is not a promo read. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

275
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:38,380
 It's a standard creature feature. But it starts off as a horror movie.

276
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,380
 Maybe 15 minutes into it, it becomes a horror comedy movie. A laugh out loud comedy.

277
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:53,380
 And then maybe 20 minutes after that, it becomes a horror comedy drama. Like, hard drama.

278
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:01,380
 And Jim Cummings expertly balances all three. Horror comedy alone is very hard to pull off.

279
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:11,380
 You can really list the good ones on one hand. But Jim Cummings in The Wolf of Snow Hollow is expertly able to balance these three things.

280
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:21,380
 And we're talking dark horror. What this werewolf is doing to the women of this town is disgusting.

281
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,380
 And what's interesting is they don't show it, but they talk about it, which makes it even worse.

282
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:33,380
 Because then your imagination fills in the gaps. And then the next scene, you're laughing out loud.

283
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:40,380
 Expertly balanced. I recommend it to anyone who's into creature features. It's one of the best movies I've seen of that genre.

284
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:46,380
 And I recommend it to anyone who has a love of film and a love of storytelling. Because this is art.

285
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:53,380
 This is a movie that I watch and I go, I could write for 100 years, I would never be able to tell a story like this.

286
00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:02,380
 The story itself is a genre piece about werewolves, but the craft behind it is so good.

287
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,380
 Really good. It's available on Amazon for a couple bucks. You can rent it. The Wolf of Snow Hollow.

288
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,380
 Dead Rabbit recommends The Wolf of Snow Hollow. You won't be disappointed.

289
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:19,380
 Lansing Loki is piloting the Scarbenter copter over Kiev, Ukraine. The year is 1991. It's a little after midnight.

290
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,380
 [Demonic voice]

291
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,380
 Natalia Urbano is asleep with her nine-year-old son in the bedroom. She wakes up.

292
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:36,380
 There's a little night light in her bedroom. Just a dim light that allows her son to get to sleep easier.

293
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,380
 Her bedroom door opens up to a long hallway that's in their house.

294
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:51,380
 She wakes up and she's looking down the hallway and she sees a new light, not just the dull night light coming from her own room.

295
00:22:51,380 --> 00:23:00,380
 She sees a fireball roll down her hallway.

296
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,380
 And then another one.

297
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,380
 And then a third.

298
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:17,380
 She thinks immediately ball lightning. I mean, she's not like, "Oh, boring, just ball lightning. Just things that can kill me when they touch me. Lame."

299
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,380
 It still alarms her, but she's not thinking anything paranormal. She thinks what she's seen is ball lightning.

300
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:30,380
 But then she looks down the hallway and she sees there's a man standing there.

301
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:42,380
 He's a man wearing a gray, well-tailored suit, necktie glasses, typical bureaucrat, stereotypical man in a suit image.

302
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,380
 But he is the one who is throwing the fireballs down the hallway.

303
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,380
 That's not something you associate with any businessman.

304
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:04,380
 The stranger approaches her with a grin and says, "Well, so, let's go."

305
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:11,380
 And she begins to freak out, not just because there's a stranger in her house, not just because he has the ability to throw fireballs at her,

306
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:18,380
 but she realizes what's going on. She's about to get abducted. She's about to get taken away.

307
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:25,380
 And she begins to plead with this figure, "I'm not ready to go yet. I'm not ready to go." And she's clutching her little son and she doesn't want to leave.

308
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:33,380
 She doesn't know where she's going. Is this a harbinger of death? Is this some sort of alien encounter or interdimensional entity? She doesn't know.

309
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,380
 She's not Peter Texas? And this is the way they handle that in the Ukraine? She doesn't know.

310
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:50,380
 But then the man in the gray suit simply says, "Okay, I'll take him." He motions towards her son.

311
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:59,380
 She freaks out and begins holding her son tightly. "No, I won't let him go. Not without me." Is her exact quote?

312
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:10,380
 "I won't let him go. Not without me." Suddenly, she, Natalia, is standing outside of her own body.

313
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:22,380
 So she is now, for all intents and purposes, astrally projecting. She's standing in her room and she sees herself clutching her nine-year-old son

314
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:30,380
 and the man in the gray suit standing in the bedroom. And she is a third party to what is going on.

315
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:42,380
 Watching her own body, watching her own body hold her son, she then begins to see a mirror image of that.

316
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:57,380
 What she sees is her...she is being split in two. She is standing there and she is watching her own body, Natalia, holding her son.

317
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:09,380
 And that image is being...it's like pulling Taffy apart. She can see Natalia and the child rise out of Natalia and the child.

318
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:22,380
 There are now two duplicate images of her and her kid, but one is floating out of the other.

319
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:32,380
 And Natalia's soul is standing elsewhere in the room. She's seeing herself and her child being ripped apart like Taffy,

320
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,380
 but then both pieces of Taffy become mirror images of each other.

321
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,380
 Then the man in the gray suit simply goes, "Okay, next time."

322
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:51,380
 Shrugs his shoulders. The next thing Natalia knows, she is clutching her son tightly, laying in bed.

323
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 The only illumination coming from her child's nightlight.

324
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,380
 I got that story from ThinkAboutAtDucks.com. They got it from 40 in Times Magazine. It's one of the best re--

325
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:10,380
 This podcast will not exist without 40 in Times. I read that magazine growing up. It's pricey. It's from Britain.

326
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,380
 If it's here in Britain, it's cheap. If you're in Europe, it's relatively cheap.

327
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,380
 But anywhere else, it is really worth the subscription price.

328
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,380
 A fascinating story. And when I first read it, I had an idea of what was going on.

329
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,380
 And it's the same idea--because I read the story a while ago. It's actually been sitting in my research folder for a while.

330
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:33,380
 And when I just read it again the other day, I said, "Yeah, I still get the same feeling from this story."

331
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:40,380
 The man in the gray suit shows up and he's there to take Natalia. And she refuses. And then he takes--goes to take the son.

332
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,380
 And she says, "Not without me." She is then removed from her physical body. Her spirit is.

333
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,380
 And then she sees herself get duplicated and pulled apart.

334
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:56,380
 My feeling--and you--we'll get to--we'll get to the rebuttal on this in a second.

335
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:03,380
 But my feeling is she was abducted and her son was abducted, but not--

336
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,380
 I'm trying to think how to say it. So I think she was duplicated.

337
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,380
 But it's not like a clone. It's--we as human beings have such ideas of the singular.

338
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,380
 I think it is hard for us to understand stuff like alternate realities, because we think which one's the real us.

339
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:29,380
 I know even when they do, like, television shows, I know in Star Trek Voyager, spoiler alert, but Harry Kim, this character got killed off in the main universe.

340
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:35,380
 But then the Harry Kim from an alternate universe in the same episode came to our universe, or the Voyager universe.

341
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,380
 People got really upset about that. And they said it's not the real Harry Kim.

342
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:45,380
 And I--first thing, these characters are real, right? They're fictional, but it is the real Harry Kim.

343
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:53,380
 It is. It is the real Harry Kim. We have a hard time thinking about if in Avengers Infinity War, if Spider-Man got snapped away--

344
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,380
 if Peter Parker got snapped away in an endgame, it turned out no, he really did get snapped away.

345
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,380
 The new Spider-Man is simply from an alternate universe where Tony Stark got snapped away and not Spider-Man.

346
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,380
 People would have been really upset, even though it's the same character simply from an alternate--

347
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:16,380
 that's what I thought they were gonna do. I thought the snap actually happened, but they were gonna combine with the universe where the snap killed off the other 50%.

348
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,380
 I thought that would have been cool, but people would have been really upset about that, 'cause they would have said it's not the real characters, da-da-da-da.

349
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:29,380
 We have a hard time dealing with stuff when we think of singular stuff as multiples. It really kind of breaks the human brain.

350
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,380
 What I'm saying is she's not cloned.

351
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:41,380
 And Kevin Feige, if you like my ideas, you can hit me up. I got tons of new Marvel ideas as well, but her soul was removed from her body, and she could see what was happening.

352
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,380
 And her soul being removed from her body, Natalia, here, might have just been a byproduct of this.

353
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,380
 You had Natalia 1 and her son, number 1, and as they're getting pulled apart, you have Natalia 2 and son, number 2.

354
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,380
 But once they're completely separated, you have Natalia 1 and you have Natalia 1.

355
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,380
 And then you have the soul in the room who is also Natalia 1.

356
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,380
 And Natalia gets abducted, but Natalia is also remains on Earth.

357
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,380
 Because that's what the grey-suited man wanted.

358
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:21,380
 Now, you could say he does go, "Okay, next time," and everything returns to "normal" when you have a guy throwing fireballs at you, but...

359
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,380
 What is next time to a creature that has a sort of ability?

360
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:32,380
 Did he decide to give up and not abduct her, even though he's going through all this effort of separating these people into different forms?

361
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:39,380
 Or was the phrase "Okay, next time" a way for her to explain what would happen next, going back to "normal"?

362
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:46,380
 My hypothesis is that Natalia and her son were not only abducted that day, they are still abducted.

363
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,380
 And this may go for every alien abduction story.

364
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,380
 The stories where the people go on these ships and they meet these aliens and then they say, "Well, then the aliens dropped me off."

365
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,380
 Did they?

366
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,380
 Or do you remember being dropped off? You are dropped off.

367
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:12,380
 But at the same time, not your clone, not your double, you are still being experimented on, on some alien starship.

368
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:18,380
 Or your meat have already been fed to some exotic alien creature on another world.

369
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,380
 I mean, hopefully that hasn't happened.

370
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:28,380
 But how do we know that the people who are getting off the ships, the people who are having these interactions with aliens,

371
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:36,380
 we know that they're having that because they're telling us these stories, but who's to say that they're also not still trapped on these ships?

372
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:43,380
 I mean, it's obviously really kind of a heady thing to think about, but this is the first story that I can recall

373
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,380
 where we can see the person being split during an abduction encounter.

374
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:54,380
 We've had people interact with clones, but what was up with these bodies being split?

375
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:05,380
 My hypothesis was the man in the gray suit took what he wanted and also left what needed to be left.

376
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:14,380
 And I'd say 99.9% of the time this stuff happens and it's only because Natalia, for whatever reason, I think this was probably a bug, not a feature,

377
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:20,380
 she stepped outside of her body and she saw what was going on.

378
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:26,380
 So is it possible that all alien encounters end poorly? All of them.

379
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:34,380
 But because reality is split, not even reality split, because the abductee is split and is left on earth,

380
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:43,380
 we hear the story, oh no, they just want to talk about peace and love and things like that, but in reality, they are trapped.

381
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,380
 They are abducted, they are experimented on, they are tortured, they are analyzed, they are psychologically abused

382
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,380
 for as long as the aliens can keep them alive.

383
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:02,380
 And you can't say that person's the other and the person on earth is the real one or the person on earth is the real one and they're the same person.

384
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,380
 Now it's possible that not every alien encounter ends like this. This may be the bug, not the feature.

385
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:19,380
 Most alien encounters may be peaceful, but if even one encounter could make it seem like you got away,

386
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:29,380
 but in reality you are imprisoned, if only one of those encounters are true, that should be horrifying enough.

387
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:35,380
 So as you go to sleep tonight, you might want to leave on your own nightlight.

388
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:42,380
 But one that gives off a little more illumination than the one Natalia's son had.

389
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,380
 Because who knows what is standing at the end of your long dark hallway.

390
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,380
 It may be nothing, it may simply be your imagination.

391
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,380
 Or there may be an alien invader at the end of that hallway,

392
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:06,380
 ready to prove to you that reality is what they command it to be.
