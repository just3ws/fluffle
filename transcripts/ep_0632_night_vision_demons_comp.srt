1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 We all know the story about a meteorite hitting Earth, killing off all the dinosaurs.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,000
 But did it do something even more spectacular?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,200
 Then we travel to Cuba to take a look at Castro's bizarre obsession with ice cream.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,500
 It drove him so mad that dairy products were better in other countries, he actually broke

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,420
 science to create the perfect cow.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,320
 And then we travel to Vietnam to see if there's any truth to the rumor that back during the

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,120
 Vietnam War, US soldiers were outfitted with experimental night vision goggles.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,160
 These goggles didn't just let them see their enemies in the dark, it also let them see

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
 the demons that inhabit the world today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:57,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,920
 Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, we got a lot of stuff to cover so first off,

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,220
 let's introduce one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,320
 Writing on the back of a Saint Bernard puppy, it's Desu, everyone give a round of applause

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
 for Desu, Desu apparently can fit on a puppy.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,080
 He is writing in, Desu you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode, if you guys

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,240
 can't support the Patreon or if you guys can't fit on the back of puppies, which I assume

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,600
 is 99% of you, that's fine too, just help spread the word about the show, really really

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
 helps out a lot.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,080
 Desu we're gonna pick you up off the puppy and we're gonna put you in the pilot seat

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,520
 of the Dead Rabbit Rocket ship.

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,040
 We're gonna leave behind Earth's atmosphere here and we're going back in time so Desu

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,520
 take control, hit that little time travel button and blast us off.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:50,160
 I came across this the other day, but it happened 66 million years ago so it took a

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,920
 while for me to get the news.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,280
 The rocket ship is launching us up in the air and back in time, specifically we're going

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,920
 back 66 million years.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,440
 We're watching the planet Earth beneath us and we see this giant asteroid coming close

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,040
 to Earth.

30
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,240
 The asteroid we all saw, that great documentary Armageddon, we know what's gonna happen, right?

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,480
 This asteroid is going to, did they talk about Armageddon actually?

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
 Armageddon or Deep Impact or Dressing Park or one of them?

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
 I think Armageddon started off 65 million years ago, I remember laughing out loud in

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
 the theater, it's one of those movies.

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,560
 I remember when I watched Deep Impact there was a rat rotting behind the screen, so that's

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,680
 what I remember about Deep Impact, that there was a dead rat in the movie theater.

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,480
 Armageddon just wasn't good, wasn't good all around.

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,840
 Dead rat or not.

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,760
 But anyways, we're watching this giant asteroid come.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,200
 Now this asteroid is actually larger than Mount Everest, it's just massive.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,840
 Now recently on Twitter there is this book excerpt that was going around.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,080
 It was a book called The Inns of the World, Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans and Our

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,000
 Quest to Understand Earth's Past Mass Extinctions.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,680
 It was written by Peter Brannon.

45
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,480
 And so I haven't read the book, but I read the tweet.

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,560
 I read the passage and that's what we're going to be focused on.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,800
 The rest of the book is maybe good, I don't know.

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,040
 But this tweet sure was.

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,640
 So anyways, we're watching this giant asteroid, this planet killer, coming into the atmosphere.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
 This is what this tweet explained.

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,480
 The asteroid was so massive that when it hit the earth, the tip of the asteroid was higher

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,840
 than a 747 flies.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
 It was a mile higher.

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,720
 I look back over at my notes, it wasn't just as high as a 747.

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,120
 It was a mile higher than a 747 flies.

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,800
 So I mean, it boggles the brain to think how big this was.

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,760
 And it was moving so quickly and it was so large that normally asteroids break up in

58
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
 the atmosphere and they become shooting stars and they all kind of fizzle out.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,380
 This didn't happen.

60
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,640
 This thing penetrated the atmosphere.

61
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,040
 The atmosphere actually just moved out of the way.

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,080
 It was like a bouncer at a mafia club and he's like, "Okay, sir, you can go ahead,

63
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,360
 you can just walk in."

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,760
 The atmosphere just moved out of the way and just parted as this thing punched into the

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
 earth.

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,400
 It didn't break up in the atmosphere, it actually punched the planet.

67
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,520
 Now because there was a huge hole in the atmosphere for a brief moment and this thing hits and

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
 that hole is still there.

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:38,680
 When it kicked up dirt and debris and foliage and animals, some of them from the sheer impact

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,760
 of this left the planet.

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,880
 Now we've seen those simulations, I'm sure you've seen them, I'll try to find one for

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,520
 the show now, it's actually cool and scary.

73
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,680
 And when a big enough asteroid hits the earth, it'll actually peel off the mantle of the

74
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,280
 planet like you're peeling an orange and it'll actually ripple and it'll completely devastate

75
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,960
 the planet.

76
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,640
 You can have a bunker, it doesn't matter, it's just going to get ripped open.

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,800
 And I've seen that and you can see parts of Paraguay end up in Antarctica because it's

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,640
 just these masses, everything's getting obliterated on the planet.

79
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,760
 But the way they're explaining this one is that when this impacted the planet and because

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,040
 there was that giant hole in the atmosphere because this thing was so huge, parts of our

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,040
 planet left our planet and floated into space.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,840
 And in this book it hypothesizes that there is a possibility, a strong possibility that

83
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
 there are dinosaur bones on the moon.

84
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 Isn't that insane, dude?

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,800
 Now when I read that I thought I'm always amazed by nature's majesty, right?

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,760
 Even though that's absolutely devastating thing, it turned out great for us apes.

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,480
 We took over from you reptilians, all it took was the earth to nearly be obliterated.

88
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,080
 But that's just so fascinating to me, the raw power of the universe.

89
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,840
 That you could have this impact that's actually throwing life forms, they weren't, they

90
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
 cease to be life forms when the meteorite hit.

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,680
 But if you were in the general vicinity of this thing, now this one wasn't so big it

92
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,880
 would peel the mantle back like the example I was using.

93
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,600
 But if you were living in this area, you were dead.

94
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 If you were living, and also it changed the climate and everything, so even if you weren't

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,320
 living in that area, T-Rexes are like "I don't feel so good, I wish I could knit a parka."

96
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
 Wish I knew what a parka was.

97
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,600
 But in this area in the Yucatan I believe is where they think this thing impacted.

98
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,120
 You had a bunch of dinosaurs just get obliterated and some of them flew into space.

99
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,160
 So I think just the raw nature, the raw power of the universe is fascinating.

100
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:54,480
 But then I think, because I'm a conspiracy theorist, nice try Peter Brannon, nice try.

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,120
 Because I thought about this.

102
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,960
 This conspiracy cap fully on, we're putting them on early this episode.

103
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,320
 What if, China is going up to the moon, America wants to go back to the moon to set up a base

104
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,360
 so they can go to Mars, all this stuff.

105
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,480
 We're going to be on the moon a lot and I suspect in the next 30 years.

106
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
 And we're going to find a triceratops skull.

107
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,840
 We're going to find a triceratops skull and people are going to be like "What?

108
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
 What is this?

109
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,760
 Why is there a triceratops skull on the moon?"

110
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,040
 And now people can go "Oh, it's because of the meteorite hit so hard, there's dinosaur

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,560
 bones on the moon and we can show you this tweet."

112
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
 Twitter won't be around in 30 years.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It won't be around in five years probably.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,600
 But they'll have it in a museum, they'll have this tweet in a museum.

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,000
 I started to think maybe this is a cover up to explain why when we start kicking dust

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,400
 around on the moon for serious reasons, building laboratories and things like that, what happens

117
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,160
 when we start finding T-Rex eating a brontosaurus on the moon.

118
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,800
 And then I realized also that when they said there's dinosaur bones on the moon, I don't

119
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
 think they even meant a whole triceratops.

120
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
 I think it was probably like pulverized triceratops bones.

121
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,100
 But again, what happens when we have scientists up on the moon and they start sending back

122
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,280
 their research and they find any sort of bones on the moon?

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,800
 It could be any sort of bone.

124
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,440
 Even if it was pulverized, even if it was a little chunk, could you imagine what the

125
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,200
 conspiracy theorist community like me, like irresponsible people like me would say?

126
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,680
 But apparently there are bones on the moon and they want it to cave, they'd still be

127
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,840
 up there, you could probably find pulverized triceratops bones on the moon.

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,680
 So that's cool scientifically and then when they start revealing that they have found

129
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,440
 bones on the moon, then this will be their cover story.

130
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,760
 When in fact we know the triceratons are on their way.

131
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
 They're first ones just died on the moon.

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,040
 He wasn't a really good pilot.

133
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,360
 Desu, let's go ahead and leave the Dead Rabbit Rocket Ship in orbit and we're going to transfer

134
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,920
 over, do a little space walk into the Dead Rabbit dirger.

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,760
 We'll take us back down to Earth.

136
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,160
 We're leaving behind the icy cold grip of outer space.

137
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,760
 We're headed to Cuba.

138
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
 It's going to be dope.

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,840
 We got on all of our Cuban clothes.

140
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,960
 I don't even know what Cuban clothes are, but we're wearing them and we're like, "Hey,

141
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
 man, really cool Cuban clothes."

142
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
 And I'm like, "I know, right?

143
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,640
 We're smoking Cuban cigars.

144
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,480
 We're watching that amazing film, Dirty Dancing 2, Havana Nights.

145
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,360
 It's on repeat the whole way down."

146
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
 Desu, Desu's hitting the gas.

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
 He's like, "Hurry up.

148
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
 Let's get down there.

149
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
 Hurry up."

150
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
 I've already watched it 10 times.

151
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,120
 We're going to 1966 Cuba and I got all of my information from this story from a article

152
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,280
 written by Simon Chadwick on thewebinairvet.com.

153
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,120
 So thank you, Simon, for writing this article, doing this research.

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,360
 It's 1966.

155
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
 It's Cuba.

156
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,080
 The Dell Castro is firmly in control, but the island is having food shortages.

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,400
 The Soviet Union is kind of synonymous with food shortages and they're considering that

158
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,320
 Cuba aligned themselves with the other country that has constantly failed to feed themselves.

159
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,640
 It shouldn't be any mystery that this is also going on.

160
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,560
 Plus, Castro, because he's aligned with people who had to borrow wheat from their enemy,

161
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,960
 it's not like he could get food from the Soviet Union.

162
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
 But Castro's thinking, "You know what?

163
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,880
 I'm going to make communism work here.

164
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,680
 They didn't make it work over there, but I'm going to make it work here."

165
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,600
 So we need to figure out a way to produce more food.

166
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,800
 And when Fidel Castro, the whole time he's talking about food shortages, there were actual

167
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 food shortages.

168
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,000
 What he really meant was milk shortages, because little did you know Fidel Castro was a milk

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,860
 addict or was a milk addict, because he's passed away now, but he was addicted to milk.

170
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,440
 He was so addicted to dairy products.

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,160
 He started a fight with France over who had better dairy products.

172
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,660
 France is like us, dude.

173
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,720
 What are you talking about?

174
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,400
 Fidel Castro is like, "Taste our cheese.

175
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,240
 Isn't this the best cheese in the world?"

176
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,440
 The French guy's like, "This cheese is okay.

177
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,400
 I don't even think it's the best in the Western hemisphere."

178
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,080
 But then Fidel Castro got mad at him and the French diplomat had to go, "Dude, listen,

179
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,800
 a bunch of countries make cigars.

180
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 You make the best cigars.

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,680
 Who cares if you make good cheese?"

182
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
 Fidel Castro, Fidel Castro cared.

183
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,040
 He really, really hated it that his cheese wasn't better than France.

184
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,400
 Well, he believed it was.

185
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,480
 He also built this giant ice cream palace.

186
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,160
 It wasn't a palace made of ice cream.

187
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,400
 That would be amazing.

188
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,760
 Capitalism would have completely failed if you could build an edible house and everyone

189
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,720
 just lived in edible houses.

190
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,280
 People would be like, "I don't want this free enterprise stuff.

191
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
 Give me the ice cream palace."

192
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,680
 He built an ice cream palace that had ice cream in it.

193
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,960
 And there would be lines around the block to eat this ice cream.

194
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,920
 It had more flavors than Howard Johnson's, which is so meaningless to me nowadays.

195
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,120
 Was Howard Johnson's known for having a bunch of ice cream?

196
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,600
 I thought it was a hotel.

197
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
 I probably have more different flavors than Howard Johnson's.

198
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,040
 What does that even mean?

199
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,320
 He also supposedly ate, every Sunday, 18 scoops of ice cream.

200
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,720
 Can you imagine that?

201
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,200
 I haven't eaten 18 scoops of ice cream in the past year.

202
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,840
 I keep comparing myself to Castro for some reason.

203
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
 I'm like, "What?

204
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 Castro, you suck.

205
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,000
 I don't do that."

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,080
 But he loved dairy products.

207
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,720
 I'm like okay on him.

208
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
 I drink milk maybe once a year when my tummy hurts.

209
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
 And I eat ice cream usually when my tummy hurts too.

210
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,240
 It's a medicine to me.

211
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,160
 But he goes, "Listen, we have a food shortage."

212
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
 Which I mean milk shortage.

213
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,840
 And all of his commanders are like, "Yes, we know what you mean."

214
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,360
 We need to start producing our own milk because we obviously can't import it from the Soviet

215
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,640
 Union and America doesn't like us.

216
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,280
 We're in this cold war with them.

217
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
 So we need to have our own dairy cows.

218
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,080
 Now Cuba actually had cows, but they were meat cows.

219
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
 They were cows that you would eat.

220
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,080
 They weren't cows to be milked.

221
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,200
 They weren't cows bred to be dairy cows.

222
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
 So he goes, "Listen, we're going to build a super cow.

223
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
 We have the technology."

224
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,280
 The commander's like, "We don't have the technology."

225
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,400
 He's like, "Well, we better get the technology because I want dairy cows."

226
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,600
 So they took a Cebu cow and a Holstein cow and they bred them.

227
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,400
 And they were able to do this breeding program.

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,480
 And the goal was by 1971 to have one million super cows.

229
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 Dairy cows.

230
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 He didn't want just dairy cows at this point.

231
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,080
 He wanted the best dairy cows in the world.

232
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,960
 Especially better than France.

233
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,480
 Definitely wanted better than France, but he wanted to show everyone what's what.

234
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,960
 By 1972, the program had been successful in creating one cow.

235
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,160
 Just not one million.

236
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,240
 They did have one cow named Ubra Blanca, aka the White Utter.

237
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,320
 Now Ubra Blanca was treated as royalty in Cuba because it truly was a genetic super

238
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
 cow.

239
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,760
 It would in a day produce four times the amount of milk as an average cow.

240
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,560
 In 1982, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, it actually produced 109 liters of milk.

241
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,280
 That's 52 liters of Coca-Cola.

242
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,760
 Last time you were at a grocery store and you were walking down an aisle of a grocery

243
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
 store.

244
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,120
 As you were walking down this aisle, I want you to count the two liters.

245
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,600
 And I want you to imagine those two liters full of milk.

246
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,920
 I want you to imagine a single cow.

247
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,000
 You have to imagine this.

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,720
 The next time you're in a store, I'm going to be standing behind you.

249
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 Are you imagining this?

250
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
 You're like, "Ah, how'd you get here?

251
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,960
 How'd you know where I lived?"

252
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
 Squirt, squirt, squirt.

253
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,200
 I want you to imagine 52 liters full of milk.

254
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 Now you go to...

255
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,520
 Jay said I could just go to the dairy department.

256
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,120
 Why do you have me walk through the soda aisle?

257
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
 Well, I want you to pick up some soda while you're there.

258
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,760
 Sprite zero sugar.

259
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,120
 But you could also go to the dairy aisle.

260
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,280
 I just figured that the two liters, that's how I think of measurement.

261
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
 Two liters.

262
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
 That's a lot of milk.

263
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,000
 52 liters worth of milk or 109 liters if you're not addicted to soda like I am.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,680
 But like I said, Uber Blanca was treated like royalty.

265
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,160
 She had an air-conditioned stable.

266
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,440
 She's always kept at a perfect temperature for a cow.

267
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,280
 Which I don't even know if the cow would realize whether or not it was air-conditioned.

268
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:09,720
 Soothe music played as handlers squeezed her udders, ushering warm milk out of her body

269
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,320
 into a tin pan.

270
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,960
 Other cows, I don't know why all of a sudden it sounded like she was walking and putting,

271
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,880
 but that's the sound of a milking cow.

272
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,360
 Other cows were probably jealous.

273
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,240
 That's not what I was about to say.

274
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,840
 Other cows were forced to taste her food.

275
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,280
 In case someone tried poisoning the miracle cow.

276
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,880
 This cow was a symbol of Cuba's scientific prowess.

277
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,240
 They created the most efficient cow on the planet.

278
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,160
 1985, after giving birth to its third little calf, Uber Blanca got sick.

279
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,760
 The doctors started to get worried.

280
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
 They were like, "Listen.

281
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,280
 We tried breeding a million of these girls.

282
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
 We only got the one.

283
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,360
 So we should start thinking ahead and figuring out a way to have more of these."

284
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
 So they took out some eggs.

285
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,520
 They took out some eggs of her to freeze.

286
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,360
 And that actually aggravated a tumor.

287
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,480
 A few weeks later, they had to put Uber Blanca to sleep.

288
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,760
 Castro was heartbroken by this.

289
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,320
 He actually loved this cow so much.

290
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
 He would visit her.

291
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,560
 There's photos of him standing next to this cow.

292
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,080
 He's all, "Move out of the way.

293
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
 Move out of the way."

294
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,640
 He's milking her himself right into his mouth.

295
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,960
 Body temperature milk.

296
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
 Just the way nature intended.

297
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,480
 They're like, "No Castro, no.

298
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,400
 That's super disgusting."

299
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,600
 After she died, she got a full page obituary in the newspaper.

300
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,480
 Her funeral was basically a state funeral with full military honors.

301
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,640
 There's a statue of her.

302
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,520
 There's a statue of a cow in Cuba.

303
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,800
 She has a stamp.

304
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,840
 And this is something they don't do with humans.

305
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,840
 Well, they did it to one human, but he was a mushroom actually.

306
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,680
 They took Uber Blanca and turned her into, like, they preserved her, basically.

307
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,440
 They stuffed her full of dirty newspaper and foam.

308
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,320
 And now she's on display.

309
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,120
 Now I'm not saying they took Vladimir Lenin and also stuffed him full of dirty newspaper

310
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,040
 and foam, but I do think it's weird when we preserve bodies like that.

311
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,240
 Usually they'll do with animals.

312
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,360
 We covered the episode about the St. Bernard.

313
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,120
 The most famous St. Bernard, he's just kind of like sitting in a museum.

314
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,720
 Like just let him decay and become part of the earth.

315
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,400
 Don't fill him full of newspapers.

316
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,960
 Don't fill him full of Bazooka Joe comic books.

317
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,680
 It's just disgusting.

318
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,280
 Like Uber Blanca just deserves to go back to the earth.

319
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,840
 So they got the frozen eggs, though.

320
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,240
 War any of her children also super cows?

321
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
 No.

322
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
 Unfortunately, no.

323
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,800
 All of her eggs that were frozen, they tried turning into super cows.

324
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,480
 They're only normal cows.

325
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,280
 So Castro was completely heartbroken.

326
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:56,200
 His idea of having an army of a million perfect dairy cows didn't work until 1993.

327
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,640
 When Castro was watching a little movie called Jurassic Park.

328
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,720
 And he asked the scientist, can we take any sort of DNA from Uber Blanca and clone her?

329
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,800
 And the scientists go, well considering she's now stuffed with dirty newspaper, probably

330
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,640
 not but we'll try.

331
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,520
 And you know how that goes.

332
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,560
 Cloning was not perfected back then.

333
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,440
 They were unable to clone Uber Blanca.

334
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,800
 She got a stamp.

335
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,920
 She got her desiccated body sitting out in the middle of a museum somewhere covered in

336
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,680
 cobwebs and kids' hand prints.

337
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,920
 But she didn't have any genetic super children.

338
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,120
 And her record was broken.

339
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,840
 At the time she had delivered the most milk in a single date.

340
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,680
 It wasn't until last year.

341
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,440
 It wasn't until 2020 that her record was broken.

342
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,360
 She pumped out 109 liters of milk in one day.

343
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,520
 A new cow pumped out 127 liters of milk in one day.

344
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
 It's not much.

345
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,840
 But it only takes one more home run to beat the home run record.

346
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,000
 So Uber Blanca, you're now the number two most milk producing cow in history.

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,880
 But you'll always be number one to us.

348
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,640
 Because now whenever we walk through a soft drink aisle of a supermarket we will think

349
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,200
 Uber Blanca, you son of a gun.

350
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,520
 You did it.

351
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,800
 You really, really did it.

352
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,600
 And then you won't want to buy soda because you'll imagine a cow just leaking bodily fluids

353
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 all over them.

354
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,920
 Day two, I'm going to toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

355
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,240
 Take us out of Castro's Cuba.

356
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,800
 We are leaving behind the shrine of Uber Blanca and we are headed out to Vietnam.

357
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:45,480
 This story was recommended to me by Peter Summers.

358
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
 Really, really interesting one.

359
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,680
 Thank you so much for sending this one over.

360
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,120
 And he got it from a podcast YouTube channel known as Forum Borealis.

361
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,920
 It was an interview with Cliff High.

362
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,160
 Now we actually covered Cliff High a long time ago on episode 222.

363
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,400
 Is 5G tech a weapon against aliens?

364
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,960
 He had created, I don't remember the exact context that we talked about Cliff High in

365
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,920
 the episode, but he had created a thing called Webbot that basically scanned articles.

366
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,600
 It scans all news coming out on the web and it tries to find keywords to predict the future.

367
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,920
 So we did a story on him a long time ago, but in this one he's telling a story to the

368
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,320
 podcast host of Forum Borealis.

369
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,960
 And this is the story that Cliff tells.

370
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,960
 Now this podcast usually deals with UFO phenomenon and they were talking about Corey Good.

371
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,160
 They were talking about Corey Good.

372
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
 We've covered him as well.

373
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,360
 I think he's the guy who believes reptilians are hanging out in Antarctica stealing people.

374
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,920
 He might also be Corey Good and might be one of the people who believes in the Mars, the

375
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
 slave colonies on Mars.

376
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,640
 I'm not for sure, but the name Corey Good is very familiar to me.

377
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,520
 I just don't know exactly what episodes we talked about him on.

378
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,760
 They were talking about Corey Good and then Cliff High goes off on this segue where he

379
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,120
 talks about his father who served in Vietnam.

380
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,960
 So the carbonicopters coming low over the jungles of Vietnam.

381
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,760
 Desu is an expert combat pilot.

382
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,560
 We trust his steady hand.

383
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,760
 And we're starting to see a bunch of other helicopters fly alongside us.

384
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,000
 We're now part of what is it called, a flotilla.

385
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 All these helicopters come in.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,360
 Fortunate son, of course, is playing.

387
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,880
 His father was in Vietnam.

388
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,060
 He did three tours.

389
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,400
 Now during his second tour, he was a field officer.

390
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,360
 Now Cliff High's father, we're going to call him Joe.

391
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,560
 Joe had a really good reputation within the military.

392
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
 He was a competent officer.

393
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,840
 He could keep his mouth shut.

394
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
 He could follow orders.

395
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,440
 And when he followed the orders, he did a good job.

396
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,880
 So he became part of this experimental program where they were working on night vision technology.

397
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,200
 Now this would have changed the scope of the war is what Cliff High was saying.

398
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,240
 If you could just see everything at night back then against an enemy who didn't really

399
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,280
 know that technology existed, it would be a game changer.

400
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,520
 But this night vision technology is different than the night vision technology we have today.

401
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,520
 Night vision technology, the reason why it shows up is green.

402
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,640
 So you have the black background and then you see all the green is because green is one

403
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,360
 of the colors that humans can see the most variations of.

404
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,280
 It's an evolutionary trait.

405
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,000
 Most of our food is green, so we're able to distinguish different types of green better

406
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,080
 than any other color.

407
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,960
 So that's the reason why night vision goggles are green today.

408
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,360
 But this story says the original versions of night vision goggles were red.

409
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,920
 They used the red spectrum.

410
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,040
 These were issued to the soldiers and these are issued to helicopter gunners.

411
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
 And they're testing them.

412
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,360
 Among the select troops, they want to see how these work in the field.

413
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,880
 And Joe High, he's a field officer, he's overseeing his men they're wearing these goggles.

414
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,640
 One night, Joe High is flying in a helicopter.

415
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
 He's sitting in the copilot's seat.

416
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,720
 The other guy's piloting it.

417
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,840
 They're in a swarm of other US helicopters.

418
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,040
 They're traversing the skies of Vietnam.

419
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
 Everything seems calm.

420
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,520
 This is actually friendly territory.

421
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,960
 They don't really expect any resistance here.

422
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,160
 But the machine gunner opens fire.

423
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,200
 And the other helicopters don't know what to do.

424
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,960
 They're looking, they're scanning, they don't see anything wrong.

425
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,920
 Joe High turns around and asks what's going on and he sees the gunner with the infrared

426
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,120
 goggles just shooting.

427
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,320
 But he's not shooting at the ground.

428
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,360
 He's shooting in the air.

429
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,480
 The machine gun isn't targeting any sort of troop movement.

430
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,120
 It's shooting out of the helicopter at nothing.

431
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,360
 Joe High has to go over and interrupt the gunner.

432
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 What are you doing, man?

433
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 What are you shooting at?

434
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 What are you shooting at?

435
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
 The radio went to the other helicopters.

436
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
 Hey, it's fine, it's fine.

437
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
 There's nothing else.

438
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,120
 Because they saw that he wasn't shooting at the ground.

439
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,600
 They see that he's shooting at something in the skies.

440
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 There an enemy helicopter?

441
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,680
 Is there an enemy jet coming in?

442
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:06,240
 The gunner turns to Joe High and tells him, "I saw it, man.

443
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,560
 It just came at me.

444
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,200
 I just opened fire."

445
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,680
 Joe's like, "What did you see?

446
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,840
 What's going on?"

447
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,360
 The gunner says that as they're flying, he looks and what could only be described as

448
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,520
 a winged beast, a demon, flies up alongside the helicopter.

449
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,600
 And he goes, "It wasn't like a hallucination.

450
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,000
 I mean, it might have been.

451
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,720
 It might have been.

452
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,480
 But the scariest part, Joe, the scariest part was that I'm sitting there manning the gun

453
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,640
 and I see this impossible creature fly up alongside the helicopter and it's flying next

454
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,960
 to us and it looks at me.

455
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,120
 It wasn't a trick of the light.

456
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:56,040
 It looked at me and then it began to motion with its finger for me to come to it.

457
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,120
 It reacted to me.

458
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,840
 It saw me.

459
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,240
 It saw me."

460
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,680
 Joe begins to collect stories from other field officers whose men are using these goggles.

461
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,400
 They're getting complaints of seeing monsters in the jungle.

462
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,120
 Great winged beasts flying over the treetops.

463
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,120
 He starts to hear reports of people engaged in "self-destructive behavior" and there

464
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,840
 seems to be a high correlation between the people who are losing their minds and the

465
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,320
 people who are testing out these goggles.

466
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,120
 On top of that, at least once a week, Joe High is hearing reports of someone just opening

467
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
 fire.

468
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,920
 Everyone's just sitting around playing cards hanging out.

469
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,160
 Everyone grabs a rifle and starts firing up into the sky.

470
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,200
 At one point, now as a field officer, the military said they want the men testing these

471
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,000
 and the gunners testing these, but they said no officers can use these night vision goggles

472
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
 so we wanted to see the enlisted men use them.

473
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,720
 You figure, yeah sure whatever, I'm just going to follow orders, not really thinking of it.

474
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,240
 But once Joe starts hearing about these reports, one time he goes, "Hey can I see those?

475
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
 Can I see those goggles?"

476
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,600
 And he said he put them on and he looked up at the canopy of the jungle and he immediately

477
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,280
 started to see movement in the treetops.

478
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,400
 He couldn't really figure it out what it was at first, but then he caught a glimpse

479
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,440
 of a giant winged creature launch itself from the top of a tree.

480
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,600
 He immediately takes the goggles off and he goes, "Not even the treetops were disturbed.

481
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 The leaves weren't moving.

482
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:41,680
 There's no sound coming from the top of the jungle, but I saw something launch itself

483
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,280
 off of the jungle canopy into the sky."

484
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,320
 But it wasn't really there.

485
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,720
 At that point he actually ordered his men to stop using the goggles.

486
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,800
 He goes, "Don't worry about it.

487
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,760
 I'll take the flak, but you guys aren't going to do that anymore."

488
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,880
 And apparently there were higher ups in the military that said that was the right decision.

489
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,080
 They were hearing reports as well, but it sounds like they wanted to get to the bottom

490
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,960
 of it, what actually was going on.

491
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,840
 The host asked Cliff High, "Did your dad ever bring home a pair of goggles?"

492
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,640
 And Cliff High kind of shrugged it off and he goes, "No, my dad really wasn't like that.

493
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,880
 Not a guy that still has military equipment."

494
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:28,960
 But Cliff High also says, "My dad said that he put them on very briefly and it affected

495
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,560
 him for days afterwards.

496
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,400
 It really rattled him."

497
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,560
 He goes, "The men who wore them constantly?"

498
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
 He goes, "They weren't right for months.

499
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,840
 A lot of them had to be shipped back stateside because they just couldn't get out of that

500
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,560
 self-destructive mode.

501
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,440
 Whatever that is, maybe they became heavy drinkers, maybe they started to just become loonies,

502
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,000
 but they were affecting people wearing these goggles."

503
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,440
 And so at a certain point the technology was important, being able to see in the night,

504
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,000
 being able to see in the dark was important.

505
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,760
 But maybe if they just did a color shift, they could have the best of both worlds.

506
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,960
 They could have the ability to see in the dark and not go insane.

507
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,120
 And that's why our night vision goggles are green nowadays.

508
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
 At that point, something really weird happened.

509
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,280
 The podcast host goes, "Well, you know, this show's about aliens and so they changed the

510
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,760
 topic back to Corey Good and talking about these bluebird aliens, these avian aliens

511
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
 and all this stuff.

512
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,200
 And then as far as I know, they didn't, I listened a little bit more to the podcast.

513
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,440
 It didn't sound like they brought this back up.

514
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,520
 Very bizarre."

515
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,560
 That was way more fascinating than anything you could talk about aliens.

516
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,920
 I think any show should be able to pivot to talk about the ability to see demons on earth.

517
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
 It was weird.

518
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,640
 It was super weird for the podcast host to do that.

519
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,320
 And I was going through the website, and I guess there's episodes you have to pay for

520
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,760
 and things like that, but they mentioned that they spoke about this again on a consciousness

521
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,440
 podcast that came out later, but I haven't been able to find it.

522
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,760
 I tried looking around.

523
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,560
 He was back on this other show, but I think it was one of the paid ones.

524
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,880
 But even then, it's just weird that you would, why would you segue out of such an interesting

525
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,640
 story to go, "Oh, let's go talk about aliens again."

526
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,680
 Because for all you know, these were aliens.

527
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,720
 Definitely not life that's indigenous to earth.

528
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,280
 Very, very creepy story if you think about it.

529
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,480
 Like first off, it could not be real, right?

530
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,000
 It could just be either a story that a dad made up or a story that Cliff High made up.

531
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Probably possible.

532
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 The dad's like, "Come here little Cliff, sit on my lap.

533
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,120
 I want to tell you the story about the darkness that surrounds us."

534
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
 Yay, daddy!

535
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,040
 But it's possible that it's totally made up.

536
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:45,120
 But if it's not made up, that idea that a simple color shift can make you see, you know,

537
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,800
 and let me back up for a second.

538
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,480
 What were they seeing?

539
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,240
 If these creatures are all around us and a simple color shift allowed us humans to see

540
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,840
 them, then they're just all around us all the time.

541
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,640
 When we're driving to the store to look at all the 2 liters of soda, there's a demon

542
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,360
 standing on a rooftop staring at you.

543
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,520
 The demon's just, every time you go to Macy's there's a demon standing in the men's dressing

544
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,640
 room as you're changing your clothes.

545
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,880
 I mean, I guess that's creepy.

546
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,880
 But I think what's even creepier than that is the fact that when the soldiers could

547
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,000
 see the demons, the demons realized they could be seen and they were trying to interact with

548
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 them.

549
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,840
 Like is a demon constantly just standing in the corner of your room beckoning you to

550
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,240
 it?

551
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,920
 Or did these creatures realize, "Oh, he can see me.

552
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,400
 Now the game's really begun."

553
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,800
 Because he says he's an edgy, bad Joker impression.

554
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,040
 I think this story might actually be pretty easy to confirm as well.

555
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,680
 I'm sure you could build a device that gives you night vision ability.

556
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,880
 With today's technology, I bet you there are people who could build a night vision device

557
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,240
 from the ground up that allows you to see the color red, all the images in the color

558
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,720
 red rather than all the images in the color green.

559
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,120
 And if that's the case, what happens when somebody does it?

560
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,120
 They're going to test them out and they're going to start to see things.

561
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,280
 And it's going to break their mind.

562
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,840
 And it's going to break the mind of someone who could put this together in the first place.

563
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,200
 And that's exactly the type of pawn that a demon would want.

564
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,040
 You don't want to make this guy go too crazy.

565
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,120
 You just want to influence him.

566
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,560
 To make more of these devices.

567
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,640
 And begin to sell them.

568
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,600
 Begin to distribute them.

569
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,720
 Turn the technology into an app that you can download on your phone.

570
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,760
 A simple color switch could allow a human to see the world of the demons.

571
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,680
 And there's a part of us that is curious enough to try that at least once to see if it was

572
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
 true.

573
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,800
 What could be the harm in looking?

574
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,040
 We would tell ourselves.

575
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,520
 What would be the harm in seeing?

576
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,800
 We just want proof.

577
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,080
 So if someone ever turns this into ghost goggles or something on your phone to download and

578
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,280
 see if there's any spooky creatures in your neighborhood, I think a lot of us would fall

579
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,560
 for it.

580
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,440
 And we'd test it out.

581
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,240
 We'd put those goggles on.

582
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,520
 And walk outside.

583
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,240
 Demons do exist.

584
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,800
 Whether we see them with our eyes or we don't.

585
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,920
 Sometimes it is better to be ignorant than search for proof.

586
00:32:34,920 --> 00:33:00,040
 Because the proof we find may be at the cost of our own sanity.

587
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:16,080
 So we're going to test it out.

588
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:33,640
 And we'll see you in the next video.
