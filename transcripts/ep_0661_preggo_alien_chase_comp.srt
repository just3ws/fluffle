1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Today we return to Guantanamo Bay for an end to the saga of Hillary Clinton and her poop.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Then, can someone actually shape shift right before your eyes?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then finally, and then we meet a man who was just driving down the road when he saw a woman screaming for help.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 He pulled over and put her in the truck.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And then the aliens show up today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We got three stories. Let's get through all of them first off.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Look at this awesome fan art we have. We have this fan art Friday submission from Brian Brain.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Look at that creepy eye. Look at that creepy eye. Sorry YouTube listeners.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Have to look at that creepy eye. It's really cool. I really like that eye.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Ryan, thank you so much for submitting this for Fan Art Friday. Really, really appreciated. Great job.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Then let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, riding into Dead Rabbit Command on the back of a giant golden dragon.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It's Rudy Jazz. Everyone give a round of applause for Rudy Jazz.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 [Rudy Jazz making noises]

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That's not Rudy Jazz making that noise. That's the dragon making that noise. Didn't you recognize it?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Rudy Jazz, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys can't make awesome sound effects like me, that's fine too.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Rudy Jazz, go ahead and shrink that dragon down so it fits in your tiny little pocket.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durageable. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 We are headed out to Guantanamo Bay.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 [Rudy Jazz making noises]

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Now this first story, Rudy, I'm sorry that you have to be the captain for this one. This is a very somber story.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I'm going to declare it right now. It's April 28th, 2021.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I'm recording this episode at 9.31pm. This episode is going to go down in history as being the official announcement.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Madam Secretary, Senator from New York, First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been executed.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Guys, I know, I know, I know it's shocking because you didn't see it on any news network.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I know you're puzzled because you did not hear the fact that Hillary Clinton was executed at Guantanamo Bay

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 because it has appeared on not a single news network or newspaper, but see the problem is you're reading the wrong news sources.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 According to real raw news, because when you think of information, you want it to be uncooked, right?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 When you think of stuff that needs to actually be formed into a tasty mass that's nutritious, I don't want that.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I don't want news that's researched and developed. No, just give it to me raw. Just give it to me real and raw.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 According to real raw news, journalist Michael Baxter wrote this article called Hillary Clinton Hanged at Gitmo.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Now I've said enough words to get this episode demonetized from YouTube, but I'm willing to take the hit because this is that no one else is covering this story, guys.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 April 26th, 2021, only a few days ago, and 9/05, almost exactly the time I'm recording this episode, Hillary Clinton was led up to the gallows.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So you're asking, wait a second, what's her crimes?

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Well, obviously, again, you haven't been paying attention to the real news, the real raw news, that news full of salmonella and worms is just waiting for you to devour it.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 It's totally healthy, guys. You don't need to check facts, what?

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Hillary Clinton, though, for Adrena-Krome related reasons. She was arrested, deep state stuff, all that stuff, all the hits, all the big ones, all the big conspiracy theory ones.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 She also flattened the earth herself. She took a rolling pin. She's like, "Ha ha ha ha."

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Hillary Clinton was led to the gallows. Let me build a picture for you. This article, it's a work of art.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 This article is a brilliant piece. I want to say literature, I want to say fiction, but what am I thinking? It's real raw news. It's not real raw stories.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Michael Baxter creates this visual of Hillary Clinton being led out into this courtyard.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 You know, you don't go in town and want to be in this courtyard. Everyone else is playing basketball. They're lifting weights.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 They're like, "Oh man, it's time for Hillary Clinton to get hung." And they're like, "Dude, I'm still trying to make a basket."

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Hillary Clinton is being led out to the gallows. He describes the gallows. He describes how it's built.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 He says, "At the gallows, there is a box with five red buttons, and there's five uniformed soldiers just standing there."

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 That's all they do. They get hired when they signed up four years ago and they're toward duty.

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 They're like, "Where are we going? Afghanistan? Iraq?" They're like, "No, we're going to put you in front of a box in Guantanamo Bay."

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 There's a box with five red buttons. There's five soldiers.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Hillary Clinton gets the noose put around her neck and Vice Admiral Hanuk, who's in charge of this whole thing, says,

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 "When I say execute and not a second sooner, each of you are going to take your left index finger and push the button.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You've got to do it all at the same time, and then the floor is going to give out and Hillary Clinton will be hung."

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Someone's like, "Wait, we're hanging Hillary Clinton? What did she do? What's going on?"

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 He's been trapped in Guantanamo Bay the whole time. He hasn't been able to read real raw news.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 You're going to hit this button. The gallow is going to activate. She's going to hang.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And the reason why there's five red buttons and there's five soldiers is no one will ever know who killed Hillary Clinton.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 First off, if she's enough of a vil-- First off, this is all made up. This is all completely made up.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 In this world, this is being reported as a real story. There are 600 comments on this article.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 There's a big debate over whether or not you should cremate her because we might be able to clone her.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So that's the type of discussions that are going around this article.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It's either the world's best satire or just-- I don't-- You know, it's one thing to read conspiracy theories about abstract things.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And it's even fine to read conspiracy theories about stuff that's happening right now, stuff that's not super abstract.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Like, you know, politics and stuff like that. You can read conspiracy theories. You can meet people face to face.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And they'll tell you their personal conspiracy theory about current politics and stuff like that. That's fine.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 When you're coming across stuff like real raw news, we had this dilemma last time when we covered Hillary Clinton sitting in her prison cell throwing poop at people.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It's 100% made up. And my question is, is who's making it up? Did Michael Baxter make this--

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Was he sitting writing his fan fiction? Is Hillary Clinton fan fiction? Does he know it's fake?

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Is he getting fooled? Is there someone who's tricking him? Is there some guy who shows up at his house late at night wearing a fake mustache and goes, "It's happened."

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Because he really goes into detail like what the process is. Like, normal conspiracy theories would say, "We don't have any details,"

73
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 but Hillary Clinton was hung in Guantanamo Bay. He's going into how everything rolls out. Listen to the detail he goes into on this.

74
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Let me read you this article. A chaplain and a physician climbed the 13 steps leading to the top of the platform and stood beside a soldier who was checking to ensure the noose was secure around Clinton's neck.

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Below them, Vice Admiral Hannick asked if Clinton wanted last rights or had any final words.

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Clinton broke silence. "I'm Hillary Clinton! You can't do this to me," she said, her voice a witch's cackle.

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 "It's already done!" Donald J. Trump shouted up at her. He was there. Donald J. Trump went to Guantanamo Bay. He was there.

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So there's a bit of a difference between someone saying monkeys don't exist, the earth is flat, NASA, the videos are faked, they're actually on a soundstage.

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 All of that stuff, those are observational conspiracy theories. We may even look at the same video footage and I may go, "Well, that video footage is clearly CGI,"

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 and they're looking at the same video footage and go, "No, no, no, that's not CGI."

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Or with the NASA stuff being faked, I go, "Well, you know, zero gravity acts weird. It may look like a fishing line, I don't think they're actually tied up to fishing lines.

82
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 A fishing line couldn't really support a human body." And then, "I've tried, I've tried several times, it's a kink of mine."

83
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And the person who believes that NASA videos are fake could debate, but we're watching the same video. He's not, no, no, no, no, no.

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 You missed that part where the aliens showed up. You missed that part where they never happened in the video.

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 It's like, yeah, the part where the reptilians showed up and ate the astronauts and then laid eggs in the suit and then the egg became a new astronaut and that astronaut standing behind you.

86
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And I look behind me just to be safe and I'm like, there's no one behind me. None of that happened. That's what we're dealing with this.

87
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 It's fascinating, fascinating stuff. People believe this, that Hillary Clinton has been executed and going forward, when she is seen in public, watch you watch, she has an unfortunate accident tonight,

88
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 but barring any sort of tragedy, when she's seen in public again, these people are going to say, "Oh, they didn't cremate the body. They didn't burn it quick enough. They didn't bury her with a silver coin under her tongue. She has come back."

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Absolutely fascinating conspiracy theory and I'm sure it's not the end of it because she is still alive. She will be seen again and I can't wait to see what real raw news or other websites of their ilk weave, what type of conspiracy.

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 You just can't predict this stuff. I thought Hillary Clinton throwing her poop at prison guards was absurd enough.

91
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Now Donald J. Trump yelling at her as she's being hung, as she's swaying in the wind. It gets real grim too. Michael Baxter really got into this, how her body was acting and stuff like that.

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And it's not real. It's not even real. It's not like you're a journalist reporting something that could actually happen. You're making it up, but it's all, I don't know if it was meant to be hilarious.

93
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It was hilarious nonetheless. Rudy Jazz. Let's go ahead and get out of Guantanamo Bay. I'm going to toss you the key. What do we take the Dead Rabbit Durgeable to get here?

94
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 We need another flight vehicle. I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the hair hang glider. Everyone grab onto Rudy's ankles. We're going to jump off the tall, jump off the gallows. We're climbing up the gallows.

95
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Let's jump off the gallows and glide all the way back to the United States. Specifically, we're headed to Georgia.

96
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And while we're flying back to Georgia, I'm going to do one more shout out for Murderer Barry Wynn. I'll put it in the show notes again. We did a promo read for it last week. It's out now.

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 If you didn't do the pre-order, you can get it now. I'm really good movie. Really recommend checking it out. Really, really enjoyable flick. I want to do one more shout out for that now that it's been released.

98
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Rudy Jazz's are flying over Atlanta, Georgia. You see that right there. You see, weeeeee, weeeeee. You see all those people having fun. You see roller coasters. You see sweaty dudes eating hot dogs.

99
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 They're having hot dog eating contests. It's unofficial. It's just one guy eating a lot of hot dogs. We're landing right there. We're landing at six flags over Georgia.

100
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 As we're at six flags over Georgia, it's an amusement park if you guys aren't aware. It's mostly roller coasters. They have a special promo going on right now. $59 for a season pass. Can you believe that?

101
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 $59 you can go there as much as you want and check this out. This isn't an ad for them. If you spend the next year $100 for the entire season, you get two meals in a snack every time you visit.

102
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I spend about $130 a month on food. So basically if I moved to Georgia and gave them $160 for an entire season, which I'm assuming is for longer than a month, I would have food. I would go there and I would sleep on the roller coaster. Weeeeeee.

103
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And I would just walk around and see shenanigans every single day. It's this show. It's some show I was doing a bunch of research on it because I got bored. I started researching six flags over Georgia.

104
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Shenanigans is a wow west shootout show with hop along casualty or something like that. He's constantly wounded. He's holding his intestines in with this cowboy hat. Please help me. He's just reaching out to the audience for an hour and a half. I'm just eating my free food.

105
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 It's not free, but it's $100 for the entire season. That's nuts. But anyways, this show isn't a theme park review show. If it was, six flags over Georgia would get two thumbs up. Two hot dogs up. But it's not. It's a paranormal music out to the point.

106
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Oh man, I gotta do a paranormal show. It's a paranormal podcast, so here we go. This story's weird. I came across this on the internet a while back and it's kind of been sitting on my head for a while.

107
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 It's October 9th, 2020. There's a woman. She's unnamed. We're going to call her Tracy. She's walking with her boyfriend into six flags over Georgia. It's kind of a gloomy day. She said it had previously been raining.

108
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 They're walking down the sidewalk to head into the amusement park. She goes, you know, normally when you go to a amusement park, you end up parking far away from the entrance. It just seems to be the way it always works out.

109
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 They're walking on the sidewalk. She goes in this area where they're at. There's only two other people. It doesn't seem to be that they're walking together. They seem to be walking alone.

110
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 There is a white woman wearing a hoodie. And then she's the farthest away. And then in between the white woman and Tracy and her boyfriend, there's a black man wearing a hoodie as well.

111
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And then she said, for some reason, the black man steps off of the sidewalk and there's like a gravelly area and a puddle of water.

112
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And she says he steps off the sidewalk and she couldn't figure out what, because she's played this event a lot in her head.

113
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 She goes, I don't know why he did this, but he stepped off the sidewalk. He walked around the puddle of water and then he got on the sidewalk and caught up to the white woman.

114
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 But this man was now a white man wearing a camouflage jacket. She sees this white man and this white woman continue to walk on and Tracy is trying to figure out what in the world she just saw.

115
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And she says she has paranormal encounters. She's seen stuff before and a lot of times she thinks it's just in her head that she's just seeing things. So she wanted to validate the experience.

116
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 She turns to her boyfriend and she asks, did you see that? And she expected him to say, see what? But when she asked, did you see that, he said, yeah, that black guy is white now.

117
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 This is one of those really interesting paranormal stories that you run across that it's inconsequential.

118
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 When we cover stuff about alien invasions or cryptids in the woods, melon heads, vampire sex cults, these things have real life casualties.

119
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 These things interfere with ecosystems, possibly destroy planets, but in a story like this, it's so benign. It is almost on the level of just a ghost.

120
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 A ghost in your house is a threat. A ghost at your place of work is a threat or an inconvenience. A ghost in someone else's place of work is actually kind of funny, right?

121
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Because they don't have to deal with it. But then like just a ghost encounter on a street, you know what I mean? Like it's fairly inconsequential. That's a bad example.

122
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Ghosts are always terrifying now that I'm thinking about it. I don't think there's anything creepier than driving down a dark street and there's a ghost there.

123
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 My point is that it's fairly inconsequential. Nothing's really changing. And that's what makes this story interesting to me.

124
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And the fact that I have to be honest with myself, I don't have that level of observation. Obviously I've seen weird stuff.

125
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I remember once I was walking through Walmart with my brother, we're in Sacramento, I just got out of the hospital. I was in there for a couple days and me and my brother at Walmart, we were walking through Walmart down off of Watt Avenue in Sacramento.

126
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It was packed. It was one of the most crowded Walmart's I've ever been in in my life. And we're walking and you're almost shoulder to shoulder with these people. The pre-COVID days, right? You remember those good old days?

127
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And I see this sweaty dude. I see this big sweaty dude wearing like a white shirt. His hair was messed up. He looked like a stereotypical slob.

128
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And me and my brother are walking through this crowd of people and I see him pass me and he looks like a cartoon character of a slob. He looks so stereotypical. He walks past me. I remember thinking that guy looks like Matt Groening drew him.

129
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And then, I mean, we're again, we're packed and he walked past me and I walk maybe in other 30, 40 seconds forward in this mass of people. He walks by me again.

130
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Not? Let me rephrase that. He doesn't walk by me going the opposite direction. He walks past me again going the same direction as if he teleported or was a clone or there's some sort of temporal disturbance.

131
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And it was so puzzling to me. I remember kind of like, he walks past me. He walks past me on my right. Headed south, we'll say. I walk for another 30 seconds. He walks past me again on my right, headed south.

132
00:17:47,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And I remember doing the whole three suges thing, I remember pointing at him and I'm looking and I'm doing this weird double take and I look back at my older brother and I go, "Did you just see that guy?"

133
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And my older brother was just staring straight ahead and he goes, "This is the scariest Walmart I've ever been in."

134
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 He didn't acknowledge that he saw exactly what I saw, but he was rattled. We still bought our snacks or whatever we were there for, chewing tobacco probably.

135
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 But on the whole, I don't think I'm that observant. I think I'm observant in certain scenarios, but if I was walking down the street and a dude changed race in front of me, I don't know if I noticed that.

136
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I think I have too much going on in my head. It's not a matter of the fact like, "Oh, I don't see color." It's the fact that I don't know if I would notice that because it seems to be such an inconsequential change.

137
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And when we talk about the world of the paranormal, somebody changing their clothes and changing their skin color, I don't know if I'd register that.

138
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And to me, the story, because of that has a layer of creepiness. That slob had to walk past me, but who knows how many other weird clone shapeshifters are hanging out of that Walmart.

139
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I don't know if I have that level of outside observational skills. So it's a little scary, like you start to think, "What are you missing?"

140
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I mentioned that earlier when I've done episodes about gangstalk, and I don't even think I would notice if I was being gangstalked.

141
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I don't know if I have that level of awareness. I grew up in really bad neighborhoods and you look for certain signs.

142
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You know, like the gunfire coming out of the car that's driving down the street.

143
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 But other than that, I don't know if I would pick up on the fact that every time I saw someone wearing a yellow shirt, they picked at their ear. I don't think I would notice it.

144
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 So yeah, it's an interesting story and it's a little creepy. I don't know if I would have noticed it, and you start to think, "How many paranormal events could happen that we're not noticing?"

145
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Just because they are so small.

146
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 RudyJazz calling that carbonar copter. We're going to go ahead and leave behind Six Flags.

147
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I'm like, "No, I want to go on this roller coaster one more time. I bought a season pass. I bought a season pass. You guys are dragging me off. I'm trying to eat as much as free food before I can go.

148
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Guys, I'll be back tomorrow."

149
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Shenanigans, the cast of shenanigans is waving at me.

150
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Guys still holding his guts as bloody at. He's waving at me.

151
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Let's hop in that carbonar copter. RudyJazz, go ahead and take us to Beckley, West Virginia.

152
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 [imitates car noises]

153
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Summer 1992 is the time period we're going to be in right now. It's three in the morning.

154
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And there's a man. We don't have a name for him, so we're going to call him Saul.

155
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 He's pulling out of the parking lot of a mall. It doesn't say why he's at a mall at three o'clock in the morning.

156
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Logically, probably drugs, right?

157
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But we don't know. We don't know. He could also just been getting off work.

158
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 So it's not really... doesn't really matter, but it could be drugs, right?

159
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 For where the story's going, we have to accept that he may not be a reliable witness.

160
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But you know, maybe he's just pulling out of a parking lot of a empty mall at three in the morning.

161
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And that's his hobby. That's his kink.

162
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 As he's driving down the road, he sees a blonde woman running down the street.

163
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 [panting]

164
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And not only a blonde woman, a pregnant blonde woman.

165
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 People are like, "Oh my God, she's not pregnant? I'm just going to keep on driving."

166
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I only save pregnant women. This eight-month pregnant woman is running down the street.

167
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 She's waving her arms. She sees Saul's truck. She starts screaming.

168
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 He wants to help her. He wants to see what's going on.

169
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Maybe she has some drugs on her. She looks like she's having a good time with those drugs.

170
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 He pulls over. She jumps into the car and she says, "Get out of here. Get out of here. They're after me. They're after me."

171
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And she starts screaming stuff like, "Leave me alone. Get away. They're after me."

172
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And so she's completely off her rocker, right?

173
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And so Saul just floors it. Because what else are you going to do?

174
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Someone jumps in your car and starts screaming, "They're after me."

175
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 You're not going to be like, "Let's have a discussion about who they are."

176
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 He floors it.

177
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 As he's driving away, he sizes her up.

178
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 She's a fairly good-looking woman.

179
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Because one thing that he noticed about her was her face wasn't swollen the way a pregnant woman's face gets.

180
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Again, I don't-- I don't-- that's not me saying that.

181
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Saul saying that. I don't think I've ever looked at a pregnant woman and go, "Man, she must be able to pregnant look how swollen her face is."

182
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 But anyways, he says apparently pregnant-- he's probably been around more pregnant women than I have.

183
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Maybe his drug of choice is Adrenal Chrome. I don't know.

184
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 But anyways, he said she had a very lean face, but she had a big, big pregnant belly.

185
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 She was wearing a bright green blouse that just seemed to absorb all the light.

186
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And she had wrinkle-free slacks.

187
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Not like dockers. Not like those pants you could get at JC Penney's.

188
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Like, they didn't seem to be any creases in them at all.

189
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 So from a quick glance, he kind of like-- he absorbs all this information. He kind of can read all this about her.

190
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 But he has more pressing matters, as in pressing the gas pedal to get out of there.

191
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 He begins to speed away from the area. She's still screaming, and that's when he sees headlights coming up behind his car.

192
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 High-speed chase, 3 AM outside of this mall in Buckley, West Virginia.

193
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And no matter how fast Saul drives this car, he can't shake it. It is right on them.

194
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So he comes up with another plan.

195
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 This is another thing that may show that he's on drugs.

196
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Tactically, it might work if it's car versus car. They're both the same, like two sedans.

197
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 He slams on the brakes. If you're in a pickup truck and they're in a weaker car, it's going to completely destroy their front end.

198
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 If they're in a stronger car, if you're like in a U-Go and they're in a truck, don't try this.

199
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 But he slams on his brakes, and I'm assuming if he's not on drugs, he's thinking,

200
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 "Maybe I can wreck their front end and then speed away." It's still a dangerous move, but any port in a storm.

201
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 He slams on his brake and he's expecting the two cars to collide. Instead, the headlights go up.

202
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 He's looking through his rear-rear mirror. He sees the headlights float up over the car, and now they're hovering right over his car.

203
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 He's like, "Okay, didn't expect that, right? Expected whiplash. Didn't expect this."

204
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 He hits the gas again. The car's flying down the road, and the lights are flying above him.

205
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 [imitates car noises]

206
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 I don't know if this is making the Jetsons noise. He didn't specify that.

207
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 He's speeding away. The lights are right over the car. The girl is flipping out. She won't stop screaming,

208
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 but then she starts to give him directions towards a place.

209
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 "Go there! Hurry up! Go, go, go!" She starts directing him down the street, and he sees an old building on the side of the street.

210
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 She's like, "Stop, stop, stop!" He slams on the brakes. She jumps out of the car and begins running into the house.

211
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 When she leaves the car, the lights stop hovering over Saul's vehicle and begin to pursue the pregnant woman.

212
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 She gets into the house, and the lights hover over the house for a few seconds, and then fly off into the night sky.

213
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Saul leaves the scene as any hero, as any hero would do, right?

214
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Oh, I've taken her to, I've taken her to her destination. This decrepit old house in the middle of nowhere.

215
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Surely those UFOs, surely those bright lights from another world won't be able to get her through that battered roof.

216
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 He leaves. To be fair, he's done his part right now. I don't expect him to grab a pulse rifle and start fighting reptilians,

217
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 but he leaves. A week later, he lets seven days pass, not a man of action, except for the first part.

218
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 He's letting seven days pass. Ah, you know the old rule. Never visit the pregnant woman who was abducted by aliens on the first day.

219
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 You gotta give it seven days, and then he's swing by and see what's up.

220
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 He's there, he said the building was completely abandoned, it was decrepit, it looked like no one had lived there for years.

221
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 This story is, I got it from ThinkAboutAtDocs.com. It's actually from a book called West Virginia UFOs,

222
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Close Encounters in the Mountain State. I was so intrigued by this story. I bought this book.

223
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I bought this book, I actually can't wait to dig into it. I really want to read it.

224
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I was so intrigued by the story, I wanted to know more about it, but I wanted to share it with you right now.

225
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I don't know if I learned any more about those wrinkle-free slacks. I'll let you know.

226
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I really enjoy this story. One, it has a high-speed pursuit in it.

227
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Don't cover a lot of those on Dead Rava Radio. It has the mystery, who's this woman, who was after her.

228
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Why was the animal born in a lot of three in the morning? All of these unanswered questions.

229
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And again, like the shapeshifter story, it adds an element of the paranormal in the world with us.

230
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 You know what I mean? It gives a life to it. It gives a life to these stories.

231
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And these stories like this and stories like the shapeshifter remind me that we live in a world full of so many unanswered questions and so many possible mysteries,

232
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 but you have to open your eyes. You have to be there to know them.

233
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 You could have easily went the other direction. You could have taken another hit off that pipe.

234
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And that woman had been running on the street and he never even noticed.

235
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 He could have the radio cranked up too loud and not heard her pleas for help.

236
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 He never would have seen those amazing slacks.

237
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But you know what I mean? Like it's a matter of being aware. It's a matter of watching your environment.

238
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Right place, right time. It could have been wrong place, wrong time if something worse had happened.

239
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 But I like stories like this that just kind of remind you that the paranormal, the mysteries are everywhere.

240
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 It doesn't have to be from the triangle or the lead mask people or these big mysteries that we talk about over and over and over again.

241
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 The mysteries that have been done to death.

242
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 It's these little ones that happen late at night outside of a mall or in a gloomy parking lot of the world's best amusement park this season.

243
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I don't know if they raise the prices.

244
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And I like that. I like that about these stories and I like that about the world and life.

245
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 You never know what adventure is going to come your way.

246
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 I guess you've got to keep an eye out for it.

247
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Make sure you see it.

248
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 It may not be an adventure you want to go on.

249
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It may be as simple as seeing somebody's shape shift in front of you that would actually be quite miraculous and terrifying.

250
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 You know what I mean? It doesn't have to be these world altering adventures.

251
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 It doesn't have to be UFO crashes into the world scenarios.

252
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 It doesn't have to be Hillary Rodham Clinton being executed in this dude's fan fiction.

253
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 It doesn't have to be these big level things.

254
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Sometimes it is as simple as seeing something and going, did you just see that?

255
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Sometimes those are the mysteries that stick with us over the years.

 DeadRabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and truth friend podcast.

260
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

261
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

262
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Guys, thank you so much for participating in that 90 day challenge.

263
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 This was the end of the 90 day challenge.

264
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 For those of you who didn't, we salute you.

 For those of you who didn't, you can start anytime you need to.

266
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Just set a time period and be better 90 days from then.

267
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 I believe in you. You can do it.

268
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Have a great weekend.
