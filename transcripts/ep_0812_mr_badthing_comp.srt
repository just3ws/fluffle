1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
 A young woman taking a shower sees something so bizarre she questions, "What's scarier?

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,300
 A human finger?

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,300
 Or a ghost finger?"

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,040
 And then we travel to Old Timie, Texas to meet up with a group of conquistadors sent

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,880
 there to explore the new world.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,540
 After a savage winter, and deadly encounters with the local natives, the conquistadors

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:32,880
 think they've seen it all, but then they find the hole in the ground.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:44,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenterner, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,720
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,880
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,360
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, walking into Dead

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
 Rabbit Command.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,560
 Everyone stand up, give him a big salute for Zachary McCree.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,720
 Zachary chants his name, he's walking in.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
 Give him a big ol' ego.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,440
 Zachary, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,320
 Just help spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
 Really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
 Stop what you're doing right now.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
 You're all working to construction.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,600
 There's like beams falling on people.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,560
 And turn to the person next to you and go, "Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,320
 Dead Rabbit Radio is awesome and causing a massive industrial accident."

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,640
 Because then it'll be the news.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,720
 They'll ask why you did it and you can promote the show as they are leading you away into

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
 prison.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
 Zachary, don't do that actually.

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,600
 For legal reasons, that was a joke.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,920
 Zachary, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the...

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,280
 What was our first story?

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
 I totally forgot.

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,520
 Zachary, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,800
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,960
 We are headed all the way out to an apartment complex.

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,480
 I know that's not the most picturesque place.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,560
 This is one of those stories that I found online.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,760
 So we don't have a specific location.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,240
 They don't want to dox themselves.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,240
 But this story takes place in an apartment complex.

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,760
 Maybe your apartment complex.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,480
 Maybe this story is happening right next to you right now.

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,880
 The story was written by someone who goes by the name Bannister X.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,960
 Bannister X, we're gonna call her Monica.

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,880
 Monica wrote this story.

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,280
 It's the year 2020.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,720
 So just a couple years ago, right?

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
 Around November, December.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 And Monica is living with her mom in this apartment.

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,360
 Now it's a typical apartment.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
 It has a room and a ceiling.

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,440
 You're like, "Whoa, this is so magical."

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,160
 It's a typical apartment in the way that when I was reading the description of the bathroom,

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,040
 I go, "I've seen this bathroom a thousand times."

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,120
 It has the little window.

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,080
 Bathrooms always have a little window.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
 And it's like frosted glass.

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
 And it looks out into the lobby of this apartment complex.

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,160
 So that's just how it is.

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,360
 And it has like the window and then there's like a wire screen.

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,920
 And then it goes out.

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,480
 So it's not like you can just open the window and someone can crawl in through.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,400
 There's like that wire mesh to keep out bugs and perverts.

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,440
 So when you're in the bathroom, you see this little window and it's frosted.

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,040
 So you just kind of see indistinct shapes kind of move back and forth outside the window.

69
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,480
 It is looking into the lobby.

70
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
 So that's not the most comfortable.

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,160
 But again, you legally have to have one basic bathroom window.

72
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,920
 Now with her window, and this happens too, I have it on my bedroom or my living room

73
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
 window.

74
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,920
 There's a little hole in the netting in the wire netting the mesh.

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,560
 There's a little hole in the side of it.

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,800
 It's just wear and tear, right?

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
 You have a little hole.

78
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
 I have a little bug that visits me every winter.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
 I call him leafy.

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,800
 And every winter he walks through that hole and he just walks all over my apartment for

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,120
 like two or three months and then he walks back out.

82
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,080
 He's been doing this for like six years.

83
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,880
 So my recommendation is everyone should have a hole in their wire mesh because who knows

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
 what type of friend you're going to have.

85
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,080
 But this one, this one does not involve a little leaf bug.

86
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,520
 This involves something absolutely bizarre.

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:16,740
 So Monica would be taking a shower, hot water hitting her body, steam rising, soapy suds

88
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,800
 all over her body.

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,920
 And one day she's sitting there and she's showering in the window, the bathroom window

90
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
 is open.

91
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,280
 But not open wide, just probably about an inch, just enough to let some of the mist go out,

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,920
 just enough to not dive carbon monoxide poisoning.

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:42,560
 And this time when she's showering she looks up and she sees a finger poke through the

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,240
 hole.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,440
 And it starts to really freak her out.

96
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,080
 What she's looking at is someone from outside, someone standing in the lobby has stuck their

97
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,160
 hand up against the window and thrust their finger through the hole in the mesh.

98
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,560
 And it's just pointing at her.

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,640
 She immediately knows what's going on, there's some pervert standing in the lobby with their

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,160
 finger sticking out.

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,640
 And that's what her gut instinct tells her.

102
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,680
 But she starts to realize some stuff really really quickly.

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,200
 One, yeah there's a hole in the wire mesh but it's not big enough for a finger to go

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 through.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,440
 Sure, you could force your finger in but your finger is going to get real cut up.

106
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,040
 This finger she's looking at has no abrasions, it's not bleeding or anything like that.

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:43,080
 She said that the finger was so long, it was this long pale finger sticking through there.

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,000
 And she was thinking about this, she goes, "The way that the gap is and the way that

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 the window is, you couldn't get a finger that deep through that hole."

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
 She's trying to process all of this stuff.

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,720
 And this is actually an interesting thing, I don't know if I would have processed this

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,040
 right away, maybe she does because she lives in the area.

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,680
 She says on this floor of the apartment complex, because it's a bigger apartment complex, everyone

114
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,000
 on that floor was either black or Asian.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,800
 And this was a Caucasian finger.

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,760
 All of these clues together kind of take her back.

117
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,800
 First she's thinking of some pervert, some neighbor pervert, but she's thinking how would

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
 the finger get in without getting cut up?

119
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
 Whose finger is it?

120
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,760
 Someone on this floor who would be doing that.

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,040
 And as she's processing all of this stuff, the finger poking through the mesh begins to

122
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,160
 beckon towards her.

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,880
 You know, doing that curl thing like, "Come here, come here."

124
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,960
 She's watching this finger do that motion.

125
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,440
 And then it really hits her.

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,120
 The glass of the window would be frosted and you would see when someone was standing outside

127
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,040
 of the window, you'd see that non-descript outline.

128
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,360
 Remember, because it's only open two inches.

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,240
 She is realizing she only sees the finger.

130
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,920
 Not the hand, not the arm, not the outline of the person.

131
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,960
 There's just the finger beckoning her.

132
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,480
 "Come here, come here."

133
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,880
 And once she makes the realization that this could not be attached to any person, the finger

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,800
 slowly pulls its way back out of the hole.

135
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,520
 The sound of the shower.

136
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,480
 But no sound of movement on the other side of the window.

137
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,640
 No blur moving in any direction.

138
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,000
 The finger just pulls itself out.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,600
 And it's gone.

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,160
 She immediately jumps out of the shower, grabs a robe.

141
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,800
 I'm adding that detail.

142
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 She didn't say that.

143
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,480
 She immediately jumps out of the shower and she runs out into the lobby.

144
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,040
 It's completely empty.

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,120
 The reason I came across this story not too long ago, and I had said in a previous episode,

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,680
 I think it was like at the very end of season 16, I go, "What's scarier?"

147
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,600
 Seeing a ghost, I don't remember what the context of this was, but I said, "What's scarier?"

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,920
 Waking up and seeing a ghost floating down the hallway or just seeing the ghost toe.

149
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,360
 Just seeing a toe walking down the hallway.

150
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
 It's creepier.

151
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,160
 And the obvious answer is the toe, because we would make sense.

152
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,320
 We understand the lore of having a ghost, a ghost image, but just the body part.

153
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,840
 I covered a story a long time ago and it was just a floating, screaming, bloody severed

154
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
 head floating down the hallway.

155
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 I don't think it was floating.

156
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,960
 I don't think it was super harmless other than the fact that it was covered in blood.

157
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,840
 It just sat there at the end of the hallway, floating in midair, screaming.

158
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,520
 And that's way more terrifying than if you had seen a full ghost scream.

159
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,360
 Because at least this full ghost, you can make sense of it.

160
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,680
 Maybe this is some sort of memory, but just the head?

161
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
 Creepy.

162
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,080
 I do find it far more unnerving, because here's the thing.

163
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,520
 Let's say it was a full body apparition, and she could see a shape through the window,

164
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,280
 and she runs out and the hole is empty.

165
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,360
 She could go, "Well, maybe it was a ghost, or maybe it was my neighbor.

166
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,920
 Maybe my neighbor got a glove, maybe he was wearing like a Michael Jackson glove and was

167
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
 beckoning me."

168
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
 You could wrap your head around that, but just the finger poking through the...

169
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
 That's far more terrifying.

170
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,720
 And you would think, "What in the world?

171
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
 What does this finger want?

172
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,960
 I'm not going to follow it.

173
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,880
 What was it thinking was going to happen?

174
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,760
 Why was it doing it?

175
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,200
 Whose finger did it belong to?"

176
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,680
 It'd be one thing if the finger was just pointing, like that would be just kind of rude, but

177
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,800
 the fact that it was trying to beckon her.

178
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,520
 And now that I think about it, she did what the finger wanted.

179
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,640
 She ran out into the lobby.

180
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,160
 Zachary, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbenter Coptor.

181
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,000
 We're leaving behind this apartment complex.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 We're headed all the way out to Old Timie, Texas.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,520
 When I say Old Timie, Texas, I'm talking like 1530s to 1540s.

184
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,960
 So this is long before America was America.

185
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,520
 This is when you still had the natives ruling the continent.

186
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,440
 And you had inter-tribal warfare.

187
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,280
 You had some that had made these alliances and these great nations.

188
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,120
 And you had other parts of the continent that were far more hardscrabble.

189
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,040
 It was a very, very violent place to be in.

190
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,000
 And where we're at is near modern-day Corpus Christi.

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 There is a conquistador named Cabiza Divaca.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,480
 And he has actually written a tale, a true story of what happened to him and his men when

193
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,840
 they came to this area and they were exploring it for the first time.

194
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,680
 It's called the Saga of Cabiza Divaca.

195
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,760
 And it sounds really interesting.

196
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,200
 I wasn't able to read the whole thing.

197
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,120
 I got to read a certain portion that relates to this story, but I'll probably go back and

198
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,000
 read the rest of it because I just happened to read a couple of chapters.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
 I dropped into the middle of this when I was researching this story and I was like, "Wow,

200
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
 this is nuts."

201
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,400
 And he writes a story about how him and his fellow conquistadors made their way through

202
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
 Texas.

203
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,840
 Spoiler alert, it did not end up well for the conquistadors.

204
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:12,280
 They basically landed and they were exploring this and they made contact with a lot of tribes.

205
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,560
 Some of them were friendly, some weren't.

206
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,840
 You have a bunch of people who are coming there and being like, "Oh, this is our place

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
 now.

208
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
 Manifest destiny.

209
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,560
 We're here to teach to you about Jesus Christ and take all your gold and take all your land."

210
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,200
 And then he just got massacred.

211
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,080
 It would be the same thing as if anyone came to your town that you'd been in and starts

212
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,480
 trying to interfere with your belongings.

213
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,240
 Now back in, when this all started back in 1529, there was a conquistador named Hernando

214
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,560
 de Esquivel and he had actually landed with 80 conquistadors and they were making their

215
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,640
 way through the area and winter came.

216
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,520
 Now I know Spain is pretty moderate, right?

217
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,160
 It's just sitting there in Europe.

218
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,040
 It's southern Europe so you don't have all of the horrible snow stuff like Sweden.

219
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,720
 It's just like palm trees and abyss and all these raves constantly going on back in the

220
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,960
 14, 1500s.

221
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,520
 I didn't know Texas got this bad or I don't know how sturdy these conquistadors were.

222
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,240
 They made landfall back in 1529.

223
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
 It's winter time.

224
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,480
 79 conquistadors die that winter.

225
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,560
 Now I'm not saying they all got super cold and shivery and their armor fell off.

226
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,920
 Some of it could have been starvation.

227
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,640
 Some of it could have been warfare.

228
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,800
 But by the end of that winter, the only one left was Hernando.

229
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,680
 Now the Spaniards were constantly dropping off more conquistadors.

230
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,400
 So he's like, "Okay, I can't do this.

231
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
 All my bros are dead.

232
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,960
 Maybe I'll make my way through this land and I'll find some other dudes to hang out with."

233
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
 That doesn't happen.

234
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,720
 He actually gets taken prisoner by a tribe known as the Quvenes and he's like, "I'll

235
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
 do this.

236
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 It totally sucks."

237
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
 They turned him into a slave.

238
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
 They're like, "Ha ha ha.

239
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,200
 All your countrymen have been dead.

240
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
 Now you work for us."

241
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,360
 He's a slave and he goes, "I gotta get out of here."

242
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,200
 And he escaped to Mary Ames territory.

243
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,640
 Mary Ames was this other tribe in the area.

244
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,920
 So now it's August 1530 and there's another conquistador, Andres Durantes.

245
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,720
 He gets captured by the Aguante tribe turned into a slave.

246
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,080
 And they're really working him to the bone.

247
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,560
 He's like, "This totally sucks.

248
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,840
 I'd much rather have just been staying in Spain and going to that rave, take a pill

249
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,400
 and a visa and all that stuff."

250
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
 No.

251
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
 He's a slave.

252
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
 Washington stuff.

253
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
 He's like, "Oh man, this totally sucks."

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,160
 And he hears stories from those natives about a dude named Hernando who also used to be

255
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,320
 a slave and they're like, "Yeah, but he was a slave for that other tribe.

256
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,800
 They treat their slaves way worse."

257
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,020
 And he ended up escaping and hanging out with them Mary Ames.

258
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,200
 So Andres is like, "Oh dude, that sounds super dope.

259
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,680
 My buddy Hernando is going to be there at the very least.

260
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,680
 Maybe we'll be slaves together at the least, but maybe they don't have slaves at all."

261
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,240
 So he actually escaped and decided to go to Mary Ames territory as well.

262
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,080
 When he gets there, the Mary Ames tribe is like, "Oh yeah dude, it's another one of you

263
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
 guys.

264
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 Super dope."

265
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 He's like, "Okay, good.

266
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,440
 The rumors were true.

267
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,920
 They must have met Hernando if they recognized me."

268
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,600
 And he's like, "Yeah man, I was a slave.

269
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 That totally sucked.

270
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,160
 That other tribe dude has super-slaved me out, but now I'm here and maybe we can just

271
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
 hang out."

272
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,840
 The Mary Ames are like, "Oh yeah dude, we love hanging out.

273
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,160
 That's all we love doing."

274
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,440
 And then he goes, "Hey, can I meet Hernando?

275
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
 Because you know, he owes me five bucks.

276
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,600
 I want to meet this dude."

277
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
 And they go, "Oh yeah, no.

278
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,400
 I wish you could have, but we killed him a month ago."

279
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
 And Andres is like, "What?"

280
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, yeah.

281
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
 We killed him.

282
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,480
 Like he came here and he hung out for a bit, but then we just stabbed him to death."

283
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,240
 And Andres at this point is like, "I don't know if I might know why he didn't believe

284
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
 them, but he goes, 'I don't know.

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Can you give me some proof that he was here, that he was there?'"

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 They're like, "Yeah, yeah."

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,560
 And then they bring him his sword and his rosary.

288
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,720
 And Andres is like, "Oh no.

289
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,480
 Like he definitely was here.

290
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,200
 They definitely killed him."

291
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
 And he goes, "So let me ask.

292
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
 Why'd you kill him?"

293
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,200
 And they go, "Oh, you know, we have this tradition in our tribe where if we dream that you do

294
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,600
 something bad, we kill you."

295
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,000
 And Andres is like, "What are you talking about?"

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 He's like, "Yeah.

297
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,800
 And as a woman in our tribe, she just had a dream one night that Hernando was going

298
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,520
 to kill her son and she told us and that we went and we murdered him.

299
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,000
 We do that all the time."

300
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,200
 They even would kill their own children if they had a nightmare about the kids.

301
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,000
 Because it was a sign.

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,240
 The Mary Ames.

303
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
 This is such a fascinating tribe.

304
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,880
 The Mary Ames, they went extinct really early on.

305
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,000
 Like of course as the Europeans were coming into America, you had these massive wars

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,640
 and these conflicts and these fights over resources and these massacres wiped out a lot

307
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
 of tribes.

308
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,080
 But the Mary Ames disappeared before the Europeans really started to take hold on the continent.

309
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,960
 This was one of the most brutal tribes around.

310
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,000
 They would kill their own children if you had a nightmare the kid was going to do something

311
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,160
 wrong.

312
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,680
 They had a policy that they would be no baby girls.

313
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,000
 None.

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
 If you had a son, it was part of the tribe.

315
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,720
 But if you gave birth to a daughter, they killed it on the spot.

316
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
 People go, "Why?

317
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,560
 Why are you killing your own little girls?"

318
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,760
 And they go, "Oh, logic.

319
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,280
 That's why."

320
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,320
 Because if we have a little girl, there's a chance that she will fall in love with someone

321
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,120
 from another tribe.

322
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,760
 She will Romeo and Juliet then.

323
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,080
 We don't even know what Romeo and Juliet is.

324
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,600
 But she will Romeo and Juliet then.

325
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,980
 She'll go to the other tribe.

326
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,240
 That young girl who doesn't have any sense will start giving birth to children of the

327
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,480
 enemy.

328
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,880
 So to prevent that, we kill the girls right when they're born.

329
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,280
 You're standing in the tribe and there's a lot of women around.

330
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,040
 And you go, "Wait a second.

331
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,520
 How do you have all these women in your tribe if you kill all the baby girls?"

332
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,360
 They go, "Oh, we kidnap those women."

333
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,880
 Because we know those women, instead of giving birth to the enemy, when we attack another

334
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,720
 tribe, we steal their women and we make them our wives.

335
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,880
 And they give birth to young men.

336
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,520
 They're just very, very brutal.

337
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,640
 So Andres is now at the Mary Ames tribe.

338
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,320
 And he realizes that they are actually going to make them work for him.

339
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
 He becomes a slave.

340
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,600
 It's a little bit less of a slave than it was before, but a slave's a slave.

341
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,720
 And he's tortured constantly, not physically tortured, but emotionally tortured.

342
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,080
 As he said, every single day he'd be sitting there, he'd be digging for roots.

343
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,920
 And he would be petrified because, you know, everyone woke up there like, "Oh, man, I

344
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,240
 had a really bad dream last night."

345
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
 And you're like, "Oh, you're super scared that at any point you could be killed because

346
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,640
 someone had a nightmare about you."

347
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,880
 And he goes, "I don't know, every day or two I'd be sitting there, I'd be digging for roots."

348
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,800
 And one of the tribesmen, one of the Mary Ames would start walking towards him and he'd

349
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,120
 get an arrow ready and he'd kind of pull his bow back and he'd point it at him and then

350
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,800
 he'd go, "Ha ha ha ha, just kidding, man."

351
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 And then he'd walk away.

352
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,560
 They did this all the time, mock executions.

353
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,920
 And he was just in a constant state of panic.

354
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,000
 He had no idea when they were actually going to kill him.

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,480
 Now what happens is, Cabez de Vaca, he's the one who's writing this book, The Saga of

356
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,080
 Cabez de Vaca, he hears about this.

357
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,440
 He hears about Andres being a slave of the Mary Ames.

358
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,680
 He also knows the Mary Ames reputation.

359
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:44,440
 And he hears about two of his other colleagues, Castelio and Estevantio, and they're slaves

360
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,680
 of another tribe called the Iguaches.

361
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,200
 He wants to run a rescue mission on these dudes.

362
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,080
 And he's told, he's actually with one of the cool tribes, right?

363
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,160
 He lucked out.

364
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,400
 He wants to go a rescue mission and the tribe that he's with goes, "Listen, you can go rescue

365
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,800
 them, but you're going to get killed, you're going to get everyone killed."

366
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,880
 However, both of these tribes, they're hunter-gatherer tribes.

367
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,160
 And both of these tribes, at a certain point in the year, will travel to the land of the

368
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,920
 prickly pear cactus.

369
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,880
 So when they go to pick the cactuses, that's the best time to escape.

370
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,600
 They're on the move, everything's a little more chaotic, that's the time to escape.

371
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,440
 So Cabez is thinking about it and he goes, "Okay, I'm going to have to rescue my guys.

372
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,000
 I'm going to have to wait for that time period.

373
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,200
 However, I'm going to have to go undercover.

374
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,800
 I'm going to have to go undercover as a slave."

375
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,640
 So he actually surrendered himself.

376
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,200
 He gets in with this tribe and he tells the people, he tells his countrymen, "Listen,

377
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,560
 we're going to get out of here, but we're going to have to wait a little bit.

378
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,920
 We're going to have to be a little slavy for a while.

379
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,600
 We're going to have to be a little mentally tortured.

380
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,920
 We have to hope nobody has a bad dream until it's time to pick the prickly pear."

381
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,600
 That story is all 100% historical.

382
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,400
 That's actually from the historical document, the saga of Cabez and Divaca.

383
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,040
 The story that we're about to shift into does have some historical elements, but we also

384
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,160
 now get into the paranormal aspect.

385
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,700
 This was not written in the book, but this is one of those stories where we start to

386
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,720
 get the paranormal, the legend mixing with fact.

387
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,720
 And you have to wonder when does that blend happen?

388
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
 Is it all true?

389
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,040
 Is just some of it true?

390
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
 Fascinating story.

391
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,320
 The prickly pear harvest is happening.

392
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,200
 So it's time to escape.

393
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,560
 And at this point, all four of them have met up.

394
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,240
 You have Cabez, you have Andres, you have Castileo, and then you have the other guy,

395
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,760
 Estivanchio.

396
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,400
 It's time to escape.

397
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,040
 Everyone's picking the prickly pear cactuses.

398
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,840
 And apparently, like these conquistadors, like the cactus is so high, they're actually

399
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,000
 able to like hide in it and they just disappear into this field.

400
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And as they're running through this field, because they're dead, right?

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,760
 At this point, they're making a run for it.

402
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 They get caught.

403
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,440
 They see smoke off in the distance.

404
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,080
 Way off in the distance, they see smoke and they go, "Listen."

405
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,280
 At this point, at this point, it's possible we're going to run out there.

406
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,340
 We're going to become slaves from them, but we got to get away from these madmen.

407
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:21,160
 So they made their way through the prickly pear harvest and they find the avarice, another

408
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,440
 tribe in the area.

409
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
 Super friendly tribe.

410
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,400
 They really looked out.

411
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,320
 These guys are totally, don't feel like, "Hey, we don't know you.

412
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 You're totally strangers.

413
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,640
 You're covered in blood.

414
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,840
 You've probably been slaves, but why don't you come and join us?"

415
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,520
 Like, we can't guarantee you that we'll necessarily protect you if these guys raid our capital

416
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,680
 to start this whole war.

417
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,920
 But for now, I think everything's good.

418
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,120
 And what happened was Cabezza very, very quickly figures out, "Dude, we can stay with

419
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,800
 this tribe forever if we have a benefit to them."

420
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,840
 So they start to say, "We're healers.

421
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,400
 We have the ability to heal people."

422
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,560
 And they're healing people by doing the sign of the cross.

423
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,480
 And then they would breathe on the patient.

424
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,260
 And then the patient would hop up and they're like, "Yay!

425
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,440
 My sickness is gone."

426
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
 Now was that actually working?

427
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 Or was it placebo?

428
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,800
 Obviously it was a placebo.

429
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,240
 That's not how you heal people.

430
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,600
 But anyways, they're doing this and they start being called the "Children of the Sun" by this

431
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
 tribe.

432
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,080
 And that is super dope.

433
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,580
 And that is also historical.

434
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,880
 But then we have a book written called "Entities, Electromagnetism, and EMPs."

435
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,760
 And this book's written by Michael Mott.

436
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,120
 Very fascinating story of what happened at the Ivarres tribe.

437
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,280
 The Ivarres are telling Cabezza, "You know, you're a great medicine man.

438
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
 You're a great medicine.

439
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,960
 We've had a bunch of people die of breathing related diseases.

440
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,440
 But other than that, all these broken bones are healed and people are feeling more peppy.

441
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,680
 You're a great medicine man.

442
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,560
 You're not the first medicine man to come to our tribe."

443
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,280
 And Cabezza's like, "Oh, okay, you know, that's fine.

444
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
 I've kind of hurt my feelings.

445
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,080
 I thought I was special."

446
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,240
 They go, "No, 16 years ago, a bearded man showed up."

447
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,000
 Now right there, that's unusual.

448
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,240
 Native Americans have a hard time growing facial hair.

449
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,800
 It's just not in the gene structure.

450
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,880
 They have a really hard time growing facial hair.

451
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,320
 So the fact that a man with a beard showed up 16 years ago, you think, "Oh, it must have

452
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
 been another conquistador.

453
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,840
 It must have been someone else running this same scam."

454
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,920
 And they go, "Yeah, this bearded man walked into our tribe one day.

455
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
 What did he look like?

456
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,120
 Was he pale like me?"

457
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,880
 And they go, "Well, we don't know.

458
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,680
 Well, we don't know.

459
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
 What do you mean you don't know?

460
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
 He was your medicine man.

461
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
 Did he leave right away?"

462
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
 "Oh, no, no, no.

463
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
 He was here for a while.

464
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
 He actually came back a lot.

465
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,680
 He had a beard, but his face was misty."

466
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
 What?

467
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,120
 Yeah, yeah, you couldn't see his face.

468
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,600
 It was like this perpetual fog, this indistinct blur.

469
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
 So like looking through a frosted bathroom window.

470
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,360
 You couldn't really make out the details of his face, but he had a beard.

471
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,600
 They said when he first showed up, he would just appear in our homes.

472
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,400
 You'd wake up in the middle of the night and there would be the bearded man standing there.

473
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,200
 A bright light would fill up the room and you would be instantly paralyzed.

474
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,800
 He pulled out a quote unquote blazing brand.

475
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,920
 It was this rod that glowed.

476
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,440
 It was hot.

477
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,840
 And he would walk towards you with it.

478
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,080
 Mmm, mmm.

479
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,760
 People were waking up with this bearded man in their room and he would heal us.

480
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,120
 Well, he would heal the damage he caused.

481
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,320
 He would cut into us and pull out pieces of our body.

482
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,880
 We would see him pull out small pieces of our organs and then he would use that blazing

483
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,640
 brand to seal the wound.

484
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:29,720
 Sometimes we've even seen him cut off a man's arm, completely sever it, and then reattach

485
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
 it.

486
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,320
 Here's the thing, we're talking 1530s, 1540s, right?

487
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,000
 He understands this is impossible.

488
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
 This is impossible.

489
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,040
 European medicine is still really behind the times and they're still throwing leeches

490
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,600
 at each other at this point.

491
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,840
 But he also understands like, yeah, I'm sure you could, one of that would be great if you

492
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
 could reattach an arm.

493
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,600
 None of this stuff is making sense to him.

494
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,080
 It's so far advanced from any technology even he's used to.

495
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,160
 He's been breathing on people and doing the cross and he knows that's just kind of showmanship.

496
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,200
 But he's thinking this is impossible.

497
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
 This is absolutely impossible.

498
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,960
 But he's hearing the story and so Cabeza goes, where did this guy come from?

499
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,000
 I mean, I know he's just popping up in people's houses, but where did he come from?

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,880
 They go, oh, over there.

501
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,080
 Cabeza's kind of scared to look, but he follows the pointing finger off into the distance.

502
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,320
 There's a giant hole in the ground.

503
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,000
 The chief goes, we call him Malacosa.

504
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,080
 It means Mr. Bad Thing.

505
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:53,000
 He crawls out of the hole in the ground, paralyzes us and heals us again from the injuries he

506
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,080
 causes himself.

507
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,960
 None of this is making sense to Cabeza, but he can't stop asking these questions.

508
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
 He has to know.

509
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,400
 He's obviously afraid this thing might pop up.

510
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,120
 Now he hasn't been seen for 16 years.

511
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,400
 But Cabeza goes, you got to tell me more about this Mr. Bad Thing guy and the chief goes,

512
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,640
 here's the thing.

513
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,880
 We can never tell when he was going to show up, but a lot of times when we were holding

514
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,560
 our celebrations, he would just appear in the middle of the party watching us.

515
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
 Did he enjoy the celebration?

516
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,060
 Were we being too loud?

517
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,480
 Were we waking him up from the hole?

518
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,160
 We wouldn't know.

519
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,680
 But we started to realize when we were holding these celebrations, every so often we'd turn

520
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,040
 and look and there would be Mr. Bad Thing standing with us.

521
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,760
 Sometimes when he would appear, he would be dressed as a woman.

522
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,840
 Still had the beard, still had the blurry face, but wearing the garb of females.

523
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,320
 Now was it a disguise?

524
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,080
 Did he just like the fashion that season?

525
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
 Who knows?

526
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,200
 We don't really know anything about Mr. Bad Thing.

527
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,000
 We know that he appeared one night, he's been doing these surgeries, removing these

528
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,400
 pieces of our body from inside of us and reattaching limbs and dressing like women

529
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
 and hanging out at our parties.

530
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
 He might be a fun guy if he was hanging out at someone else's tribe, but he came here

531
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
 for quite a long time.

532
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
 He would just come and go.

533
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,600
 We haven't seen him in 16 years though.

534
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,880
 Cabeza goes, listen, that was a really cool story.

535
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,520
 I'm kind of spooky, I want to sleep away from the hole tonight, but to be honest, I don't

536
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
 believe it.

537
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,280
 He's a Catholic, obviously they believe in the devil, but even people who believe in

538
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,120
 the devil have a hard time accepting it as a physical entity, someone who can pop out

539
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,600
 of holes and chop people up and put them back together.

540
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,320
 Like even that is high level superstition.

541
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,280
 Most people, most Catholics, most religious people will believe in ultimate evil that

542
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,280
 can influence people, but actually the devil knocking on your door.

543
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,800
 Look, somebody stop me.

544
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,760
 That's a little much for a lot of people to believe in.

545
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,000
 And Cabeza says as much.

546
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,920
 He goes, do you have any proof that any of this is true?

547
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,720
 Which is a daring thing to ask, right?

548
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,280
 Remember, you're hiding out in this tribe.

549
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,040
 You escape these two other tribes.

550
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,280
 One of them, one of them currently right now is killing their own newborn daughters, but

551
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,880
 he has to ask, do you have any proof this happened?

552
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,160
 The chief goes, yeah.

553
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,720
 And in this tribe, there was a certain section of the tribe that was kind of isolated from

554
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
 the rest.

555
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,600
 And Cabeza and his conquistadors are walking towards this area and the chieftains leading

556
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,240
 them over there.

557
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,520
 And when they enter the dwellings in that part, there's a bunch of natives sitting there,

558
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:48,160
 fellow avarys with surgical scars burned into their body.

559
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,360
 Cabeza said even a few of them, you could tell it looked like their arms had been completely

560
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:10,120
 cut off and then crudely reattached with some sort of heat, with some sort of brand.

561
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,840
 Fascinating story.

562
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
 Fascinating story.

563
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,600
 Cabeza, that's all that I've been able to read in the book.

564
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,920
 Now again, in his saga, he does not talk about that.

565
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,920
 In his saga, he says, we did there, we did the healing thing for a while.

566
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,440
 They kept making us want to heal people.

567
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,960
 And eventually we got bored of that and we ended up leaving.

568
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,640
 In the official account, that's Cabeza's report, but we do have this other account of Mr. Badthing

569
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
 in it.

570
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,760
 And to be fair, the story of Mr. Badthing could be completely made up by this man, Michael

571
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,920
 Mott.

572
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,440
 There is also the possibility too, when you're writing a book in 1540, are you going to include

573
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,320
 the chapter that involves the devil popping out of the hole and chopping people up and

574
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
 reattaching them?

575
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,360
 Or is that the point where people go, you're nuts?

576
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,200
 I mean, how many prickly pears did you eat?

577
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
 That's not true.

578
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
 So it's possible that it happened.

579
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,480
 It's possible it's only made up.

580
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
 It's possible that it happened and he left it out.

581
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,800
 I don't think it would be something that after he sent the book off to the publisher, he's

582
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,440
 sitting at home and he's like, Gadzooks, I forgot to talk about Mr. Badthing.

583
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,960
 So I do want to finish reading that saga because there's a lot more to this book and

584
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,200
 the books available, the saga of Kabazid-e-Vaka.

585
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,320
 It's very, very fascinating.

586
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,280
 But yeah, the reason why I love this story is when you think about the totality of human

587
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,480
 history, right?

588
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,640
 We talk a lot about ancient aliens building the pyramids.

589
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,160
 We talk a lot about aliens building the Nazca lines.

590
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,520
 We look at these giant things and we go, how could humans possibly construct these things?

591
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,240
 Now, I don't believe that those were constructed by aliens.

592
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,760
 I've talked about it several times on the show.

593
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
 There's an amazing documentary.

594
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,040
 I'm going to put in the show notes called "Ancient Aliens Debunked from a Fan of the

595
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,520
 Ancient Aliens Theory."

596
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,680
 And he goes through it case by case and shows how humans can do that.

597
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,040
 I believe humans are far more ingenious than we give them credit for.

598
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,880
 But I do believe in aliens and I do believe that we've been visited.

599
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,000
 Maybe the aliens came from the ideas for the pyramids, but I think humans could build that

600
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 stuff.

601
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,880
 But when you look at the totality of human history and this idea of aliens visiting,

602
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,680
 would it be them coming down and drawing these giant monuments and leaving these things

603
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,960
 or would it be stuff like Mr. Badthing?

604
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,400
 Would it be individual alien encounters with tribes?

605
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,600
 Would it be something from Hollow Earth?

606
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,800
 Some not alien entity from another galaxy but something that's already here crawling

607
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,720
 up onto the surface?

608
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,080
 Because how would this would be not be like a spirit?

609
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,040
 This definitely falls into the realm of alien encounters.

610
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:43,640
 The indistinct face, the blurring of memories is very, very common in alien lore.

611
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:50,200
 The operations, like you never hear about the ghost doctor, the doctor who died in 1890s.

612
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,440
 And every so often he operates on people.

613
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,720
 That is outside of ghost lore.

614
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,720
 That's where you do get into alien lore, inner world lore, which again I think is really

615
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,040
 just alien lore but it starts off on the planet instead of coming from Alpha Centauri.

616
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,320
 This idea of sneaking into your bedroom at night, this idea of operating on you, this

617
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,040
 idea of having such a clinical detachment to you, the same way we have a clinical detachment

618
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,760
 to ants.

619
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,940
 Very, it's this hyper intelligent thing.

620
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,400
 So it would just walk in your room and cut you up the same way you may squish an ant on

621
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,000
 your kitchen counter.

622
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,360
 Very, very interesting story and to me very terrifying.

623
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,120
 Because this tribe was at its mercy.

624
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,000
 It may have been the most advanced civilization on the continent at that time, but it was

625
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,640
 no match for Mr. Badthing that could crawl out of this hole and operate with impunity,

626
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,240
 literally and figuratively.

627
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,960
 And we may have more technology nowadays, our buildings may rise up into the sky and

628
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,400
 we have all this communication device and technically we're smarter as a global consciousness,

629
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,320
 we know more about biology, we know more about math and astronomy, but we're still frail,

630
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,440
 fleshy human beings.

631
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:19,080
 We're probably less healthy than they were.

632
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,920
 And we'd still be no match for one of these guys.

633
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:30,360
 The story of Mr. Badthing should remind us that even on our own planet we may be second

634
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,040
 banana.

635
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,020
 Even in our own homes we may not be the king.

636
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:42,880
 Because at any point one of these alien intruders can just pop in and do whatever they want

637
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,280
 to us.

638
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,160
 Just when life was going good for you, just when everything seemed to be working, in a

639
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,920
 moment your entire existence could change.

640
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,920
 You went to bed happy and content.

641
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:14,920
 You woke up and a bearded man was standing next to you, cutting open your stomach.

642
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,800
 Who could have ever seen that coming?

643
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
 The Varys tribe did.

644
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,360
 But these stories have been relegated to legends.

645
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,320
 The tale of Mr. Badthing is long forgotten.

646
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:39,160
 But just because he's forgotten doesn't mean he's not still out there.

 I'm glad you listened to it today.
