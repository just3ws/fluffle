1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A brand new cryptid is spotted just a few miles from my home.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is it possible that you can summon a trash can by insulting it?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then we take a look at a young boy who has a terrifying experience in a swimming pool.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 As he watches the world fade to black, gasping for breath at the bottom of this public swimming pool,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 we are forced to ask ourselves the question, what really happens when we die?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 You heard it in the intro. We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Everyone give it up for Orm's Fane.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Woohoo! Yeah, come on in Orm's Fane. Come on in buddy.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Thank you so much for joining the Dead Rabbit Radio Patreon.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 He actually sent me an email not too long ago where he, before he's a Patreon supporter,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 where he was talking about getting the word out about the show, which I also appreciate so much.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It helps out so much. Or do both. Both is fine too, but preferably not neither, right?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Orm's Fane's gonna be our captain, our pilot of this episode, and he's specifically asked to drive the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So we're gonna go ahead, give him a little skipper uniform, little Donald Duck pants,

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 even has a little bow tie or whatever Donald Duck hat around his neck, spiked collar.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Orm's Fane take this Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught, our massive battleship, out of the dock.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We're headed all the way down the Columbia River.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 [makes noise]

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I don't know what noise a battleship's supposed to make. Probably none, right?

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Aren't they supposed to be sneaky? So you don't see it? You're just kind of like standing there,

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 standing there with your face on an island and you're like looking the other way and then you turn around, there's the giant battleship there.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I came across this story, and this story actually was recommended to me by a good personal friend of mine named Ryan,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 who lives in the area, so thank you Ryan for turning me on to this. This is a brand new cryptid.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 This is a brand new cryptid. I don't believe I've ever heard of this thing before.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But there have been these flyers popping up on the other side of the river. I live in Hood River,

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Oregon, and in Bingen, Washington, completely on the other side of the river to me.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 There are these flyers popping up that say, "Have you seen the ebony ape cat?"

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Now in Britain, you know, in America we have the Sasquatch, especially in the Pacific Northwest,

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 but in Britain, their big cryptid is a thing called the alien black cat. Not alien like space aliens,

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 but there are these panther sightings all over Britain. They've been there for decades.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's a little more lame than a big foot. You know, America got the big old hairy dude who disappears.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 They just got some cat. They just got some cat, but there are people who spend their entire lives trying to prove

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 that there are really these giant panthers walking around England. There's every so often a blurry photo shows up.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 That's about it. Maybe a big old panther claw. Maybe a half-eaten shepherd somewhere.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 But in America, it's really lame if that's the only thing you got.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 There you got Stonehenge, and that's about it. You got Stonehenge and then Rendlesham,

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 which was kind of like a low-rent Roswell over in Britain.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 The UFO didn't even crash. Not even that spectacular. It was just a big light.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Boring. But in America, we got the Sasquatch, and now you can have the big black panthers, Britain.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 We have the ebony ape cat. Ebony ape. I got to emphasize that because it's just weird.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It's an ape cat. This might be a publicity stunt, but I don't think it is.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I don't think it is because I've kind of looked into this company, and they're really into this stuff even before this whole ebony ape cat.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 There is a business across the river called Margie's Outdoor Store.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And next to it, I have to say this too because this might also inform a little bit of this, Margie's Outdoor Store.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I believe that you're selling outdoor supplies. I haven't visited it yet, but I will be going there.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Margie's Outdoor Store sells outdoor supplies, and then right next to it, an operation for much longer than the outdoor store, Margie's Pot Shop.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So this store has a bunch of camping gear, and then right next to it, you can go and get all of your marijuana needs.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Not flower pots, you can go and buy your previously medicinal marijuana, and now that it's legal, just marijuana.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So you have a pot shop right next to an outdoor store, and this store, when you walk into Margie's Outdoor Store, there's a giant sign on the window that says, "We want your paranormal reports."

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 They want to know about your Sasquatch sightings, your UFOs, your ghosts.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 If you visited Britain, did you see anything lame over there? And they have a little form you can fill out, and then hand it to them, and they're compiling all of this stuff.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 They're paranormal researchers.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And what they're working on right now is they've started to collect reports fairly recently.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 They really started collecting these reports in February of 2022.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So even though the sightings are a little farther back than that, they're not too far back.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 We're not talking about sightings from the 1800s.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 It's of the Ebony Ape Cat, and this is why they call it that.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 People have reported seeing in the forests in South Washington this massive black cat.

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 They say it's about five feet tall, and it's totally muscular.

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 It's like walking around. You ever see like a nature documentary, or you look at your window if you live in a wilderness reserve right now?

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 You ever see like a big cat move and its muscles are just rippling? Not like it's a domestic cat with all-flabby American cats.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I'm sure you had some muscles underneath all that fat, but they're just these raw predators.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 You can actually watch their muscles flex.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 This dude's super muscular, and he's covered. His whole body's uncovered in four-inch black fur.

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 But it's not like a little, like, the fur is hanging down. It's not like a little shaggy dog.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Apparently, the fur is sticking up, like bristling everywhere.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And, people are clearly making this up. That doesn't make any sense.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Also, how do you see how muscular it is if the hair's all sticking up? I don't know.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I have not seen one yet. Maybe it is totally apparent, but you see the hair all sticking up, and it has a six-foot long tail.

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So that's pretty big cat, right? I'm not six feet tall.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 If I laid down behind this giant cat, which I never would, maybe I'm playing dead and he's passing me,

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I'd be like, "Whoa, that's a quite a long tail."

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I guess I don't have to lay down next to it to tell how tall it is.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 But the reason why they call it the "ape cat" is some reports say that when you look into this creature's eyes,

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 it has "intelligent ape-like eyes."

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So that's why it's called this. Some reports say this thing is almost, you could almost define it as half-cat, half-ape.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 But I don't know why that's impossible. That's a totally different creature.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 That's not like a cat with ape eyes. That is, has cat legs and then big old monkey arms.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 However, monkeys are quite muscular, so I don't know, maybe it does have that.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Again, I've never seen one. There's been no photographs of this thing, but people have been reporting the "ebony ape-cat" in "Bingen,"

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 and it has these really intelligent eyes. Now, there have been no interactions that have been hostile.

89
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 People who watch this thing, the creature just kind of looks at them and steadies them.

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 You have to be pretty close to tell what type of eyes they have, right?

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That's not something that you're seeing across the cornfield in Britain.

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 That, I just want to keep ragging on their stupid black cats over there.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You got to be close to this dude to actually see what type of eyes he has.

94
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 He has intelligent ape-like eyes.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And they said, "What happens is when you're in the presence of this thing, if you have a compass, like a magnetic compass,"

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 which I think really all compasses are magnetic, "your little thing will spin."

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Woo-woo-woo, it spins around, spins around.

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 It's interesting they say this is not a joke. We actually want to know about this ebony ape-cat.

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Please come in. We're serious. Tell us about what's going on.

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And so I started looking at it. Ryan, thanks for sending that over to me.

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I started looking up more information on this other than the flyer,

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 and I found some articles in a local newspaper called the Columbia Community Connection.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 It's a local newsletter and local news website.

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And there are these interviews from James Zubsky.

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 James Zubsky? He's the chief operating officer of Margie's Outdoor Store.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And he said he talks about, "Since February we've been taking in these stories."

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And then he kind of relayed a lot of the information that I just relayed to you.

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I did think this was interesting because he also did another interview.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And these are sponsored interviews. He's paying the newspaper to run these interviews.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I don't know if that makes it more legit or less legit.

111
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But I could see myself doing something like that.

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 To get the word out, you give the newspaper clearly, Jason.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It's clearly not a community newspaper.

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Clearly, generally, the LA Times isn't like, "We'd really like to cover this crime.

115
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Maybe some money will get the word out about that suspect that fled the crime scene.

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 The police are like, "Ah, fine. Here's your money."

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I don't know how this newspaper works. I don't know if all the articles are sponsored,

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 but just to be clear, Margie's Outdoor Store paid them to do these interviews.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Okay? So anyway, Jason, come on.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 I think this is probably legit. I don't think this is a scam.

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I don't think this is a scam. I think they probably are seeing something up there.

122
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 But one of these articles was about why is the gorge, that's what this area is called,

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 why is this gorge considered such a paranormal hotbed?

124
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I mean, we have a ton of UFO sightings.

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Mount Adams supposedly has underground bases.

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 There's Colts. We had the big Colts in the Dalles that committed the largest

127
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 bioweapon attack in American history. There's that Netflix documentary about those guys.

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 We have all sorts of weirdos up here.

129
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And aliens, not too many ghosts, not as many ghosts as I would like.

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But we have a bunch of paranormal stuff.

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So the article saying your check is cleared, James, we'll go ahead and do this interview.

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And he goes, the reason why this is fascinating, the reason why I think the gorge has so much paranormal activity

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 is because of how it was created.

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 He says this whole area, because we're sitting in between two volcanoes here,

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Hood River and Benjen. You have Mount Hood in Oregon.

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 It's a massive volcano when you're flying in a plane.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Once you pretty much enter Oregon, you can see it.

138
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 So we have Mount Hood right here, and then we have Mount Adams on the other side of the river.

139
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 So we're literally in between two volcanoes.

140
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And he goes, about 15 million years ago, this entire area was created by massive volcanic eruptions.

141
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 You just had lava flowing over the landscape.

142
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 This entire region was born in fire and flame.

143
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And then about 15,000 years ago, the gorge itself, this river, the Columbia River that cuts through,

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 there's this massive gorge that separates Washington and Oregon.

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 There was a huge flood.

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Millions of gallons of water cut a swath through the volcanic bed, through the soil.

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So we have this really weird striations when you're driving through.

148
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 You can kind of just see the wall.

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Apparently, this is the only-- I could be getting this detail a little bit wrong,

150
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 because I've had other people tell me this in Hood River, and I haven't verified.

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 But in Hood River, in Benjen, this is the only national, like, registered national park that you can live in.

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 This whole area is like protected federal land, because it's so beautiful.

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And then you just have people living in it.

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And he goes, I think that's why you have so much paranormal activity here.

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And he had the birth of it with these two elements, fire and water, colliding together.

156
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And in the relatively recent past, 15,000 years ago, it's not long at all for the earth.

157
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 So who knows? Maybe that's an interesting theory of why there's so much paranormal activity.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Again, I would like a little more ghosts in the area.

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It's really hard finding haunted houses around here.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 But yeah, there are a lot of UFO sightings, a lot of weird cults, especially towards Mount Adams.

161
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So is there a new cryptid? Is this a brand new cryptid that's being spotted?

162
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And he seems to be, James seems to be the kind of the same attitude I am.

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 It's not necessarily a biological thing.

164
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Some people believe that Bigfoot is a biological creature that has like a mating season,

165
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 and defecates and eats and stuff like that.

166
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 He seems to think this is something paranormal, because you have the magnetic issues with the compass,

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 and because the area it's in.

168
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And I think that's a good reason why we can never find Sasquatch.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He may exist, but it's not a creature like a bear, or a deer, or a duck.

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It's something from somewhere else.

171
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 So, Ryan, thank you for sending that over.

172
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I'm going to go visit that store soon.

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 It'd be cool to get some more information about what's going on there.

174
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And if the podcast gets really, really wacky, it's because I also went over to Margie's Pod Shop.

175
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And I was like, hmm, Orm's Fang is taking me to the hospital for marijuana poisoning.

176
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 He's then going to take the keys to the Jason Jalopy out of my pocket,

177
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 and we are all going to drive out to South Dakota.

 [imitates car horn]

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I found this online. This story's really short, and it's an experiment we can all do together.

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Or maybe not. This might actually be some unholy curse that I'm about to unleash on myself.

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 But I found this posted online, and if you're wondering why the art for this episode,

182
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 wait this long, I waited like 15 minutes to tell you what's going on.

183
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 If you've wondered why the art for this episode is a red trash can,

184
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 it's because I found this online. It was posted by Dusted Like You.

185
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Dusted Like You.

186
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Posted this in the Urban Legends subreddit.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And he goes, hey, has anyone else heard about the trash can?

188
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Has anyone else heard about the red trash can Urban Legend?

189
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Nobody, nobody's heard about this thing.

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 But apparently it's a local Urban Legend, and I did a reverse Google image search on this trash can.

191
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I couldn't find that this had been posted anywhere.

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 There's a photo of this red trash can, and he says, in my area there's this Urban Legend,

193
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 that there is one particular trash can that got beat up a lot.

194
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 He got beat up a bunch, I guess people were kicking him around or throwing trash at him.

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 He's like, no, no, why am I getting trashed at me, even though that's what I'm designed for?

196
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 He got beat up a bunch, he got kicked around, so they started calling him the trash can.

197
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Because he got thrashed. Apparently the story took place in the 1980s, and people still use that word.

198
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And you look at the photo, not if you're driving a car, not if you're driving a car,

199
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 but if you look at this photo, it doesn't look too badly beat up.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Maybe it was emotional damage, maybe they picked on this trash can at school.

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 We don't know. But apparently this trash can, or the trash can, if you talk bad about it,

202
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 this is so weird, who knows if it's true, right?

203
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I kind of think this is legit, because when I see this stuff pop up on Reddit,

204
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I kind of look through their other stuff they're posting on, to see if they're also posting a bunch of pranks.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 This might be legit, we're going to find out.

206
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 If you talk bad about this particular trash can, you, or a member of your family,

207
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 in the not too distant future, will get a red trash can.

208
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And you go, "Well Jason, couldn't you just go out and buy a red trash can right now?"

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And yes, that is one of the ways you may get it.

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 But let's say you don't buy a red trash can, then someone may gift you a red trash can.

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 You may be sitting there and someone's like, "I've been over your apartment a couple of times, it's really disgusting."

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Here's a trash can. And it's red.

213
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You can get it as a gift, someone can trade you something for it, someone's like,

214
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 "Hey man, thanks for inviting me over to your dirty, dirty apartment. Here's a red trash can.

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I'm trading it for our friendship. I don't want to be friends with you anymore."

216
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Or maybe you're just walking around town and you find a red trash can.

217
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 The point is, is that if you talk trash, no pun intended, about this trash can, you'll get a red trash can.

218
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Or family member will get a red trash can.

219
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Again, you can just run out and buy a trash can, but let's not buy trash cans.

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 We're going to talk bad about this trash can right now.

221
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And we'll see. I will report back to you, I'll report back to you if anyone in my huge extended family gets a trash can.

222
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But let's see if I can get one, or find one.

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So trash can, I actually feel bad about that. I actually even think about the story, I feel bad.

224
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I was like, "Oh, it's just a trash can. You suck, dude. Red? Pfft. That's the lamest color of the prism.

225
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I swear that I could put more trash in a box than I could put in you.

226
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 A tiny box, a jewelry box, box for a little ring. You, as I'm visualizing you red trash can, you suck.

227
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And I hope that no one ever finds you. I hope you're sitting in a dump right now covered in rats.

228
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Not even rats. Earthworms. I hope you're full of rotten apples and earthworms.

229
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Trash can, red, trash can. Let's see if that-- Jason, come on, man. What does this show become?

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 You just spent three minutes trash talking to trash-- We're going to see what happens.

231
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 That's what this show has become. It's become experimental. Let's find out.

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 If I-- Listen, if my family gets a red trash can, I don't know if I would ever know about it.

233
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I'm going to go visit my mom in a couple weeks. Take a three-week break from the show.

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Maybe I'll walk in. If there's a red trash can, I will report it immediately.

235
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I will do like a mini-episode while I'm down there.

236
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But maybe I'll get a trash can. Maybe when we fall back, it'll be so full of disgusting stuff.

237
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I'm like, "No!" And I actually want to take back all that mean stuff I said about this cute little trash can, but I can't.

238
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 So let's see. And if you guys feel comfortable invoking the dark spirit of this red-- Who knows?

239
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Is it dark spirit? Is it cursed? I don't know. I guess I should have asked.

240
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I guess I should have figured that out before I publicly lambasted this trash can. Let's find out.

241
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I should also do this on my TikTok, too. That would be fun.

242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 That would be fun to spread the curse even further before anyone knows the full ramifications.

243
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 But, dude, what a fun urban legend. What a cool little test. What a short little story.

 Orm's Fang, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonicopter. We're changing gears.

245
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 If you thought me trash talking to trash can was upsetting, I hope you didn't. I hope you weren't crying.

246
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 We're about to get real dark. Orm's Fang, let's toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

247
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 We're saying goodbye to South Dakota and it's rapidly multiplying red trash cans.

248
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 We're headed all the way out to a public swimming pool.

 [imitates swimming pool]

250
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 The year is 1987 and we're outside of this public swimming pool.

251
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 We don't have a lot of information of where this pool is located, but I feel--

252
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 I believe that this story truly is a universal story.

253
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 It doesn't matter where this happens at, it may always resolve itself the same.

254
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I find these types of stories absolutely fascinating. Let's get into it.

255
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It's 1987. I found this story posted online by someone who goes by the name "TechSupport261."

256
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 In TechSupport, we're going to go ahead and call him Jimmy.

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Jimmy is a four-year-old boy in 1987.

258
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 He's at the local swimming pool with his family. Now, Jimmy couldn't swim.

259
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 He was relegated to hanging out in the kiddie pool,

260
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 where his little feet could touch the ground and he would sit there and play with the other kids

261
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 and splash each other and be like, "Wee!"

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 But of course, it's not super fun in there, right?

263
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It's like maybe two cubic feet of water and you just walk around in a circle

264
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 and then you just sit there like it's a spa.

265
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 You want to go in the big boy pool.

266
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And little Jimmy would get to go in the big boy pool.

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Sometimes he would have his little floaters on his arms and he would kind of float along.

268
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And then sometimes he would have a inner tube.

269
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He'd have like one of those circular floaties, which is great.

270
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I don't understand. I don't know if they still do them this way,

271
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 but when I was a kid back in 1987, they designed these with a giant hole in the middle,

272
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 which is the place there shouldn't be a hole because you fall through.

273
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Or an octopus wraps its arm around you and grabs you right through it.

274
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Now, I think nowadays it's a circle and there's like a little covering down there,

275
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 so you don't actually fall through.

276
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 But back in 1987, safety was not anyone's concern.

277
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Jimmy, when he goes in this big boy pool, if he doesn't have his arm floaties on,

278
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 he's in his little inner tube.

279
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And of course, you always want to go to the big boy pool.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So in this particular day, because he said his family did this all the time,

281
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 his family loved going to the pool. They were often down there.

282
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 He goes, this particular day though is very crowded.

283
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And he's in the big boy pool and he's in his little inner tube

284
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 and he's floating through the crowd of people.

285
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And they're splashing each other and swimming.

286
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Apparently, I'm sure some people are actually trying to breaststroke their hit

287
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 and everyone, they're like, get out of my way.

288
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I'm currently competing in the Olympics.

289

 You're like, ah, people are doing all this stuff, horsing around.

290
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 He's in this little floaty inner tube and he finds himself in the middle of the pool,

291
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 like dead set in the middle of the pool.

292
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 It's about five and a half feet deep where he's at and he's less than that.

293
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 He's not that tall, but he's in a little inner tube.

294
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 He's not worried about what's underneath the water.

295
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 He's on top of the water. He's soaking in the sun.

296
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 He just costed an Olympian his gold medal. He's having a great day.

297
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 But then, because these things are so poorly designed,

298
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 shock of shockers, he falls through the giant kid sized hole in the floaty

299
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 in this little inner tube and he's now underwater.

300
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Jimmy, four years old, little four year old boy, doesn't know how to swim

301
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and he's starting to sink into the water.

302
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Now, he says, I remember clearly looking up and seeing a ton of adults.

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 The pool was so crowded.

304
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I could see all these adults and as I'm falling deeper and deeper in the water,

305
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 he goes, I remember reaching up, thinking, if I can touch one of them,

306
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 if I can grab one of them, they will look down and see me

307
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 because through all their revelry, all their swimming and hooting and hollering,

308
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 they're throwing the inner tube around to each other.

309
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Frisbee fight!

310
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 They don't notice him under there.

311
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 If I can just grab one of them, touch one of them,

312
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 they'll look down and see this little boy at the bottom of the pool.

313
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But his little hand is reaching up and as he floats further and further to the floor,

314
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 no one sees him.

315
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 He's now too far away to grab one of these people.

316
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 No one knows Jimmy is drowning.

317
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Jimmy starts to convulse.

318
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 He has no air.

319
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 He's trying to hold his breath.

320
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 The oxygen is leaving his lungs.

321
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And then all of a sudden, he realized he no longer had to breathe.

322
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Like his body just said, nope, you don't have to breathe anymore, Jimmy.

323
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Because you can't, there's nothing you can do about it, so just relax.

324
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And as this little boy is at the bottom of the pool, he goes,

325
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I remember being down there and I realized I didn't have to breathe anymore.

326
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 But I should try to move.

327
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 I got one last chance here because my body is shutting down at this point.

328
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And he says, he goes, I remember walking across the bottom of the pool.

329
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I figured maybe I could get to a wall.

330
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Maybe I could get to a wall, maybe climb up, maybe get to a ladder.

331
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 But as his little feet are walking along the bottom of the pool,

332
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 suddenly he is laying on the side of the pool.

333
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Like he's like up on a towel laying there and his mom is sitting over him.

334
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And he sits up.

335
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 He's like, what happened, mom?

336
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 How'd you get me out of there?

337
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Is everything okay?

338
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And his mom looks down at him and goes, what are you talking about?

339
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 He goes, I was in the water.

340
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I was drowning.

341
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 And he goes, my mom looked at me like she had no idea what was going on.

342
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And he realized in this moment, and he still thinks about this 35 years later,

343
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 he goes, when I came out, like when I woke up sitting next to my mom,

344
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I wasn't gasping for air.

345
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I wasn't choking up water.

346
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I was just there, alive, with no physical effect of drowning.

347
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I mean, his body was shutting down and now he just sits up and goes, ah!

348
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 There was no gasping of breath.

349
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 There was no refilling his lungs of air.

350
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And he's thought about that day over the years.

351
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And he's wondered if he died at the bottom of that pool

352
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 and his consciousness shifted to a reality where he didn't.

353
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Because what he quickly realized after waking up next to his mom,

354
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 in this reality, he knew how to swim.

355
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 That would make all the difference in the story, right?

356
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 You could have two jimmies in two different worlds.

357
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 One of them, four years old, had been taught to swim, at least the basics, right?

358
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 But the jimmy from the original timeline hadn't either, didn't want to swim,

359
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 parents couldn't afford the lessons, whatever.

360
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 I mean, you're going to a pool all the time, you don't want to teach your kids how to swim,

361
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 but when he woke up, he knew how to swim in this world, in this reality,

362
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 which would make all the difference.

363
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 It's a fascinating read.

364
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And I think in the show notes, he begins interacting with other people,

365
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 because other people start sharing similar stories.

366
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I remember drowning, and then I remember just not drowning,

367
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 and not having any water in my lungs.

368
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, so he goes, I can't believe other people have experienced this before."

369
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Something so similar to his story, right?

370
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But we've talked about this before, and this is pretty big in the paranormal community.

371
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Quantum immortality is the term.

372
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 The idea that when you die in one universe, you shift to another one,

373
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 because you cannot exist in a universe, this is the guiding principle to it,

374
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 because you cannot exist in a universe you cannot consciously observe,

375
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 you will go to a universe you can consciously observe.

376
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It's a very, very interesting concept.

377
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 We've talked about it a lot on the show, most famously.

378
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 This is how I found about it.

379
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 That nutcase, John McAfee, did a big article where he put a gun to his head,

380
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 and was playing Russian roulette, and he's like, "Quantum suicide, I can only be in universes where

381
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 I don't blow my brains out in front of this vice-reviewer."

382
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And then eventually he did kill himself in a jail cell or something, right?

383
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 If I remember correctly, or some people think that he was murdered.

384
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Quantum immortality.

385
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Fascinating concept.

386
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 The issue that I've had with it is,

387
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 it's fine when you're in, well, I'm not saying drowning four-year-olds is fine,

388
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 but it's fine if you're four and you're drowning in a pool,

389
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 and then you wake up and you're not drowned, and you know how to swim.

390
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 But what happens when you're 85 years old with two broken hips,

391
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 and you're hooked up to life support, and your heart gives out,

392
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and then you shift into a reality where you're an 82-year-old person, two broken hips,

393
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 and your heart just has an extra minute left, and you're hooked up to all life support,

394
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 and then you shift out of that universe.

395
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 So another old body with broken hips and a heart that just has an extra minute,

396
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 like that is the interesting and terrifying thing about quantum mortality.

397
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Is it what we would think of as hell?

398
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Because if this happens when you're four, you jump into a four-year-old body,

399
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 you're good to go.

400
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 But imagine being 92 years old and your body's shutting down,

401
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 and you're just constantly hopped to realities where your body hasn't shut down yet,

402
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 but guess what? You're 92 years old.

403
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 You're in the hospital and your body's about to shut down,

404
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 and it would be an unending series of fear of death constantly shifting forward and forward.

405
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Now, I've had my own interactions with what I believe is quantum immortality.

406
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Once I almost got my head crushed by a bunch of really, really heavy boxes

407
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 that I had stacked up haphazardly next to my bed,

408
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 and I remember having a dream.

409
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Have I ever talked about this on the show?

410
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I remember having a dream that I rolled over in my bed,

411
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 and there was someone else in my bed with a real kind of creepy look on their face,

412
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 and something touched me, touched the side of my face as they were looking at me,

413
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 and I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs,

414
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 and what had happened was all of these boxes, these very, very heavy boxes,

415
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 I don't know if they would have immediately killed me,

416
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 but they would have done some serious damage to my skull,

417
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 had fallen inches from my head,

418
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 and inches might be too generous,

419
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 because what I believed at the time was that when the boxes fell,

420
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I hit my face against the box, and that was the thing touching me.

421
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 But I was screaming at the top of my lungs,

422
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 and I was living with my aunt at the time, her little dog was barking,

423
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 barking outside my door.

424
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 My aunt had no idea what happened, she didn't hear me yelling or anything.

425
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 What I've always, I haven't always thought,

426
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 I've thought that maybe there was a reality, that was me shifting.

427
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Like, there was a reality where I was killed underneath those boxes, they, yeah,

428
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 they did not kill me instantly, they, they could have.

429
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And I could have shifted to a reality where I was just an inch or two away.

430
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Or again, less than that.

431
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 So, that's all well and good, right?

432
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Shift from one Jason to another Jason, still 35 years old.

433
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Haven't even hit my peak yet.

434
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 But what happens when you're on your deathbed?

435
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 But then I, I, I, I don't know how to answer that question,

436
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 and I started to think that maybe that's a little too,

437
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 maybe that's a little too negative, right?

438
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I mean, it's logical.

439
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 If you look at quantum immortality, you take it to its end result,

440
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 that's what would happen, because we don't have a documented case of someone who's 92 years old

441
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 shifting into the body of a four-year-old.

442
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Right, even with reincarnation, right?

443
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 It's someone else who passed away in World War II,

444
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 they shot down a bunch of Japanese planes,

445
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 and then they crashed into an island, made sweet love to Amelia Earhart,

446
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 got bit by a Komodo dragon, and died.

447
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And now there's some three-year-old in Desmoine, Iowa.

448
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 It's never, oh yeah, I remember being an old man,

449
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 I remember being me as an old man,

450
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 and dying of a heart attack, because I was making love to Amelia Earhart's long-lost relative,

451
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 and then I became three years old again, we don't have a documented case of that.

452
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 But what if that works?

453
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Has there ever been a case of self-reincarnation?

454
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Somebody living out their full life,

455
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 dying, and then becoming themselves as a kid again,

456
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 and remembering it?

457
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Because that's the only way that quantum immortality would be a happy ending.

458
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 These stories are so fascinating, right?

459
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 This kid dying and then shifting into a reality where he knows how to swim,

460
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 and we've covered other stories like quantum immortality as well, but...

461
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 If the end result is us just in hospital beds, for eternity,

462
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 hospital beds, if you're lucky, right?

463
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 That's all go gruesome, that's the fate worse than death,

464
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 dying over and over again, and just getting a little bit older,

465
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 and a little bit older, and a little bit older.

466
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Is there a case of someone living a full life, and then living it again, and again, and again?

467
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Their same life, not reincarnating as someone else.

468
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 It's so interesting, because when you look at the world of paranormal,

469
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 there's people like us that are like, "Whoa, there's a new cat that might have monkey eyes."

470
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And most people are just going to be like, "What are you talking about?

471
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Did you go to Margie's pot shop again?"

472
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 But the one paranormal activity that everyone has to face is death.

473
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 It's the definition of paranormal.

474
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Death itself is normal, but what happens afterwards,

475
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 even the idea of annihilation, even the idea of never existing again,

476
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 is paranormal, because there is no way we can comprehend not existing.

477
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 You just can't.

478
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Death is the one paranormal event that eventually everyone will have the answer for.

479
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 You may hate UFOs, you may not believe in Sasquatch, or ghosts, or anything like that,

480
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 but in the end, we will all find out the truth about what death is,

481
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 and what lies afterwards.

482
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 It's a terrifying concept, but it's one that we grapple with every single day.

483
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 And to me, the hopeful answer is a paradise in the afterlife.

484
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I also would love to reincarnate, because I love Earth so much.

485
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 I love life so much, and this is all I know.

486
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Paradise terrifies me, honestly, because I don't understand it.

487
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 But I understand this, understand life.

488
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And the idea of dying and shifting to another universe, that's even cooler,

489
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 because then I just get to keep being me,

490
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 instead of being a branch or a bug or something like that.

491
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Reincarnating as somebody else.

492
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 I don't know, right? I don't know. I don't know that dude!

493
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 I know me. I know all my friends and my family and stuff like that.

494
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 The quantum immortality throws a monkey wrench into even that idea of reincarnation,

495
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 where you're basically shifting over into another reality, as yourself.

496
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 The whole idea is completely fascinating.

497
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Whether it's any of these theories or something even more unknowable to what happens to us after we die,

498
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 it's the one mystery that everyone from a paranormal investigator to a die-hard skeptic

499
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 will someday investigate for themselves.

500
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 I only hope that the answer isn't utterly terrifying.

501
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 But I guess we'll find out someday.
