1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 A creepy, true crime case has finally been solved.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
 Or has it?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,880
 And then we often ask the questions, alien life does it exist, has it visited Earth before?

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,040
 And most of the time these questions are asked and answered by people who have never gone

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,800
 to aliens home turf, aka space.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,400
 So what happens when one of the most decorated astronauts of the US space program comes back

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,440
 to Earth multiple times and tells his bosses the truth is up there today on Dead Rabbit

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:46,920

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,640

20

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,720
 I know a lot of you guys do it because we've seen massive increases in this show just in

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,360
 the past week so thank you thank you very much for those of you who are doing that.

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,480
 Wobb I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider we're gonna leave Dead Rabbit Command

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,640
 we're gonna take a nice leisurely journey because this first story is a little rough

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:02:00,520
 we're gonna take a nice gentle glide all the way out to Durango Colorado

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,160
 and as we were headed out there I'm sure I'm sure you heard the sound of a couple people

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,120
 letting go of Wobb's ankles they're like now I'm good I'm good I don't want to hear this

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,760
 story this story is fascinating to me it's one of my favorite true crime cases and I've

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,400
 been just with lack of a better word digesting every bit of information that pun will not

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,720
 make sense now the people who are plummeting away from the hair hang glider they're like

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,400
 I get it because they're aware where this story is going but I've loved this story it's

32
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,040
 a tragic true crime story so as much as you can love a story like this but the mystery

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,720
 involved has kept me the edge of my seat and I'm not saying any of that to downplay the

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,960
 real tragedy of this story it's just as a true crime aficionado this one tell my attention

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:56,200
 for quite a while it's been this ongoing process so November 18th 2012 in Durango Colorado

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,200
 there is a man named Mark Redwine a divorced father of a couple boys from a couple different

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,540
 marriages and he would have custody of his kids from time to time he was legally considered

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,560
 a good pop so the court gave him custody on certain dates mandatory custody whether or

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,400
 not the kids wanted to go they were legally obligated to go they had to that's the worst

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,040
 it's almost like prison at that point now you hope that the kids would come to love their

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,640
 dad despite all of his flaws like yeah mom and dad couldn't stay together sons but I

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,760
 still love you you know it takes a court mandated order for to give me the time to tell you this

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,700
 and maybe over time you will learn to forgive me for cheating on your mom or whatever but

44
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:50,860
 in this case the obligated court ordered visitations were not doing Mark Redwine any favors because

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,820
 a couple years ago his sons Corey Redwine and Dylan Redwine are at his house and he's

46
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,700
 asleep it's late at night and they get his laptop I don't know it's very the story is

47
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,320
 very interesting I don't know what sparked them to do this maybe it was just childlike

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,680
 curiosity you find a laptop you're chasing his son along with wanting to use laptops what

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,120
 are you talking about what are you some sort of Luddite all of a sudden they had his their

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,320
 dad's laptop is locked and they bypass his security lock that's one and then they take

51
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,280
 the laptop into the bathroom because they don't want the dad to know that they're on his laptop

52
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,180
 maybe they're expecting to see porn maybe they're like oh dad might be into boobs right

53
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,220
 you think dad's into boobs now I think dad's more of a butt person that they were having

54
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,580
 this super disgusting conversation we shouldn't be but maybe they want to look at some porn

55
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,140
 see what their dad who who who I do not I don't know if they're trying to find their dad's

56
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,540
 porn but I'm gonna tell you right now that's what they found I don't know if that's what

57
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,020
 they said out there just trying to download some V bucks app and they found their dad's

58
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,200
 porn now it's not as bad as you think usually when we talk about stuff like this like finding

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,280
 their dad's porn it's child porn it's not that bad but it is so gross it's so gross

60
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,600
 that I go to true crime websites all this is so funny I with bated breath waited honestly

61
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,640
 like half the year like six seven months for these photos because although crime websites

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,820
 will constantly show video footage is like a young woman's walking down New York and

63
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,620
 a man walks up and shoots her in the brain it's just like it's like an autoplay you go

64
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,020
 to the website and this is a little like web m or this gift of this woman getting blasted

65
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,940
 they refused true crime websites at least the ones I want to refuse to show the photos

66
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,540
 that they found they would describe them but they would barely describe them they would

67
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:01,840
 just say a sentence and the sentence wait what I want to see these photos and then finally

68
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,240
 maybe like in June it was very very recently June of this year they said okay guys there's

69
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,120
 a website to go to every day it's called crime online dot com it's really cool crime website

70
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,320
 they go okay we're going to show you the photos but these photos are so disgusting we're not

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,140
 going to host them on our website we're going to have a link to someone else's website so

72
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,980
 get them while you can guys they may end up taking these down here were the photos these

73
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,420
 boys because they boys take the laptop into the bathroom they see these disgusting photos

74
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,940
 and Cole the older brother pulls out his cell phone and starts taking pictures of the photos

75
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,740
 now this whole part of the story is happening like a 2010 I think 2011 so it's like really

76
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,880
 not the best film quality camera but it actually makes the photos so much more creepier and

77
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,560
 I with with great suspense I know you guys are waiting for this the photos are imagine

78
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,060
 you find these photos of your dad the photos of anyone would be gross finding these photos

79
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,800
 of your roommate would be unsettling but if they if you found them of your dad and you

80
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,300
 were trapped in his house right now you're both minors it'd be horrifying what they find

81
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:29,620
 are photos of this there's a photo of Mark Redwine and he's wearing women's clothing

82
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,260
 that's fine that's not that's crazy thing a man's ever done it's not that he's wearing

83
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:44,280
 women's clothing just to build the mood and he has this brown material all over his face

84
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,000
 you're like I didn't know my dad was in chocolate and fish the annatto and then there's like

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,680
 a close so I'm going off memory I'm already seen him twice and they're disgusting so it's

86
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,480
 a little bit closer and you can see more chocolate someone is face that there and the third photo

87
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,860
 looks like it looks if if a black metal album from Sweden has their cover people would go

88
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,740
 too much bro too much that one with your bandmate you committed suicide yeah that was that was

89
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:26,100
 okay but this one it's a close up of a man of not a man Mark Redwine with a poop filled

90
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:32,500
 diaper this was described all the time on crime online like he did Cheerios I'm like

91
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,840
 I want to see those photos it's a picture of a man with a poop filled diaper stuffed in

92
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:46,160
 his mouth and easy the poop there you go Jason Jason you haven't seen two girls one cup Jason

93
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,360
 I've seen way worse stuff on this website blah blah blah blah well here's the thing one probably

94
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,220
 yeah I have seen two girls one cup is absolutely disgusting I hated it I didn't finish watching

95
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:05,340
 him super gross but it was super glossy look like they shot it at evil angel studios or

96
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:12,200
 some porn place right this was this because the cinematography of it was so grainy and

97
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:21,580
 made it even creepier and it was two girls one cup right you're like Rebecca no it was

98
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,180
 just two models that got paid to do that they were probably into it and they're having a

99
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,500
 good time it was disgusting I think it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization

100
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 if you ask me I think that you talk about 9/11 everything changing I think two girls one

101
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,900
 cup I should have never said on that I actually think that that was the first push towards

102
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,940
 oblivion for civilization I really think of I've never seen it so widely accepted something

103
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,180
 that disgusting that was real but anyways you know to this day there's a lot of podcasts

104
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,620
 called like two girls one ghost or two girls one true grand podcast and they're playing

105
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:03,060
 off that it's that much of a meme and I do think that that was the beginning of the end

106
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,420
 of civilization but I will talk about interesting concept try to remind me I'll probably forget

107
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,300
 to talk about it but I'll never forget I do I do think that I think that was a site op

108
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,500
 think that was that was promoted on it naturally not a naturally because of the fetish I think

109
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,940
 that it shouldn't have gone viral and it did and I think someone or a group was behind it

110
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,100
 for some reason or another but we'll talk about that another time were we talking about oh

111
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,980
 yeah yeah poop poop eat a poop filled diapers I forget what we're talking about I just talking

112
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,460
 about two girls one cup and so it's not only is it somebody you know in this video or these

113
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:51,780
 photos and it's it really gross cinematography which does add a creepiness layer to it these

114
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:59,060
 photos may have led to a murder and let me add there is one more photo to of him wearing

115
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,780
 the poop filled diaper that's a de-escalation though after eating it after you're eating

116
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,100
 it he's like num num num now you know it'll be really gross if I use it for its intended

117
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,260
 purpose but I think the prosecutor because the photos were laid out the prosecutor probably

118
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,020
 should have shoveled them to make it like less gross to most gross but maybe the maybe the

119
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,700
 prosecutor hates sitting in poopy diapers and so he's like that was the worst photo guys

120
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,060
 I almost didn't show that to you and everyone's like as he's eating he's eating chipotle at

121
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,460
 the trial he's like as long as I have to sit down and poopy diaper everything's a okay

122
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:42,380
 creepy story but this has led to murder allegations November 18th 2012 in Durango Colorado Dylan

123
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,260
 red wine has to go spin Thanksgiving with his dad Mark and he doesn't want to he doesn't

124
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,180
 want to for two reasons one one the photos I mean you just don't visit a guy who you're

125
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,660
 stuck with like if you have a friend who's into this and you can leave you can leave

126
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,820
 whenever he starts going I'm hungry you're like okay dude I'm out he's reaching for the

127
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,660
 denizen's chili he's like making a marshmallow diaper you can leave but you don't want to

128
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,780
 be stuck with someone who's eating poop I'm just assuming my audience could be like I'm

129
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,860
 unsubscribing to this podcast he obviously doesn't get me he doesn't understand the

130
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,540
 deliciousness of my fetish you'd I you wouldn't want to be there but also he was hated the

131
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,460
 way that his dad was talking to his mom he could hear him arguing over the phone and

132
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,900
 he was like this is just a piece of trash you don't want to be with him the mom is like

133
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:35,020
 it's court ordered you have to go November 18th 2012 he goes to Colorado Mark Redwine

134
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,740
 picks him up they go to I think a McDonald's in a Walmart there's surveillance footage

135
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,380
 of them going to a couple different locations in 956 a text message was sent from Dylan's

136
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:56,380
 phone and since then no one has ever seen Dylan again and that's where the mystery stood

137
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:05,660
 from 2012 to 2013 so that first half a year first six seven months you had Mark Redwine

138
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:12,780
 go and listen we got in a fight we did but Dylan ran away he just left the house you guys know

139
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,340
 that he hates me first off officers do you have anything to eat do you have anything to eat

140
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,100
 because they happen to be can we stop at the maternity ward on the way to the police station

141
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,740
 I'm famished but then he goes listen he ran away and who knows what happened to him we live in

142
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,660
 this mountainous region we're in Colorado for crying out loud there's like bears and mountain

143
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,620
 lines in the area and the cops are kind of like looking at each other and they're like yeah I

144
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:42,620
 guess but they don't have enough evidence to charge him in 2013 though about five miles away

145
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,420
 from the Durango household of Mark Redwine they find bones a couple bones some clothing

146
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:56,300
 and they test it and they are the bones of Dylan Redwine and at this point Mark Redwine goes I

147
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,100
 told you guys that I told you I told you guys exactly where the location of the body would be

148
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,100
 no he goes listen I told you he ran out it was most likely he got attacked by some sort of

149
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,220
 animal which is rare but not unheard of and he's a 13 year old boy who's running into the wilderness

150
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,300
 anything could happen he goes on the Dr. Phil's show Mark Redwine goes on the Dr. Phil's show with

151
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,580
 which god bless Dr. Phil's heart but I really wish his shows were available online I get it

152
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,300
 it's not an easily accessible show to watch but I watched a couple clips from this episode

153
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,300
 and it's what you would expect from this type of story his family saying that he's gross and a

154
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,500
 murderer probably more they probably more accusing him of murder first and then him going I didn't

155
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,740
 do it I didn't do it he took a polygraph test and then I couldn't find I couldn't find the

156
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,140
 polygraph test but I'm assuming he passed it or was inconclusive or anything like that because

157
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,260
 because he's still walking around free in 2013 in 2015

158
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,940
 they find Dylan's skull

159
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,940
 and when they're looking at the skull they see what appears to be blunt force trauma

160
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:14,620
 now could a wild animal cause blunt force trauma it's unlikely like the swat of a bearish paw

161
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,860
 that's like about 10 baseball bats hitting the side of your dome but it's enough for the coroner to

162
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,700
 rule he probably got his head caved in and it probably wasn't a wild animal in 2017

163
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:35,420
 Mark Redwine is finally arrested a good five years after the event his disappearance

164
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,780
 and then prosecutor Fred you know prosecutors defense lawyers they're really they're salesmen

165
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,860
 they're speech givers they're politics that's why lawyers make sedgeka politicians I want to read

166
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,900
 you this bit of prosecutor Fred Johnson's very short quote here talking about this trial or

167
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:58,220
 talking about this event I love this type of stuff quote after 9 56 that evening all communication

168
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:05,900
 from Dylan Redwine stopped that night under the shadow of middle mountain the defendant murdered

169
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,460
 Dylan Redwine unquote that's really cool I'm not saying that it's cool that he murdered this kid

170
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,660
 but it's very visual it's very evocative isn't it and apparently he also lived near where the

171
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,740
 dwarfs hide all their gold middle mountain blood all over the house there's going to be blood all

172
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,380
 over your house it's just going to happen he's like oh no that blood came from when he was clipping

173
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,260
 his finger and he got too close to the skin that was when he stepped on that nail and you can kind

174
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:40,220
 of explain a bunch of stuff his there's such an interesting trial because it does make sense

175
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,340
 that a kid running out into the wilderness could die of natural causes and the evidence against

176
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,460
 mark red wine was there was blood of the boy in his house a house that he lived in

177
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:59,660
 that he drove his atv down a road where they eventually found the body it was an av it was

178
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,460
 an atv road it wasn't just some random road it was like where you'd go atv and the family saying he

179
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:12,620
 didn't seem too concerned about finding dylan and he was the only one with the motive he's found

180
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,700
 guilty based on that's so circumstantial now I think he was guilty I do think he was guilty but I

181
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,020
 don't think there would be enough evidence there to prosecute him for that he was just found guilty

182
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,140
 in July 2021 and I missed it because I was on vacation I wasn't reading anything I've been

183
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,460
 waiting to cover this story but I wanted to wait till the end of the trial I wanted to wait until

184
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,620
 it was done before I shared it with you I wanted to find out what the conclusion was but he's going

185
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,500
 to be sentenced on october 8th I mean obviously the sentence is either life in prison without parole

186
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:49,180
 or death fascinating story though I love it because it's a mystery it lasted for years

187
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:56,140
 it's actually a pretty good alibi that's really good defense I didn't do it the bears did and it

188
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,860
 would make in that area it's not gonna work in downtown Sacramento it's a good defense it is a

189
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,900
 good defense and the weird fetish angle to it as well if it was a guy just killing his kid you

190
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:16,220
 it happens every single day but oh man those photos so a true mystery it was he really the guy I

191
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:22,940
 think so but who knows the truth of the story could still be out there on middle mountain somewhere

192
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,700
 evidence that would show that mark red wine is not a murderer but just a totally disgusting dude

193
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,820
 he's gonna get into prison he's like all this prison food reminds me of home everyone's like

194
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,860
 dude this stuff's super disgusting he's like yum yum yum yummy in my tummy can I have some of your

195
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:47,740
 foods sir wobble let's go I swear I'm shocked I still get paid to get some orders because it is so

196
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,220
 so random what episode you end up on wobble is already sent it off they're like nah I'm good

197
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,180
 I'm totally good well let's toss you the keys of the carpenter we're gonna leave behind Durango

198
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:05,260
 Colorado and we are headed on out to the very edge of space

199
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:14,940
 carpenter copter is taking us off to where the blue meets the black where the atmosphere slowly

200
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,500
 gives away to the icy grip of the abyss I could be a prosecutor I would much rather be a defense

201
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,780
 lawyer I think it's way more fun but I can say snazzy stuff too it we're in zero gravity so

202
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,020
 we're kind of floating around and wob is slowly I don't think we've ever taken the carpenter

203
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,900
 this high up we're floating into space we're just kind of floating around it's a having a good time

204
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,140
 right throwing a beach ball we're throwing the slowest thing we can't even tell it's in zero

205
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,620
 gravity you're like Jason why aren't we throwing like anvils or something if you threw an ant if

206
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:52,220
 you're in space and I threw an anvil to you would it kill you like in real life if I dropped an

207
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,820
 anvil on your head you die but if I dropped an anvil your space suit gets all shattered I was

208
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,340
 like I'm just testing it bro you can't breathe I mean but think about it if you dropped it in

209
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,580
 space it would just kind of float there right there is no dropping it I wonder if you could

210
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,100
 play baseball on the space station this is why this is why they'll never allow me anywhere near

211
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,580
 any technology I'm like oh what does this button do it's CERN I bring Nelson Mandela back to life

212
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:24,460
 all this craziness so anyways we'll we'll let the space nerds I'm sure I'll get a ton of emails

213
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,900
 explaining stuff to me and I do love those emails I often get them usually from English majors

214
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,140
 and people who are correcting my grammar this is one of those fascinating stories that is packaged

215
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:42,140
 in such a bizarre way I just don't understand it we recently talked about it on yesterday's episode

216
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,780
 about how journalists are supposed to write their articles in an inverted pyramid and you put the

217
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,580
 best information the most important information at the top and it gets less informative as you go

218
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,900
 down so the editors can edit it or the reader can stop reading it and they get the gist of the

219
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,700
 information at the top the problem is is that paranormal in particular paranormal writers

220
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:10,940
 are not journalists but they churn out articles constantly now they may be good paranormal researchers

221
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,500
 but they're not they're not journalists they don't know how to structure an article in a classic

222
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:26,300
 journalist way drives me up the wall drives me up the wall and I don't want to call out certain

223
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,020
 web I'm going on a website now but a lot of the paranormal websites they're just a mess their

224
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,220
 articles are just really really poorly written no and I'm not in a informational way they're just

225
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,780
 formatted they're not even written like in a magazine format they're just written as if someone

226
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,380
 was I don't I don't even know how to describe it they're headache inducing for me and I have to

227
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,980
 read them to get stories for this show but it's fascinating you guys if you're a paranormal

228
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,460
 researcher just take a journalism class or buy a journalism book for crying out loud but anyway so

229
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,940
 here's a website that I go to all the time it's a great website called howanwise.com they have a

230
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,260
 lot of really good information on here I found a lot of cool stuff and this is an article called

231
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,340
 well I won't tell you the title right now it's written by a journalist named Vicky Verma

232
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,100
 again I'm not calling you out for being a bad researcher but it's just such a bizarre it's not

233
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:23,020
 a very well-structured article I'm reading it and it starts off with quoting a Gaia article with

234
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:32,060
 Gaia if you don't know is middle-aged mom metaphysics it's a website that specializes in just the

235
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,020
 hokeyest of the hokey so unless they're sponsoring this unless they're sponsoring my podcast where

236
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,740
 I'm on their channel one of these days then it's the best source of information around but as of now

237
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,940
 when they're not paying me just a bland repackaging of paranormal and consciousness and stuff like

238
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,380
 that at best then they have stuff then they have stuff that's just straight up fictional but passes

239
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:00,140
 as reality like the guy who says that he was an Alantean warlord and this article that they're

240
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:06,140
 referencing Vicky Verma talks about a transcript between Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong as a

241
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,820
 young as they're exiting the lunar module on Apollo 11 and it's like here's a dramatic

242
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,660
 reenactment of what Gaia no recording of this by the way I looked I looked Gaia I tried verifying

243
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:26,300
 it future future bosses I tried find verifying it Apollo 11 those are giant things no no no this

244
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:33,340
 is not an optical illusion no one is gonna believe this this is NASA command what what what the

245
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:43,260
 hell is happening what's wrong with you they're here under the surface who's there calling Apollo 11

246
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:50,060
 we saw some visitors they were here for a while observing the instruments repeat your last information

247
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,580
 from it repeat your last information I say there were other spaceships they're lined up in the other

248
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,220
 side of the crater and then it just kind of goes on from there right you're like Jason that sounds

249
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,660
 super interesting keep reading me that what are they're nonsense what are they're nonsense are you

250
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:11,980
 possibly trying to speed towards you gave that half-assed reading I know I know you can do a

251
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,700
 better dramatic reading than that you're an actor for crying out loud what could what could be more

252
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:24,860
 interesting than that well that is not true and the truth is always more interesting than fiction

253
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,620
 if I could have found a recording of that oh that would have been awesome I would have done

254
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,660
 what is this quit the show and started a new show where I analyze that recording every day

255
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:44,300
 so in this article I'm reading I was like here's the thing I'm open to it and I tried finding this

256
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,340
 I went to the Gaia website I went to the Gaia website subscribed I joined I joined I'm now an

257
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,380
 Atlantean warrior but I try looking for the recording of this I tried looking for anything

258
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,300
 that backs this up and there's nothing to back it up it's a transcript if this was true

259
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:06,620
 it doesn't exist it doesn't exist but in this that's how the article starts off and I'm my eyes

260
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,860
 are rolling to my eyes are rolling so hard they've basically achieved a zero gravity

261
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:19,900
 but in this article after you read about that you get to doctor story you must grave and because

262
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,980
 I'm already primed not to believe what's coming up next because I'm already like that isn't real

263
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,620
 and I've checked it out it wasn't that I just read that I'm like what aliens those don't exist

264
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,420
 I stopped I go wait that's weird and I started looking for other versions of the transcript or

265
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,060
 an audio version or any proof that this existed and it doesn't and then I go back to the article

266
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,780
 and I'm already primed to be like this is made up I almost didn't finish reading the article

267
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,100
 then we get to doctor story must grave

268
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:58,620
 this guy goes on the record there is a voice recording of him talking about what he saw

269
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:05,580
 doctor story must grave you may not know who is maybe you do he helped design

270
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,900
 essential space shuttle equipment like spacesuits and life support he's been to space six

271
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:18,300
 different times he's been on six different space missions he is the only astronaut the only us

272
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:25,100
 astronaut to fly in all five shuttles including challenger before blue not afterwards that would

273
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:31,100
 be the feet you flying in a go shuttle ma and if none of that impresses you he was also a guest star

274
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:41,100
 on home improvement the headline of this article retired NASA astronaut claimed to have seen snake

275
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:49,100
 shaped UFOs during two missions in space starts off with this bizarre fictional account of this

276
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,580
 UFO float what was it I don't remember how they were on the lunar crater and some alien showed up

277
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,460
 totally fictional so when I get to this transcript of what doctor story must grave said I was like

278
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:09,020
 what that's not true but but how's and why is includes a link a video link to an episode of

279
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:17,900
 a old show called sightings and let me read you this transcript this really should have been

280
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:24,620
 all the only thing the article was about let me read you this transcript on two of my missions

281
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:32,780
 and I still don't have an answer I have seen a snake out there six seven eight feet long

282
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:38,620
 it is rubbery because it has internal waves in it and it follows you for a rather long period

283
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:44,940
 of time the more you fly in space the more you see an incredible amount of things out there and that

284
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:52,060
 sort of brings to you really a certainty that other living creatures are out there some incredibly

285
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:59,340
 primitive more primitive some just just proteins coming together amino acids and and some just

286
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:06,220
 single cell organisms and other civilizations that have been around for a million years that

287
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:16,220
 are doing unimaginable kinds of things unquote and while he's doing this while he's speaking about

288
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,300
 this on the sightings video they show what appears to be real footage from a shuttle in space and you

289
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:29,180
 see this weird snake like object floating far far far above the earth next to the shuttle

290
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,420
 it's fascinating sorry and I've seen footage like that before and I've seen the weird orbs and all

291
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,260
 this stuff that seemed to be outside of the earth's atmosphere absolutely fascinating stuff and here

292
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:50,380
 we have one of the most highly decorated astronauts ever coming forward in a non-faked transcript on

293
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:58,620
 audio saying this is what I saw there's snakes in space he also does an interview with forbs later on

294
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,860
 and he at that point he's talking more about traditional aliens what we think of as like

295
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:10,300
 graves and reptilians and stuff like that he is he finds it odd that they would come to earth

296
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:17,100
 not because of any sort of technological limitations he just thinks that they're out there but why would

297
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,260
 they come to earth like what would make us so special for them to come here in the first place

298
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:27,340
 which is a very scientific way to look at it it's special to us just like when we're flying in a

299
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:33,820
 plane or driving down the road and we we drive past Patawah Idaho but you would drive past you

300
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,660
 wouldn't think anything of it you only stop there if you needed to but you're probably going to stop

301
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:45,820
 by a bigger city but to the people of Patawah Idaho it's their town it's their home the fighting

302
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,140
 huskies is their local football team and they got all this pride there and blah blah blah blah

303
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:58,460
 to that we're basically Patawah Idaho in the galactic scheme of things but we do sure love our

304
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:07,260
 huskies there is a reason think think about this story for a second there is a reason why one of

305
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:16,780
 these is more popular than the other right there is one of these why we know all about the bases

306
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:24,620
 on the moon or ancient aliens or crop circles this is all alien lore 101 this is something you

307
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,300
 learn when you first start researching aliens you learn these conspiracy theories but organic

308
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,580
 aliens in space floating around like that single cell organisms kind of clumping together and and

309
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,700
 evolving in the atmosphere that's a more of a high-level conspiracy theory and it shouldn't be

310
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,420
 because people are willing to go people who have been to space are willing to go on the record

311
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:54,300
 and say this is what we saw this should be well known knowledge this should be conspiracy theory

312
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:00,540
 UFO lore 101 it should be one of the first things you see when they talk about it before we get to

313
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,580
 Betty and Barney hill before we get to cattle mutilations before we get to a entire series

314
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:13,100
 based on ancient aliens this should be ground zero the building blocks for life have been seen

315
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,340
 in outer space right next to our planet by people who are trained observers and seen on two different

316
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,540
 missions so you can't say oh it was just uh he had some he had a worm in his eye he's like ah

317
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,980
 I shouldn't have been swimming in that swamp right before takeoff I find it interesting I don't know

318
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:41,100
 if it's by design that the the true stuff is pushed aside by the nobly false stuff even in

319
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,140
 this article itself by vicki verma that is apparent this should have been the top

320
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,140
 we didn't need the people on the moon the the base whatever was the aliens on the crater I've

321
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,780
 literally already I literally already have a hard time remembering what that was because it's just

322
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:03,820
 fake and this is so fascinating this was real so why are we as a UFO community as UFOologists why

323
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:10,780
 do we do it as well continually push away the stuff that is real for the stuff that isn't

324
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,940
 I mean there have been massive massive flaws pointed in the ancient aliens theorem and I'll

325
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,900
 put this link on the show notes again there's a guy he did a three hour long video breaking it down

326
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:28,540
 almost episode by episode showing how this stuff is not aliens over and over and over again no one's

327
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,260
 watching that people just want to hear about ancient aliens and I have no problem I love aliens I have

328
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,380
 no problem discussing it but we should be discussing the stuff from first-hand observers in space

329
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,620
 it's sure it's not laser beams sure they're not building pyramids or creating crap circles or

330
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,180
 mutilating cattle it's a just a lie we don't even know if there's any consciousness in it

331
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:56,060
 it's just a snake floating around in space but it's real may not be flashy may not be dancing

332
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,820
 with a little top hat it may not be plotting to take over the world but it is life outside of the

333
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:12,140
 planet earth and even in a website even in an article named after it the headline is on it it's

334
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:21,820
 buried in that article itself is this just because we don't have a big attention span is this just

335
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:33,820
 because we want the flashy stuff or is it more sinister than that is someone trying to hide

336
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:41,660
 the real stuff from us to sell us the independence day alien invasion or the space brothers coming

337
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:50,380
 to cure all of our diseases or the sinister men in black it's all well and good it's very entertaining

338
00:33:50,620 --> 00:34:00,940
 but the reality of just miles above us right now there are proto life forms slowly evolving

339
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:09,740
 at the edge of space may not be enough for a whole series on history channel

340
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:17,500
 or to sell a book but dr story must grave solve these things with his own eyes and put his

341
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:24,620
 reputation on the line to talk about them that shouldn't just be an episode of an obscure

342
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:32,860
 television show from the 1990s that should be something that all UFOologists know it should

343
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:42,620
 be common knowledge among the UFO community but it's not and the mystery is why

344
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,860
 I

345
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
