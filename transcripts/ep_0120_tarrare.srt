1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 A temple in India holds riches and curses.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,300
 Then are we on the cusp of a modern-day zombie outbreak?

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,300
 Seriously. Seriously.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,800
 You guys are like nothing serious, but no, no, it's an interesting one.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then we find a man who can eat anything. Yes?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,300
 Anything. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,300
 I'm a big doll. Actually, I'm a hot big doll.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,300
 I hope you're having a great day too. This is take four.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,800
 I've spent the past hour here doing different takes, driving me nuts.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 Money's are actually really hard to do because I've been out of practice for a while and I'm like, "Urrrgh!"

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,300
 But so goes the world of podcasting.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,300
 There is a guy on YouTube. Not a YouTuber as far as I know, but they're one of my listeners on YouTube.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,300
 I love you to death, dude.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,300
 You suggested that I do a story and I thought, "Oh yeah, that would be an interesting one because I had a vague knowledge of it."

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,300
 But Pondroll, Pondroll, I know I've seen you pop up on a couple different videos.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,300
 I've seen you commenting on a few of my podcast videos on YouTube.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,300
 And I know you listen to the show.

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:24,300
 So when you suggested this story, you knew the torment you were about to unleash on my audience.

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,300
 Because I have a hard time pronouncing cities in America.

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
 And Pondroll suggested a story that takes place in India.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,300
 Now, the story is...

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,300
 The Padman Abbaswamy Temple.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,300
 I'm not even going to try that one again. The Temple.

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,300
 And it is this side, Pondroll, really. I love you and I'm... Thanks so much for listening. Thanks so much for the suggestion.

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,300
 But there's this temple in India that...

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,300
 There's this temple in this India that there was always this legend that it was full of treasure.

29
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
 This is going to be a fairly short story.

30
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,300
 But there was always this rumor that there was this treasure in this temple.

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,300
 And back in... What was it?

32
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,300
 20... So, but back in 2011, the government said, "You know what? Let's go through and find out actually what's in this temple.

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,300
 We should catalog it." Because it's been there since like 3 A.D.

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
 And they're like, "Hey, finally getting around to it, right? Let's do this."

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,300
 While they were snooping around the temple, they found six hidden doors that they never knew was there.

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,300
 And we'll get into that in a second, because that's an interesting thing.

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,300
 You find these six hidden doors and they basically label them A through F.

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,300
 Now, I don't think they used the English letters, but it was basically just like, this is door A, this is door B, so it's C, so on.

39
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
 But in Indian letters.

40
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,300
 And so, they start opening the doors and they find amazing riches.

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:03,300
 Gold, ancient gold coins, diamonds, gems, diamond necklaces encased in gold.

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
 With gems, I don't know, just these amazing artifacts.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
 And they're like, "Oh my God, we're rich!"

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,300
 I mean, we're the government, so we're rich anyways, but we have this untold, unheard of fortune just laying in this temple.

45
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:45,300
 They're opening the doors and they're like, "Doo-lulululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululululul

46
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,300
 And what it says is that door B has a legend behind it.

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:56,300
 Now, back in the 1930s, that region was super, super poor and they were actually going there having like a starvation issue.

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
 Which I mean, I guess it's just starvation, that's the issue.

49
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
 They didn't have enough food.

50
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,300
 Now, this is what I thought was weird, because in 2011 they said, "Let's go see what's in this temple."

51
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,300
 But in the 1930s, they go, "Hey, we're pretty sure there's a bunch of winking gold coins in that temple. Let's go in there."

52
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,300
 And for whatever reason, the first door they tried to open was door B, and...

53
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
 Sorry, that didn't happen in 1930.

54
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
 That happened a hundred years ago.

55
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,300
 So in 1900, the region was... something else happened in 1930.

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,300
 So in about 1900, the region's super poor and they're starving and everything like that.

57
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,300
 They go to open door B, and they hear a curious sound on the other side of door B.

58
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,300
 A sound you shouldn't hear on the other side of any door in existence.

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,300
 That's the sound of the ocean.

60
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,300
 And they're like, "Eh, let's not open this. Let's not go here."

61
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:54,300
 And they thought this door must lead to the Arabian Ocean, which actually I figured would be closer to Saudi Arabia,

62
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
 but apparently it's also close to India.

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
 They have big coastlines, but anyway, so they didn't.

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
 And then there's just a bunch of people starved.

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,300
 I don't know why they didn't try the other doors.

66
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
 Maybe they didn't know the other doors were there, because they were so well hidden.

67
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,300
 In the 1930s, some burglars were like, "Hey, dude, sometimes when I'm walking by that temple, I hear the sound of coins winking at me."

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,300
 So they try to open door B, and a bunch of snakes jump out of the door and chase them off.

69
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
 Noxious snakes is the term.

70
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
 So a smelly snake.

71
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
 Or unless the word means something else that I don't know of.

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
 To this day, that door has never been opened.

73
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
 Door B has never been opened.

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,300
 And the legend is that only a cleric or a high level saint can open it.

75
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
 So break out your Final Fantasy VII saves and see if you have...

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
 I don't know if there are saints in that.

77
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
 But anyways, break out your role-playing game.

78
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,300
 Whatever role-playing game you do, level up your saint, try to open this door.

79
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
 Because they believe that it is sealed by magic.

80
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,300
 And unless the seal is broken, even though the door they believe can be opened with modern technology,

81
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:00,300
 i.e. dynamite, they think that opening the door without removing the magic will cause great catastrophe to the region.

82
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,300
 Like a giant new Arabian ocean emptying into the middle of India.

83
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,300
 I think it's interesting because the door has the images of snakes on it.

84
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,300
 And it had images of something else I couldn't pronounce.

85
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
 Again, thanks, Pongraal.

86
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,300
 And those images are associated in Indian mythology or Indian culture as being warning signs.

87
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,300
 I mentioned once before that there was a group of people who were trying to design a warning logo

88
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,300
 that could be interpreted 10 million years in the future.

89
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
 Because we want to bury all this nuclear waste in Nevada.

90
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,300
 But they don't want anyone stumbling across the, you know, long after we're gone and opening the doors

91
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,300
 and irradiating the entire western half of the United States.

92
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,300
 So they go, "What type of image can we come up with that millions of years from now

93
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,300
 people will not interpret as anything other than dangerous?"

94
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,300
 A skull, a lot of times that represents religious.

95
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,300
 So if archaeologists in the future stumbled across a giant skull in the middle of a desert on a door,

96
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
 it may not necessarily equate that with death.

97
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
 For the most part, it hasn't been equated with death.

98
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,300
 For a long time in human history, skulls meant rebirth or religion.

99
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
 But they're saying that this is a warning, do not open this door.

100
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
 I think that's really interesting because who knows what's behind it.

101
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,300
 Is it more gold, diamonds, the size of an infant?

102
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
 Is it something, is it some magical portal to somewhere else?

103
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,300
 Is it a super weapon that was hidden there?

104
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,300
 Or is it just an empty room? We don't know.

105
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300
 And it's funny because the Indian government is in no hurry to figure it out.

106
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,300
 So that is the story of the temple I can't pronounce.

107
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
 Indiana Jones and the temple I can't pronounce.

108
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:45,300
 You know what's so funny is intriguing is the story is it delves a lot into Indian mythology

109
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
 and I just can't pronounce the words.

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
 And I'm not going to put you through that.

111
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
 So we're leaving India.

112
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,300
 We'll probably be back to India at some point because they do have a lot of cool mythology.

113
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
 It's the language barrier. I just can't pronounce that stuff.

114
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,300
 And I don't like to give foreign places nicknames like "Padaha Mata Ta Ta Castle".

115
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
 We'll just call it "Patti". I don't like to do that.

116
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
 But anyways, so we're off.

117
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:19,300
 Now, we're going from India and the legends involving that to Africa, modern day Africa.

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,300
 Now we're in the Congo. Now this is an interesting story because this just popped up in the news.

119
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,300
 They're having an Ebola outbreak again. It's not just any Ebola outbreak.

120
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,300
 This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak in history.

121
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,300
 Now, they've had them and it's been fairly restricted to villages.

122
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
 And they go, "Okay, that's not like a good thing."

123
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
 And I'm like, "Yay, just villages."

124
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,300
 But it could have been a lot, lot worse.

125
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
 And the problem is, is that we might be there now.

126
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,300
 Because they have this city. It's called Butembo in the Congo.

127
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
 And it has a population, it's a city.

128
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
 It has a population of over a million people.

129
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,300
 And Ebola has not hit a major city yet.

130
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,300
 And we're starting to see outbreaks in the suburbs and in outlying communities.

131
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:14,300
 Ebola, if you don't know, is incredibly contagious and has a kill rate between 50% and 90%.

132
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,300
 It can be transmitted through a drop, a drop of sweat or blood.

133
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
 So people riding on the subway are sweaty.

134
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,300
 You just want to stay away from them anyways, but they're like, "Woohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoo

135
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,300
 You just want to stay away from them anyways, but they're like, "Woohoohoo, shaking their head like a dog is flying everywhere."

136
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,300
 It's like Beethoven, but Ebola infected.

137
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,300
 And it can take up to nine days before you start to become symptomatic.

138
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
 So you can have it and spread it and not know it.

139
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
 And then you start pooping out blood.

140
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
 Basically, you liquefy from the inside out.

141
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
 That's what ends up killing you.

142
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
 You'll start to get like, some people get rashes, some people get bloodshot eyes.

143
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,300
 Some people, it starts off with confusion and things like that.

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,300
 But the end result that will kill you is massive blood loss.

145
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
 Your organs liquefy.

146
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
 And then you throw up and you poop out blood until you die.

147
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
 It's very brutal.

148
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
 I've seen some photos of people dying from it.

149
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
 They're alive.

150
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
 I saw a photo of a guy sitting in the middle of a street.

151
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,300
 He's just blood all on the ground underneath his butt.

152
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
 He's laying down.

153
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
 He's sitting.

154
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,300
 But you just see a puddle of blood because he's pooping out blood and he's reaching out for help.

155
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,300
 And everyone else in the photo has given him like a 10 foot radius.

156
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
 Because he's dead.

157
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,300
 There's nothing you can do.

158
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,300
 And part of the problem is not only is Ebola highly contagious,

159
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,300
 but the burial rituals in the Congo and in other regions of this area,

160
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,300
 they require the people to clean the body, to wash the bodies off.

161
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,300
 And if they're a very famous person, sometimes you'll lay on the body.

162
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,300
 You'll be like, "Oh, Elvis, such great music.

163
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
 Let me lay on your body."

164
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
 Which gives you Ebola.

165
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,300
 And then you die and then your loved ones wash your body, clean your body, things like that.

166
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
 I read an interesting article where the person says,

167
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,300
 "Imagine having a millennial old tradition and all of a sudden a couple guys show up

168
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,300
 and has mat suits and say, 'Just throw it in a bag and burn it.'"

169
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,300
 And that's the problem they're having over in these regions.

170
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,300
 They've been having these burial practices for hundreds, hundreds of years.

171
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
 And now people are showing up in pretty much space suits saying,

172
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,300
 "No, can't say goodbye. Just throw it in a bag."

173
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
 That's it. Can't touch it.

174
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
 Now it's hitting a city.

175
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,300
 Like I said, it's only outskirts. It hasn't gotten to the main part of town.

176
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
 But it seems like it's only a matter of time.

177
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
 And here's the problem.

178
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:39,300
 Merrick, the group that makes the Ebola, it's an experimental Ebola vaccine.

179
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
 So they're not entirely for sure that it works.

180
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
 They're pretty sure that it works.

181
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,300
 They give it to people and it seems to work,

182
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,300
 but they've only dealt with basic "minor outbreaks."

183
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,300
 The biggest outbreak was around 11,000 people.

184
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,300
 So they go, "Okay, well, let's stockpile 300,000 doses of this vaccine."

185
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
 It takes months to prepare.

186
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,300
 But they go 300,000. That's a good starting point.

187
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
 But with over a million people in the city,

188
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,300
 it's not even half that can be vaccinated from this.

189
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:22,300
 You could have a city full of skyscrapers and restaurants and coffee shops and skate parks,

190
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,300
 a wash in blood by next summer.

191
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
 It would be like a zombie movie.

192
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
 And the weirdest part about this vaccine,

193
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
 and they don't know what they're going to do,

194
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
 Merrick has said, you know,

195
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,300
 "We don't know if we can have enough vaccines ready to go."

196
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,300
 And another thing with this outbreak is people are coming down with Ebola,

197
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
 and they don't know where they got it from.

198
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
 Normally, you would have one person go,

199
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,300
 "Well, yeah, I was holding hands with that dude."

200
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
 And that's how I got Ebola.

201
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
 But now people are showing up and they're like,

202
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
 "Well, do you know anyone who died of Ebola?"

203
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,300
 And they're like, "No, I don't know anyone who died of Ebola."

204
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,300
 So it may already get spread in that droplet form.

205
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,300
 All it takes to, I mean, this was the big controversy a couple of years ago,

206
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,300
 is it takes nine days someone to get on a plane and go to another country,

207
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,300
 but they don't have enough vaccines to inoculate an entire city.

208
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,300
 They don't know how some people are catching it, which is very worrying.

209
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
 But the vaccine, I remember reading about this a couple of years ago,

210
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
 the vaccine itself, so Merrick is a company,

211
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,300
 and a company's goal is to make profit.

212
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
 Companies tend to have secondary goals.

213
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,300
 Walmart's goal is to make profit.

214
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
 And Sam Walton's goal, at least,

215
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
 you can argue whether or not Walmart's still about it,

216
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,300
 but Sam Walton's goal was to give customers low-price items.

217
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,300
 That was, I mean, he wanted to make money and keep the company going,

218
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,300
 but his secondary goal was to allow people to buy stuff at the lowest price possible.

219
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
 That's an admirable goal.

220
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,300
 Merrick, their main goal is to make money,

221
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
 and their secondary goal is to help people.

222
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,300
 But when you come, and most corporations are like that,

223
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
 Amazon's like, "Hey, we want you to have access to all the entertainment you want to,

224
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,300
 but we also, our main goal is to make money."

225
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
 There's a little capitalism side note there.

226
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,300
 Merrick said, "Listen, we can make this Ebola vaccine,

227
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,300
 but the truth of the matter is that Ebola is quite rare.

228
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,300
 So the amount of money that we put into making this vaccine, we have to recoup.

229
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
 Not just the research and development,

230
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,300
 but the making, producing the actual physical vaccine itself.

231
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
 It's quite rare. It'll take us forever to recoup a profit from making this."

232
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,300
 And then someone, some genius there,

233
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,300
 probably Max Brooks or George Romero, said,

234
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
 "You know what else is rare?

235
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,300
 That we have a vaccine for, that we can stockpile,

236
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,300
 but it's so rare it doesn't really make it cost effective for us to make all this vaccine for.

237
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,300
 And we can combine them together, and they're like,

238
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
 "Yes, Mr. Romero, what's your suggestion?"

239
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,300
 And he goes, "Rabies.

240
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,300
 Rabies is a vaccine that is needed that we have,

241
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,300
 but it doesn't make sense for us to make a separate rabies vaccine.

242
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,300
 What if we took, this is 100% true.

243
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
 What if we took the rabies vaccine and the Ebola vaccine,

244
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,300
 combined them into a single vaccine,

245
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
 so we can give it to either person?"

246
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
 And people are like, "Yay!"

247
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
 Clapping, having no, then...

248
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,300
 You ever wonder why people in zombie movies act like they've never seen a zombie movie?

249
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,300
 Because people in our planet act like they've never seen a zombie movie.

250
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
 Why would you invent something?

251
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:35,300
 Because remember, a vaccine tends to have an element of the disease in the vaccine.

252
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,300
 That might not hold true across all vaccines,

253
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,300
 but like the flu vaccine, they're like, "Oh yeah, it has a little bit of the flu vaccine.

254
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 You might get sick, you might find a little..."

255
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,300
 You're gonna give me rabies if I have Ebola?

256
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,300
 Or if I have rabies, you're gonna inject me with something that has Ebola in it?

257
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,300
 You're basically created a crazy, blood-spuing monster.

258
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,300
 Who's just gonna run around, spit in blood at everybody, and doesn't care, because he has rabies.

259
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
 Why would you combine those two?

260
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,300
 Why don't you combine Ebola and like, I don't know, antidepressant medicine,

261
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
 or something that makes you sleepy?

262
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
 Anything else!

263
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,300
 I guess people who have depression don't want to be injected full of Ebola, but...

264
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
 Those are the two... those...

265
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,300
 That's like at the beginning of "I Am Legend" the movie.

266
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,300
 They invent the cure for cancer and it turns everyone into a vampire.

267
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,300
 I don't know if I would take that vaccine.

268
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,300
 And I don't know if I would hang out with anybody who took that vaccine.

269
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:38,300
 Because again, you've now created a crazy, a 28 days later, rage-infected monster.

270
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
 No!

271
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,300
 Put something else in that vaccine, Merrick.

272
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:52,300
 But 300,000 doses of that rabies/Ebola vaccine is on its way to a major city in Africa.

273
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
 Okay, the last story we're gonna talk about, it's funny,

274
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
 because I heard about this story when I was a kid.

275
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
 Because I've always been reading this weird stuff.

276
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,300
 And as I was researching this, I realized the version I heard as a kid was heavily edited.

277
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
 So we're going to France.

278
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,300
 We will take... well, hop in the Carpenter copter,

279
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,300
 because I want to get out of the Ebola city of Congo.

280
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
 We're gonna fly above just right like they're...

281
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
 They're like running towards the helicopter.

282
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
 Get on, get on, get on!

283
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,300
 Many guns are out of ammo.

284
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
 Get on!

285
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,300
 That's not you making that noise, that's the zombies behind you.

286
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
 You hop into the helicopter.

287
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
 It's so funny, I get accused of racism all the time for this podcast.

288
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
 This isn't helping, but anyways...

289
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
 They're chasing us down.

290
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
 Jump in the helicopter.

291
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,300
 They're forming like a human pyramid to try to get us...

292
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,300
 Take off.

293
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,300
 Just as we start to see the nuke coming towards the city.

294
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
 Anyways, we're gonna go to France.

295
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,300
 We're back in time so we don't have to worry about zombies.

296
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,300
 I don't know why the helicopter made an airplane noise, but anyways...

297
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,300
 Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-ch

298
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:17,300
 We land.

299
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:32,300
 We're back in time.

300
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:42,300
 Anyways, Tarrere...

301
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
 That is a skinny man.

302
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
 He is of normal height.

303
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
 Whatever that may be.

304
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
 He's 100 pounds.

305
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
 He looks to be 100 pounds.

306
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
 You're like, "Oh man, you didn't eat something."

307
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,300
 100 pounds for being in your 20s is quite slender.

308
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,300
 That's when he lifts up his shirt and billows of loose skin just...

309
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,300
 And like, deflated balloon just kind of like, sloped towards the ground.

310
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,300
 And you notice that even though he's only in his 20s, his face is super wrinkly.

311
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:19,300
 He looks like a 100 pound man whose skin is just melted jello.

312
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,300
 Now, Tarrere was a medical freak.

313
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,300
 There's a few other people who have this condition, but Tarrere is the most notable.

314
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,300
 When he was a kid, his appetite was insatiable.

315
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
 He couldn't stop eating.

316
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
 And eventually, he literally...

317
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,300
 Not literally, but he ate them out of house and home.

318
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
 He didn't eat the house.

319
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
 He was like, "You know what, actually he would have."

320
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
 We'll get to that in a second.

321
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
 He actually would have given the chance.

322
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
 And so his parents kicked him out because they were like,

323
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
 "Oh, we saw you eyeing the floorboards."

324
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
 They kicked him out because they couldn't afford to keep him.

325
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,300
 He ends up joining a bunch of circus freaks and his show was,

326
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
 "Let me eat whatever you got in your pockets."

327
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
 "Hey, you. What do you have in your pockets?"

328
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,300
 And he's like, "I don't know, a couple shillings."

329
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
 And he's like, "Well, that's weird. This is France.

330
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
 You should have francs."

331
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
 And he's like, "Oh, yes, that's where I meant francs."

332
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
 So he'd eat the francs.

333
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
 And he goes, "What do you have?"

334
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
 And the person's like, "I have this potted plant in my purse."

335
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
 And he's like, "Give it to me."

336
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,300
 "Aah, he'd eat it."

337
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,300
 Now, his jaw didn't distend and he ate a whole pot.

338
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
 But he would eat cats.

339
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,300
 He'd be like, "Hey, hey, cat lady. Can I borrow one of those?"

340
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
 And she's like, "Uh, sure."

341
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
 And he's gonna pet it and he's like, "Sump."

342
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
 Pet it from the inside.

343
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
 He'd rip its stomach open and eat the guts.

344
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
 And then he would eat everything but the bones.

345
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,300
 And then he'd throw up the fur and the skin.

346
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
 And then at that point, everyone kind of just applauded.

347
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
 At one point, he was doing this act

348
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
 and he'd got an obstruction in the stomach

349
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
 and the other circus performers had to take him to the doctor.

350
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
 And the doctor was like fixing him up.

351
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,300
 And he goes, "Hey, you know, I do this act."

352
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
 This is your story.

353
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
 He goes, "You know, I do this act where I can eat anything."

354
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
 The doctor's like, "Really?"

355
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
 He's like, "Hey, let me eat your gold watch."

356
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
 He couldn't stop eating stuff.

357
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
 And the doctor said, "If you ate my watch,

358
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
 I'm gonna cut you open and get it out."

359
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
 To which I imagined Terare, like,

360
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
 grabbed the collar of his shirt and went, "Gold?"

361
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,300
 But anyways, he couldn't stop eating stuff.

362
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
 Eventually, he joined the military,

363
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
 which considering that that life is so regimented,

364
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
 it seemed like a bizarre choice,

365
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
 but maybe just doing his civic duty.

366
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
 And he would eat all of his rations

367
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
 and then he would do chores around the camp

368
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
 to eat other people's rations.

369
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 And then he started eating food out of the garbage.

370
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
 And that's nothing compared to what's coming.

371
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
 He started eating food out of the garbage.

372
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
 And the army was like, "Dude, seriously."

373
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,300
 And when he'd eat,

374
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
 like, all of his loose skin would inflate like a balloon.

375
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,300
 He could actually fill his body up with food

376
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
 and then as it would dissolve,

377
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
 his skin would get super loose again.

378
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
 And finally, there was this dude at the camp,

379
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
 the commander, and he goes,

380
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,300
 "This guy's driving me nuts, but I have a plan."

381
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
 I'm gonna make him swallow little, like,

382
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
 wooden boxes with battle plans on them.

383
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,300
 And then he'll just walk across enemy lines

384
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
 and no one will notice him,

385
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
 'cause he just looks like a normal dude.

386
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,300
 And then he'll poop out the plans to somebody else.

387
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
 And so they do a test.

388
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
 They give him a little wooden box

389
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
 and put a piece of paper in it,

390
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
 and he swallows it,

391
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
 and then a couple days later,

392
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
 he poops it out, or a couple hours later, whatever,

393
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
 he poops it out, and the box was fine.

394
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
 And they're like, "Oh, this plan's gonna work."

395
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,300
 Now, let me tell you a little bit more about Tarare.

396
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
 This was his description.

397
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,300
 He had an abnormally wide mouth

398
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
 and near-invisible lips.

399
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
 Now, I don't think that meant they were, like,

400
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
 an invisible woman that you could see through me.

401
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,300
 I think they just meant that he had super, super thin lips.

402
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
 Like I said, his face was super wrinkly,

403
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
 his skin hung super low.

404
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 His skin, like, if you touched him, it was hot.

405
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
 He was hot to the touch.

406
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
 He was just probably a big part of his metabolism.

407
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
 And he was described, this is a quote,

408
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,300
 "He stunk to such a degree

409
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,300
 that he could not be endured within the distance of 20 paces."

410
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
 So just a super stink bag.

411
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
 You didn't want to be near him.

412
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,300
 And that was normal.

413
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,300
 When he ate, he smelled worse.

414
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,300
 He had constant diarrhea, constant diarrhea,

415
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,300
 and that gives a new angle to the story of them,

416
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,300
 like, waiting around for him to poop out the box,

417
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 and then it's all, "Pfft!"

418
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
 Just like a huge puddle, and they're like,

419
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,300
 "Okay, let's get a private in here to dig through this stuff,

420
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
 'cause I'm not."

421
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,300
 He had chronic diarrhea, and it was, and again, quote,

422
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
 "fetted beyond all conception."

423
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
 So they should have had a poet in the room,

424
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
 'cause you hear that phrase,

425
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
 they should send a poet to space.

426
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
 They should have had a poet.

427
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,300
 Beyond all conception, beyond what great ideas

428
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,300
 lay out in the universe they cannot use to describe

429
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,300
 the smell of his diarrhea.

430
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,300
 And I don't know, I don't know how this is possible,

431
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,300
 but they said that you could look at him and vapor,

432
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,300
 like, stink lines came out of his skin.

433
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
 You could see a visible vapor around him.

434
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
 They're just the stench.

435
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,300
 Now let's go back to that plan about using him as a spy.

436
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,300
 You want someone to walk across enemy lines.

437
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
 France was at war with pressure at this point.

438
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,300
 You pick a guy who has big, big, flabby cheeks,

439
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
 stinks from 20 meters away,

440
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
 has visible vapor lines coming off of him,

441
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
 and constantly has to stop to have diarrhea.

442
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,300
 Needless to say, the plan didn't really work.

443
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
 He eventually, when he went back, he's like,

444
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
 he didn't want to do any more army stuff,

445
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
 so he volunteered to go to hospital.

446
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
 The doctors were like, "Oh my God, this is amazing.

447
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,300
 We can't wait to see how this dude works."

448
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
 They tried curing him.

449
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
 One of the cures was soft-boiled eggs.

450
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,300
 Let's give him as many soft-boiled eggs as we can.

451
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,300
 He's like, "Go, go, go, go, go."

452
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
 Didn't work out too well.

453
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,300
 One of the things was they had a meal spread,

454
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
 a table spread for 15 laborers

455
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
 who were working at the hospital at that time,

456
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
 so they had all this food laid out,

457
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
 and they go, "Hmm, the doctors are like,

458
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,300
 "I wonder what will happen if we give him food

459
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,300
 "that is set aside for 15 able-bodied men."

460
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
 He ate it all. He ate it all.

461
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
 He complained about hunger all the time.

462
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,300
 If he wasn't eating, he was constantly exhausted,

463
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
 so it wasn't just like this circus freak,

464
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
 "Let me swallow anything."

465
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
 He was constantly hungry.

466
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
 He had to eat. That's why he was digging through the garbage.

467
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
 So they saw him eat all that food, and they're like,

468
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
 "Okay, okay, enough fun, guys.

469
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
 "Let's go back to trying to cure him."

470
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
 And they would put him on these regulated diets.

471
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
 But the problem is, is that he wouldn't stick to him.

472
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
 He would break out of the hospital

473
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
 or just walk out of the hospital at night.

474
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
 And there was a butcher shop that, you know,

475
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
 they throw all their scraps in the dump

476
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,300
 and the garbage behind the butcher shop.

477
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,300
 I imagine it's like the lady in the tramp.

478
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
 There's just a bunch of spaghetti back there.

479
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 He would go through that, but so would stray dogs.

480
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,300
 So he had to fight stray dogs for food every night

481
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
 just to get some extra food.

482
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,300
 In this hospital, because we're in the 1700s,

483
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,300
 bloodletting was a thing. They had a bloodletting ward.

484
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
 "Hmm, you're sick.

485
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
 "Let's take as much blood out of you as possible.

486
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
 "That might cure you."

487
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
 He would drink their blood.

488
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
 He would go in there and he'd be like,

489
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 "Gulp, gulp, gulp."

490
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,300
 And you can imagine like a nurse was walking through the hospital

491
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,300
 and saw like a silhouette crouched over with like a hose in his mouth.

492
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,300
 And she's like, "Tar rare. What are you doing out of your room?"

493
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
 And he's like, "Gulp."

494
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,300
 And then they caught him.

495
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
 No joke, 'cause imagine having a hunger

496
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
 that's on the level of a heroin addiction.

497
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,300
 Like you have to eat. You have to eat.

498
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,300
 They caught him in the morgue trying to eat corpses.

499
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
 And they're like, "Tar rare."

500
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,300
 No, at that point they were really concerned about...

501
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
 So the end of his hospital stay,

502
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
 the end of all the experiments ends like this.

503
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
 Tarare's in the hospital.

504
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,300
 And he's probably sitting there and he has like

505
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
 an odd shaped lump in his stomach.

506
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
 I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's true, but...

507
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
 Okay, let me try to stick to the fact.

508
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
 [laughs]

509
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
 The fact... Okay.

510
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
 The fact of the story is...

511
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
 [laughs]

512
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
 The fact of the story is,

513
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,300
 Tarare is in the hospital.

514
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,300
 And it was a fully functional hospital.

515
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,300
 So they had like the bloodletting ward and the morgue

516
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,300
 and other stuff going on there,

517
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
 including a maternity ward.

518
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
 Oh wait, this baby wouldn't be there,

519
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
 'cause this baby was 14 months old,

520
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,300
 but they did have a maternity ward.

521
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,300
 So, not the maternity ward, 'cause this baby's too old.

522
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 This baby's graduated.

523
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,300
 The baby's there for some checkup.

524
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
 French measles.

525
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,300
 They wanna make sure the baby doesn't have French measles.

526
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 So...

527
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,300
 But one day the mom's like, "Here baby, 14 month old baby,

528
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
 I'm gonna set you down on this chair while I read

529
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
 this old timey wood carving magazine."

530
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,300
 She's like, getting splinters, reading this wood carving magazine.

531
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
 And she turns back,

532
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
 "Baby's gone. Baby's gone."

533
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,300
 Now, I don't know if that exact sequence of events happened either.

534
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,300
 The point is, is that Tarare was in a hospital

535
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,300
 and a 14 month old baby went completely missing.

536
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,300
 They never, ever found the kid.

537
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,300
 And the fur-- they didn't go, "Oh, Tarare!"

538
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,300
 This time, they were like, "That dude ate a baby.

539
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
 That guy straight up ate a baby."

540
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
 And he took off. He ran out.

541
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,300
 That's the end of that story.

542
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 I was like, "There has to be another answer.

543
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
 There has to be that they found the baby later."

544
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,300
 But from all accounts, he ate a living baby,

545
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,300
 which isn't far from the other stuff he's done.

546
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,300
 We know he's eaten live cats and live dogs,

547
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
 and he's tried eating humans, so, I mean,

548
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,300
 babies kind of look like food.

549
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
 They look like little rolls.

550
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,300
 Now, I would never eat a baby, but they look puffy.

551
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
 And so, Tarare, as hungry as he is,

552
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
 he could just be like, "Ah, it'll probably taste like

553
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 dinner rolls and marshmallows."

554
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
 I don't know. That's super disgusting.

555
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
 But anyways, actually, you think they would have found the bones,

556
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
 because he doesn't eat that.

557
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,300
 He runs out of the hospital.

558
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
 Eventually, though, at age 26,

559
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 died very, very young.

560
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
 He goes and he says--

561
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
 he goes to the Southern doctor, and he's like,

562
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,300
 "Oh, hi, I'm Tarare. You might know me from the baby eating scandal."

563
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,300
 But I ate a gold fork a while ago,

564
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
 and I think it's still in me, and I'm super sick.

565
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
 Now, the doctor's looking at this saggy,

566
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,300
 fetid, gross diarrhea monster,

567
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,300
 and he's thinking, you know, a guy who ate a gold fork--

568
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
 that's not the weirdest thing about you,

569
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
 but let's take a look.

570
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
 So, he starts treating him, and he goes,

571
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,300
 "No, you don't have-- you may or may not have eaten a golden fork,

572
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
 but you have tuberculosis."

573
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
 Advanced tuberculosis.

574
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
 And Tarare's like, "No, trust me, dude, I ate a gold fork.

575
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
 It's in my stomach. It really hurts.

576
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
 I've eaten tons of stuff, but for some reason,

577
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
 that's not sitting well with me."

578
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,300
 The fact that it's a four-pronged metal object,

579
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
 he eventually does die, though.

580
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,300
 And in his last moments, like the last couple hours of his life,

581
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
 ten times the worst diarrhea.

582
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
 He was pooping out pus,

583
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
 pus and blood-filled diarrhea,

584
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
 and then he dies.

585
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,300
 A fitting way to end to a man who had diarrhea his entire life.

586
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,300
 He had to tie-- he had to one-up it.

587
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,300
 And so, one of the doctors who treated him

588
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
 at the baby-eating hospital came to this hospital,

589
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
 because they called him up, and they're like,

590
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
 "Hey, remember that baby-eating scandal?"

591
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,300
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah. We have that guy here."

592
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,300
 He says he ate a gold fork.

593
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
 And you can imagine the doctor at the other hospital.

594
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
 By that time, the phone's already, like,

595
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,300
 hanging off the desk, and he's in his jalopy

596
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
 to get to this hospital, or a horse,

597
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
 because they didn't have cars back then,

598
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,300
 to get there, because he's like, "Dude, I need to find--

599
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
 I want to find this guy, because this guy was like a medical marvel."

600
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,300
 And he gets there, and the body's just laying there,

601
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,300
 and it's super stinky, and none of the doctors want to do an autopsy,

602
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
 and the baby-eating hospital doctor says,

603
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,300
 "I'll do it. I need to find out what made this guy tick."

604
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,300
 So they cut him open.

605
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,300
 His throat cavity was so huge that if you opened his mouth,

606
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
 you could look down into his stomach.

607
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,300
 His body cavity was filled with pus.

608
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
 Like, his liver was covered in pus,

609
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 and it was just like an ocean of mucus in there.

610
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,300
 And his stomach, all over the inside of his stomach, were ma--

611
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,300
 and his stomach was huge, by the way, like his actual stomach cavity,

612
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,300
 but all over the inside of his stomach were these massive, gross, disgusting tumors.

613
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
 I don't-- it wasn't in the description.

614
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,300
 They were gross and disgusting, but I'm sure they were.

615
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
 I don't think that's a stretch of the imagination.

616
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,300
 And no golden fork.

617
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
 So the question is, did he really eat the golden fork?

618
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,300
 Probably, for whatever reason, 'cause he's terraria.

619
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
 But did he poop it out at some point,

620
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,300
 or was his stomach acid so intense he can actually melt metal, or gold?

621
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
 I guess gold is a metal, but...

622
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
 That's the story of terraria.

623
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300
 Now, like I said, when I read the story when I was a kid,

624
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
 it was like, there's this goofy guy named Terraria.

625
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
 He'd eat anything.

626
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,300
 He was a circus performer, and he ate corks and screws,

627
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
 and once he even ate a cat.

628
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,300
 And then he turned the page, and it's like about the two-headed wolf girl or something like that.

629
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
 Nothing about eating babies.

630
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,300
 Nothing about puss and philda diarrhea.

631
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
 None of that stuff.

632
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
 But I remembered that story as a kid,

633
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,300
 looking through, like, Ripley's Believe It or Not, or some crazy person, like,

634
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
 crazy people in history book.

635
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
 They took out all the good stuff.

636
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,300
 That's why I found it for you guys on Dead Rabbit Radio.

637
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,300
 There we go.

638
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,300
 I liked that take.

639
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,300
 Took me four tries.

640
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
 But we got it.

641
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
 It takes a while to warm up on Mondays.

642
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,300
 It's weird, because I have those two days where I don't do anything,

643
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,300
 but I went and took a shower, and I was like, I gotta do it.

644
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
 It's my job.

645
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
 I gotta do it.

646
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
 But we had a good one.

647
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
 I really liked this episode.

648
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
 Now.

649
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
 Now I like this episode.
