1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 are certain Halloween costumes cursed?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,300
 Today we find out once again, what's in the box?

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,300
 And then we take a look at an epidemic that is sweeping the world of entertainment.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,300
 All I want to do is listen to some music or watch a movie,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,500
 but instead I have to deal with so many clones.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,300
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,800
 I don't wanna sleep down, actually I'm a walkie-talkie.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,300
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
 I once saw Joker again the other day with some of my other friends,

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 and I was hoping I'd have a different feeling in it, but I didn't.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
 It's the exact...

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,800
 The movie could have been great.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,300
 The... it just didn't stick the landing guys.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,800
 I didn't really talk about it much.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,300
 I'm still not gonna give away spoilers, but that little monologue that he has towards the end,

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,800
 not at the very end, but you know what I'm talking about, that'll give me spoilers.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,300
 Totally false, flat for me. I don't like it.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,800
 And it's not that I'm like, "Oh, I just don't like it."

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,800
 And to be fair, Walking Phoenix said they did several versions of that speech that he gives,

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,300
 and the one that they ended up showing, the one that's used in the movie, is one of his least favorite ones.

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,300
 He said, "I had one that was really, really good. It was my favorite,

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,800
 but it didn't fit the theme of the movie."

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
 So we took it out. It just totally falls flat for me.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
 Again, it's not average. It's good. It's not great.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 That's my review. That's my review.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
 You know what movie I'm really looking forward to?

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,300
 And right, this is when people go, "Pfft, that's his taste in movies, that idiot."

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,300
 You know what movie I'm really looking forward to?

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 Is Midway.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,800
 Stuff blowing up.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,300
 It sounded like Donald Duck.

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
 Donald Duck was in there.

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,300
 But you, "Pfft, watch Japanese battleships blow up."

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,800
 Yeah, take that 60-year-old battle.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 Totally looking forward to that movie.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 Directed by the guy who did 2012, which was not a very good movie,

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
 but the special effects and the action.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,300
 I mean, 2012, the plot, not just the plot, but the plot points were so bad,

41
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,300
 but the action scenes in 2012 were phenomenal.

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,300
 And before you go Jason, why don't you start talking about paranormal stuff?

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,800
 There's a paranormal podcast.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
 2012 was a paranormal event.

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,300
 So hold on.

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
 2012, great action scenes.

47
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
 I want to see how well that translates to,

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
 [imitates a scene from a movie]

49
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,800
 Battleships blowing up.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,300
 Now, I'm afraid the first hour is going to be a bunch of dudes standing around

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,300
 going like, "Look at this piece of paper.

52
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,800
 This is where the Japanese are, and this is where we're at."

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
 And that's going to be the first hour, is them just steadying a map.

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,300
 And then, I wonder if the movie Pearl Harbor is a prequel to Midway.

55
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,800
 I'm wondering if it's a shared universe.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
 I'll have to look into that.

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,300
 But I'm hoping that they just, maybe they'll show Ben Affleck.

58
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,800
 He'll be like walking in the background.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
 It'll be an Easter egg.

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,300
 People are like, "Whoa, I didn't know these two events were connected."

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,300
 They're going to, I hope that it starts off with probably Pearl Harbor.

62
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,800
 Some Pearl Harbor action.

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
 And then maybe half an hour of people going like,

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 "There's no way they're going to attack Midway."

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 The Japanese are going to attack this, and then they're like,

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,300
 "No, they're going to attack Midway."

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,800
 And then they get proven right.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
 And then the last, I hope the movie is like about two hours long.

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,800
 And the last hour and 45 minutes is just stuff getting blowing up.

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 And characters we barely know going,

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 "Look out, oh no, I'm going to die, I'm going to die."

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 And if in the movie, because I made a joke about this earlier,

73
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,300
 I forgot what episode it was.

74
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,300
 It was the human Bigfoot War, where the guy took a photo of his girlfriend

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,300
 and put it on his horse so he could see as sweetheart as he's riding in a battle.

76
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,300
 If when I'm watching Midway, because I will see it at the theater,

77
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,800
 if a character takes a photograph and puts it in the cockpit of their plane,

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,300
 I promise I will stand up in the theater and yell, "Go Bigfoot."

79
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
 And then sit down.

80
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,800
 And it will be the most non-sequitur thing possible,

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,300
 because I can almost guarantee that's going to happen.

82
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
 Someone's like, "Hey, who's that?"

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
 It's like, "Oh, no one. Just my sweetheart."

84
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,800
 And he's going to put it in his plane where it's visible.

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 I will yell from theater and yell, "Go Bigfoot."

86
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 That's enough to do with the rest of this podcast.

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 Let's go ahead and get started with the actual podcast here.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
 So it's funny, I saw this thing on Reddit today,

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,300
 and it's something that I've, I think there's only two people who believe this.

90
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,800
 Me and this Reddit person, because I've brought this up to people for years.

91
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,300
 People are always looking at me like I'm an idiot.

92
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
 They're like, "What?"

93
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,800
 Every so often I'm walking through a store, right?

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 So every so often I'm walking through a store.

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
 Like most humans, every so often they walk through a store.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
 But around Halloween time, you see all the costumes.

97
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
 I remember, again, I've had this conversation with multiple people,

98
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
 but for the example of setting up this narrative,

99
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,300
 once I was with my friend, we were walking through Walmart,

100
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,800
 and there was a skeleton costume for like a toddler.

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,300
 It's like a onesie with little bones on it.

102
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
 And it was actually Veronica who I was with.

103
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,800
 I go, "Hey, Veronica, isn't that weird?"

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
 She's like, "What?"

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,800
 "Why would you dress your baby up like how it's going to be someday?"

106
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 And she's like, "What?"

107
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 She's like, "What are you talking about?"

108
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 I think it was Veronica.

109
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
 And she goes, "What? What in the world does that mean?"

110
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
 And I go, "Everyone becomes a skeleton eventually.

111
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 Why would you take a baby and dress them as a dead version of your baby?"

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 Because I think that's the worst fear.

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
 That's one of the main reasons why I don't want to have kids.

114
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,300
 One, I can't afford them.

115
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,300
 Two, I could not fathom losing a child.

116
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,800
 I don't even like it when files get deleted from my computer.

117
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 I couldn't fathom like losing a child.

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 So if I had a kid, I definitely wouldn't make it look like it was dead.

119
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,300
 Now, you see that there have skeleton costumes for babies.

120
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
 Now, of course, they have skeleton costumes for adults too.

121
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,300
 It's not something people are like, "What? No, that kid's over the age of 13.

122
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
 He can't dress like a corpse."

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,300
 You have skeleton costumes for adults, but as an adult deciding to be a zombie,

124
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,800
 it's totally fine.

125
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
 Whatever.

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,300
 Yeah, you're a zombie, but the baby doesn't know.

127
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
 It doesn't understand it's a zombie.

128
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,800
 So basically, you're dressing your baby up as a dead baby.

129
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
 I don't understand that.

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
 And it's the zombie costume too.

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,300
 I'll see costumes for kids and their bloody makeup and rotting clothes and their kid's size.

132
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,300
 Then I'm thinking, every time I see a kid dressed up as a zombie,

133
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,800
 I go, "There is someone of your age group actually rotting away in a grave right now."

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 It's very, very terrifying to me to see kids dressed up as skeletons and zombies.

135
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
 I don't like it.

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
 And it's not because I think that they're actual skeletons and zombies.

137
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,300
 There's something chilling about that imagery.

138
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,800
 Everyone, of course, there's adult zombies and stuff like that.

139
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 And every time I see a zombie in general, when I'm watching The Walking Dead,

140
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 I'm not thinking, "Oh, so many lives have been lost."

141
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,300
 I'm not, that's different because I get that.

142
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,800
 And I guess there's some sort of psychological divide with that.

143
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 But to see a kid dressed up as a decaying corpse, a kid-sized corpse,

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,300
 it really makes me sad.

145
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,800
 I guess sad is probably a better word than frightened.

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
 And it doesn't make me sad like, "Oh, the parents are bad," or anything like that.

147
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,300
 It just makes me sad to think that death is inevitable.

148
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
 And sometimes kids die.

149
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,800
 Like, I really can't enjoy Halloween when there's a bunch of like,

150
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,300
 kid zombies, kid skeletons walking around.

151
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 So, yeah.

152
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,300
 But, okay, so, and I've had this conversation with multiple people before,

153
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,300
 and they just go, "What? What are you, that's no."

154
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,300
 I've never, ever had that thought before in my head.

155
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,300
 So I always figured it was just a Jason Quirk.

156
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,800
 I read this article recently and it said that, you know,

157
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
 and there's a scientific study for everything.

158
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,300
 And I've gotten to that point where I'm about as jaded towards science as I am towards ghosts.

159
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,300
 Because every week a new study comes out that contradicts a previous study.

160
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,800
 And if you don't like the results of that, wait a week,

161
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 and someone else will come out with a competing study.

162
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,800
 But anyways, I saw a study, and it was saying that humans can't comprehend death.

163
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 And I was like, "That's fascinating, 'cause I sure can."

164
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,300
 And I'm reading this article and the way that they did this is they showed people pictures of random people,

165
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,800
 and then the word like, "Funeral" or "death" or "burial" would pop up,

166
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 and they were gauging people's reaction.

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,300
 But when they showed people photos of themselves and flashed a negative death word,

168
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
 there was more of a delay.

169
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,300
 So, and I'm butchering it, it went more, it went more into it in the article,

170
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:49,300
 but basically the article saying, or the scientist was saying that when we're confronted with our own idea of death,

171
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,800
 there's a disconnect, and we have to think of it as the other.

172
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 We don't think of ourselves as dying, we think of death as something that happens to other people.

173
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,300
 And I was like, "I don't really know if you can extrapolate that from a couple pictures."

174
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,300
 And first off, how do you get those pictures of me, your pictures of me like going,

175
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,800
 like taking the garbage out pictures of me in the shower?

176
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,300
 I'm like, "That's why I'm hesitating trying to figure out where these pictures came from."

177
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,300
 But I sure can't, I'm wondering if that might be, and when I read that article, I go,

178
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,800
 "Maybe I have a glitch, maybe that is something..."

179
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,300
 I've talked to people, I go, "How are you, how do you like not think about death all the time?"

180
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,300
 And people are like, "Well, because then I never get anything done."

181
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,300
 Because I go, "I think about death all the time, all the time, always in the back of my head, no matter what I'm doing."

182
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,800
 And my death, really, my death.

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 And they go, "Yeah, no, I'd be paralyzed."

184
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,300
 And I think I've just always thought that, so I just deal with it.

185
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
 Sometimes I'll look in the mirror and go, "This might be the last time I ever see myself."

186
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,800
 Because I may die before I get to another mirror.

187
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 Like, just thoughts like that, thoughts like that.

188
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 Now, that might sound grim, and it is kind of grim, but I think it's just the way my brain works.

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 So I'm wondering if that scientific study is right, and people generally have a switch

190
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,800
 that doesn't allow them to really comprehend their own mortality, that switch may be off on me.

191
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,300
 And that might be why I'm a little more like, I don't like seeing, I don't like seeing kids in rotted costumes.

192
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,800
 I think that death may be a more constant thought for me than other people.

193
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 I don't know.

194
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,300
 But anyways, apparently me and this Reddit user are the only people who think that the,

195
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,300
 the Reddit user was actually, the question they were putting up was,

196
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,300
 "Is it a bad omen to dress a baby as a skeleton for Halloween or just good harmless fun?"

197
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,800
 And the responses were, "Oh no, it's totally fine, you can dress a baby up as a skeleton."

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 So even this guy was probably like, "Oh, well, I guess it's just me."

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,300
 At the very least, I don't think it's cute.

200
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,800
 I think it's, you know, like some people are like, "Oh, look, dress him up as a squirrel or something,

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,300
 or a, or a rabbit, or dress him up as a ghost."

202
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,800
 Oh, I guess that's the same. The difference is, is that a ghost is like cute.

203
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 A skeleton is what is underneath your flesh.

204
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 And, and a zombie is basically just you dying.

205
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300
 Ghost is, you know, I don't know, cute.

206
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,800
 Like, that's more ethereal.

207
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 That's more like hypothetical.

208
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 You're, you actually, there's no people who are skeptical about the existence of skeletons.

209
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 They're like, "Nah, you're just full of jelly. There's nothing in there."

210
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,300
 Anyways, I believe this is my political stance here.

211
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
 If I run for office in 2020 for the presidency,

212
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:36,300
 my first executive order will be no baby skeletons, no baby zombies, and I will be applauded.

213
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next segment.

214
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,300
 Our next segment is a little true crime nugget.

215
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,300
 Kind of a kind, kind of a short one, but unusual to say the least.

216
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
 Let's go ahead and let's hop in the carboner copter.

217
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
 We haven't been in this thing in a while.

218
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,800
 We are going to Canterbury, Spain, and we're not going that far back into the past.

219
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,800
 We're going in February 2019.

220
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 Now, there we're going to meet a woman named Maria del Carmen, who's 61 years old,

221
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
 and then her husband, Jesus Maria.

222
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:17,800
 My question is, if they're married, by the way, if his name is Jesus Maria and her name is Maria del Carmen,

223
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,300
 wouldn't that make her name Maria Maria, like that Santana song?

224
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,800
 Maria Maria.

225
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 Sound like a West Side Story.

226
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,300
 I hate that song with a passion.

227
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:40,800
 I'd rather be surrounded by babies and skeletons outfits than have to listen to Maria Maria one more time.

228
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 That's not true.

229
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
 Actually, anyways, let's go ahead.

230
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
 Maria Maria.

231
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
 So Jesus is missing.

232
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,300
 I'll go by first names because it's confusing otherwise.

233
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
 Jesus is missing.

234
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,800
 And the cops come to Maria's house.

235
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 They're looking around and she's like, he took like $13,000.

236
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,300
 He left, went on vacation.

237
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,800
 I don't think he's coming back.

238
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,300
 But the family is concerned about him because they can't really get ahold of this dude.

239
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
 He's just gone.

240
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,800
 So the cops are coming over.

241
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 They're talking to Maria.

242
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,300
 They're like, do you know anything?

243
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,800
 Taking notes, writing stuff down.

244
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
 They're writing down lyrics to Maria Maria.

245
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 They just can't get a song out of their head.

246
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
 And Maria's like, I've kind of told you guys everything that I know.

247
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,300
 I think that he just left me.

248
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,800
 And now it's really hard to investigate missing adults, especially in their 60s.

249
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,300
 You're going to figure unless we have a lead that they've been murdered, maybe they just pack up and leave.

250
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,300
 So what happens is the investigation is ongoing.

251
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
 Now we're in April 2019.

252
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,300
 Now Maria, again, she's 61 years old.

253
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,800
 She's an independent woman.

254
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 She has sex toys.

255
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,300
 Some women just have them laying around like you walk into their apartment and laying on the floor.

256
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
 Maybe not laying on the floor.

257
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,800
 That's probably a little filthy.

258
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 But bedstand, stuff like that.

259
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,300
 Bathroom, you're just like, hey, look at it.

260
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
 It's a soap dispenser.

261
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
 Squeeze, squeeze.

262
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,300
 And they're like, that's not a soap dispenser.

263
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,300
 But other people are a little more modest like Maria.

264
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,300
 So she got all of her sex toys because the cops kept coming over.

265
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,300
 And she was like, I don't want them to find my sex toys.

266
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
 Like I don't want to be embarrassed.

267
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,300
 This guy left me and I have no privacy now.

268
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,800
 The cops are always over here.

269
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,300
 Let me put all my sex toys in this box.

270
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,800
 I'm going to give it to a friend and she can hold on to him.

271
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 Maybe the cops will stop bugging me.

272
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,300
 Jesus is long gone.

273
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
 Jesus is not coming back.

274
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:32,300
 So she gives this box of sex toys to her friend and she's like, can you hold on to these just because the cops keep coming around and I'm just a, I'm an old woman.

275
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,300
 I don't want people to know that I have like a eight inch dragon dildo.

276
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,300
 And this friend's like, oh yeah, you have one of those too?

277
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
 Yes, I will hold this box for you.

278
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,800
 The other friend gives you the box.

279
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,800
 Now the cops are like, he left the Jesus left.

280
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
 Like he, we see the money was taken out of the account.

281
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
 There's no trace of him really.

282
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 Now what happens is he is communicating with his family via text.

283
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 He says that his old phone fell in the bathtub, which happens and and you know what happens if your phone falls in water, you're supposed to immediately take it out and then shove it in a bunch of rice.

284
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,300
 And the rice will suck the moisture out and then that will actually give you a higher likelihood of being able to salvage the phone.

285
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:23,300
 It doesn't work if you're on keto because you don't have rice laying around, but if you're not on keto and your phone drops in the water, grab some rice, do it right now and throw your phone in there.

286
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,300
 They should make a phone case that's just rice.

287
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
 And then it doesn't matter.

288
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
 You could fall it, drop it in immediately.

289
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
 I mean, you could use your phone.

290
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,300
 You wouldn't be able to use your phone, but it would be protected from water.

291
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
 I'm going to patent that.

292
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
 Don't steal that idea.

293
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 So he's texting the family, but they can't the family can't hear his voice.

294
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,300
 So the family suspicious, but the cops are like, listen, maybe he's nervous.

295
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,300
 Maybe he's going to audition to be on the voice and he's trying to save his voice for the reveal.

296
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
 But we've done all we can.

297
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,800
 We don't think he was murdered.

298
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,300
 We don't think he was kidnapped.

299
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
 We think he went on vacation.

300
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,800
 Cops actually really stop investigating the case at this point.

301
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,300
 You know, if something comes up, we'll look into it, but October 2019.

302
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:17,300
 So this month, the friend she gave the box of sex toys to starts to realize there is a smell in her apartment that wasn't there previously.

303
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,300
 So she's like, what's that?

304
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
 What's that smell?

305
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
 What is that coming from?

306
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:35,300
 Now she doesn't make an immediate connection between the box of mystery sex toys and the newfound smell because she got the box of sex toys.

307
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,300
 Back in April and use sex toys.

308
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,300
 I should also point out these aren't the factory sealed.

309
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:54,300
 There's a there's a charity in Sacramento that is called toys for tarts where you donate your used sex toys to women who can't afford sex toys.

310
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
 That's a gamble.

311
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
 That's risky.

312
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,300
 I don't care how many times you disinfect that.

313
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:12,300
 You're playing roulette if you are like, ooh, a used sex toy from an anonymous person in Sacramento.

314
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
 Anyways, toys for tarts.

315
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
 I wonder if they're still around.

316
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
 They're probably like in eight states by now.

317
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
 Such a stupid idea.

318
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
 It's probably incredibly successful.

319
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
 Where was it going?

320
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, box of sex toys.

321
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,300
 So she smells smelling around and she's like, hmm, I wonder what this smell is.

322
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,300
 So she's following her sniffer.

323
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
 She's sniffing around.

324
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
 Let's see, where's that at?

325
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,300
 And she goes her like she sees those stink lines.

326
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
 She visibly sees stink lines coming off of this box.

327
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:51,300
 She walks over to the box and she's like, oh, this is where the smell is coming from a box of used sex toys.

328
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:57,300
 I better open it up because I'm getting not I get I don't know am I not getting enough of the smell.

329
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,300
 If I open it up, maybe all of the smell will just dissipate and then I'll just have a box sex toys.

330
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,300
 She opens up the box of sex toys, which she had not opened up before it was sealed.

331
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,300
 I guess I should have said that it was sealed up until this moment.

332
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,300
 She opens it up and it's full of sex toys.

333
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:22,300
 Dildos vibrators, you know, the classics, the classic sex toys and a boiled severed head.

334
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,300
 No skin, just bleh, which you're saying isn't that a skull.

335
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
 Well, kind of.

336
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,300
 The head was boiled and wrapped in foil to hold in the smell.

337
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
 So it wasn't like a straight skull.

338
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,300
 There was still just like meaty matter on it.

339
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:47,300
 But anyways, she goes into instant shock and she falls down and the head rolls out after her.

340
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
 Now I made up that part.

341
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
 She does go into shock though.

342
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,300
 And she goes and she calls the cops and she's like, oh my God, you won't believe what I just found in a box of sex toys.

343
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:02,300
 So the cops show up at her house and they look in the sex toys and there is a human head.

344
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:08,300
 And then the cops go and arrest Maria because they have a chain of custody basically.

345
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
 They have a friend.

346
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:16,300
 Maria gives a woman a box, a box says a head in it and then she's able to say, yeah, Maria gave this to me.

347
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
 So what is Maria?

348
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
 This is what I thought was interesting too.

349
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
 What's Maria's excuse for this?

350
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
 You figure she was just like, dang, damn it.

351
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
 What had got away with it?

352
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
 If it wasn't for that horrible decaying stench.

353
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
 She, because they've arrested her now.

354
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
 Her defense is this.

355
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,300
 Okay, I knew when you were investigating Jesus' disappearance, he was dead.

356
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,300
 That part was true, but I didn't kill him.

357
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
 I didn't kill him.

358
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:50,300
 What happened was one day I went to my front door and lo and behold was Martin's boiled head sitting on the ground.

359
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,300
 The cops go, why didn't you call us?

360
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,300
 And she goes, it was the only part of him I had left and I wanted to remember him.

361
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,300
 So I put him inside a box of sex toys.

362
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
 Now the cops obviously don't believe that.

363
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
 They don't believe that she just, oh, look at a head.

364
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
 Oh, it's my husband's head.

365
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,300
 I'm going to hold onto this even though the cops are looking for to find out whether or not he's been murdered.

366
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
 The cops don't believe that at all.

367
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,300
 What's interesting is the cops believe that Maria didn't kill him.

368
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:28,300
 The cops believe that Maria hired hitmen because there are pieces of evidence they've come across that make them think it was a professional hit.

369
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,300
 One of them being, this is odd, the way the head was boiled.

370
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:41,300
 Apparently there is a professional way to boil a human head to eliminate most, if not all, of the biological matter.

371
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
 In jail right now they're still investigating that.

372
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,300
 That would explain the $13,000 it could have went to a hitman.

373
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
 But this story is still unfolding.

374
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
 She was just arrested this month.

375
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
 So we'll see what happens with the case of the box.

376
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,300
 I'm wondering too if they're going to, if the head was originally in the box of sex toys,

377
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,300
 I'm wondering if she was using the head as a sex toy as well.

378
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
 And I'm sure the cops are wondering that as well.

379
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,300
 If you have to hide a human head, you're not going to be like,

380
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,300
 "Oh, where am I going to put this? I can throw this out in the river.

381
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,300
 I can put it in a suitcase or put it in a box of sex toys."

382
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,300
 Like, it may have already been there being used.

383
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,300
 And then when she was like, "Oh, someone's going to eventually find this head."

384
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,300
 She just taped that same box shut and gave it to her friend.

385
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,300
 I think we've run out of time. I think we've run out of time for the clone story.

386
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,300
 I think, I don't think we have time for that honestly.

387
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,300
 But let me give you a teaser for tomorrow then.

388
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,300
 Because tomorrow, actually, you know what? I was originally going to have this, this works.

389
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,300
 Because I was going to have the clone part broken up into two segments, two episodes.

390
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,300
 But now I can do it all as one episode. Tomorrow, send in the clones special.

391
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,300
 It's all about clones, baby. It's all about clones.

392
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,300
 And you go, "Jason, that's kind of lame. I've heard other podcasts about..."

393
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,300
 Whoop. You haven't heard another podcast about the type of clones we're talking about.

394
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,300
 Yes, we are going to talk about celebrity clones. We're going to talk about...

395
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 Was Eminem a clone?

396
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
 Was Avril Lavigne a clone? Or is she still a clone?

397
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,300
 I guess would be more grammatically correct.

398
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
 But...

399
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,300
 The first part, we're going to delve into a clone that nobody knows of.

400
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,300
 Or no one suspected of, at least.

401
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,300
 Maybe the most powerful clone to have ever existed.

402
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,300
 But how come nobody is talking about it?

403
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:43,300
 And then we are going to go straight into the Illuminati cloning facilities themselves.

404
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:51,300
 To meet a man who was not only cloned, imprisoned, tortured...

405
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
 And then escaped.

406
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,300
 But, while he was trapped in that Illuminati underground cloning facility...

407
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:04,300
 He managed to write all the music you've ever heard.

408
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 And we'll talk about that more tomorrow on a new episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

409
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,300
 Don't you just love these cliffhangers? I know I do.
