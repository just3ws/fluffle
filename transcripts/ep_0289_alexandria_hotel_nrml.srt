00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Today, we start Vampire Week, with the story of a blood mobile being pursued down a dark, lonely road.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And then we travel to Los Angeles to visit the famed luxurious Alexandria Hotel.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Well, it was luxurious back in the 20s, but today it's full of crackheads, cockroaches, and ghosts.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 It's Marathon Day for me. I'm recording all five episodes today and editing them tomorrow.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 So the rest of the week, I can just work and do play practice.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Work and play practice. From 7am to 9pm, I will be out to doing something.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 It's going to be absolute hell, but I want to get all these episodes out for you guys.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I got a Patreon to thank. I got Alexandra Watts. Thank you for joining the Patreon.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 She actually submitted the Guy Trash story about the big black dog in England.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 She's in England, Jolly Old England over there. Good day, mate.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And the other story she had was one about the crazy British couple who thought people were trapped in their cellar or in their sub-basement or something like that.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So thank you very much for joining the Patreon.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 We have Vampire Week going on. It's a brand new thing. Just came up with it.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And the impetus for it was, one, having a theme makes it easier to research stuff.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And I got a series of emails from Mason Nordbeck, who's also a Patreon of mine. Thanks for supporting the show.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 He just sent me like maybe 10 different stories involving werewolves and vampires in the news, and I said, "This is perfect."

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So thank you, Mason. You pretty much provided the structure for this.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 But not every story we're going to cover this week is from Mason. Some of them I stumbled across on my own.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 But let's go ahead and get started with Spooky Spooky Vampire Week.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We're going to start off Vampire Week with a little bloodmobile incident.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Ooh, sounds sinister. Bloodmobile. Why do they call them bloodmobile?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 That has to be a slang term. I don't think the Red Cross is like, "Hey, do you have the keys through the bloodmobile?"

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I don't think that's the official name. But anyways, bloodmobile.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I also should note, like I said, I'm recording all these episodes in one day.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I wonder if my sanity is going to decrease with each episode. His sweat's dripping off my body.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Okay, 1967. Let's go back to the year 1967.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Hop in the Jason Jalopy, because this is a road story. We're on the road.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 1967, we're in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Now, people who know Point Pleasant know it, unless you live there, and then I'm sure it's a lovely place,

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 but most people know Point Pleasant as the home of the mothman, that creature, fictional,

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 that flies around with moth wings or something. You know what? To be fair, I don't have a great opinion of the mothman story,

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 because one, I think it's kind of lame, a bunch of, like, a big old dudes flying around and then a bridge collapses.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 The end. And apparently, if you see the mothman, it's battle luck or something like that.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Like, I think the story itself is kind of lame. Like, no one gets eaten. There's no, like, laser beams.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So, you know, you see my threshold. Now you know why all my alien stories involve aliens getting chased with chainsaws.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I read so many stories where it's just like a bright light in the sky. I'm like, that's boring.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Alien in the woods, that's boring. Mothman just flies around and bridge collapses. The end.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Then he's like, was mothman spotted at 9/11? No, because he doesn't exist. That's my personal opinion.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's one of those things that I'm... Okay, but to be fair too, I went and saw the mothmanic chronicles that's movie with Richard Gere,

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 and I didn't like that. So maybe that's why I don't like the mothman much? I don't know.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I just don't think he's a compelling cryptid. Bigfoot at least is like, killed people.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Mothman just flies around. Big old mothwings. Maybe he doesn't have mothwings. I don't know.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But anyways, I'm already losing my sanity. Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It's 1967. It's March 5th. It's a cold spring night. And you have a guy, which this...

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 This is his real name, apparently. His name's Beau Scherzer. I guess that's not too funny.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I guess it just looks funnier than it sounds. So Beau Scherzer is driving on the road with a...

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 What's described as a young nurse? Ooh, a sexy young nurse in a blood mobile.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Beau is driving this car with this gorgeous young nurse in 1967. So her hair is all up in a bun.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 She does crosstops all the time. I love this sentence. This sentence...

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I was reading an excerpt from a book on this story. This is the sentence.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Beau Scherzer, 21, and a young nurse had been out all day collecting human blood.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Like it's a normal thing. I guess if it's a blood mode, they make it sound like they're just picking it up off the street.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 A garbage man collects garbage. If you don't collect blood, they're collecting human blood.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 You've got to catch them all, right? So they have 152 bags of blood in the back of their blood mobile.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Satisfied. Team Rocket's like, "We'll get you next time."

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And the blood mobile's driving away. It's nighttime. It's March 5th. This is going to be a long five episode.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I can't even stay on top of this one. This blood mobile's driving down the road at night.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And it's a deserted stretch of road, and it's like forested around.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And they're driving, and they see a hill off in the distance and it has like a little forest on top of the hill.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And they see a bright light, like, "Woo-woah, woo-woah." Kind of like throbbing in the woods, right?

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 I'm not going to make a sex joke. It's throbbing out in the woods.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And then it goes "woom, woom, woom, woom, woom." It kind of lifts and ejaculates out of the top of the woods.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 This white light kind of lifts up out of the woods. And they're freaking out now.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Like he's looking at it, and the young hot nurse is like, "What is it?" That's our actual quote.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I think our actual quote was "Oh my God, what is it?" It's original. Who's writing this script?

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 The little ship goes "woom, woom, woom, woom." And then it flies over the blood mobile.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Like in a heartbeat, it goes from the hillside over to the blood mobile.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 That's weird enough. That's weird enough. So you're driving your blood mobile, you got your nurse next to you.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 She doesn't have a name either. I'm not just him omitting her name. She doesn't have a name in the story.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 If I refer to her as "hot nurse," that's why she might have been "merc nurse ratchet" for all I know.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 They're driving down the road. This UFO is now hovering over the blood mobile.

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And then you're like, "Okay, classic UFO story. It's going to make the car stop."

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 They wake up 20 minutes later, four hours have passed. No. This UFO, so he's slamming on the gas.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 "Wooom, go, go, go, go, go." And the UFO is keeping pace with it. Of course.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It's an interstellar object. It can go 85 miles an hour. But at that point, two large metal pinchers go, "Wooom."

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And start lowering out of the top of the UFO. And it's getting red like one on each side of the blood mobile.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So both things, and it's a pretty, pretty accurate, I think any normal person would think this,

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 that the UFO is trying to pinch the blood mobile to grasp onto it like one of those claws at a toy stuffed animal stupid machine you see at Walmart.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 It's going to pick it up and take it, fly away with it, whatever.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 This thing is going to pinch the blood mobile and steal it. So he's like, "Ahh, I'm sure he was a little more fennec than that."

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And the thing was about to pinch down. They're getting closer.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And a car appears from the other direction and both sees it and the car sees him and the UFO goes, "Oh, no."

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And he flies away, UFO flies away. So that story was reported in a book by John Keel, author of the Mothman Prophecies.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So he was kind of just, the author was really into, he's most famous for the Mothman Prophecies,

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 but he was really into high strangeness of all sorts.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And he had the story in one of his books, it might have actually been the Mothman Prophecies,

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 but he's talking about the story and people have come to say, "Ooh, is that Mothman?"

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Not Mothman, obviously. Mothman doesn't have giant pinchers. It started to be retconned that it wasn't metal pinchers.

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It was Mothman's arms. Like, I really hate Mothman. I really, really dislike that urban legend or whatever it is that made up fable.

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 But anyways, John Keel to his credit, because again, I'm not bashing John Keel. I just think it's stupid.

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 His Mothman stuff, stupid. Everything else is fine.

95
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 But he said he started calling around the American Red Cross saying, "Have you guys ever had any blood mobiles missing on the road?"

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And he said that they acted like he was a lunatic, you know, which to be fair, that is something a lunatic would say.

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So it's funny because I stumbled across this story because I was looking into alien vampire connection.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And there's actually a lot, but we're going to touch on some later in the week.

99
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And we touched on one in the past, which was Operation Plate.

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 That big episode I did, like, it was episode 60 or 70 about an entire town in Brazil

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 that was being attacked by the Chupa Chupas, where the suck sucks, these UFOs would appear in the night and then suck the blood out of people.

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And so we did that, we did that episode.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 But I wanted to find something new, and this came across, and it's a super underreported story.

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Are aliens trying to get human blood? You figure there'd be easier ways to do it.

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And this type of story has never been repeated.

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 However, the reason why John Keel was calling the American Red Cross, because his question was, which is always a good question,

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 maybe we're only hearing about this one because they got away.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Or there other, is there a like UFO junkyard that's just a bunch of blood mobiles

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 and a bunch of skeletons of hunky young lab assistants and hot nurses in the vans rotting away?

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Who knows? Who knows?

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Let's move on to our next story. I have no way, I don't really have another way to end that.

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I do think it's a fascinating story though.

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I do like it. We need more UFO stories, your UFOs are attacking people and tired of just seeing lights in the sky.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Pinshires are pretty cool too.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Well actually, now that I think about it, I'm sure they have better technology than the technology you have at a Walmart vending machine.

116
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Whenever they want to get one of their ships out, they have to put a quarter in and it comes out in a big old plastic ball

117
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 and they pop it open and get in the ship and fly away.

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Okay, let's move on to our next story.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Now our next story starts off with a little prologue.

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 There is a hotel in Alexandria, Virginia called the Relax Inn.

121
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Oh, that's so sweet. Just relax in. Don't go outside.

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 There's a review on TripAdvisor, one of my favorite websites I've referred to multiple times over the course of this show,

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 from September 13th, 2016.

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I'm going to read you this as far as I know this is real.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Okay, I'm going to read you this in full and then this is a prologue for the story we're going to.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 This is the review for the Relax Inn title of the review.

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Where my sister committed suicide?

128
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Review of Relax Inn, reviewed September 13th, 2016.

129
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Here's the actual, here's the review. Here's the review. For real.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 That's how it starts off. I'm not saying that. For real.

131
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Motel staff cleaned up the room very well.

132
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 There was no blood.

133
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 She put a plastic bag over her head with a tube to a helium tank.

134
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Fairfax County police found her.

135
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I had to read this. This next part I didn't get. I had to reread it a couple of times.

136
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 So let me start this part over. Fairfax County police found her.

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 No, she was not floating around the room, but I think she was all blue.

138
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And I thought, why? What? What? She's not floating around the room.

139
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 She was not found floating around. What is going on?

140
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And then I realized that his sister killed her.

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And then I realized his sister killed herself with a helium tank.

142
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So are we sure that multiple people, as he told the story, said,

143
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 was she floating? And he had to preempt that.

144
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Because unfortunately that is a common new quote-unquote painless way to kill yourself.

145
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Apparently if you get the mixture right, you fall asleep.

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 If you get it wrong, your brain leaks and it's incredibly painful.

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So don't do it. Don't commit suicide anyways, but it's actually,

148
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 people have built it as being like super painless, super painful actually.

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 'Cause your brain explodes. But, oh and he also raided the trip.

150
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So anyways, he goes on with his review.

151
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 He puts travel type, travel solo, well generally when you commit suicide you're biased.

152
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And then he...

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Okay, so at this point you're thinking, Jason, you're just being cruel.

154
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I kind of think this is a joke, I can't be for sure, but this is why I think it's a joke.

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 It then allows you to rate special parts of it.

156
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 He gave a four to service, 'cause you know they cleaned up the blood.

157
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 There was no blood, they knocked her floating body off the ceiling.

158
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 He gave a four for cleanliness.

159
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And he gave a five for sleep quality.

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Because she's dead, and she's sleeping forever.

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 This actually plays a part in our next story.

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Now, we're gonna talk about the Alexandria Hotel.

163
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 You like that tone change there?

164
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 We're gonna talk about the Alexandria Hotel in Los Angeles.

165
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Now, this is actually a recommendation from a friend of mine named Dan.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 He was the producer on that short film I've talked about, Bulldog Skin.

167
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Last night he went out with Dan and Ash.

168
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 She was the director in Carson, who was the cinematographer.

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 But anyways, so he was telling me that he used to live in the Alexandria Hotel in Los Angeles.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And it is right next to the Cecil Hotel, which conspiracy theorists know all about,

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 because that's the hotel that was involved in the Black Dahlia murders and the Eliza Lamb case,

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 where the young woman had a mental condition, went up onto the roof,

173
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 and jumped into a water tank, and then died.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And then she rot in the water tank, and for about two weeks,

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 people, black water was coming out of their, drank out of their faucets,

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 and people were like, "Eh, you know, water's water, and they're drinking it.

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 They're drinking this decaying woman."

178
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Now, those are really, and Black Dahlia was a woman who got chopped up.

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So those are probably big, like, too long, didn't watch versions of both of those stories.

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Both of those stories are things that I most likely will never cover on the show.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Black Dahlia is one of the most notable true crime stories of all time, really.

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Probably in the top ten, at least in America.

183
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And then Eliza Lamb is a, as far as I'm concerned, completely debunked conspiracy theory.

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 It's totally plausible for her to have gotten in the roof by herself.

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 I don't think there was ghosts or anything involved in that.

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I think she was just mentally disturbed.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 So, Alexandria Hotel.

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Now, so thank you, Dan, for the recommendation.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 He told me, he said that he hadn't personally seen ghosts, but he goes,

190
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 "Here's the thing, you walk into the hotel, and he'd live there for a while,

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 and he goes every, he goes near, I don't want to misquote him,

192
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 because I know him personally, he'll be like, "I didn't say that."

193
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 He goes, "Almost every tenant in that building had a ghost story."

194
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 You'd be walking in the hallway, you'd see someone, and they'd be like,

195
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 "Hey, Dan, how's it going? I'm doing pretty good."

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 "I saw Phantom last night."

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And you'd be like, "Huh?"

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Telling everyone's telling spooky ghost stories in the lobby,

199
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 and then they have to go upstairs to their quiet room.

200
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And he said the security guards said that they would be looking at the security cameras,

201
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 and they would see chairs move in the lobby.

202
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Because the story of the Alexandria Hotel, and I'm going to just do another brief overview of it,

203
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 it has this grand history, but it was built in like 1906.

204
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 It was a super luxurious hotel, you had presidents stay there, and super famous people.

205
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Rudolph Valentino was there, good old Rudy,

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 and Charlie Chaplin used to hang out there, Mary Pickford, all that stuff.

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Famous people, long, long time ago.

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And they had one whole section of the, some guy built an annex onto the hotel,

209
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 and started charging less rent, so the owner of the hotel like walled it up,

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 so there's an entire wing of the hotel.

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It's an apartment complex now.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 There was an entire wing of the hotel that hadn't been touched for like 50 years.

213
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Like it was just walled up.

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I was like, "That's fascinating.

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I'm going to go home and do some more research on this stuff."

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And then he goes, "Wait, Jason, he grabs my arm before I get up to go to leave from the table."

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He's like, "Hold on. Stop. I haven't told you everything yet."

218
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I'm like, "What do you mean?" And he goes, "Sit back down."

219
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I said, "Sit back down."

220
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 None of that, none of that happened.

221
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 But he said the place was also super disgusting.

222
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Glittered with bedbugs.

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I've never seen a bedbug before.

224
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 He goes, "Yeah, you can see him crawl across the beds,

225
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 and they would spray one floor,

226
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 and then they would go down to the next floor and spray that floor,

227
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 and the bugs would just go to different floors that had already had him and sprayed yet.

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 They would just move them down."

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Eventually he said he was going to leave, and he was in the basement.

230
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 He was like in the bottom garage area.

231
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 There was a bedbug.

232
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 There's no beds anywhere.

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 There's just a bedbug in the elevator taking the elevator down,

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 looking for some place to go.

235
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 That was his last day there.

236
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Now, he had had some interesting stories,

237
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 not necessarily paranormal,

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 but his window opened up into a window across the alleyway

239
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 where there was another building,

240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 and there would be a half-naked guy just staring at him

241
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 while he was chopping vegetables, hanging out with his friends.

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 One night he forgot to shut his door,

243
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 and he woke up his phone and his wallet were gone.

244
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Now that is just -- he's in LA.

245
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Oh, I guess I should say this -- let me -- I went off the history thing.

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So the hotel used to have all these famous people in there,

247
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 but as LA expanded,

248
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 West Hollywood started getting more and more poverty-stricken

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 because all the money was going to other parts as the city was growing.

250
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 So now it's a hellhole.

251
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Like, now there's just thousands of homeless people there.

252
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And when I say "there," I mean, like, in the building.

253
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So the idea of the Alexandria Hotel has two basic elements to it,

254
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 and I'm going to tie it together in the end.

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 The place is infested today with bedbugs,

256
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 like Dan was saying,

257
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 and cockroaches.

258
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 They run in herds in this building.

259
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 They're doing maneuvers.

260
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 They make a giant fist.

261
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 They open your door.

262
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 They steal your wallet and your phone.

263
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Now, the homeless people have invaded the building,

264
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 so you have the people paying the rent,

265
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 and then you would walk out of your door

266
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 and there'd be a homeless guy just laying in your hallway.

267
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 There was one guy who got on an elevator,

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 and it was got crowded,

269
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 and there was a guy in a wheelchair in the middle of it,

270
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 and then he pulled a knife out and started like slashing the people in the elevator,

271
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 which sounds like a horror movie, really,

272
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 because what are you going to do?

273
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You're just going to press up against the side of the elevator

274
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 and put one foot to the wheel of his wheelchair,

275
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 and hopefully he can't get you.

276
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 The elevators haunted, by the way, too.

277
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 They say the elevator stops at floors

278
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 that there's no button press, and the door will open up

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 like someone's walking out.

280
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I know I'm going back and forth between the bedbugs and the ghosts,

281
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 but I do think they're connected in a way.

282
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 The fire alarm goes off in the middle of the night,

283
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 which would be terrifying, the first four times it happened,

284
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 but apparently it's some sort of malfunction.

285
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And I think that's where you start to see the connection.

286
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Is there stuff going on in the hotel that is the result of shoddy management?

287
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Not taking care of stuff.

288
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Are there a bunch of homeless people walking around in this building

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 because they're attracted by the horrible evil of the building?

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Or they're just really bad security?

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And again, it's a state how crummy this building is.

292
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 This was the apartment building used as the serial killers apartment building from 7.

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 It's that gross that David Fincher said,

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 "Ooh, I don't even need to do set dressing on this place."

295
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 So here's two different reviews highlighting the two big problems with Alexandria Hotel.

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And I honestly don't know which one's funnier.

297
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 First one is from a guy named Andre P.

298
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And I'm gonna skip a bunch of stuff because it's just boring relationship stuff.

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 But anyways, so here's the experiences from Andre at the Alexandria Hotel.

300
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 "I felt breathing behind me when I would walk through the hallways.

301
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 My cell phone calls would get interrupted with demonic whispers and screams.

302
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I bet you that he uses Sprint and it's just really bad cell phone service.

303
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I'd see dark shadows. A good night's sleep was out of the question

304
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 because I constantly felt I was being watched.

305
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 The shower would turn on by itself and lightly stream at 3 AM every morning."

306
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Shhh.

307
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And he goes on to say that he talked to his neighbors and they said,

308
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 "Yeah, we have weird stuff there too."

309
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And then he goes, he ends his review saying,

310
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 "I heard everything between people and dogs committing suicide and Charlie Chaplin's ghost."

311
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Gave the place two stars, by the way.

312
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Causes people and canines to kill themselves.

313
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Demonic groans and a rep your phone call, two stars.

314
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 It's not the worst place he's ever stayed.

315
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And then we have this review.

316
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 This is maybe the best review I've ever read on any website ever.

317
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 "I have a deaf neighbor who is a prostitute who sells drugs at late hours."

318
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 [cough]

319
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 "Since many of her customers are deaf..."

320
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 "Since many of her customers are deaf, they're deaf as well, they bang on the door so loud..."

321
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 "That it shakes the walls at 2 AM to 5 AM in the morning."

322
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Now, from what I understand the walls are super flimsy.

323
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 The floors are concrete with giant cracks in them from multiple earthquakes

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 and cockroaches crawl out of your floor all the time.

325
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And to be fair, let's go back to that review.

326
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 That's a specialized drug dealer.

327
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 She's a deaf drug dealer who's also a prostitute who primarily sells drugs to other deaf people.

328
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I mean, that is a specialized drug dealer.

329
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 I wonder if she like charges them more because who else can like do drug deals in sign language?

330
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 This is probably my least sensitive episode.

331
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 But no, that's being an entrepreneur.

332
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 If I was deaf, I would specialize in selling drugs, selling heroin to a deaf person.

333
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 That's really good.

334
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 You can either be stuck, if you pick number two, you're stuck in a room with Charlie Chaplin's ghost

335
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 and the ghost of a guy committed suicide.

336
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 If you pick number one, you live next door to a deaf prostitute who sells drugs to deaf people.

337
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So, why are you rambling about all this stuff, Jason?

338
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Well, I came up with an interesting theory regarding this.

339
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I actually was headed on one path.

340
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And it's something I've talked about before, that dark places tend to attract dark people.

341
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 So, if you have a...

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And what's interesting is I've read several reviews, several notes and stuff like that about suicides and murders at the hotel.

343
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I couldn't find articles pertaining to that.

344
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 So, it makes me think of one of two things.

345
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 One, it's an urban legend and not a lot of people die there.

346
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Or two, it happens so often, it's not noteworthy.

347
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Suicides rarely make the newspaper unless it's something super bizarre.

348
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But murders tend to.

349
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But in LA, in a hotel, in a bad side of town, people really might not be thinking about that.

350
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Oh, I should say this too.

351
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 This would be why no journalist would go there.

352
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 The bedbugs are so bad, the post service doesn't deliver mail to the building, according to multiple reviews.

353
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Because the bedbugs will hop in their mailbag and they deliver them to other parts of the city.

354
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 So, they don't deliver mail there.

355
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 UPS won't deliver mail there either.

356
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 The place has been described as smelling between rotting flesh or this is, again, a great...

357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 I don't know what this would smell like, but someone said, "The hallway smell like a mixture of body odor and boiled chicken."

358
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So, it's not a place...

359
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 It's only like $600 a month, though, if you're in LA.

360
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Is it the fact that this place does have a lot of suicides, a lot of murders that have just kind of been lost time?

361
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 It's an old hotel that's in a bad side of town that's mainly populated by a mixture of elderly people and young people who are just getting started in LA

362
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 and elderly people who are dying in LA.

363
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And do they just kind of infuse it with this emotional energy?

364
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 The young people are just struggling and the old people are just ready to go.

365
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Like, they're like, "Oh, man, I can't believe I ended up in the Alexandria."

366
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So, you're cooking boiled chicken.

367
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And that's possible. That's possible.

368
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 The place could just be like a magnet for this stuff.

369
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 But I actually came up with another... as I was reading all this stuff, I thought about it and I go, "Hmm, what would be the effects on the human psyche in a building infested with insects?"

370
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Like, think about that for a second.

371
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 As species, we're the master of our domain.

372
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 I can go and I can open a window, the place gets cooler, I can turn on a fan, the place gets cooler, I'm sweating so much right now.

373
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But when you have an insect infestation, you're really not.

374
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 You've already tried all these different ways to kill the bugs and they keep coming.

375
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And you already feel a little powerless because you're just renting one of all of these rooms.

376
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It's not like you can really take care of the pest problem because your neighbor has the pest too and stuff like that.

377
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 So, what is the effect on the human psyche in a building that is completely infested with cockroaches and bedbugs?

378
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Would that actually break you down to the point where you're more susceptible to, like, just losing control?

379
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 You're like, "If I wake up covered in bedbug bites one more time, I'm murdering someone."

380
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 But then I thought, "Hmm, hmm, what if there's an even more rational explanation for this?"

381
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 So there's a thing called infrasound at 18.9 hertz.

382
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 That is, you can't hear it, but that is the frequency that your eyeballs are attuned to.

383
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 So basically, like, there's that thing that if a note is played at the right frequency, other things in the room can resonate to it.

384
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 That's why if I hit a key on a piano, it can actually make the piano string resonate on the other piano in the same room,

385
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 because it's tuned to the same frequency or something like that.

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I just read that in an article, but 18.9 hertz is the same frequency your eyeball vibrates at.

387
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So when you hear that tone, it's making your eyeball jiggle and it makes you see things that aren't there.

388
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 It makes you feel a sense of dread, it makes you terrified.

389
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And it makes you see things.

390
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And scientists have kind of played around with it, and they think that when people see ghosts, that may be like a busted fan.

391
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And you don't hear it, but it's putting out that frequency.

392
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Tiger's roar, part of their roar is 18.9 hertz, which just terrifies you.

393
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 What if--and one of the causes of that is a particular type of earthquake as well in this building is an LA,

394
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 and it has been affected by several earthquakes, but what if the sound of all those insects all night long?

395
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And you're not necessarily hearing it, but the sound is there.

396
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 When they get close enough, you'll hear them marching.

397
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 But if we're talking thousands of cockroaches and thousands of bedbugs infesting a building constantly scurrying about,

398
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 they are making noise, you just can't hear it.

399
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Now, that noise isn't in 18.9 hertz, but the only reason why we know that is an accidental discovery in a "haunted laboratory."

400
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 A guy thought he saw something out of the corner of his eye, he believed in ghosts, he was a ghost hunter,

401
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 he realized that a fan or a piece of equipment was malfunctioning, he repaired it, and all of a sudden he felt totally fine.

402
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And he goes, "I'm going to do some experiments," and he was able to figure that out.

403
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 What if there is another sound of a higher frequency range that drives you mad?

404
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 You could maybe full on hallucinate, look at a security monitor and see a chair move across the ballroom,

405
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 or you could just, it could just drive you crazy.

406
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 You think you're sitting in a quiet room, but you're really hearing all the time.

407
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 The place, if there are such a thing as ghosts, that place almost seems like it would be a magnet for them.

408
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's in a totally depressed part of town, full of totally depressed people.

409
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And you got drugs, you got crime, you got boiled chicken, you got everything you could need for a ghost too.

410
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But even if ghosts don't exist, I think it would be the perfect place to think they did.

411
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 It seems like the type of place that would drive you mad.

412
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 When I was researching this, I found far more horror stories about crime and crack addicts,

413
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 people getting their apartments broken into, than anything about Charlie Chaplin's ghost.

414
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 When people were saying, "Stay away from the hotel," they weren't saying, "Stay away from the hotel," Annabelle might get you.

415
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 They were saying, "Stay away from the hotel," you may get stabbed to death by a crack addict.

416
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 It's funny because it's very rare that happy places are considered haunted.

417
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Churches are considered holy. You go out to nature to be one with nature.

418
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Hauntings are something we ascribe to bad places.

419
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Assuming there's just not the one off, I feel like my grandma's still in my house, I can smell her clone.

420
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Not clone, I can smell her cooking every once in a while, maybe her clone, I don't know.

421
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 But if you have a place that's full of negativity, that's attracting negative people,

422
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 that's bringing in people at the start of their long struggle through life or at the end of their journey,

423
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 and you infest that place with bugs that have played humanity since the beginning,

424
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 that would be the perfect spot for a ghost, and not only a ghost, but demons.

425
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Because if you wanted to wallow in human suffering,

426
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 what better place to go than the Alexandria Hotel in Los Angeles, California?

427
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 One star. Sleep quality zero.
