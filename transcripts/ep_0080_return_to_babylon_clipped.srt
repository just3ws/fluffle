1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 A creepy cat man that stalks you in the dark.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,120
 And what happens when you find some abandoned film grills, shoot a movie with it, and the

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,320
 images are haunted today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:23,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,160
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,200
 So the last episode we profiled Bambi Sleeves, which was the audio file that people were

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,600
 saying created a disassociative personality in you and basically created an alter ego

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,840
 of a bimbo in your head.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,840
 And I told you guys I was going to listen to it.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
 You know what?

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,080
 I stopped listening to it because it started giving me a headache and I don't know if that's

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,160
 like a side effect of a hypnosis.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,400
 And I didn't stop listening because I was afraid of, you know, becoming a bimbo or like

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,560
 a ghost, you know, invading me or whatever.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,840
 But it was really just like, because it has that "woom woom woom woom" going on.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,600
 And then the multiple voices, which again I'm fine with.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,600
 I think part of the thing is your brain is trying to listen, understand what the main

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,800
 voice is saying, and then also hear the little tiny voices in the background.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,040
 And yeah, it was just giving me a headache.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,200
 It wasn't enjoyable at all.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,440
 I got through the first two audio files and that was like a total of a half hour.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,200
 The whole series, the first series, I think is close to two or three hours of files.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,640
 So I was like, I can't, I can't do this weird thing.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,400
 Although I will say this though, weird things have been happening in my, in my apartment.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,900
 Very weird things.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,760
 The other night I woke up at around four and I was like, I need to go to the bathroom.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,120
 And I walked and went to the bathroom and I'm in the bathroom and I realized that my boxers

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
 are gone.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,480
 I went to bed wearing boxers and they were gone.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,240
 I'm like, where did my boxers go?

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,400
 Did they take them off in the middle of the night?

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
 Like that's weird.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,080
 I'm pretty sure that I, I know I went to bed with them on, but I woke up and they were

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
 gone.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
 They were off of me.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,520
 And then the next night I'm laying there, quote unquote, in bed.

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,320
 I sleep on the couch normally.

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
 I just like sleeping on a couch.

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
 I don't know what it is.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,080
 I'm sleeping on the couch and I'm getting ready to go to sleep.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,000
 And I remember having this bizarre thought I've never had in my life.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,360
 I thought, my boxers are clean.

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
 I'm going to take them off.

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
 And I was like, it was weird in hindsight.

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
 Oh, I don't want to fall asleep in my clean boxers for whatever reason.

48
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,360
 So I take them off and then I wake up in the morning.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,480
 They're gone.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
 There are nowhere in my house.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,600
 There is a pair of black boxers that were clean, mind you.

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,240
 Not saying most of my boxers are dirty, but I remember this pair was particularly clean.

53
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,240
 This story is getting weird.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,480
 I had a pair of black boxers that I had just put on that day.

55
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,320
 Well, I put all my boxers on that day.

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,160
 Anyways, the point is, is that I guess I'm getting into the quibbles of my boxer laundry,

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,400
 but I went to bed.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,440
 I don't normally care whether or not I just put my boxers on that day.

59
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
 I had such a bizarre thought.

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
 I took them off.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
 I woke up.

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,200
 I went to put them back on, you know, to go to work.

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 They're gone.

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
 Completely gone.

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,600
 Now again, I'm sleeping in my living room.

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
 Where did they go?

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
 The boxers are completely gone.

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,640
 So Friday night, I wake up naked.

69
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,920
 Saturday night, I lose my clothes.

70
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,120
 So I don't know.

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,920
 Now obviously the logical explanation is they're around here somewhere.

72
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,200
 I do now have to do my laundry.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,880
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,800
 That technically was my last pair of clean boxers.

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,000
 I think that might have been it.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,280
 But that doesn't explain why they're gone.

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,280
 So first thing we're going to talk about, I found out I was on 4chan posting some dead

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,440
 rabbit radio stuff.

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,760
 It's a good place for me to find listeners.

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,000
 I know a lot of people don't like that website, but the paranormal board actually has a really

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,720
 good community for the most part.

82
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
 I think I'm about to get banned from there though, but for posting my stuff.

83
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,600
 But while I was there, some guy was like, "Hey, does anyone know about the Catman?"

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,040
 And posted this horrifying photo.

85
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,120
 I'm not horrifying by normal 4chan standards or old school 4chan standards.

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
 It's a lot better than it used to be.

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,200
 But it was a picture of a hobo.

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,920
 I'm the only person who still uses that word, but it's such a lovable word.

89
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:32,560
 It's a picture of a hobo covered in soot from head to toe, dressed all in black, sitting

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,360
 in the or laying down in the dark, giving a thumbs up, his black sooted hand, middle

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,960
 to middle of the night with a dead rat in his mouth.

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,440
 I'm like, "What the hell is this?

93
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,640
 This must just be some sort of fake thing."

94
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,520
 Catman of Green Ock.

95
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
 Green Ock.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,040
 It's a place in Scotland.

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,200
 He's a real dude.

98
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 He is...

99
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,120
 Nobody really knows much about him, but this is what we know so far.

100
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,200
 So dating back to the 70s, people in this little village, I'm assuming it's a village because

101
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,600
 everything in Scotland is a village, but in this little sleepy fishing village, I don't

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,520
 even know if it's a fishing village, but okay, so just imagine somewhere in Scotland, whatever

103
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,160
 you imagine Scotland is stereotypically like.

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,680
 I imagine it is a fishing village.

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,720
 So back in the 70s, people started reporting this very large creature with bright glowing

106
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,520
 eyes scurrying about in the darkness.

107
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
 And at first people were terrified.

108
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
 They were like, "What the hell is that?

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
 Get your gun.

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
 Get your gun, mate."

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
 I don't know what they say over there, but anyway, so...

112
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,520
 And this creature would be found rummaging through trash cans.

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 He would never stand up.

114
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,440
 He always scooted along his belly.

115
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,000
 And it freaked a lot of people out, but what happened was people started to encounter him.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,320
 It wasn't just a far off sighting.

117
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,040
 They started to encounter him one on one, and that's when they realized it was a person,

118
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,280
 a person who never talks.

119
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,480
 They don't know anything about him.

120
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,880
 And the reports were if you walk around certain parts of Greenock at night, Greenock, whatever,

121
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,120
 we'll say Greenock, if you walk around certain parts of Greenock at night, there's a chance

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
 you're going to run into the cat man.

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
 And he's very harmless.

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,160
 He'll scare the crap out of you because he's a full grown man scurrying on his belly.

125
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
 And for whatever reason, his eyes glow.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,760
 That might be a little bit a part of the legend, but we'll get to that.

127
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,880
 And he eats rats and goes to the garbage cans and disappears into the underground sewer

128
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
 system.

129
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,800
 And so you have this weird thing where a lot of people just were like, it's a legend.

130
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,960
 This guy doesn't exist.

131
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,160
 This guy can't exist.

132
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,600
 That's impossible.

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,760
 And it's a lot like when we talked about Aki from England where unless you saw him, you

134
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,160
 thought he was an urban legend.

135
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,000
 And that's how the cat man was.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,640
 For the longest time, people would say, oh, I saw the cat man.

137
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
 I saw the cat man.

138
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,800
 He was eating a rat and people would be like, ah, whatever, Tommy drinking too much.

139
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,480
 But the legend would grow.

140
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,920
 And people went out looking for him.

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,120
 A couple of times like social workers went out looking for him because they're like,

142
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,040
 there really is a guy like scurrying around on his belly, eating rats.

143
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,840
 Like maybe we should help this guy.

144
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,880
 And they would, you know, like find him and say, oh, you know, do you need help?

145
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,280
 And he would kind of like scurry away and people would leave food.

146
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,080
 But again, people were like, this is you.

147
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
 I don't know.

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
 That was my Scottish impression.

149
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,880
 Ah, matey, you don't know.

150
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,880
 There's no such thing as the cat man is what the general population would say.

151
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,640
 And people would be like, no, I saw the cat man.

152
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 I swear to God, I saw him.

153
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,560
 And just like any legend, same thing with Bigfoot, people are like, no, no, I totally

154
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,000
 saw Bigfoot and everyone else is like, kick bricks.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,560
 There's no such thing as Bigfoot.

156
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,680
 In 2007, photos appeared for the very first time.

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,440
 So this guy's been in operation for close to what, 40 years at this point, because he

158
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,800
 started in the 70s.

159
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,440
 Photos appeared of a hobo and all covered in all black, wearing all black clothing, eating

160
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,040
 a rat.

161
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,000
 So this point, people were like, I, I told you, I told you, mate, that was the cat man

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 was real.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,720
 You owe me some logger.

164
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
 And then they got their logger.

165
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,440
 But so at this point, like social workers, they were like, okay, we really need to do

166
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
 something like this.

167
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,680
 And people in the community would look for him and like give him food.

168
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,800
 People were treating him really nice.

169
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,400
 And he was just kind of this local legend.

170
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,800
 So now you're thinking, oh, Jason, that's a sweet story, but you missed the biggest point.

171
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,040
 Who is this dude?

172
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,800
 And the fact is, we don't know.

173
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,200
 There's always like legends surrounding him because it doesn't say anything.

174
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,320
 Some people thought that he was a Russian sailor who got trapped in Scotland, which

175
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,040
 seems like an odd, you think he would just be like, oh, no, I'm trapped in Scotland.

176
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,080
 I better take a boat back.

177
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,840
 Like in the 1970s, I mean, you're just, you'd be like, okay, I'll get an airplane or a ferry

178
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
 back to the mainland.

179
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,040
 And some people think he was a Russian sailor who got lost on Scotland and for whatever

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,440
 reason decided to become a cat.

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
 So I'd become a cat man, as you do.

182
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:14,120
 Some people think this is more likely that he was a mental mental patient who got discharged

183
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,880
 and then was like, screw it, I'm just going to be a cat man.

184
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,440
 I didn't really like being in the hospital.

185
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,520
 I got discharged and social workers who came back to him who said, hey, do you want to

186
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
 come back to hospital?

187
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,120
 He's like, just scurries away.

188
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,400
 And then third option is that he was a normal bloke and then he got beat up by some kids

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,640
 and they broke his legs and that's why he can't move around.

190
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,120
 I think that one's also pretty ridiculous because I mean, even if your legs get broke,

191
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,360
 you can still talk and just because I've had broken legs before, I've never been like,

192
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
 you know what I want?

193
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
 I want a rat.

194
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 I want to eat a rat.

195
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,160
 It's most likely he has some sort of mental impairment.

196
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,040
 Now there's two more wrinkles to the story.

197
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,280
 So he went missing after about 2008, 2009, there were no sightings of him.

198
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,320
 And then in 2015, more sightings appeared.

199
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,360
 So people in that interim fear that he'd finally passed away because he's been doing

200
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
 this for 30 years.

201
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,960
 I'm sure like dogs are chasing him and stuff like he's getting cat scratch fever.

202
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,560
 And then other people are saying, no, the cat man never existed.

203
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
 The photos that were posted, someone paid a hobo to cover himself in soot and put rats

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
 in his mouth.

205
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,980
 Now, that's possible.

206
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,920
 You would have to pay me a lot to put rats in my mouth like cover me in soot.

207
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
 Yeah, sure.

208
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
 I can do that for free.

209
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,300
 But to walk around with rats, because there's several photos of them in different locations

210
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,360
 with this rat in his mouth.

211
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,080
 The timeline matches up, actually, because you would have an era where people didn't

212
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
 have cameras.

213
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,280
 People weren't walking around with cameras.

214
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,120
 They would just stumble across the cat man and be like, oh my God.

215
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,040
 And then they, and he would just kind of look at him and I don't know his.

216
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,320
 They'd be like, hey, do you want a burger?

217
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,520
 And then his cell phones became more prevalent and camera phones actually more specifically

218
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,080
 became more prevalent in the late 2000s.

219
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,880
 Then yeah, that would be when you would start seeing photos of this guy up here.

220
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,020
 So the cat man probably still exists and still alive and still doing cat stuff.

221
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,260
 I have a couple of questions about this though.

222
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,980
 One, you know, I've talked about local legends before, like when I grew up, we had Joe Trombone

223
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,540
 in our area and actually some guy sent me a clip of that.

224
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,540
 I'm going to have to find out who did that so I can credit him and I'll post a bit of

225
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,860
 the clip on the podcast because it's hilarious.

226
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,460
 But we had Joe Trombone in the rapping schizophrenic when I was a kid.

227
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,260
 And then you had Aki in England who was trying to fill everyone's muscles.

228
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
 You have this guy.

229
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,080
 I'm always obsessed by these little local legend type figures because every town has

230
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 one.

231
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,320
 Everyone, every town has these local legends.

232
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
 And I think it's even more interesting when they turn out to be true.

233
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,600
 These figures that you don't know exist unless you're in a particular area at a particular

234
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
 time.

235
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 It's very magical.

236
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,920
 It's a very magical part of a community where you have like the one just lunatic, not like

237
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,360
 I'm axing people to death lunatic, but just like a harmless lunatic guy like cat man.

238
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,540
 I guess Aki wasn't very harmless, but cat man.

239
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,660
 I love local legends.

240
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,140
 I love hearing about stuff like this.

241
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,260
 It's always fascinating to me when I just kind of stumble across stories like this.

242
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,900
 A dude pretended to be a cat for 40 years.

243
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
 It's mind boggling.

244
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,660
 Most people can't even show up to work every day.

245
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,300
 This guy did it consistently, ate rats and scurried along on his belly and was a cat

246
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,020
 every single day for 40 years.

247
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,560
 What is dedication?

248
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,880
 That might also be the definition of insanity, but he definitely like had a plan.

249
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,240
 He stuck to it.

250
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,040
 Cat man dead rabbit radio salutes you.

251
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,960
 Cat man at Greenock.

252
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
 A Scottish hero.

253
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,840
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

254
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,840
 So our next story, what we're going to talk about is I recently did the episode about

255
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,440
 what's the scariest movie of all time where I was postulating like is there a movie out

256
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:03,580
 there that's so terrifying that's never been released and what I thought would be like

257
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,900
 not necessarily qualifiers, but way to identify the movie.

258
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,540
 And on YouTube I got a lot of response on that video where people were talking about

259
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,900
 movies they particularly found scary either as a kid or as an adult or movies they found

260
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
 disturbing.

261
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,060
 It was a really cool conversation with you guys.

262
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,500
 One of the movies though, this was mentioned by Joe on YouTube.

263
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,640
 Joe said there's a movie out there called Return to Babylon.

264
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,080
 It instantly intrigued me and it was supposedly a haunted film.

265
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,660
 And so I started looking into the mythology of this very recent movie, very recent movie.

266
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,640
 Started looking into the mythology of this movie and this story is weird.

267
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,340
 So let's start from the beginning.

268
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,800
 So the director of Return to Babylon was Alex Monti Kanawati.

269
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,260
 He says the people in the film industry know him as Monti.

270
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,700
 So we'll call him Monti.

271
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,020
 Monti was driving down the road and he saw in Hollywood.

272
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:09,660
 So he saw on the side of the street a factory sealed box or bag, whatever, a factory sealed

273
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,980
 package of black and white film reels.

274
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,860
 And he's like oh my god this is amazing.

275
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,900
 Look at all this brand new black and white film reels.

276
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,460
 I've always wanted to shoot a black and white movie.

277
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,160
 And so he originally shot a short film called Rise of Babylon.

278
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,960
 And it is a silent film about the golden age of cinema.

279
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,360
 So in the silent film era.

280
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,760
 And it was moderately successful for being a short film.

281
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,160
 This was before the artist.

282
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,960
 This was before the big budget silent film, which looks stupid.

283
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,840
 Let me say this too.

284
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,060
 That era of time is like my least, I think all that, the music that came out of the like

285
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,580
 1920s, 1910, I think all the music super irritating.

286
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,100
 I don't like the movies.

287
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,540
 I don't like the culture.

288
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,100
 I just, that entire, that entire part of American culture I was not a fan of.

289
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
 Not a fan of the flappers.

290
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,860
 I did really enjoy The Great Gatsby.

291
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,460
 I thought that was a good book.

292
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,620
 But I mean like overall like when I was watching trailers for this movie.

293
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,960
 This is all, I'm like, oh my God, volume down.

294
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
 This is driving me nuts.

295
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,200
 I don't like jazz to begin with.

296
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,800
 I don't like brass instruments.

297
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,960
 And so you basically had an error where everything was like super loud, super brassy.

298
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,120
 The chicks were hot.

299
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,960
 Did enjoy that.

300
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,280
 And the mobsters, but the mobsters came a little bit later, I think.

301
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
 After the depression.

302
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,480
 So like pre depression stuff.

303
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
 So annoying.

304
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,820
 If I had to live through that, I'd be like, sign me up for World War One, please.

305
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
 One ticket.

306
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,180
 I will be a dough boy if I have to listen to...

307
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,580
 Oh my God.

308
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,900
 Annoying.

309
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,300
 That's what caused the Great Depression.

310
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,380
 They were all depressed because they had no good music.

311
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:04,180
 So anyways, he shot Rise of Babylon and it got moderately successful.

312
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,860
 And this was like I said before, The Artist, which was the big budget silent film.

313
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,140
 He went to then shoot Return to Babylon.

314
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,240
 And for that, I don't know if for Rise of Babylon, he did this, but definitely for

315
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,240
 Return to Babylon, he got a hand cranked camera.

316
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,480
 So it was like you had to turn it to use it.

317
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,200
 And he shot Return to Babylon and that was a bigger budget and it had a bunch of stars

318
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
 in it.

319
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,760
 Jennifer Tilley was the only one I remember off the top of my head.

320
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,960
 Think like Maria Conchita Alonzo was in it, but I don't know, I couldn't be wrong with

321
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
 that.

322
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
 But anyways, Jennifer Tilley was in it.

323
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,880
 She was in all the Chris and Chuckie movies.

324
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,300
 She was the Variety of Chuckie and the Mother of the Seed of Chuckie.

325
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,620
 But anyway, and she's done some actually other much better movies than that, but that's what

326
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,740
 I know her from.

327
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,580
 So he got this cast and they shot this movie.

328
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,580
 And when they started, this was in 2013, it was when Return of Babylon was finished and

329
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,740
 that movie was about the fall of Hollywood.

330
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,660
 So you're looking at all of these scandals that brought down Hollywood.

331
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,820
 Faddy R. Buckel being one of the big ones over there.

332
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,440
 Faddy R. Buckel was this dude like this, basically he was the, who's the fat guy from Saturday

333
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,160
 Life, Chris Farley.

334
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,600
 If you took basically the comedy of Chris Farley and the star power of Brad Pitt, that

335
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
 was Faddy R. Buckel.

336
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,560
 He was the super famous actor and he was this big fat comedian and he raped a girl and the

337
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,520
 rumor was was that he crushed her to death while he was raping her and she died.

338
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,040
 And he was on trial for murder and he didn't get found guilty, but it completely ruined

339
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
 his career.

340
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,820
 It was just like this huge scandal.

341
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,200
 So that kind of plays into it, just like the fall of the, it's the movie takes place when

342
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,400
 silent, when talkies were appearing and the silent film era was disappearing and all that

343
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,180
 stuff.

344
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,380
 When he was editing the movie, he started noticing.

345
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,920
 So this is the story, this is the story that I saw on all the websites.

346
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
 So you kind of know where this is going.

347
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,700
 This is the story as I was researching it.

348
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
 And again, thanks Joe for bringing this movie to my attention.

349
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,320
 It was a wonderful journey researching all this.

350
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,560
 So I'm looking at all these websites and they're saying that as Monty began editing the film,

351
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,840
 he started noticing there was distortions in the picture.

352
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
 Sometimes the faces would appear like tortured, like someone would turn their face and you

353
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,020
 would see like this tortured, like ghoulish look on their face.

354
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,200
 Sometimes their hands would grow really big.

355
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,480
 Like they'd be pointing at something, but their fingers would be like four feet long.

356
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,800
 Sometimes you'd see ghostly images move in the background.

357
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,000
 I'm like, holy, this is terrifying.

358
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,640
 And I was like, maybe this does kind of fit in what I was thinking like a scary movie,

359
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,680
 oh slash a cursed film.

360
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,920
 And they show all these stills and you just see kind of these haunting images of people

361
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,840
 being like, and people with their long fingers and there's this creepy guy with no shirt on

362
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,360
 with his really long nose and he just looks like a beast walking by.

363
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,760
 So I keep looking at these articles and they're like, they brought out these film experts,

364
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,600
 the photography experts to look at the film and they're like, that shouldn't happen.

365
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,920
 Even if you use a hand cranked camera with black and white film, you shouldn't be getting

366
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,880
 these distortions.

367
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,920
 Someone might have done something in post, but it doesn't appear that it's been altered.

368
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,280
 And he was like, you know, no, I didn't do add any special effects to this.

369
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,520
 The budget was really low.

370
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,200
 They didn't have money to do special effects.

371
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,560
 Some people thought it was because you took 16 millimeter black and white film and then

372
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,720
 you bumped it up frames per second.

373
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,760
 So it, you know, might distort the read speed of the film and all this stuff.

374
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,560
 And the film was never released.

375
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,200
 And I'm like, well, that is kind of creepy.

376
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,120
 And you're looking at all these images and they keep having this like on these articles

377
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
 that have little like a YouTube video of the director.

378
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,880
 And I was like, I'll watch that later.

379
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
 I'll watch that later.

380
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,600
 Let me keep reading these articles because I'm on like, I'm, you know, I'm on the story.

381
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
 I'm a bloodhound.

382
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
 So I'm reading this.

383
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,560
 I wish I'd watched that video earlier, obviously.

384
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,640
 But so he's like, the articles are saying like this film is cursed, possibly cursed.

385
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,560
 It could be a hoax, but it looks like it's cursed.

386
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,880
 And I read article after article that kind of told that line.

387
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,040
 And then I was like, oh, man, that's super creepy.

388
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
 So then I looked it up.

389
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,040
 The movie is actually having a showing for the first time this year, a public showing

390
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,680
 in 2018, according to the website, return to Babylon.com.

391
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
 So it's still an active project.

392
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,280
 It's not like it's a dead film and it's disappeared.

393
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,760
 They're planning this year to do a showing in Hollywood.

394
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,080
 And I'm like, okay, that's creepy.

395
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,920
 Then I started thinking like, dude, what if they showed that movie in like a theater

396
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,720
 and everyone's like, everyone gets possessed or something like that?

397
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,080
 Like what if it's finally been released?

398
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,240
 So anyways, after that daydream and all of the research I did, I finally decided to

399
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,560
 watch the, the little director commentary thing.

400
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,360
 He's talking about the movie.

401
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,120
 So none of what he said was reported in any of the articles.

402
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,720
 None of what the article said was anywhere in that video.

403
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,960
 I don't know, at this point, I don't really know how much of that video I played, probably

404
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,280
 just a couple of minutes.

405
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,320
 Even if I cut it off halfway through the links in my, my show notes, there's a couple things

406
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
 going on.

407
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,600
 He talks constantly about, look it, you can see the Christ imagery.

408
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,520
 You see how it's making Christ imagery.

409
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,760
 Let me tell you what he's talking about.

410
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,200
 It's a woman with long hair turning quickly.

411
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,440
 So her hair looks like a beard.

412
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
 What?

413
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,880
 What happens in every, that happens in everyday life.

414
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,400
 When I was watching that video, I'm kind of, I put it in and I'm, I was probably doing

415
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
 something else I think and I was kind of barely paying attention.

416
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,400
 Then he goes, I lost my family and I lost someone.

417
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,680
 They stole my identity.

418
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,440
 And I remember kind of refocusing back on the video and thinking, like this has nothing

419
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,080
 to do with ghosts or haunt, a haunted video or cursed film reels, which is what other,

420
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,600
 like who left these black and white film canisters on the side of the road?

421
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,520
 Was it to get rid of this curse video?

422
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,240
 And he's like, I lost my family over this.

423
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,720
 And now I'm, I don't know if he was running around with his family being like, look, look,

424
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
 here's Christ imagery.

425
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,400
 And it's just a picture of a girl with long hair turning slightly to the left and making

426
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,880
 it look like she has a beard.

427
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,520
 So hope's dashed.

428
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,160
 Here I thought I had a real example and it's not Joe's fault.

429
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
 Joe again, thanks for sending me the clip.

430
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,480
 I mean, thanks for putting me on the story.

431
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
 I was totally into it.

432
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,080
 I was like, oh, and people on the set of the movie were like, oh, ghosts are pushing us,

433
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
 ghosts are pushing us.

434
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,600
 At this point, I don't believe any of it.

435
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,720
 I think what happened was Monty saw all this, he was sniffing a lot and he ended up seeing

436
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
 all this Christ imagery.

437
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,280
 Let's put this stuff together.

438
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
 This is what I think happened.

439
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,200
 I think Monty, and what's weird, none of the articles call him Monty, even though he calls

440
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
 himself Monty.

441
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,560
 Again, it's kind of weird.

442
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,760
 I think it's a publicity scam.

443
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,080
 I think he really did see a bunch of Christ imagery in his movie.

444
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,160
 But I think after that, and which isn't there, obviously, it's just a glitch, but then after

445
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,360
 that it became demonic spooky happenings on the set and everything's like that because

446
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,040
 most people who are showing the clip, the pictures I was seeing before was of like a

447
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,160
 ghost man walking through the woods or like these demonic figures.

448
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,000
 If the photo, and that made me interested on keep clicking on it and doing more and looking

449
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,920
 into the story and seeing if I could get a copy of the movie and all this stuff.

450
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,880
 If all the websites were, "Watch this woman turn into a man as she turns slightly to the

451
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,280
 left," then I wouldn't have clicked on it.

452
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,160
 The website wouldn't have run the article.

453
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
 Nothing.

454
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,680
 He probably does believe there's some sort of mystical importance to this movie.

455
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,600
 There isn't.

456
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
 And the story's just been overblown.

457
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,940
 So it's been busted.

458
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,360
 That really sucked.

459
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,880
 I was really looking for, I was like, "Dude, if this movie actually exists and it actually

460
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,280
 has these creepy images in it, I will buy a copy of it and just to check it out."

461
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,440
 So you almost had me fooled.

462
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,240
 If the movie had already come out, you probably would have had me fooled.

463
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,240
 I probably would have paid money to get a copy of it or rent it or however I could have

464
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,520
 gotten access to it legally.

465
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,000
 But yeah, return to Babylon.

466
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 That's me giving it a big raspberry.

467
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I'm sure the movie may be well made and I hope everyone who made it has fun and I hope

468
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,400
 this guy finds the help that he needs, obviously.

469
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
 That busted myth.

470
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
 We're still on the lookout for a creepy cursed movie.

471
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 It'll pop up someday.

472
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,280
 I believe that it exists out there, but we'll just have to keep looking.

473
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,440
 But again, thanks for the suggestion, Joe.

474
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
 So there we go.

475
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,580
 We got one myth confirmed with the Catman.

476
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,360
 We got photographic evidence of a Catman.

477
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,240
 And then we got one myth busted with return to Babylon.

478
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,480
 I think that was a fair balance.

479
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,600
 I really was like, when I was putting the episode together, I go, "I think that I don't want

480
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,240
 to have two Downer stories.

481
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,440
 Originally, I was going to cover the Battle of Los Angeles.

482
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,840
 We're going to save that for tomorrow."

483
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 But I thought it was a good to have a balance of one that was actually confirmed and one

484
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,400
 that was disappointingly not true.

485
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,360
 Sounded interesting, but didn't pass the weight test.

486
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,680
 When she started to put a little bit of pressure on a story sometimes, it completely collapses

487
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,840
 and with Monty, he did that himself.

488
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,280
 If he didn't release that little YouTube video, I would have ran the story as this movie's

489
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
 possibly haunted.

490
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,560
 We should all go out and watch it when it comes out.

491
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,320
 But he released this super weird YouTube video where he's like, "Look, it's Jesus.

492
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
 No, it's not.

493
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
 Yes, it is.

494
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
 No, it's not.

495
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
