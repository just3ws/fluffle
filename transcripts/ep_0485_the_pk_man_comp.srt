1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
 "If you are hearing this broadcast, seek shelter immediately."

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,340
 Do YOU have paranormal powers?

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,840
 If you do, I get $5,000.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
 And you like that contest?

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,520
 Then we take a look at the story of a man who claimed he had paranormal powers.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,700
 Nobody really took him seriously until football teams began disastrously losing games today

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,000
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,800
 [music]

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,640
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,080
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,200
 So we're gonna get started right away.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,880
 You remember the old episodes, like the first like 100 episodes?

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,080
 I was like, "My day was great."

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,720
 And I'd spend like four or five minutes talking about just random stuff.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,000
 Not anymore.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,960
 I put that stuff in the middle of the episode now to trick you.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,560
 First off, is that what you're already engaged in the story?

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,400
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter,

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
 Mokushi!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
 Mokushi, thank you very much for supporting the show.

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,800
 You are gonna be our captain, our pilot, our gunner, maybe?

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,040
 If we have like a gun in this one? We don't.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,720
 And then, if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,280
 Just help get the word out about the show.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,800
 Really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,760
 Still sending out supporters, stickers for Patreon supporters.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,360
 And we have merch in the merch store.

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
 That's all in the show notes below.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
 Like I keep hitting home.

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
 I'm gonna be going on vacation soon.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,760
 That means more video game time for me.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,120
 Didn't you just say you don't spend time talking about random stuff?

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,440
 Mokushi, let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy.

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,640
 We're going for a drive.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,920
 We're going down to Hollywood.

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,160
 Mokushi, we're driving through streets of LA.

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,760
 We got our sunglasses on.

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,800
 I got a big hat.

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
 That's it. No other clothes.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,360
 We're driving through LA.

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,520
 We're going to a place.

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,760
 We're not just down there to sightsee.

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,960
 We're going to the Center for Inquiry Investigations Group.

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,320
 These guys have made it their mission to prove the unprovable

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,240
 or unprove the impossible.

48
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,920
 However you want to put it, they're a group of skeptics.

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,280
 They consider themselves the largest

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,040
 paranormal investigation group in the world.

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,000
 Because they do investigate the paranormal,

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,120
 but they investigate the fun out of it.

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,440
 So, I mean, and I do the same thing for the most part,

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,560
 but I also believe in like ghosts and aliens and all that stuff.

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,320
 There's just certain narratives that I'm like,

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,000
 "Eh."

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And even ghost stories, a lot of times I'll shred

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
 into pieces so they don't think they work.

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,880
 But I enjoy the realm of the unknown.

60
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,560
 And these guys might too, but these guys actually

61
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,040
 go the extra effort to basically bring weirdos

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,800
 to their location and come up with impossible tests

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
 that really nobody can pass.

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,680
 So we pull up outside the Center for Inquiry

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,080
 and I get out and Mokushi's like,

66
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,280
 "So why are we here though?

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
 Like are we here to debunk stuff or are we here

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,320
 to prove like the world's supernatural

69
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,400
 'cause you believe that and I go, "Mokushi,

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,640
 you first off, you drive.

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,480
 Don't talk, just sit there and don't talk."

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,320
 That's my job.

73
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
 I don't know how you got on my podcast.

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 Secondly, the SIG is what they're known as,

75
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,040
 the Center for Inquiry Investigations Group.

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,040
 They have a cash prize of $250,000.

77
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,520
 And $50,000.

78
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 You like, "I'll pause there."

79
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
 You're like, "$200 bucks, that's exactly my rent.

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,920
 $250, I can also buy an ice cream cone.

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
 $250,000, this is an expensive ice cream cone.

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,840
 $250,000, if you can prove to them,

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,360
 you can exhibit some sort of paranormal power."

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,880
 Now it used to just be $100,000, but no one can do it.

85
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
 So they raised the price.

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,760
 Now, last episode I talked about me being an empath

87
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
 and I said, "I don't know if I could do it on command."

88
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,400
 And it's funny 'cause when I said that caveat,

89
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,320
 I was specifically thinking about this story

90
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,440
 that I was going to do for this episode.

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,740
 If I went to the SIG, which actually we're here right now,

92
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,120
 let's test this hypothetical.

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,760
 We walk inside and there's a bunch of nerds

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,560
 and around they got the poster's episode.

95
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,580
 No fun.

96
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,680
 And then there's a ghostbuster poster

97
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,960
 with the X through the ghost

98
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,760
 and then there's a bigger X through the poster.

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,240
 And it's go, "You can't even have ghostbusters.

100
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,760
 Boo, all paranormal stuff."

101
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,400
 We're like, "Let me crack my knuckles.

102
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,960
 Okay, let me use some of my paranormal power."

103
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,360
 And I can walk into this room and I'm an empath

104
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,440
 and I go looking around and I point at dude

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,960
 and I go, "Your marriage is in trouble."

106
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,440
 I can tell right now your marriage is in trouble.

107
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,320
 And he goes, "No, it's not."

108
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,200
 And then I go, "It will be when your wife sees me."

109
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,360
 Whoa, Mimogushi high five.

110
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,640
 Woo, no, no one's giving me high five.

111
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,080
 I'm just standing in this room by by myself.

112
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,960
 Okay, so here's the thing.

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,760
 If you, I might be able to go into a room.

114
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,160
 I don't think I could go in a room and dry read people

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,360
 or cold read people, I think is the word.

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 I couldn't do that.

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,920
 But if I said, "You take me to a house

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
 where some horrible event has happened,

119
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,560
 I could probably more than likely, more than 50/50 chance,

120
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,200
 I could probably at least tell you something's gone wrong."

121
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,240
 But there's a bit of a, again, there's a gimmick to that.

122
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,320
 First off, if the house you take me to

123
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,880
 is all run down with like wallpaper peeling,

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,240
 I'm like, "Something bad has gone on here.

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,800
 It's called water damage."

126
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,240
 If you took me to a really, really nice house,

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
 I would go, "Hmm, they're trying to trick me.

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,640
 Nothing bad ever happens in a mansion.

129
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
 Rich people never do anything wrong.

130
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,960
 That's what I would think, right?

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,880
 Because I'm an idiot.

132
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,640
 But since I'm not an idiot,

133
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
 since I can out thank these people,

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
 they're taking me to a nice house,

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,360
 assuming that I would think that it was too nice

136
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
 for something evil to happen.

137
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,120
 So I'm gonna say something evil happened.

138
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,720
 So I just walking and saying something evil happened everywhere.

139
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
 You couldn't really test that, right?

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,800
 I couldn't have, 'cause they do actual real tests and stuff.

141
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,080
 They go over their stuff, how they test the stuff.

142
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,400
 You would have to literally do a double blind steady

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,800
 where you take an intern.

144
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,920
 You take two interns into two different rooms,

145
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,280
 violently beat one and not let me see the victim.

146
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,080
 And then the other one, you play a game of Chinese checkers.

147
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,240
 And then I would have to go into the room and go,

148
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,600
 "Hmm, this room's covered in blood.

149
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
 It must be the violent assault one."

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,680
 It would be really hard to test this theory.

151
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,080
 And again, I don't necessarily think

152
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,360
 it's something supernatural.

153
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
 I think it's something everyone has.

154
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,840
 Just some people, all 100% say it's not supernatural.

155
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,240
 I think it's something that everyone has.

156
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,280
 Just like some people can run marathons

157
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,560
 and some people can merely walk.

158
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,120
 I think I can run a half marathon with my ability.

159
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,080
 I don't think I'm super good at being an empath.

160
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,160
 But everyone can do it.

161
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,120
 Just some people have trained themselves more.

162
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,880
 But anyways, I don't think you would even buy that.

163
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,440
 But this group, you know there's something coming here.

164
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,880
 This group, they're offering $250,000

165
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,840
 if you can prove that you have paranormal abilities.

166
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,280
 There's gonna be all the links in the show notes.

167
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
 You can actually fill it out yourself.

168
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,920
 If you go and prove you have paranormal activities,

169
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,120
 I get a finder's fee.

170
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,440
 I get 5,000 bucks.

171
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,920
 So I encourage everyone who actually has paranormal abilities.

172
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,280
 Don't troll them, right?

173
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,440
 We talked about that last episode.

174
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
 Don't troll them.

175
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,800
 But if you do have a authentic,

176
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,720
 if one of my listeners happens to actually be

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,680
 one of the new gods,

178
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,400
 feel free to put me down on the recommended,

179
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,760
 you recommend Dead Rabbit Radio,

180
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,000
 recommended you let me get some of that money,

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,900
 that 5,000 bucks.

182
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,680
 You still get the full $250,000, but it's not easy.

183
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
 It's not easy.

184
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,840
 What they do is they have two sets of tests.

185
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
 They have an informal test,

186
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,520
 which is still incredibly rigorous.

187
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,200
 And then they have a formal test

188
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,220
 under strict scientific conditions.

189
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,060
 So I was looking through them.

190
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,820
 I might look through more of them,

191
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,540
 but the ones I looked through were already pretty intriguing.

192
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,560
 They had one guy, he said,

193
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,280
 that he could tell what was in a box.

194
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,200
 He was like a remote viewer.

195
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,140
 And it takes months from the time you make the claim

196
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,920
 to the time they can get you out to LA,

197
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,800
 or sometimes they'll do it on Zoom.

198
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,680
 If they really have to,

199
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,160
 this one guy was in like Moldova.

200
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,280
 They're like, "Oh, well, we know this is fake.

201
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,120
 "We're not gonna fly him out, right?"

202
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,760
 But anyways, they said they did it on webcam

203
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
 and he couldn't do it.

204
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,500
 But this guy said he could take an envelope.

205
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,980
 He could look at it, tell you what the picture was

206
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,820
 in the envelope.

207
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,900
 And I mean, again, for the informal test,

208
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
 they had double blind,

209
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,860
 like they had one guy stuff the envelopes

210
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,900
 in a totally secure room.

211
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,660
 Once all four envelopes were stuffed,

212
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,060
 he slid them under a door.

213
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
 So the person administering the test

214
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,420
 doesn't even know what's in the envelope.

215
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,620
 So they look a sh,

216
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,220
 that's the thing when I do tarot readings,

217
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,780
 which I haven't done in a long time.

218
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,660
 I'd look at your face or your body language.

219
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,780
 And when I would say something,

220
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,700
 if you reacted however slight,

221
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,920
 I would know I was on the right track.

222
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,240
 If he didn't react,

223
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,480
 I would say something else.

224
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,920
 I'd be like, "So you're having issues with your dad?"

225
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,120
 No, your brother.

226
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
 (gasps)

227
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
 Yeah.

228
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,240
 As I've seen your brother stand behind you

229
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,520
 with an ax mid swing,

230
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,920
 I'm like, "Look out!

231
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
 "Should've come here an hour earlier

232
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,720
 "before your brother picked up that ax from Home Depot."

233
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
 That's how you do it, right?

234
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
 So you have to have the double blind steady

235
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,560
 because if the guy started getting them right wrong,

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
 the tester could be like smirk and being like,

237
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
 "Good thing we didn't play this too, not from Moldova."

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,980
 So that's just the informal test.

239
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,060
 That's just the informal test where they do this stuff.

240
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,260
 Now, and no one's been able to pass it so far,

241
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,660
 that's why they raised it up to $250,000.

242
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,820
 But let's take a look at,

243
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,140
 I'm gonna go into detail with this one test they did

244
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,420
 'cause it leads us into our next story.

245
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,740
 And it's actually really recent.

246
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,060
 They're still doing this.

247
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,140
 They said about six to 10 people come out a year

248
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,580
 to test this, to be tested.

249
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,540
 And to this day, nobody's ever been successfully.

250
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,060
 I wonder if anyone's moved on to the formal stage.

251
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,620
 I'm gonna do some more research on this,

252
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,920
 but 'cause there's a ton of these studies

253
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
 and it was interesting.

254
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,920
 You feel free to look through them yourself.

255
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
 June 25th, 2020, so very, very recently,

256
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,040
 this man had been contacting back and forth.

257
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,880
 He goes by the initials TR.

258
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,200
 I don't know if that was actually a designation they gave him,

259
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,960
 but we'll just call him Tom for short,

260
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,120
 which is actually longer than TR, but you understand.

261
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,480
 Tom, less syllables,

262
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
 Tom had been contacting this group

263
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,220
 and saying that he had the ability to

264
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,340
 (imitates static)

265
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,220
 make static electricity come out of his hands.

266
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,300
 That's all he did was the sound effect over the phone

267
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,780
 and they're like, "Oh, he's in.

268
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,340
 "Here's $250,000."

269
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,780
 He can make static electricity shoot out of his hands.

270
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,080
 He could create lightning in the sky.

271
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,840
 And he could teleport three feet.

272
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,220
 Why only three feet?

273
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,980
 What does that have to do with lightning?

274
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,820
 I don't know.

275
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,980
 Generally superheroes have a,

276
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,220
 well, it's not like he's a superhero.

277
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,280
 He's no Phoenix Jones,

278
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,080
 but it's not like he's actually saying he's a mutant,

279
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
 but he has the ability to shoot lightning

280
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
 out of his fingertips

281
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,640
 and call down lightning and teleport three feet.

282
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,720
 So he comes out to LA and they have photographs

283
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
 and they have video.

284
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,320
 I really wish I could have seen the video for this,

285
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
 but I couldn't find it,

286
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,960
 but I did look at these photographs.

287
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,920
 So they, the first test,

288
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,760
 out of those three, what are you gonna test first, right?

289
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,840
 Okay, he can shoot static electricity out of his hands,

290
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,840
 which is basically any four-year-old with socks on.

291
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,960
 He can rain down lightning from the sky

292
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,500
 or maybe just make it go from cloud to cloud.

293
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,640
 And then he can teleport.

294
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,700
 Which one of those do you wanna test the first, right?

295
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,620
 The teleport one, right?

296
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,940
 There's 100%.

297
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,060
 That's the one that is, if he teleported,

298
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,900
 you wouldn't be like,

299
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,380
 "Well, you couldn't call down lightning,

300
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,260
 so no money for you."

301
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,620
 Like that's the deal, right?

302
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,660
 If someone shocked you,

303
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,540
 it'd be like, "Ah, give me $250,000."

304
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,060
 No, but if someone teleported,

305
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,500
 but then they're like, "Here, make it rain."

306
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,920
 He's like, "I lied about that one,

307
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,880
 I can only teleport."

308
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,160
 So that was the first one they test.

309
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,480
 So we have this thing.

310
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,760
 They set up these chairs in about like a 12-foot row

311
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,960
 and covered it with a blue tarp to create a barrier.

312
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,120
 And they wanted him to teleport somewhere in this location.

313
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,120
 It's so funny to see a bunch of adults

314
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,320
 out in the middle of LA.

315
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,360
 They're all geared up for the coronavirus.

316
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
 They all have masks on.

317
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,360
 But a bunch of adults,

318
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,160
 a bunch of adults have shown up

319
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,080
 because another adult told them he could teleport.

320
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,860
 And they're documenting all this stuff, right?

321
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,020
 It's just hilarious.

322
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,340
 So anyways, this guy shows up

323
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,380
 and he goes, "I can teleport."

324
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,020
 And they go, "Okay, here's his barrier."

325
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,660
 Now he's set, 'cause they've been talking for months.

326
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,140
 He goes, "I told you guys I can't teleport through stuff.

327
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,820
 So I can't appear on one side of this barrier,

328
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,580
 but I can teleport around it.

329
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,260
 Like I can go from one end and teleport to the end."

330
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
 At this point, the people were probably like,

331
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,480
 "Just do it!

332
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,020
 Just teleport.

333
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,220
 I don't care if you're teleporting two feet in the air

334
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,180
 and you call it a jump.

335
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,900
 Like I just wanna see movement."

336
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,880
 So we get this, this from this report they wrote.

337
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,220
 "Upon being introduced to the TARP barrier,

338
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,140
 TR," or Tom is recalling them,

339
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,340
 "Tom said that he can't go through things

340
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,920
 and reminded us that he must be moving to teleport.

341
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,620
 He soon after showed us what he meant

342
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,400
 and walked around the barrier

343
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
 in a sort of herky-jerky motion.

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,680
 He asked if we saw the teleportation

345
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,840
 and we replied that we did not.

346
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,260
 We only saw someone walking.

347
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,760
 We offered to show him the just shot video of him

348
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
 and he declined to view it."

349
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,760
 So apparently, I just imagined him kind of like walking

350
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
 like Samara from the ring,

351
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,760
 but even more creepy because you're there in person, right?

352
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
 He walks and then he goes, "Do you see it?

353
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
 Do you see I teleported?

354
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,260
 I have to move to teleport.

355
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
 I moved from one location to another

356
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,760
 and they're like, "No, we didn't see it."

357
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
 Did you really teleport?

358
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
 Yeah!

359
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
 Do you wanna watch the video?

360
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
 I'm not sure.

361
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
 I don't know.

362
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 Yeah!

363
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
 Do you wanna watch the video?

364
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
 No, I'm good.

365
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,260
 This is weird, right?

366
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,260
 And then, that's like the definition of weird.

367
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,760
 A bunch of adults out in a parking lot

368
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
 trying to prove whether or not one of them can teleport.

369
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,260
 I don't know what he thought.

370
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,760
 Like when he moved, did he think?

371
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,260
 He was obviously walking, right?

372
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,760
 He obviously knew he was moving.

373
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,260
 He obviously knew he had some sort of motion in his body.

374
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
 So why he thought other--

375
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,760
 Did he honestly think he teleported?

376
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
 Did he think he could fool them?

377
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
 But who know?

378
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
 I don't know.

379
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
 Anyways, they move on to the next test,

380
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,760
 which, like at that point,

381
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
 now they're like, "Oh, at least we don't--

382
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,260
 we can put away this giant $250,000 check."

383
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
 He goes, "I'm gonna call Lightning down from the sky."

384
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,760
 Now they actually scheduled this meeting.

385
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
 They had to watch weather reports

386
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,260
 to make sure there's gonna be no storms.

387
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,760
 I mean, these guys are pretty thorough.

388
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,260
 He's like, "I'm gonna call down Lightning now,

389
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,760
 but I gotta put in my music."

390
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,260
 So he puts in his earbuds

391
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,760
 and he raises his hands to the sky

392
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
 and he's listening to music

393
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
 and he closes his eyes.

394
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,760
 And there's a photo of a dude just staring up

395
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,260
 at the sky looking for Lightning.

396
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,760
 It's like--

397
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
 It's like noon.

398
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
 It's the sunniest LA day.

399
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,260
 There's just a photograph of one of the researchers

400
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,760
 looking up in the sky.

401
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,260
 And there's no Lightning.

402
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
 There's no Lightning.

403
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,760
 Now that obviously--

404
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,260
 You could chalk that up to chance.

405
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,760
 It could be weird.

406
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
 Would be really weird.

407
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
 And then at the end of it,

408
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,260
 at the end of that, he said,

409
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,260
 "He saw electricity shooting out of his hands,

410
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,760
 but nobody else did."

411
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
 And they checked the camera just to be careful,

412
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,260
 just to make sure it wasn't moving at the speed of light.

413
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,260
 The camera didn't pick up any electricity either.

414
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,260
 As entertaining as I found this whole segment,

415
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,760
 there was one thing that I thought

416
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,260
 probably could have gone with that.

417
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,760
 At the end, this guy obviously

418
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,260
 doesn't have any superpowers

419
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
 and believes that he does.

420
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
 At the end of this research report,

421
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,260
 they make kind of a comment about him being in rehab

422
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,760
 and they ask him why he's in rehab

423
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
 and he says he's in rehab for cocaine.

424
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,260
 They ask him, "Is he taking any schizophrenia medication?"

425
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,760
 And he says, "No."

426
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
 That was--

427
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,760
 I personally felt that was uncalled for.

428
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
 Like maybe--

429
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,760
 And then I go, "Did they mention that earlier in the report?"

430
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
 And I did a word search for--

431
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,260
 If they had said at the beginning,

432
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,760
 he just came here from rehab.

433
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
 He's out for an hour to test his powers.

434
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,260
 Then that would be a fine way to conclude it.

435
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
 But as a researcher,

436
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
 or as someone who's just reading the article,

437
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
 I get it, his powers don't work.

438
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,260
 You didn't really have to go,

439
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,260
 "Oh, he's in rehab too for cocaine addiction."

440
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,760
 Like, I think it's--

441
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,260
 That might be--

442
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
 That obviously might be

443
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
 causing some of these issues with him.

444
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,760
 But it just felt to me like they were kind of kicking him

445
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
 when he was down.

446
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
 On yesterday's episode, I talked about being

447
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
 how I could be way trodlier than I actually am

448
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,760
 and how we should strive to just be nicer to people

449
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
 on kind of an existential level.

450
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,260
 And this kind of thing is what I'm talking about, right?

451
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,760
 Like, you're kicking him--

452
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,260
 He obviously doesn't have superpowers.

453
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
 He obviously proved that this guy

454
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,260
 has some issue you don't have to add at the ending.

455
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
 "Oh, yeah, and he's just out of rehab."

456
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,760
 "Coco, Coco!"

457
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
 Yeah, I was having a good laugh.

458
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 I mean, actually, even though

459
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,260
 we should be nicer to each other,

460
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
 I was having a good laugh at this dude.

461
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,760
 But there's a point, right, guys?

462
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
 There's a point.

463
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,760
 Like, I think it's okay to say this is story's fake.

464
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
 Can I do that all the time?

465
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
 This story's fake and that, and that, and that, and that.

466
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
 That was a long way of saying,

467
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
 "Give me some of that sweet, sweet $5,000."

468
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,760
 If you go and do this test and pass,

469
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
 you'd make a $5,000 donation of a pay--

470
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,760
 No, no, no, you don't have to donate enough, then they'll pay me.

471
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
 They'll pay me.

472
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
 And I wanted to use this story as a springboard

473
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,760
 because this other story had been sitting on for a while, actually.

474
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,260
 "Mokushi, let's hop in the carbonar copter.

475
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
 We're saying goodbye to the skeptics.

476
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
 Lightning storms come in."

477
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,260
 He's like, "Pfft, we see the dude's eyes start glowing."

478
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
 "Get out of here!"

479
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,260
 The skeptic scientists are hanging on to the landing gear.

480
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
 We're kicking him off.

481
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
 "You deserve your fate!"

482
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
 "No!"

483
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
 And before he hits the ground, the lightning strikes him.

484
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,260
 [Lightning strikes]

485
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,260
 Half of L.A.'s getting destroyed.

486
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,760
 As the helicopter is leaving this destructive scene,

487
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
 Tom has been unleashed.

488
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
 That's actually not far from the story I'm about to tell you.

489
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
 "Mokushi, let's hightail it out.

490
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
 We're headed to Florida."

491
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
 [Lightning strikes]

492
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,260
 We look back to the city of L.A.'s a massive crater.

493
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,760
 Have you seen the trailer for that new movie, "Grainland"?

494
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
 Starring...

495
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
 Leonidas and the Phantom?

496
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
 What's his name?

497
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
 Chris O'Dowd?

498
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
 Craig Robinson?

499
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,260
 What's that dude's name?

500
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260
 He's the dude.

501
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
 Gerard Butler.

502
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
 Gerard Butler.

503
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,260
 He's the dude.

504
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
 The movie looks great.

505
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
 I'm going to put that in the show notes.

506
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
 That looks amazing.

507
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
 I love movies like that.

508
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
 "Grainland."

509
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,260
 Did a rapper recommend watching the trailer for "Grainland"?

510
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
 We're headed out to Florida.

511
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,260
 It's 1979.

512
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,260
 And Florida is suffering a horrible drought.

513
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,260
 Now, there is a newspaper known as the National Enquirer.

514
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,760
 Now, newspaper is probably...

515
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,760
 National Enquirer is interesting because it's actually a tabloid newspaper.

516
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,760
 But it tells the truth more often than the Weekly World News.

517
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,760
 The National Enquirer is more on a level of like the sun,

518
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,760
 where it's a nationally recognized paper that does break stories.

519
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
 But they're super sensationalists.

520
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,760
 They will make up stuff and they've been sued in the past.

521
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760
 Weekly World News is a 100% fictional newspaper.

522
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,260
 National Enquirer has covered stuff like Roswell before Roswell was a big story.

523
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,260
 They've covered a lot of French stuff.

524
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,760
 We've talked about National Enquirer a couple times on...

525
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
 I don't use them as a main source, obviously,

526
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,260
 but they are a less reputable newspaper than every other newspaper,

527
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,760
 but more reputable than, say, the Weekly World News.

528
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
 But you have real people working for these things,

529
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
 and they're always looking for some sensational story.

530
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
 In 1979, Florida's hit with a drought.

531
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,260
 National Enquirer, the publishing headquarters, is in Florida.

532
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,260
 And you had an editor named Wayne Grover,

533
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,760
 who knew of a man who could control the weather.

534
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,260
 So he calls up, can't really call him a friend,

535
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,760
 an acquaintance, an ally, someone you'd want on your sign,

536
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,260
 calls up Ted Owens and says, "Hey, Ted, yeah, yeah, it's Wayne.

537
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,760
 Hey, can you do something about this drought?"

538
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,760
 Kind of looking at his buddies all, "Yeah, yeah, in the office, yeah, I'm talking to Ted, yeah, yeah."

539
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
 "Yeah, yeah, this drought in Florida, man, it's so hot, can you take care of it?"

540
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,260
 "Yeah, yeah, okay, okay, cool, cool."

541
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
 Hangs up, he gives a thumb up to him.

542
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
 "Yeah, let's see what Ted can do this time."

543
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
 "Yeah, he says he can control the weather."

544
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
 Ten days later, massive storm hits Florida.

545
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,260
 Now, you're going, Jason, storms always hit Florida.

546
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,760
 But Wayne had a reason to call Ted.

547
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
 Let's go back to February 10th, 1920.

548
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,260
 That's when Ted Owens was born.

549
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,760
 He claimed that both of his grandparents had psychic powers,

550
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,260
 but that's not where this ended.

551
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,760
 That would just be the end of the episode.

552
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,260
 Believed by the age of four, he could levitate.

553
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,260
 He said an imaginary friend taught him to read,

554
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,760
 and he later learned how to hypnotize people.

555
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,260
 In the 1940s, he began serving in the US Navy.

556
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,760
 And that's when he really began to believe he had powers.

557
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,260
 He believed he was psychokinetic, which would be an equivalent of telekinesis.

558
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,760
 You basically can move stuff, create stuff with your mind.

559
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,260
 Specifically, he believed that he could cause lightning storms.

560
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,760
 So he could control the weather, violent weather.

561
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
 Even though his grandparents were psychic,

562
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
 he believed that he was actually chosen by aliens.

563
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,760
 That aliens wanted to see what a human body can do.

564
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,260
 Here's a quote from him.

565
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,760
 "I'm an experiment with them, being the aliens.

566
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,760
 I'm an experiment with them, to find out just how much PK power

567
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,260
 a human being can absorb and stand.

568
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,760
 It took them literally ages to find a human being, myself,

569
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,760
 with whom they could communicate back and forth."

570
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,760
 What's super interesting is if this story happened anywhere close to the internet age,

571
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
 things would be completely different.

572
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
 This story is absolutely fascinating.

573
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,260
 It starts and ends right before people can actually document this stuff.

574
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,260
 It is fairly well documented, but if this happened nowadays,

575
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,260
 he starts saying that he can cause hurricanes.

576
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,260
 That's really his bread and butter, right?

577
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,260
 One of the most destructive natural events on the planet.

578
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,760
 He begins sending letters to the US government saying,

579
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,760
 "There's going to be a hurricane. It's going to hit here."

580
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,760
 "There's going to be a hurricane. It's going to hit here."

581
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 Now, he wasn't just sending them to some flunky of the government.

582
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
 He was doing that, but he was also letting other people know.

583
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,760
 Wayne Grover, for example, became a confidant of his later on.

584
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
 So he's sending out these letters to the US government,

585
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
 but obviously they're just thinking he's a crackpot.

586
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,760
 He has this weird, quick fall-off.

587
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,260
 He didn't seem to be the most stable person to begin with.

588
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
 I mean, he's levitating at H4, right?

589
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
 That can't be good for your psyche.

590
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,760
 That must give you some sort of...

591
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:33,260
 If it's true, obviously, that would make him feel so far separated from normal people.

592
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
 How could you even stand being around them?

593
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
 But he does have a family.

594
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,260
 In 1969, he quits his job.

595
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:44,260
 He's really not doing much, but he believes that he should be paid for his powers.

596
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,760
 That people should pay him because he's so powerful.

597
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,760
 He has this weird money-making scheme where he starts to send letters to football teams

598
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,760
 and say, "If you don't pay me X amount of money, your team's going to lose."

599
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 People are like, "What? No, we're not going to do that, obviously. We're not going to do that."

600
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,760
 And then the game would come, Sunday would come,

601
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,760
 disastrous loss for the team.

602
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 Now, there's an easy way and a hard way to do predictions.

603
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 The easiest way is to write a riddle,

604
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,760
 and then afterwards, anything that even comes close to the riddle go,

605
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 "Predicted that."

606
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,260
 That's not what Ted Owens was doing.

607
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,760
 He would send letters out to everybody,

608
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,760
 send them out to news agencies, to football coaches,

609
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,260
 friends of his, Wayne Grover, who ends up becoming a close confidant of his,

610
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,260
 would get letters and say, "Buffalo bills are going to suck today."

611
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
 And everyone goes, "They always suck."

612
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,760
 And he goes, "No, no, especially suck today." And they would watch the game with bated breath

613
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,260
 and they would just lose.

614
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,260
 Fumbles, mistakes, stuff that they should know better.

615
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,760
 They'd lose.

616
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,260
 But the teams weren't paying him money.

617
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
 Is it a fluke? What's going on here?

618
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,260
 But he would predict it, send it out to multiple people,

619
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,260
 and then say, "See, I told you, you need to pay me money or your sports team's going to fail."

620
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,760
 What does it have to do with lightning?

621
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,760
 Well, trust me, that was basically on an off day when he was messing with football games.

622
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,760
 At one point, he thinks the city of Cleveland is dissing him,

623
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,260
 that they weren't giving him the respect he deserves,

624
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,760
 which, I mean, that's how any normal person feels in any city, right?

625
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,760
 But we're not Ted Owens. He sends out letters.

626
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,260
 Cleveland disrespected Ted Owens.

627
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,260
 Cleveland is going to pay.

628
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,760
 I will cause devastation. I will cause a heat wave to strike the city.

629
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,260
 People are going to go mad. They're going to hear voices.

630
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,260
 Lightning storms, plane crashes, blackouts across the city.

631
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,260
 Nobody disrespects Ted Owens.

632
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,260
 That summer, lightning storms killed three people in the city.

633
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,260
 Citywide blackout, week-long heat wave,

634
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,260
 and oddly enough, people were calling up City Hall at all hours.

635
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
 "Hello? Hello? City Hall?"

636
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,260
 "You gotta get it out of my head. What's going on?"

637
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,260
 "I can hear them. I can hear God in my head, and you gotta get the voices out.

638
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
 Gotta get 'em out."

639
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,260
 Some people said they were getting messages in their head being from space,

640
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,260
 or getting intercepting secret transmissions from spies.

641
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,260
 That was May 30th, 1972,

642
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,260
 when he made the claim that he was going to strike out the city of Cleveland.

643
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
 And then that summer, we had all of that.

644
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,260
 January 30th, 1976, Ted Owens said he would end the California drought.

645
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,260
 He began sending these letters out. "I will end the drought."

646
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,260
 "Could use a little extra money to take care of it, but to show in good faith,

647
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,260
 I won't go into this drought."

648
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,260
 February 5th, not even a week later, the first snowstorm in 100 years hit San Francisco.

649
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,260
 Lightning storms. People are killed.

650
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
 And this time UFOs are sighted.

651
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,260
 There's an increase in UFO sightings around San Francisco.

652
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,260
 This is where Wayne Grover and a couple other people enter the scene.

653
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
 Because National Enquirer is picking up on all this stuff.

654
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,260
 In 1979, National Enquirer sends out Wayne Grover and Don Horine

655
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,260
 to meet up with Ted Owens, because Ted Owens says he can make a UFO appear like that.

656
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,260
 You can just see one with him.

657
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
 "It'd be great. We'll come out with our photographer.

658
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
 We're going to stand here in this alleyway.

659
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,260
 This UFO is going to appear. It's going to be awesome."

660
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,260
 Now, Ted Owens is doing whatever he does.

661
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,260
 And at a certain point, Wayne and Don are kind of looking at each other and like,

662
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,260
 "This isn't working."

663
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
 It's like those guys at SIG.

664
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
 Like, "This isn't working."

665
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
 So they end up saying, "We don't see a UFO."

666
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,260
 Now, Ted goes, "No, no, no. It was right there. I could totally see the UFO."

667
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
 "Didn't you see me teleport?"

668
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,260
 And they're like, "Ted Owens felt that he was disrespected. It was a waste of his time."

669
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,260
 This was supposed to be finally some big exposure for him.

670
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
 Honestly, National Enquirer probably offered him some money,

671
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,260
 because they've done stuff like that in the past.

672
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,260
 But there's no UFO.

673
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,260
 So they leave. The story's over with.

674
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,260
 Ted feels double-crossed. He actually curses Don Horin.

675
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,260
 "You're going to lose your job. You're going to lose your wife.

676
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,260
 And I'm going to bring another drought to Florida."

677
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
 And all three things happen.

678
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
 At this point, this is where Wayne Grover,

679
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,260
 because Wayne Grover had talked to him before, before the UFO incident as well,

680
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,260
 but this is where things really kind of start to take a turn for not just Ted,

681
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,260
 but Wayne, because Wayne is now thinking this guy might actually be legit.

682
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,260
 And he begins steady phone conversations and mail correspondence with Ted Owens.

683
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,260
 And he says, "This is what would happen. I would get a phone call from Ted,

684
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,260
 saying something was going very specific, not just like,

685
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
 'Oh, there's going to be an uprising somewhere in the world.

686
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,260
 There'd be like, 'There's going to be a hurricane. It's going to hit here.'

687
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
 Then I would receive a letter from Ted saying,

688
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
 'This is where the hurricane's going to hit.'

689
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,260
 And then I'd either get a phone call or newspaper clippings,

690
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
 or both, showing that he was right.

691
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,260
 And Wayne Grover started off thinking this was all kind of funny.

692
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,260
 In the end, he said it was about 80% accuracy.

693
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,260
 That this guy was putting this information forth.

694
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,260
 At one point, there was a hurricane headed towards Florida,

695
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,260
 and Wayne was talking to Ted, almost jokingly, and was like,

696
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,260
 'Yeah, you know, we probably can't afford to get hit by another hurricane.'

697
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,260
 Ted goes, 'I'll take care of it. I'll take care of the cane.'

698
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,260
 That's what he called him.

699
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
 He dissipated before it made landfall.

700
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
 There was another time he said,

701
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,260
 'Yeah, there's another hurricane coming. I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it.'

702
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,260
 And it went and it hit South Carolina instead and caused massive damage.

703
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,260
 Now, obviously, hurricanes are always hitting Florida,

704
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
 and sometimes they dissipate and things like that.

705
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,260
 I actually have a theory about Ted Owens, but let's finish out this story.

706
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,260
 He feels like he's powerful, obviously, right?

707
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,260
 If you believe that you can create hurricanes to move hurricanes out of the way,

708
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
 you should be paid for it.

709
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:42,260
 But he was more well-known in the sports pages than he was for anything else.

710
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
 Sports writers would talk about this guy,

711
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,260
 because he would send them articles, he would send them letters saying,

712
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,260
 'Philadelphia Eagles are going to have a bad game this Sunday unless the coach pays me X amount of dollars.'

713
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,260
 People would want to take it seriously and they would lose.

714
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:03,260
 He was reported about way more in the sports pages than he was covered in national news or anything like that.

715
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,260
 And he couldn't deal with that.

716
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
 He's a superhuman.

717
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,260
 I'm sure it's funny. I'm sure some of the teams actually paid him off.

718
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,260
 I'm sure that people never admitted to it, but I'm sure a couple of teams actually paid him off.

719
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,260
 And he told Wayne, he goes, 'I can't make a team win. I can make a team lose.'

720
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,260
 So if a team came to him and said, 'Hey, can we win this week?'

721
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,260
 He couldn't make, he couldn't have a good outcome.

722
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,260
 He couldn't make an average team better or a better team have good luck.

723
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,260
 He could only make a team worse.

724
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,260
 In the end, though, he ended up homeless and he's in New York City.

725
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,260
 He's still in contact with Wayne Grover at this point and he's completely bitter.

726
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,260
 Obviously, I don't think there were many happy homeless people.

727
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
 He's completely bitter.

728
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,260
 And he, to the end, believed the government needed to pay him,

729
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:56,260
 but he also began to confide in Wayne that he felt his powers were diminishing.

730
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,260
 He was losing the ability to control the things he used to control.

731
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:05,260
 Wayne Grover said in the end, in 1987, he gets a phone call from Ted Owens and says,

732
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,260
 'A UFO's coming to pick me up. Me and my family are in New York City.

733
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,260
 A UFO's coming to pick us all up. I want to tell you something, Ted.'

734
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
 We have this quote from Wayne Grover.

735
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,260
 It says, 'The predictions of that last conversation changed my life

736
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,260
 and caused me to wonder where science leaves off and the unknown begins.'

737
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,260
 His family did not disappear on a UFO. Neither did he.

738
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,260
 He ended up dying that year of cirrhosis of the liver.

739
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,260
 Interesting story. You see what I mean?

740
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,260
 Like, if this was happening nowadays, when he's sending out letters to these newspapers

741
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,260
 in the 60s and the 70s and stuff like that and you'd have editors throwing them in the trash

742
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
 or passing them around as jokes,

743
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,260
 did you imagine if he had access to YouTube or any internet forum?

744
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,260
 I mean, it would be a totally different ballgame, right?

745
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,260
 Now, it's definitely possible that this guy was making random guesses.

746
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:06,260
 80% is outside the chance of randomness, but we're taking Wayne Grover's word for that thing.

747
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,260
 He's saying, 'I definitely was getting a lot of hits from this guy.'

748
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,260
 But yeah, if that had happened today where everything could be documented,

749
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,260
 he could pull out his phone and go, 'I got a prediction for you.'

750
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,260
 The Buffalo Bill still suck.

751
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,260
 Just a million views. Actually, that'd be his least viewed video.

752
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
 They're like, 'Yeah, yeah, I know.'

753
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,260
 But imagine that pulling out YouTube, going on Snapchat.

754
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,260
 A real-life 2028 man, right?

755
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,260
 But one who could also control lightning.

756
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
 I have a theory about this guy.

757
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,260
 It's very interesting because there's very--

758
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,260
 There's a lot of resources on this guy and they basically all corroborate each other.

759
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,260
 There's a book called The PK Man which kind of combines all this stuff.

760
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
 There's three possibilities.

761
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
 One who's just very lucky.

762
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,260
 But someone who dies homeless with cirrhosis of the liver,

763
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,260
 I don't think you can define as lucky.

764
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,260
 He just had good guessing abilities too.

765
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,260
 He did have the ability to call down lightning to stop storms.

766
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,260
 He claimed that he actually killed 100 people who were in an airplane once through lightning.

767
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,260
 I wasn't able to corroborate that.

768
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,260
 I only found that in one source, so I didn't include that in the main narrative.

769
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,260
 So he would claim a bunch of stuff. We don't know if that's true.

770
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,260
 But he said that he can call down lightning, he can create and diminish storms and all that stuff.

771
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,260
 He can make football teams win and lose. These are his powers.

772
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,260
 What other power or what other ability would give you all of those things?

773
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,260
 Time traveler.

774
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,260
 Every single one of those events would have been documented, right?

775
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,260
 Hurricane reports, massive storms, electrical disturbances in the city,

776
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,260
 teams winning and losing, every single thing.

777
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,260
 You could even add UFO sightings to that.

778
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,260
 I have a list of nearly every UFO sighting in the world.

779
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,260
 I check it out all the time. Time traveler.

780
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,260
 Someone who came back with the knowledge of the world before him.

781
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:03,260
 That would actually be a more reasonable answer than someone who would have the ability to do these things.

782
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,260
 Because that's why he said, "I can't make one team better, but I can make a team lose. He just knows which team loses."

783
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,260
 And it wouldn't be every game.

784
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,260
 It would be games with losses that were so odd that they would stick out.

785
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,260
 And the ones that he got wrong would just be ones he forgot.

786
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:26,260
 So I think a time traveler makes more sense, but more interesting than that is what if he's an unwilling time traveler?

787
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,260
 What if he didn't travel back in time as an adult?

788
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:40,260
 But traveled back in time as a child, lived an adult life in a future, traveled back in time and relived the life and remembered the things.

789
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,260
 And even weirder, what if it's backwards reincarnation?

790
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,260
 I know now I'm just kind of throwing stuff out there, but...

791
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,260
 Someone who lived in the future and they reincarnated in the past. A true glitch in the system.

792
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,260
 Wasn't able to predict what movies were going to be big box office hits.

793
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,260
 Wasn't interested in that in the future.

794
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,260
 Was interested in sports? Interested in hurricanes?

795
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,260
 Interested in weird events?

796
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,260
 And whether they ended up here as a time traveler and simply made up a story of their past,

797
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:19,260
 or something even weirder happened, reincarnating backwards or time traveling back and being reborn,

798
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,260
 none of it's provable, obviously.

799
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:30,260
 But it would be interesting to see what the SIG, that skeptic group, could test with Ted Owens.

800
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:37,260
 He could either come out there and go, "I'm going to cause lightning in five days." And then a massive storm hits and they can go, "Ugh."

801
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,260
 Or he could just arrange for the test to take place on a Tuesday.

802
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:48,260
 And sit there and go, "A freak storm is hitting Talladega right now."

803
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,260
 They go and they check the news.

804
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,260
 What? Because he knew that was coming.

805
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:59,260
 The whole time I was reading the story I was thinking, time traveling, he knows these events, he can't control them, he's predicting them.

806
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,260
 And it would be even more interesting if he doesn't know he's predicting them.

807
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
 He feels a tingle in his skin.

808
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,260
 He gets a hint of a memory, a vision, some might call it.

809
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:15,260
 But it's really just him remembering, sitting down and watching a game and going, "Those damn bills!"

810
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
 Can't believe they lost again.

811
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
 Like they always do.

812
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
 I don't know why I bet money on them.

813
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,260
 Ted Owens, the PK man as he's known, is all but forgotten nowadays. I had no idea who this guy was.

814
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,260
 I never heard this story before. Some of you guys may be familiar with him, but I hadn't heard of it.

815
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,260
 It's fairly well documented.

816
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
 It's fairly well documented.

817
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:42,260
 Of course, one of the documentarians is working for the National Enquirer, which throws a lot of stuff in a suspect, but not everything.

818
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,260
 Did Ted Owens have special powers that would have earned him $250,000 today?

819
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,260
 Or was he just able to predict the future, which would also earn him $250,000?

820
00:35:53,260 --> 00:36:00,260
 His biggest problem wasn't that he was a man born with special powers, and the world didn't understand him.

821
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,260
 His biggest problem was he was a man born with special powers in the wrong time period.

822
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:19,260
 He was born today. Not only would he have $250,000, he would have a massive following of fans, of worshippers, falling at his feet, waiting for his next prediction.

823
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,260
 On YouTube, on TikTok, on Instagram, on Twitter.

824
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:30,260
 If Ted Owens was a time traveler, he ended up coming back to the wrong time.
