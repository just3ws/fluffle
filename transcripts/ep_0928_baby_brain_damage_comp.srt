1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When a young man is up late playing video games, he thinks the only thing he has to worry about is getting spawn camped.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 But then he realized something was watching him from the darkness outside his bedroom.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then we take a look at the story of three young boys at home with their teenage babysitter.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Many people often say they wish they could see a UFO.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 This story is so terrifying, you'll never say that again.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 This is the last episode of this trunk. It's not the end of the season.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 The next two weeks are going to be classic episodes that pick some really good ones.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 A lot of behind the scenes stuff.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And then there's going to be a week and no episodes. I'm actually going to be physically gone on vacation.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I won't be home. But I'm bringing a microphone in case there's some breaking news.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We have to do any sort of podcasting stuff.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But we will be back the first week of September, last week of August.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I'm still trying to figure everything out.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It's been a whirlwind the past couple of weeks just trying to get these episodes together.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But someone who's never a whirlwind, someone who's a light gentle breeze, hopefully,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 blowing in, is that a thing people are called? Is that a compliment? I think it is.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Blowing into Dead Rabbit Command. Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, Meredith Riddle.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Woo yeah, come on in, come on in. Meredith, she's like made of smoke and clouds and stuff like that.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 She's like, what normal, normal, carbon-based human?

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Now in my wisp of air since you just needed that weird segue.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Meredith, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon, I totally get it. Just help spread the word about this show.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 That really, really helps out a lot. Now, Meredith, you lucked out. This is a pretty creepy episode.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I'm assuming you like creepy stuff if you listen to this podcast.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Meredith, we're going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. Let's get it out of the garage.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We're driving all the way out from Dead Rabbit Command to some dudes.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I was thinking you'd give us a location to the anonymous story, but we're going to some dude's house.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 [Dude's house sounds]

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You know what's interesting? It's such a small world. These stories could be taking place somewhere around me.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I don't know if I've ever announced on the show. I don't know if I've ever announced this.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We've talked about it on the Patreon Discord. I've talked it with listeners in real life.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Hans Vermhat, the very famous Hans Vermhat, long time friend of the show. He wouldn't describe it.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I doubt that he likes the show if he knows about it. Hans Vermhat lives in Oregon. And I live in Oregon.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 So who knows? We might have passed each other's paths at one point. You may be my boss for a while, I know.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I should walk into my boss and be like, "Hey man, how do you feel about monkeys?"

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And see what he says. Small world, though, isn't it? Hans Vermhat and Jason Carpenter.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I almost don't even feel like I'm in the same category as him, right?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Hans Vermhat is an icon. I would not consider myself on the level of the stature of Hans Vermhat.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 This show could become the next Joe Rogan podcast. It could have 10 million listeners a day.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And I'd still be like, "But I'm no Hans Vermhat. He's an icon."

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So I agree with what he says. I'll be honest with you. This isn't a Hans Vermhat segment.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I'm talking about this just randomly, but for people who are just the first episode there, who's Hans Vermhat?

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Hans Vermhat doesn't believe monkeys exist, believes that space doesn't exist.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 The space believes that the color orange is satanic.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Those are like the fun stuff that I talk about. He also has these other conspiracy theories that I'm shocked he hasn't been kicked off YouTube.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It's one thing to say monkeys... I guess this has become Hans Vermhat thing. I hope this isn't one of those rant episodes.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Hans Vermhat, monkeys don't exist to find. That's a funny conspiracy theory.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He believes that every monkey you've ever seen is animated. Not like a little McGillagorella guy, but like drawing or animatronics or a puppet.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Monkeys don't exist. Gorillas don't exist. It's an evil plot to make humans believe in evolution, which is satanic.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 See, that's why they fake the monkeys in the first place. Monkeys don't exist.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 He also believes... I remember this was so weird, I was like, "I can't cover that on my show, bro!"

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 He doesn't believe that the slave trade existed in the United States.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I'm like, "What are you talking about, dude?" And he'll... has this whole video. I'll put it in the...

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I'll risk my YouTube channel by putting it in the show notes.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 If it's still up, right? The video could have gotten taken it down. I don't even know who I'm talking about.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 This is just off the top of my head.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Hans Vermhat doesn't believe there are any slaves in America, zero.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And he goes, "Here's his proof." He would show drawings of boats.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And he goes, "Look at how many people they stored on these boats. That's inhumane."

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 "You can never in any way, shape, or form put a bunch of people on a boat like that."

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And have them not like half of them die.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Yeah, dude, that was like what made it so horrible was the fact that it was completely inhumane.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 They treated the slaves like they were like barrels of water, right?

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 They just stored as many as they could on.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 You knew you're going to lose 15% of them coming over.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Yeah, that's the point. That's why people don't like slavery. It's inhumane.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 He doesn't believe that the American slave trade ever existed, which I'm very curious, because he's very religious.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I wonder if he thinks that the Egyptians had slaves, like they enslaved the Israelites.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 He hasn't done a video on that.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Yeah, but he believes that there was no slaves in America, zero.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 That's so weird. That's like absolutely bizarre.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I wonder what would happen if he got a hold of the World War II never existed.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 We covered that on a podcast a long time ago.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 World War II never happened. It was all crisis actors. Your grandpa was in on it.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I had a bunch of relatives who fought World War II. They were all in on it.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 It was all a stage show. World War II never existed.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Slave trade never existed just for the sensors out there.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I'm not saying that. Hans Verm Hat, though, lives in Oregon.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 That was the whole point of that. It went all the way from Hans Verm Hat,

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 lives in the same state as I do, to possibly nuking my YouTube channel.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Absolutely bizarre. I do love conspiracy theories.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So when you meet people who genuinely believe in them, it's just so fascinating.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I used to. I talked about that on a show.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I never believed that World War II never happened.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I never believed that monkeys don't exist, but I believed in other big conspiracy theories.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Meredith, let's go ahead and get this episode actually started.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 We're pulling up to this young dude's house.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 He goes by the online name Tiz Me Flow.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 We're going to go ahead and call him Terry.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Terry, 16-year-old boy, has a habit of staying up late playing video games.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Living the dream, right? Isn't that awesome?

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 You're running around. You're playing some Team Fortress 2.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 You're playing some killing floor.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Killing them clots.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Blowing them up. Maybe a little battlefield.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Maybe a couple Call of Duty.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I don't know. This guy could have been super lame.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He might have been playing farming simulator all day long.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Sorry to insult all you farmers out there, both real and simulated.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 He'd stay up late and he'd be playing these video games, and of course, he'd get too loud.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And his mom would come in.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Terry, what are you doing? Why are you yelling so loud?

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Mom, you won't believe it. We just capped the point for the third time in a row.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 I don't care. That was a rhetorical question, Terry.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You can't be loud. It's late at night. Quit yelling.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Okay, Mom.

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 We're going to cap it one more time, guys, before I go to bed.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 This happened a couple times. It's happened to all of us, right?

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Mom, spoil in our fun.

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Well, one night, same setup, right?

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 He's up late. The entire house is pitch black.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And his room is only illuminated by his monitor.

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Oh, yeah, took him out. Shot him in the stomach.

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Go us.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And while he's playing this video game, he has his bedroom door open about six inches.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 There's about a six-inch gap between the door and the door frame.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 But it must have just been air flow.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 No wonder why this guy gets yelled at for being loud.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Shut your door, bro.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 He has his door open about six inches.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Must have just been for air flow or something like that.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Because the entire house is pitch black.

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He goes, "When you turn and you looked out my door, you would just see the darkness of the hallway."

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Right?

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Yeah, come on, guys. One more round for victory.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Sounds like the most annoying guy to play with, honestly.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 He's playing his game and he sees out of the corner of his eye,

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 his mom staring at him from that hallway.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Like, her face is wedged in between the gap of the door frame and the door.

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So you have that six-inch gap and he sees out of the corner of his eye,

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 his mom staring at him.

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 But not just staring at him, he said her face was locked in a scream.

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Now, he has his headphones on.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Of course, you're going to have to be a lot louder than the game.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 So he's used to her screaming.

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 But when he sees out of the corner of his eye, he sees his mom yelling at him.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Like, a perfect image of his mom yelling at him.

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Furrowed, browed.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 She looked so angry that she couldn't get this guy to hear him.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 She looked so frustrated because she knew he couldn't hear her,

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 so now she's having a yell late at night to get his attention.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And he sees his mom yelling at him from the hallway,

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 face wedged right in between the door and the door frame.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 He turns and he looks and as he's turning, he takes his headphones off

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 to hear what she's yelling about.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 He knows what it is, right? He knows what it is.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 He's being too loud.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 He takes his headphones off, he's turning to face her and he goes, "What?"

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And then he realizes he's just looking into pitch blackness.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 There was no one standing in the hallway.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 There was no one even else awake in the house.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It was just Terry sitting in his bedroom, staring through the crack in his door

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 into the pitch black hallway.

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Now, you could argue that it was his imagination, right?

161
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 He's up late.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 He's seen his mom yell a lot of times.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So it's like an after-image or something like that, right?

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 But he says, he realized immediately like it was something else,

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 something paranormal.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 He goes on to explain.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 He goes, "I've never had anything paranormal happen to me ever."

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 He goes, "That was the only time anything that you could possibly say was paranormal

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 happened and nothing's happened since."

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And he saw that.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 He saw his mom with her face wedged in the door screaming at him

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and then he turned and she was gone.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Now, it was so just weird.

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 He didn't tell anyone about it.

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He didn't tell anyone.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He was in the next day.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 He's like, "Hey, Mom, did you get to me being loud last night?"

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 She's like, "What?"

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He didn't tell anyone.

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And eventually his sister who lived with him, she moved away.

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 She went to college and he goes, "I never really liked my sister's room.

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I always felt kind of unsettled by it."

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And after she left to college, he goes, "I always kept her bedroom door shut."

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 It just was very unsettling.

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Something in her room creeped him out.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 A few years later, he was saying he was talking to his family

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and he told him this story.

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 He said, "You know, it's so weird.

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 One night I was up late.

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And I thought I saw Mom yelling at me,

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 yelling at me from the darkness of the hallway.

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And it was unsettling.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 She wasn't really there.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 It actually creeped me out.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Like when I turned and I looked, she wasn't there at all.

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I was alone or I was the only one awake.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And at that time, this, I don't know how often this happens in families.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 My family was very vocal about stuff they had seen.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 At that time, his mom and his sister said,

200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 "Yeah, we've had some paranormal encounters as well.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Some weird stuff has happened in this house before."

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 He doesn't go into detail about what they saw,

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 but that's interesting, right?

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 It's an interesting thing.

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So we talk about this as a ghost researcher.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 You want to have multiple witnesses and you want to have multiple witnesses

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 that aren't interfering with each other's perceptions.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 If you have three people living in a house

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 and they're all experiencing the same thing,

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 and each morning they're like,

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 "Oh, dude, you won't believe it.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I woke up last night and heard phantom footsteps down the hallway."

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 The other two people, I can almost guarantee, will hear phantom footsteps.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Even if it's just the wind, even if it's just the creaking of the old house.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 We covered a story recently where a mom was hearing her voice called in the house.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 She heard someone going, whatever her name was, Louise or whatever.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Louise and it was her voice.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It wasn't like Jacob Marley floating around.

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It wasn't that exaggerated,

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 but she said it was the sound of my name being called

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 and there was a tone of desperation to it.

222
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 She never told her kids about it.

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 She was trying to shield her kids from the haunting.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And then one day, years later, she hears her son talking to his friend

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 and the son goes, "This place is really creepy.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You want to hear something weird?"

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Sometimes I hear my name being called when I'm the only one alone.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 So that's a verifiable haunting at that point.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 The son never told her son what was going on

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 and she just happened to overhear that.

231
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 The son never told the mom what was going on.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 So in this type of situation where you have three people,

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 and they weren't telling the 16-year-olds,

234
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 they probably used a big old security cat.

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 They didn't want to scare them around, scare them out of the house.

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 But they were experiencing paranormal.

237
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Now what does that mean?

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Is that phantom noises?

239
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Is that stuff flying off the shelves?

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Is it full body apparitions?

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 We don't know, but it was definitely something that the mother and the sister,

242
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 individually, thought was weird.

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Something was going on in this house.

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I read that story, like, literally last night before I'm recording this episode.

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It's just creepy, right?

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 A vengeful spirit, that's a trope.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 You know, something screaming at you from the darkness.

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 But the fact that it took the form of his mom

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 adds a level of terror to it.

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And what if it was trying to lure him out into the hallway?

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Or what if he turned around when it was looking at him,

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 and had he not turned around, had he not caught it out of the corner of his eye,

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 that it would have creeped closer into the bedroom?

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 So for all you gamers out there,

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio recommends sleeping on all the lights in the house.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Make it shine as bright as Rockefeller Square's Christmas tree.

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Ghosts have a hard time sneaking up on you in the light.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 It's not impossible, but it's a little bit over your electric bill.

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 You're electric bill super high, but you're like,

260
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 "But at least I'm not getting attacked by a ghost that looks like my mama."

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Meredith Riddle, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonic hopter.

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 We're saying goodbye to our gamer friends.

263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 We're gonna fly all the way out to Canada.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 [imitates car engine]

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 It's October 7th, 1979, and we're in Wabaska.

266
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 That's a town in Alberta, Canada.

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Maybe a township, maybe a shire, I don't know.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Other countries have weird names for their localities.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Wabaska.

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Wabaska in Canada, it's 8 p.m.

271
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And there's a mom with her little boys, with her little boys hanging out there.

272
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 We're gonna have this mom, and she has three sons, Charles, who's seven,

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Nick, who's six, it's a busy mom,

274
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 and Milo, who's a nine month old little baby brother.

275
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 So he's like [imitates car engine]

276
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And he's like crawling around, and the mom's like, "I need a break! Can I need a break?

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I'm gonna go out, hang out with my friends.

278
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'll see you guys in a couple hours."

279
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So she hives, they're not washing them by themselves, right?

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 She gets a babysitter.

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 They get their 14 year old cousin.

282
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 This babysitter will go ahead and call her Nancy.

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 All of these names I've made up, by the way.

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 We don't have the actual names of these people.

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 So if you go to Wabaska, and you start knocking on people's doors,

286
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 asking for Charles, you might just get some weirdo.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 October 7, 1979, we're up here.

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Nancy's gonna be watching these boys.

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I can do it, don't worry. You go out and have fun.

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 "I'm a big girl," said the babysitter.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 "I'll watch your babies."

292
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And the mom's like, "Okay, I'm here. I need a break. I need a break.

293
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I don't care who's watching right now."

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Now this is a rural part of Wabaska.

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 They're all living in a trailer on their grandma's piece of property.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 So the grandma has a big piece of property.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It's near this lake in the area.

298
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And you have this trailer where the boys are hanging out, the babysitters there,

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 and the mom's like, "See you later."

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 They're on their grandma's property.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And so even if something went really south, right,

302
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 they could just run across the field, get grandma.

303
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And luckily, their aunt is a nurse.

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Actually, now the thing about why didn't you get grandma or the nurse to watch these kids or whatever.

305
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 The mom leaves. The mom goes to do what she needs to do.

306
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 You have these three boys, Charles, Nick, and Milo being watched over by this babysitter.

307
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And the mom said, "I'll be back around 10.30."

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 So it's only going to be a couple hours that they're by themselves or with a babysitter, with a teenage babysitter.

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And Charles is our narrator in this story.

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 He's the one who posted this to UFO reporting groups.

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 He said, "We're sitting in the trailer and I remember clearly it's nighttime, right?

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 It's dark outside."

313
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And Milo is in his little walker.

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Me and Nick are just kind of hanging out.

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Nancy's doing whatever she's doing.

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 He goes, "I start to notice that there are these multi-colored lights shining into the trailer."

317
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 He goes, "I'm sitting there and I start to see these lights get projected into, like, on the walls of the trailer."

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So he's looking around his house, right?

319
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 They're all living in this trailer.

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And he sees these lights just appearing on the wall around him.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's like, "What in the world is going on?"

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So he gets up and he starts walking over to the window to look outside to see what could be projecting this light show.

323
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And he says that he begins to hear a, quote, "high low noise."

324
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 A high low noise.

325
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 That's very, very interesting detail.

326
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 When we talk about the paranormal, things don't always make sense.

327
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 If I told you to imagine a high noise, that's also a low noise that might be hard for us to think about.

328
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 But in the world of the paranormal, it doesn't have any sort of physical real...

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 When I say physical, like, "physical properties," you know, like, it doesn't necessarily follow the rules of the universe.

330
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 It's a high noise and a low noise at the same time.

331
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And it's getting, whatever this is, it's not going from high to low or low to high.

332
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 The high low noise is getting louder and louder and louder.

333
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And Charles is starting to almost be stunned by this noise.

334
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 It's starting to have physiological effects.

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And Charles goes, "I looked out that window and I realized that I could no longer see any stars in the sky."

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 This noise is deafening him.

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 At this point, Nick is also reacting to this.

338
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 The babysitter is like, "What in the world is going on? Where is that coming from?"

339
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And Milo starts crying.

340
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Little baby Milo and his walker.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Truly the most helpless in the story, right?

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Everyone else is mobile.

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Everyone else can hold up the weight of their own neck.

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Everyone else can move or hide, but Milo is just in his walker.

345
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And you now have this trailer that's not only filled with the sound of this high low noise that's becoming increasingly louder.

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's filled with the sounds of kids screaming.

347
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Charles realizes the reason why he can't see any stars is there is something blocking the night sky.

348
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 He said there is this massive circular craft hovering only a hundred feet off the ground.

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 He said it was just right above like the tree line.

350
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 He said it was above the trees. It was above the trailer.

351
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But that was just like the rim of it.

352
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Most of it was just covering this patch of field.

353
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 There were only outskirts of this massive rim and he could see this.

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And he said you could see the lights that were bombarding them were on the sides of the UFO.

355
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It almost like ran the circumference of the UFO on the side.

356
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And that's where these multicolored lights were coming from.

357
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 The trailer that they're in right now begins to shake.

358
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Trailers. These trailers are not built to weather even earthly events like tornadoes or hurricanes.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And right now as this UFO is hovering overhead, it's not moving.

360
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It's just there. The trailer begins to violently shake.

361
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 The noise is so loud now. Charles has his ears completely cupped.

362
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 He's putting his head into a pillow. He still can't block the noise.

363
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It's a sonic attack.

364
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Everyone's screaming. Everyone's crying.

365
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 The trailer is shaking. The lights are blinding.

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 The noise is still getting louder and louder and louder.

367
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And then a noise above all is the scream of Nancy when she yells out, "Where's Milo?"

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Charles turns and looks at the walker that Milo was in. He's gone.

369
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 At that point, both Charles and Nancy, just a word of advice.

370
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Nick is completely useless for the rest of the story.

371
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 He's basically in a fetal position somewhere in the trailer.

372
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 He does not appear in the rest of the story.

373
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Charles and Nancy look and they both see that the door to the trailer is swung wide open

374
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and standing in the middle of that field, directly underneath the bottom of this massive craft, is Milo.

375
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Now, there's no way he would have been able to get out there on his own.

376
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I mean, okay, nine months old, I think you can crawl then, but the amount of time that's passed so far,

377
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 there's no way he would have gotten out by his own. He couldn't have gotten out the walker by himself.

378
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 The walker is empty. He's in the middle of this field.

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And Charles said, "I looked into that field and I saw my baby brother and he was in the middle of the field, completely frozen in place."

380
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Charles is staring outside this door. The night sky completely dark.

381
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 The light coming from this UFO and there in the middle of the field, directly underneath this vehicle, is a little baby just frozen in place.

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Charles is sitting on the couch and he's like, "What just happened? What just happened?"

383
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And he realizes that there's some block of time that's gone now.

384
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 He remembers standing at the door, staring at, and the next thing he knew, he was sitting on the couch.

385
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Nick, Nick is still in the fetal position on the ground screaming.

386
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Charles jumps up off the couch and he runs to the window and he looks out and he sees the UFO, but now it's farther away.

387
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 He says, "Now it's starting to hover over the lake." It's leaving the area.

388
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 He turns around, Milo is crying, the babysitter is almost in shock at this point, and Mom walks in.

389
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And Charles, his immediate thought was, "She must have seen what happened."

390
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 She had just left not too long ago. This giant vehicle showed up. This had to be visible from pretty much anywhere in Wabaska.

391
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 He turns to his mom and his mom is furious as she's coming in the door and she goes, "What is going on?

392
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Why is Milo screaming? Why is Nick in the fetal position? What is going on?"

393
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And the babysitter doesn't have words for it. Neither does Charles.

394
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Charles quickly realizes the mom did not come back because she saw the UFO.

395
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 The mom walked into the trailer because it was 10.30pm.

396
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Now remember the story started at 8pm. The UFO showed up at 8pm.

397
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And Charles, he didn't know. He goes, "Later on in life, I heard about a thing called lost time in relation to UFOs."

398
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 He goes, "I did not even know. It took a long time. I didn't know what that meant."

399
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He goes, "The event started. It was maybe like a couple minutes. And then I'm sitting on the couch and it's 10.30pm.

400
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 I had no way to figure out that that was a real phenomenon or what."

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 First he thought his mom came home early because she saw the event.

402
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Then he realized, "No, the four people in the trailer lost two and a half hours of time."

403
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Now the mom walks over to Milo. Nobody knows what to tell her, right?

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Nick is completely useless. Charles is trying to process all this stuff.

405
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 The babysitter, Nancy, is freaking out.

406
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And Milo is crying so hard. This little baby boy is crying so hard that he's having a hard time breathing.

407
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 He can't even catch his breath. He's sobs are preventing him from breathing properly.

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And the mom walks over to Milo and Charles and Nancy go over to him because they're still like,

409
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 "How do you even explain that?" They're still trying to process it themselves when it happens.

410
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Charles goes, "We walk over and my mom is trying to calm down Milo. He's sobbing so hard."

411
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And they're all standing there looking at Milo in the walker.

412
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 When all of a sudden Milo's eyeballs roll to the back of his head and he begins going into convulsions.

413
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 This little nine month old infant is in a full body seizure right now.

414
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And foam begins to come out of his mouth.

415
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 His body goes limp. He completely stops breathing.

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And the mom is trying to do CPR. Everyone's freaking out.

417
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 The screams now reach the grandma's house on the same property.

418
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Without any sort of paranormal phenomenon, any sort of alien technology to mute the screams

419
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 of these kids, the grandma hears just this cacophony of crying and yelling.

420
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And the grandma comes over and she sees her grandson limp.

421
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 This little nine month old baby, all this foam coming out of his mouth.

422
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 They take the baby, they take Milo to the grandma's house and the aunt happened to be there.

423
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And she begins doing CPR. She begins to scoop the foam out of Milo's mouth.

424
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 She's just pulling this thick foam out.

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 They then take him to Slave Lake Hospital. Apparently that's the name of the hospital in Wabaska.

426
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Slave Lake Hospital where he was treated and he's okay.

427
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Charles said that Milo is A-okay.

428
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 However, he did add this detail. He did say that his little brother was okay.

429
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 However, he did suffer minor brain damage due to a lack of oxygen for a short period of time.

430
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Now the aunt said when she was pulling the foam out of baby Milo's mouth, she was saying,

431
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 "I don't know what this is. I've dealt with people who have epileptic fits and I've dealt with people who have had seizures."

432
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And they will sometimes foam, they'll sometimes spit stuff up, but nothing like this.

433
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 She's just like pulling out of this goo.

434
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 In a thing that's very typical of paranormal or UFO encounters,

435
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 that people who haven't experienced them have a hard time believing, but this is true.

436
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I've encountered this as well.

437
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 That amazing and terrifying event that had real-world ramifications, right?

438
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 This little baby had brain damage from this.

439
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 So all the UFO, the trailer, shaking, you had four witnesses, three that could comprehend it, and then a little baby.

440
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Charles said, "I remember the event. Never forgotten about it. That's why I can talk about it."

441
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So the National UFO Reporting Center, that's where we got this.

442
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 We got it from ThinkAboutItDucks.com. They got it from National UFO Reporting Center.

443
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He goes, "I remember the event. Nick remembers bits and pieces."

444
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 He kind of remembers stuff of it. He goes, "When I talk to my cousin," you know, they're all adults now, right?

445
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 This story happened back in 1979.

446
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He goes, "When I've talked to my cousin about it, the babysitter, she doesn't remember it at all.

447
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 She has no memory of the UFO. She has no memory of the trailer shaking or the lights.

448
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 But she will remember a night."

449
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 She goes, "I do remember when Milo got brain damage, which I'm assuming would be pretty memorable."

450
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 But that's all she remembers about it.

451
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And we see that in paranormal events. I've gone on Ghost Hunts where we've experienced phenomenon.

452
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 And then years later, like obvious stuff, and then years later, I'll be talking to someone.

453
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I was like, "Hey, dude, remember when that happened?" And they're like, "No."

454
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I was like, "You don't remember when that shadow man grabbed you by the shoulders?"

455
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 "No." And I would tell him about the night. He's like, "Oh, no, no. I remember that night we all went out."

456
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I was like, "You remember when we went to that spooky forest?" He's like, "Yeah."

457
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 And I go, "Then you don't remember what happened after that?" He's like, "No."

458
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 I don't remember.

459
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 So it happens, right? It's weird. You think that would be one of the most memorable events of your life, but...

460
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Different people remember different parts of it. Milo probably doesn't remember any of it.

461
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 For one, he's not even told. Two, minor brain damage.

462
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Fascinating story. I read this story a while back and I just couldn't wait to share it with you.

463
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Because, and I wanted to wrap it up like this, I see people all the time online.

464
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And I said the other day, my friend, Magania, here in town, she's like, "I hope I get possessed."

465
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I'm like, "Dude, quit saying that. I hope I get possessed." She just recently moved into a new house.

466
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 "I hope I get possessed. I hope there's a monster in the basement that takes over my soul."

467
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 It's like, "Dude, you are an idiot. You are actually dumb for saying so."

468
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 No, no, it's cool, man. What? What are you talking about?

469
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 She's an extreme example, right? She's a great kid, but she's also an extreme example of that.

470
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 You see people online a lot talk about, "I wish I had a paranormal thing happen to me."

471
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I believe in UFOs. I believe in aliens. I believe in ghosts. I believe in demons.

472
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 I wish something paranormal would happen to me.

473
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And these are the stories you come across where you go, "No, you don't."

474
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Like, I get wanting to see it because then it will give you some sort of proof.

475
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 First off, it doesn't. Like, I've seen a lot of ghosts. I didn't see a ghost until I was 18 years old.

476
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And you can't say that it necessarily--because you think you're going crazy, right?

477
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 When you first start seeing stuff, you go, "That's obviously not real. I must be going crazy."

478
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And even now, you know, I've had a lot of experiences. I've seen a lot of stuff.

479
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I think that you could explain a lot of it. Maybe not all of it, right?

480
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 But you could explain a lot of it away.

481
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 So it doesn't really necessarily give you proof. I mean, I think that if you believe it, that should just be good enough, right?

482
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 I don't think you need proof because you'll never have the concrete proof that you want.

483
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 But then you also invite stuff like this happening.

484
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 It's not anything to toy around with, whether it's my friend talking about getting possessed by a demon, which I still can't believe that that sentence even came out of her mouth.

485
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 To, "Oh, I wish I saw UFO. I wish I saw aliens." These things are not meant for human consumption.

486
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 They're just not. You have to wonder, like, are aliens and Bigfoot and ghosts and stuff like that, are the reason why they're so hard to pin down?

487
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 The reason why they're so hard for everyone to see is because the side effects of interacting with them are so bad.

488
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 You know what I mean? Like, the side effects of having these things in your life is a net negative.

489
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Because this baby got brain damage because this UFO showed up.

490
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 So it's, you know, be careful what you wish for, right? You don't know what type of thing you're inviting into the world.

491
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 You know, when you go, "Oh man, I wish I had had an experience." Oh, all these paranormal stories sound so interesting.

492
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Best case scenario, you see a light in the sky moving away that you go, "Whoa, no human craft could move like that."

493
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Nowadays with drones, that's almost, you basically got to shake hands with an alien, right?

494
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 I see lights in the sky every so while. I won't say all the time, but I see lights in the sky making weird moves.

495
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And it's probably a drone, right? But, you know, that's the best case scenario.

496
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 You see a light in the sky you can't explain. Stephen Greer is dropping flares from an airplane type of scenario, right?

497
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 You're like, "Oh, that's unusual. Now I have proof that there are lights in the sky that I can't explain."

498
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 The worst case scenario is you see something like this, right?

499
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Or, I mean, who wouldn't, you know, seeing something like this would be cool. You know, the baby brain damage is the thing you don't want.

500
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 You know, when you interact with these things, when you invite them into your life, we have no idea of the short or long-term consequences of these type of paranormal encounters.

501
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 I would argue that ghosts are pretty benign, but they're just, they're also super spooky.

502
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 You know, how many people, they say what most accidents happen in the house?

503
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 This is my conspiracy theory I just came up with. I literally just popped in my head. This is how my brain works.

504
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And we'll end it like this. This is a good insight into the mind of Jason Carpenter.

505
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 I literally just thought of this. You know how they say most accidents happen at home?

506
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And the deadliest places in your bathroom. What if, like you could say like, 50 to 70% of all bathroom fatalities are because you got scared by a ghost?

507
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Like you're in your house and you're taking a bath and then it's a nice relaxing bath.

508
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And then you're going, man, that sure was nice. And then you stand up and the ghost, the ghost just goes, boo! And you slip and fall.

509
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 And we would never know. And maybe you slipped and fall, but you just broke your ankle. You're like, good thing I didn't die.

510
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And then the ghost starts kicking you a couple of times in the head. It's like, I want a new friend. I want a new friend.

511
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 And it kills you. That is obviously a not well fleshed out thought. I don't know how it plays in the previous 40 minutes of the episode that I've recorded.

512
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 But I'll wrap it up like this. We just don't know what, oh, that was what I was talking about.

513
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 We don't know what the long term or short term effects are of having this paranormal. This baby got brain damage because a UFO showed up.

514
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 So think about that. The next time you're sitting at home and you go, you know what, I think UFOs are pretty cool.

515
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 I would like to see one one day. You selfish, you selfish jerk. The next time you have that thought, I want you to imagine a baby with brain damage, minor brain damage.

516
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Don't get too creepy, right? But the next time you wistfully think of wanting to have a paranormal activity, remember the story of baby Milo.

517
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 These things may be fun to look at, but only if you're not a baby.

518
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000

520

 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy. What a way to end an episode.

521
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 I was second guessing myself. I was like, what? What baby? Now I'm going to get a bunch of letters from pro baby advocates.

522
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 They're like babies can see UFOs too.

523
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 I go to their website and it's a bunch of pictures of babies going, "Ugh, you're all brain damaged."

524
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't have to listen to it every day. I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
