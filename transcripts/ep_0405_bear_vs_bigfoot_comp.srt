1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
 When a woman hitches a ride with a creepy trucker, you will guess what happens next.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,200
 And then we go hunting with three Indians in Canada. The year is 1938.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,200
 They're looking to just shoot some elk, bag a deer or two, but instead they find a bear

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,700
 fighting Bigfoot today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:35,700
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,500
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I think

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,140
 you guys can hear I'm feeling much, much better. Still a little short-winded, still can't

8
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,300
 breathe through my nose, but I'm A-OK on everything else. It's funny because I've been

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,700
 in self-isolation for about four days, four days in a row, but at a certain point it's

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,500
 like I gotta go outside, right? Going crazy in here. So I went and I don't have the coronavirus,

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,660
 okay? If I do have it, everyone in town has it. But anyways, I'm walking down the street

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,220
 and we're after the day where everyone flooded the Walmart, flooded the Rite Aid, the Walgreens,

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,300
 the Rosars, bought all the stuff. The day after everyone panicked. Walking down the street,

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,140
 everything's kind of back to normal. People at the coffee shop, people are buying overpriced

15
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,900
 toys. It's just the way Hood River is. But every so often I'd go and I'd have a little

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,380
 cough. I felt like the guy in a zombie movie who's gotten bit, but doesn't want anyone

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,820
 else to know that he's bit. I'd be like walking around and I'd be like, I have to cough and

18
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,620
 I'm like, I'm like duck into an alley and go coughing on my elbow. Did anyone see that?

19
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,900
 Expecting cops to come and trank me. And the next thing I know, I wake up in some isolation

20
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,500
 ward in China, but I am still taking the steps to self-isolate. I'm still doing all that.

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,580
 I have one more grocery run to do tomorrow and then I'm sitting well. I have a lot of

22
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,860
 stuff now, but I'd like to diversify my food and drink supplies. But I hope you guys are

23
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,700
 doing great. And honestly, other than like funny stories like I just told you, feeling

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,060
 like I was the traitor in a zombie movie, we're really not going to talk about the coronavirus.

25
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,820
 We're going to treat the coronavirus like I treat politics on this show. You get enough

26
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,940
 of that just turning it on the television set. Doesn't mean it's not important, but

27
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,540
 you get enough of it. So every show often I might tell a funny anecdote or two, but

28
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,780
 we're not going to talk about any conspiracy theories. I'm sorry. Actually, I'm not. I

29
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,420
 already read too much of it and it gets kind of overwhelms me and then I will just have

30
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,020
 to, you know, go and start playing balloon invasion. Just some flash came from like

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,100
 2011. It's like my comfy game or I'm playing Minecraft and stuff like that. So we're not

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,460
 going to talk about coronavirus unless a huge news pops up about it. I think there's major

33
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,420
 outlets that can cover that. We're going to cover fun stuff like our next story. Now,

34
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,820
 our next story is fun for us because we weren't involved in it, but there's multiple people

35
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,620
 suffered because of this story. Still very fascinating. And I want to give a shout out

36
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,940
 to a classic Patreon. I want to give shout outs to people who continue to support the

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,940
 show. Dave, Dave is one of the earliest Patreon supporters. Thank you so much for supporting

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,980
 this show. Really, really helps a lot. We're going to give you the end of your cancer where

39
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,260
 the Patreon. You can always help the show just by getting the word out. I always want

40
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,620
 to give a shout out to the people out there too who can't financially support the show.

41
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,500
 You can still help get the word out about the show. That helps a lot as well. But thank

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,460
 you so much Dave and all my other Patreons as well. Dave, take the keys to the Jason

43
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:34,100
 Jalopy. We are hitting the highways checking the highways, going down the road. I can't

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,040
 sing the rest of that. You guys don't even know what song that was, you lunatic. If I

45
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,940
 sing the rest of it, the video will get taken off YouTube. But let's just say some people

46
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,860
 are born to be wild. That's unrelated to the tune I was just singing. It's May 22, 2019.

47
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:59,340
 So very, very recent. Those are cars driving by. Or in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. And it's

48
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,380
 Interstate 24 in this woman's car, this unnamed woman. She should be named. We'll know why.

49
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,700
 I'll tell you why she should be named at the end of it. Her car is out of gas. Oh no. What?

50
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,740
 Did I forget how to operate a car? Actually no, I shouldn't make fun of her. I've had

51
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,460
 cars run out of gas multiple times. So we're not going to mock her. Because I'm empathetic.

52
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,980
 If I never ran out of gas, I would totally make fun of her. Cars are driving by her.

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:31,740
 People are nowhere. And then a truck, like a big rig pulls up. It slows down. I really

54
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,900
 got my sound effects on point today. I should get sick more often. Birds are chirping. Okay,

55
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,380
 that was pushing it. That was pushing it. Anyways, truck pulls over. The trucker's name

56
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:49,900
 is Roy Nelsch. Roy Nelsch. And he's like, "Hey ma'am, you need a lift?" Now, we're not

57
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,100
 going to make this an interactive episode. But if you were in this situation, your car

58
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,860
 is out of gas here in the middle of nowhere, a semi pulls up, and a guy offers you a ride.

59
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,980
 Would you get in? If a truck... I've had people offer to give me rides because I walk around

60
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,500
 Sacramento all the time. Did I tell you guys about this? I did tell you that guy was like,

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,340
 all super creepy and trying to get me in his car because he wanted to bang me. I know I

62
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,420
 mentioned that a couple episodes ago. You're like, "No, you never told us that story."

63
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,420
 Yeah, but I'm not going to tell it now. But anyways, sometimes I'm walking through the

64
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,780
 hood of a river and people will pull up and be like, "Hey, you want a ride?" And I'll

65
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,620
 be like, "No, stranger danger. I don't tell them that, but I don't get in rides with people

66
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,740
 I don't know." So anyways, you wouldn't get in this truck, right? I wouldn't get in this

67
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,980
 semi at all. I wouldn't get in a semi truck of someone I knew because I still think they

68
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,260
 were a serial killer. But anyways, this woman goes... I don't know what time of day this

69
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:46,140
 happened, but this woman goes, "Sure, I'll get in your truck." So anyways, you know what

70
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:53,020
 happens next, right? But you don't. I love this story. Truck is driving the ladies in

71
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,700
 the passenger seat and the truck driver's driving. And she needed to get off at this

72
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,220
 next exit. The truck driver's like, "Yeah, totally." Pass that exit. And she's like,

73
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,540
 "Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm supposed to get off that exit." He's like, "Oh, sorry, sorry."

74
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:15,660
 Passes the next exit. Now she's getting nervous. Sweatin', hearts racing. Pass the next exit.

75
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,420
 She starts freaking out because now she realized she made a mistake. Roy, the truck driver,

76
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,780
 pulls out a gun and says, "I'm gonna kidnap you and I'm gonna rape you." Now I don't

77
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,380
 know if he said it like that. He probably was a little more menacing and he probably

78
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,260
 like, "I don't know. I don't know if he built it up or sugar-coated it or something, but

79
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,700
 I don't know if he was that blunt." But the point is, is that now she's aware that she

80
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,940
 got into the wrong truck. She's gonna be kidnapped, which she's currently being kidnapped and

81
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,220
 raped and possibly murdered, right? He didn't threaten to murder her yet. Get in the sleeper

82
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,900
 part of the cab. She's a little like box room if you're not familiar with semi-trucks. Behind

83
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,420
 the driver's wheel, I'm apparently not familiar with semi-trucks, but you know where the driver

84
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,540
 wheel, you know the steering wheel, that's what it's called, the place where the driver

85
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,700
 sits and steers it. Behind him is like a bed. So imagine if it was Optimus Prime, it would

86
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,780
 be like in where Optimus Prime's head is. That's where the sleeper area is. So she gets

87
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,580
 back there and he, or he's trying to get her back there and she starts fighting. She starts

88
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,300
 putting up a fight. So he's driving the semi and he's fighting this girl and she gets the

89
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,060
 gun and she points it at him and pulls the trigger. Click. Now, it's unknown whether

90
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,100
 or not the gun was unloaded or the gun misfired. I think the gun was unloaded, honestly. I

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,940
 think if you looked at serial killers, like if you really like delved into serial killer

92
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,140
 stuff, I bet a lot of times they use unloaded guns because that's even more like you could

93
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,740
 have got away, but I tricked you with my gun. Serial killers are so just like mentally ill,

94
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,780
 mentally deficient, and they're so powerless in normal life that any amount of power they

95
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,060
 can get is what they crave. Generally, I've said this before, serial killers, serial killers

96
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,300
 are men, really, men whose dicks don't work. When you bake it down to that, it's men who

97
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,460
 can't get off unless they're killing people who remind them of their mom or the girl who

98
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,620
 broke up with them in high school and they never got over it. Like all serial killers,

99
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,740
 even the serial killers who are trying to bang their dad or the boy who broke up them in

100
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,940
 high school, like John Wayne Gacy, it's all, their dicks don't work. I should have said

101
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,060
 this is going to be an explicit episode. So they need every sense of power. So having

102
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,740
 a loaded gun and pointing it at someone is a sense of power, but tricking someone, being

103
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,780
 like, oh, you could have got away if you knew the gun wasn't loaded. Now you're chained

104
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,100
 up and you can't get away. I think, because John Wayne Gacy did that. He'd go, hey, you

105
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,100
 want to see a magic trick? It wasn't so much the fact that he overpowered the kids, it was

106
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,220
 the fact that he tricked them into their own demise. John Wayne Gacy would put handcuffs

107
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,180
 on and then put his hands behind his, or have his hands behind his back to the handcuffs

108
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,940
 on and then go, ta-da. Look it, I did it. It's a magic trick. You want to see how to

109
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,140
 do it. The kid would be like, yeah, sure. He'd get handcuffed behind the back and John

110
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,940
 Wayne Gacy would say, the trick is to have the key and then he would kill the kid. And

111
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,100
 so that's the part of that power trip. Now, John Wayne Gacy, his dick didn't work unless

112
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,940
 he was in that situation. He was a powerless little man. And that's this guy too. This

113
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,020
 guy had no respect for serial killer. We've done episodes on this in the past. Long time

114
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,820
 listeners are like, oh, I'm fast forwarding. I've heard this rant. But it's important because

115
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,140
 I think they're punks and I think they're little babies. They didn't get enough love

116
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,020
 in their life. So now they think that he can kill a couple prostitutes and then everything,

117
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,540
 now they're powerful. Whatever, bro. Disgust me. But anyways, let's get back to this piece

118
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,940
 of filth. He's driving on the road. She grabs the gun. She pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.

119
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,300
 He pulls another gun out and pistol whips her handcuffs her throws a blanket on her. Now

120
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,220
 I'm assuming at points he was at least slowing down the truck. I don't know if he was going

121
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,660
 60 this whole time, but and he actually is still driving because I know now remember

122
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,540
 this part. I remembered as an I looked over my notes. So he is still driving because what

123
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,620
 happens is she's handcuffed. She's underneath a blanket. She slips one of her hands out

124
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,980
 of a handcuff takes the blanket throws it over his head gets him in a chokehold and

125
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,500
 begins grabs the wheel and begins swerving the semi side to side across the freeway.

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,540
 At this point, the guy pulls over and kicks her out of the truck. He's just like this

127
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,860
 is not this whatever my intent was totally not worth being kicks her out of a truck.

128
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,380
 Her car is driving down the road and sees kind of what's going on pulls over and she

129
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,060
 goes oh my God you won't believe what just happened. He's like yeah it's all you get

130
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,700
 kicked out of a car and you have handcuffs on. Yeah yeah call the police. The police pull

131
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,820
 over this truck. The trial is going on now. This is why this is in the news. Roy ends

132
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,100
 up getting arrested pretty quickly and the trial is going on now. So we're getting all

133
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,940
 this information out about him. So first you're thinking maybe he's just some guy who can't

134
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:13,380
 get it up and then he decides to pull a gun out and try to like rape this woman or try

135
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,500
 to have power over this woman. What the police have found so they found in his property trucks

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,100
 and home and all that stuff a ledger full of the names of women and children which is

137
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,580
 weird I don't know how they'd have how they know the names are of children unless it was

138
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,140
 like Bobby or like current names like all the names are like Edward and Bella you'd

139
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,700
 probably be like oh there's a kid names but other than that they must be able to connect

140
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,980
 it to some living people. He had in his possession not only to have this weird ledger but he had

141
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:50,860
 10,000 images of child abuse. He had bloody underwear in his truck. He had chat conversations

142
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,940
 with other people offering children for abuse. Blood on his steering wheel. Blood on his

143
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,220
 driver's seat. Blanket with blood stains. Rope handcuffs. Stun gun. Which is funny because

144
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,100
 it's good that's not funny not owning a stun gun is funny but it's a good thing he didn't

145
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,700
 use that on her because it could have went somewhere else. So they don't know if Roy

146
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,580
 Nellish is some sort of sicko serial killer if he's just a sicko if he's a poser if he's

147
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:24,460
 a pretender who knows but he's currently on trial and hopefully he goes to prison for

148
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,860
 a long long time and I'll say this the reason why we should know that woman's name because

149
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,900
 that's pretty badass right that's badass like that woman and I could understand her not

150
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,260
 wanting to get her name out there but especially it's kind of creepy that he has like this

151
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,700
 chat combos with others offering these kids for abuse. Who are those other people? Why

152
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,740
 aren't they in jail? Hopefully they're headed to jail. Maybe she just doesn't want the attention

153
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,860
 to something like that but that's a hero. We applaud you nameless woman on Interstate

154
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,540
 24 because you took every step you needed to to survive and when you're dealing with

155
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:02,140
 a sicko creep like that you stopped him. His reign of terror ended because you were totally

156
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:10,860
 badass so that applause is not is not sarcastic really I mean you are an honorary member of

157
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,020
 the fluffle which is the name which is the scientific name for a group of rabbits. You

158
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:26,380
 are a honorary member of our patreon nameless woman that's weird. You are a dead rabbit

159
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:33,140
 radio person I don't know you guys get it I'm trying to instill an honor on her but

160
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,260
 I don't really need to because nature made her an awesome butt kicking person that's

161
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,820
 all the honor she needs. Anyways maybe she's traveling America now killing other serial

162
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,500
 killers so I thought that story is really interesting that guy's disgusting and I was

163
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,420
 able to go off on another serial killer rant because it's just been about 200 episodes

164
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,980
 since I've done that because I don't want to beat a dead horse but god I hate those

165
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,460
 guys. Let's go ahead and though and move on to our next topic so Dave let's go ahead

166
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,540
 and fire up the carbonar copter we're gonna park the Jason Jalopy we're gonna take the

167
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,140
 carbonar copter because we got a long way to go from Kentucky we're headed up to I

168
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,500
 think so I don't know I don't know where's that on the map we're headed up to British

169
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,540
 Columbia and we're going to a place called Chillowack now we're gonna talk about a very

170
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:23,100
 bizarre news article and when I first saw it I go hmm there's a large possibility this

171
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,260
 news article doesn't exist we've run into that a lot on this podcast where we find a

172
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,500
 news article and find out that it's forged or it's some viral marketing for some movie

173
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:39,140
 or something like that. This one I actually found the article it was published in a newspaper

174
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,700
 called the Chillowack Progress you can go to the link it's in the newspapers archives

175
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,620
 this article is 100% real whether or not the events are the article is real so that's

176
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,940
 a good sign because we've covered we've uncovered a lot of hoaxes on this show but anyway so

177
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,860
 we're headed up to Chillowack and that's in British Columbia we're going back to the

178
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:06,340
 year it's 1938 it's February 23rd 1938 and we're going to land and first we're gonna

179
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,340
 pick up a newspaper because this is an odd this this every news article should have a

180
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:17,420
 lead like this leads always the first paragraph of the article in a newspaper newspapers are

181
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,740
 written like an inverted pyramid the way they do it is the most important information is

182
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,180
 at the top in the further you read in the article the less important information gets

183
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,860
 it's very easy to edit and you just stop reading halfway through and then there's a thing called

184
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,220
 burying the lead where you have the most important stuff at the bottom but this one that's from

185
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,140
 journalism that's from a journalism degree but every article in the world should be written

186
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,900
 with this every article should just start with this paragraph actually but if you can't

187
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,700
 start with this paragraph you should start with this style here we go a terrific battle

188
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,780
 a fight for life of prodigious strength matched against savage ferocity between a hairy giant

189
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,900
 of the Sasquatch so right in the article they're just like oh yeah by the way Bigfoot exists

190
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:07,140
 this is a real newspaper this isn't a tabloid this is an actual newspaper still around apparently

191
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:14,580
 a terrific battle a fight for life of prodigious strength matched against savage ferocity between

192
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:21,660
 a hairy giant of the Sasquatch and a huge bear which after 10 minutes of wild struggle

193
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,780
 fury and rage dot dot dot I'm not gonna give away the ending they do there's a thing called

194
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,500
 burying the lead there's a thing just giving away the ending in the opening paragraph they

195
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,460
 should have just ended it there but that's how every article should be it's just one

196
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,900
 of that that just get your heart pumping so in this article it explains the story of

197
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:49,100
 these three Indians they're Harrison River Indians so let's join them in the forest this

198
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,140
 happens only a week before February 23rd so we don't have far to go back in time and there's

199
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,020
 three dudes walking through the forest they're hunting just hanging out they're looking to

200
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:05,220
 shoot living things in the brain and then consume the meat for energy and maybe make

201
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,380
 some new shoes I don't know but they're walking through this forest and they haven't shot

202
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,860
 anything yet they're really disappointed that nothing is dead they're like oh dang it and

203
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,140
 you know they're probably hungry too but anyways they can't find anything and then in the forest

204
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:30,500
 now in this article the main guy being quoted of the Indian I wanted to say Native Americans

205
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,940
 but they're in Canada the Indians is a guy named Jimmy Craneback he's being quoted in

206
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,060
 this article and he's saying they heard this roar they're dealing the forest they hear this

207
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:49,780
 roar birds scatter out of their nests fly off into the sky they hear trees they hear

208
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:57,540
 trees getting pushed like something's pushing against them they can hear the trees crack

209
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:05,260
 they can see the leaves sway through the tree tops okay maybe they didn't see that part

210
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,660
 but the fact is that they're not eight feet tall they can't see over the tree top but

211
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:21,700
 they hear the crack of tree branches snapping and loud thuds like two things are just going

212
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:29,540
 to war in the middle of this forest throwing each other up against trees a true battle

213
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:35,220
 of the beasts so these three dudes are like okay here's the thing that's super spooky

214
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:42,620
 right we don't want to go anywhere near that but it's February and bears are super hungry

215
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,300
 around this time they're really lean they're really angry and we got women in the woods

216
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,100
 doing the gathering thing we're doing the hunting thing women are like picking up mushrooms

217
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,900
 and collecting berries and all that stuff so we have to at least see what that is because

218
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,900
 if it's two bears fighting we'll go kill them both we'll bring home some bear meat or we'll

219
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,140
 just scare them off so everyone else here doesn't have to worry about getting mauled

220
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,380
 to death so the three men begin walking through the woods towards the sound of the commotion

221
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:20,460
 rock keep her in it again closing so now at this point when they get to the ravine they

222
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,260
 go okay now we got to make a decision because there's definitely two bears fighting here

223
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,340
 if they they look like they're gonna fall over the wrestling it's so it's such a violent

224
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,020
 match looks like they're both gonna fall under the river then they're just they're both

225
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,940
 gonna die and no good comes out of it let's shoot them now and then we can at least eat

226
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,580
 them they're both gonna die anyways but we get something so they raise their rifles they're

227
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,740
 ready to aim and right before they can take a shot one of the creatures one of the supposed

228
00:19:47,740 --> 00:20:00,220
 bears says something echoes through the forest then Indians look at each other and they're

229
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:08,700
 like oh it's the Sasquatch and they know that they said if he had said nothing they both

230
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,180
 would have been dead it was shot him both and then they'd been like oh no Sasquatch we

231
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,660
 shot this mythological creature in the brain I guess we're still gonna eat it I wonder

232
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,900
 if anyone's eaten Sasquatch I wonder if anyone's eaten Bigfoot meat that would actually be

233
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,260
 an interesting thing like you always have like the ultra rich like oh they inject the

234
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,700
 blood of the young or they're eating babies we should start a conspiracy theory that the

235
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,540
 ultra rich dying on Bigfoot meat that's why you can never find them because George Soros

236
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,860
 has eaten all of them he's like mmm I love the yeti but North American Sasquatch has

237
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,500
 a particular meaty they're all meaty it's meat but anyways new conspiracy theory the

238
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,180
 ultra rich eat Bigfoot they though realize that oh this is Bigfoot like we've heard

239
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,900
 about Bigfoot in our area let's not shoot them and let's start cheering they're like

240
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:07,060
 yeah go on Bigfoot go so with the cheering behind him Bigfoot turned like oh me feel

241
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:13,700
 better now me and oh get home turf advantage he gets the bear in a headlock a chokehold

242
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:21,860
 really and chokes him out they say that the bears tongue sticking out of its mouth as

243
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:28,700
 the Bigfoot got the chokehold even tighter tighter tighter and then finally the bear

244
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:37,580
 went limp and then died but that's not enough for Bigfoot boys he's not that type he's

245
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,780
 not just gonna choke you out and leave your body there he then picks the bear up and

246
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:51,860
 throws it into the river and the Indian dudes clapped as Bigfoot walks away so then they

247
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,580
 came back to town and they told everyone this story now whether or not that story is true

248
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,780
 who knows it does raise a couple interesting questions one Bigfoot would be beating the

249
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:11,020
 crap out of bears constantly bears are very violent territorial Bigfoot he doesn't really

250
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:17,140
 have many places to go he lives in the woods they're both giant I think if you and I we

251
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,700
 could do math on this or I could probably watch a YouTube video on this but a gorilla versus

252
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:31,420
 a bear I think the gorilla stronger I think the bear has like the big old claws all the

253
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,660
 muscle to punch through but I'm pretty sure the gorilla could to break them up and I don't

254
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,340
 think it would be a controversial statement to say that Bigfoot stronger than a gorilla

255
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,860
 so I think it at least would be a savage battle but you go Jason so we have the story of three

256
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,380
 men back in 1938 there's no evidence for this whatsoever it was printed in the newspaper

257
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,940
 it's a very entertaining article you can read it in the show notes that's I mean any three

258
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,460
 dudes can go walking through the woods the story is over a hundred years old there's a

259
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:11,900
 shh because that's not the only encounter of a Bigfoot and a bear and not only is that

260
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:18,180
 not the only encounter with a Bigfoot and a bear that is the encounter you would tell

261
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:26,100
 a little baby to put them to sleep oh Bigfoot is nice and chokes the bear out and throws

262
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:40,220
 them in the water let's go to Russia it's autumn 1989 we're in the Ark Ark Angel's

263
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:48,980
 Ark Angel's region in Russia there's a guy he's a professor of medicine his name is

264
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:58,540
 doctor in Alutsk collecting herbs in the middle of the forest so we have a story that's much

265
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:04,100
 more recent in time with a doctor supposedly assuming this guy exists well just exists

266
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,660
 for the for the entertainment value of the story we have a doctor who's most likely still

267
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:14,420
 alive and he's a professor of medicine again assuming that's the author didn't just make

268
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,820
 this up this is taken from a magazine a paranormal magazine called periscope it's written by

269
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:26,540
 Paul Stonehill but anyways doctor Alutsky is hanging out in the forest he's collecting

270
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,300
 herbs and stuff like that he's probably nerd this is his hobby he's like ooh a particularly

271
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,620
 delicious herb I heard this the herb that I'm supposed to eat but I don't want to throw

272
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:41,380
 up well I eat disgusting herbs oh yes we'll take a lot of these herbs are gross and he's

273
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,780
 sitting there he's by the river there's a it's funny because there's some parallels in

274
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,580
 this story this one the guys collecting herbs in the first story the Indians were afraid

275
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,340
 of other people just kind of randomly collecting herbs both of these stories take place by a

276
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,980
 river both of these stories involve a big foot and a bear that's where they end because

277
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,220
 in this story he's sitting there he's collecting herbs and berries and all that stuff and he

278
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:10,380
 sees a bear cub kind of walk out of the forest and begin yelping at him and he's like are

279
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,460
 you kidding me and then he hears also in the forest the mama bear coming and he's like

280
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:23,420
 okay herb mission herb mission is over I'm out of here all he has is a knife on him he

281
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,460
 gets up and he starts running because he knows that he it's already too late like he knows

282
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,380
 the fact that he can see the baby bear means that he's already in trouble and he begins

283
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,780
 running and then he hears a horrible sound from behind him his brain can't even register

284
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,220
 what could possibly be making the sound and under what circumstances would cause anything

285
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:57,460
 to make this sound and he turns around and he sees the mama bear now out in the open

286
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,960
 by the cub and standing behind the mama bear is a gorilla like creature that's two and

287
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,620
 a half meters tall eight feet tall he said it was a female had large fangs and it was

288
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:22,860
 holding the mama bear by its back legs it then in one motion with no visible effort hoisted

289
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:33,420
 the mama bear up holding it by its hind legs and then ripped it apart like a wishbone

290
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:41,700
 within a matter of seconds he said it was like nothing picking up this big Russian bear

291
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:50,060
 and just splitting it open fur and muscle and blood spilling out into the river it's

292
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:56,780
 funny because humans really anthropomorphize nature I was watching videos of bears in

293
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,620
 preparation for this story little bear cubs walking around I was like oh they look like

294
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,140
 dogs oh look at the way like I can see the way the mom looks at those cubs kind of looks

295
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,660
 like she's a little tired because you had a long day work she doesn't work she eats

296
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,140
 stuff but we put our emotions on stuff and I think we do the same thing with Bigfoot

297
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,060
 we see Bigfoot as always like this lost cryptid of this tribe or he's some species that hasn't

298
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,660
 been encountered but maybe they have rituals and they bury their dead and that's why we

299
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,060
 can't find them or maybe they get angry and they throw rocks if they exist they are beasts

300
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:38,300
 of the wild if they exist they fight every day against savage creatures it's less hairy

301
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,740
 in the Henderson's and more like dirty hairy like you would have to Bigfoot's would have

302
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,500
 to be violent by nature because nature is violent you may be able to live out in the

303
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,860
 woods as a human and grow a little patch of patchouli and eat that all day long and live

304
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,860
 off four leaf clovers and live a peaceful life but if you didn't even have a hut if

305
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:05,100
 you were living in a cave you'd be strangling ducks all day long and beating up raccoons

306
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,060
 and eating them that's what we used to do we become civilized and now we live in buildings

307
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:16,200
 and we just eat duck we let someone else beat it up at a farm but the Bigfoot's never

308
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,460
 become civilized like that definitely not in these two circumstances and because Bigfoot

309
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,620
 are already so hard to find they could be doing this 24/7 they could constantly just

310
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,460
 be walking through nature stepping on the backs of bobcats picking up skunks and like

311
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,140
 putting their hands up their butts and using them as boxing gloves is like punching elk

312
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:43,980
 in the face a Bigfoot is a wild creature and all the Bigfoot hunters and Squatch hunters

313
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:50,460
 and all that stuff desperately seeking Squatch all of them they hope they're gonna run into

314
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:58,580
 the Bigfoot that's like me Bigfoot me friend but the truth is Bigfoot's a big old monster

315
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,860
 and yeah it could be nice just like you may run into a bear and it looks at you and just

316
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,340
 like walks away and you go I had a good encounter with a bear not all bears are like that bear

317
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:14,300
 I met was totally fine and didn't maul me but you're really taking your chance between

318
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:22,100
 Bigfoot greeting you giving you a high five and Bigfoot grabbing your legs and as the

319
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:28,900
 Bigfoot is tearing you into you're the one making the horrifying noise that scatters

320
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:36,060
 the birds from trees and makes the rest of nature go silent be careful how their Bigfoot

321
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:47,340
 hunters you can't find them if he's right behind you

322
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,700
