1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Was the Hollow Earth theory proved this week?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,080
 And then we take a look at the mystery of Pauline Picard.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,280
 A young French girl who went missing was found and then found again today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,880
 [Music]

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. Just a quick update to a story we

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,520
 did a couple days ago, I think it was last week, where we were talking about conspiracy theories.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
 Basically YouTube is going to stop recommending conspiracy theory videos and things like that.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,520
 It'll have a minor impact on this channel. I do get flagged for talking about stuff even though

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
 I'm disputing certain conspiracy theories. The algorithm doesn't pick up on that. They just

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,880
 hear that I'm using those words. And in that little segment, I was talking about what is a

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,760
 conspiracy theory? When I was talking to my friend Mitcham, we started talking about anti-vaxxers.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,560
 At what point does that become a conspiracy theory where YouTube is going to start

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,680
 not recommending those videos? And he said, yeah, at what point does something go from

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,200
 being a quack medical practice to a conspiracy theory? Well, I just saw an article the other day

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,560
 where Facebook is actually going to stop recommending or they're looking at the option

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,240
 of stop recommending groups and pages that talk about the dangers of vaccinations.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,360
 Representative Adam Schiff wrote a letter to Facebook and Google saying that we're having

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,640
 real problems with measles outbreaks and it's on you guys to stop promoting this stuff. So again,

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,560
 I mean, this is where this is going. I'm personally not an anti-vaxxer. I understand a lot of people

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,120
 have concerns about the vaccine and they wish that it was broken up into three separate vaccines.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,760
 So I get it. I don't have kids. It's kind of an issue that I really haven't looked into that much

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,360
 because I'm like, I don't have kids. I don't have to worry about it. People believe this. People

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,560
 believe that. It doesn't affect me. But it's the slippery slope because my example was the

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,840
 Mueller investigation. If Mueller doesn't find any proof that Trump colluded, does that mean

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,320
 everything? All the podcasts talking about Russian collusion, all the YouTube videos about

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,280
 Russian collusion, all of the Facebook pages, are those going to not get recommended anymore?

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,400
 At what point, stuff like the keto diet, can people say that's quack medicine? It doesn't work.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,240
 Like at what point do the companies have to say, listen, we can't censor everything that's not

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,240
 mainstream? So yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out because really at a certain

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,080
 point there's conspiracy theories about everything. I think the thing comes down to the opponents or

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
 proponents of a particular conspiracy theory. How powerful are they? Because they could say,

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,600
 no, no, no, this isn't, is climate change a conspiracy theory? Is denying climate change a

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,200
 conspiracy theory? All of these issues will have to be handled in the next, really probably in the

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,520
 next couple months. The Facebook and Google and all that stuff leading up to the next election are

36
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,040
 going to have a lot of pressure on them to shut this stuff down in one way or the other. So we'll

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,200
 see. We'll keep covering the story. I think it's going to develop very interestingly. But we had

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,960
 some amazing news this week. And it really gives hope to the weirdos. Hope to the weirdos like me.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,600
 And we're going to specifically be talking about hollow earth. Now, so the idea when people use

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,520
 the term hollow earth is generally that the earth itself is hollow, that there's just an outward

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,000
 crust. And then inside there's a bunch of like spaceships flying around and octopus people and

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,320
 eight foot tall mummies dancing and all that stuff. And I think that's kind of the perception. And I

43
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,880
 think that's kind of misleading. Now that may have been the idea of what hollow earth was in the 1700s.

44
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,880
 But when I've talked about stuff like vast cave systems, and I don't generally use the term hollow

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,800
 earth because a lot of people think, well, there's not a giant hole in the earth that you can fall

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,000
 into and meet like mumra flying around ships powered by Vril. I don't believe in any of that.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,160
 But I believe that deep, deep under the earth, there are vast caverns and cave big enough for

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,600
 whole societies to live in. I believe that what we think I don't I never really bought the idea

49
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,840
 that the earth was a solid ball. I believe that deep in the earth, you would have huge open stretches.

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,120
 And I'm talking deep, deep, deep under the earth, hundreds of miles. You'd have these vast cavern

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,280
 systems. Whether or not those were accessible to us. I don't know. But I never really I was

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,320
 thought, well, how do we really know what the earth is made of the scientific idea. And it's

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,800
 funny because I was in preparation for the story I went to the Wikipedia article about hollow earth.

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,680
 And talking about the scientific debunking and stuff like that, they said, nope, the earth is

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,360
 completely solid. You have the upper mantle and the lower mantle and the molten core and the crust.

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,400
 Delicious jelly filled doughnut that we call planet earth, except instead of jelly, it's hot lava.

57
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,400
 But so what happened in 1994? There was a massive earthquake, the second strongest earthquake

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,320
 on record. And it wasn't just like, oh, no stuff shaking around. It was a earth quake. The whole

59
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,720
 earth shook during this event. And a bunch of nerds have been pouring over the results for the past,

60
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,120
 I don't know, what would that be 15? No, that'd be like 25 years, maybe. So this earthquake happened

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,200
 when I was in high school graduating year. Happened the year after Kurt Cobain died, maybe it was

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,000
 his ghost floating around, shaking stuff up like he did with the music industry. But anyways,

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,440
 so in 1994, the shine earthquake happened, they've been pouring over the results ever since. Now,

64
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,080
 last week, Valentine's week, it was a love letter to, like I said, all the weirdos out there. And

65
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,640
 I'm including myself in that definition. The report was released. And they're saying,

66
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,840
 well, we can measure the seismic waves because this earthquake, it's kind of bounces around the

67
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,560
 core and moves from one end of the earth to the other. They said, based on the seismic waves and

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,840
 the way they moved through this, through the planet, there are mountain ranges and valleys

69
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,400
 within the planet earth. This is a quote with stronger topography than the Rocky Mountains or

70
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,880
 the Appalachians. And this is at the 600 kilometer boundary. The deepest we've ever dug is seven

71
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,400
 miles down 600 kilometers, I think comes out to what, three feet? No, 600 kilometers is hundreds

72
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,520
 of miles down. And based on this study, they've had to update what they think the earth looks like.

73
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,640
 Now, of course, a bunch of other scientists are going to go, no, no, no, that's wrong and Pluto's

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,400
 not a planet, by the way. But they're showing a new model of the earth where we have the crust,

75
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
 we have the upper mantle. Now, there's always been a thing called the transition zone.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,280
 But old science was that the upper mantle and the lower mantle touched and there was a slight

77
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,160
 transition zone in between the two. And then after the lower mantle, you get into the core and things

78
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,000
 like that. But the new vision of what the earth looks like is you have the crust, that's us,

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,440
 we're the tasty crust. You have the upper mantle, which goes down a couple hundred miles. And then

80
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,880
 you have an incredibly vast mountain range that exists between the lower and the upper. And it's

81
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,760
 not like the mountains are pushing up again, there's room in there. We can tell from the way that the

82
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,840
 seismic waves were bouncing around and all the links are here. Check them out yourself because

83
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,040
 they'll have these new pictures of what they think the earth looks like. But it is basically a smaller

84
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,120
 version of the earth. We have the earth and you get a little couple go couple hundred miles down

85
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,640
 and you got all these other mountains and valleys and stuff like that. The earth has a hollow zone

86
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,680
 inside of it. It's not hollow in the middle. You can't, Jules Verne can't take his little

87
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,880
 blimp down there and fly around. Well, technically he could, but we don't have a way to get down there.

88
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:57,200
 And there's a theory that there's a ton of water stored up in mineral deposits in the lower

89
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,960
 mantle. And they think that if the water wasn't there, it like, it basically keeps the earth,

90
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,640
 like it filters up in the earth and signs us like, listen, we think that it's down there based on

91
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,440
 these mineral deposits that we know hold a lot of water. And now to be fair, a lot of these articles

92
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,600
 were, as I started to dig deeper into it, I was really trying to find some stuff, a lot of the

93
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,240
 articles were a little too smart for me using a bunch of five dollar words. But from what I could

94
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,960
 gather, there are rocks down there, there's minerals down there that do soak up water. And

95
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,280
 there are mineral deposits down there that they believe can release oxygen as well. Now,

96
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,600
 if that stuff sounds stupid to you, it's because I misread the articles, but possibly have water

97
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,520
 down there. And I don't see why not. You still have hundreds and hundreds of miles ago before you

98
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,600
 hit the molten core. You have water down there. Do you have oxygen down there? I tried digging

99
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
 through all these scientific papers. They're way too smart for me. So I can't say for sure,

100
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,440
 oh science thinks there's oxygen down there, but there's a bunch of room. Maybe there is. Or maybe

101
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,960
 there's not. Maybe it's a super dark place that has mountain. And let's not get into the, let's

102
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,440
 take a step back here. Underneath our feet, past the hot lava tubes, past the mole men, past the

103
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:23,760
 chuds, there are unexplored, never will be explored mountain ranges, valleys, caves, locked in eternal

104
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,960
 darkness. We will never, ever get to experience geography that exists on our own planet. And I

105
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,160
 always thought it was fascinating because you think, think about all the wonders under the

106
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,680
 ocean, not just the fish and stuff like that, but the geography, the amazing, the amazing chasms,

107
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,400
 the marinara trench for one. But these amazing geological formations that will never be seen,

108
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:53,360
 but at least we can pick them up with deep sea cameras, kind of seismic x-ray, water things,

109
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,400
 you know, topographical maps of the ocean, stuff like that. But now we're discovering that there is

110
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,960
 an entire new land base inside our planet that we'll never experience. Is it possible that there is

111
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,640
 a series of caves that lead down into there? Just connected here? Is it possible that you could go

112
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,920
 deep down enough into a cave and get your cobra drilling machine, cobra commander drilling machine,

113
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,360
 and then go through and hit another cave system and so on and so forth and then

114
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,320
 eventually get into this other area? I don't know that, but I do trust the old saying that nature

115
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,080
 abhors a vacuum. Where there is space, there is life. May not be life that we would recognize,

116
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 but life. My personal belief with UFOs and aliens is that they come from our planet,

117
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
 most likely from inside of our planet, I've stated that multiple times,

118
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,520
 and now for the first time just having that kind of half-assed idea. Now for the first time, science

119
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:00,640
 says there is room down there for something to inhabit. Doesn't mean that something's down there,

120
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,000
 but nature does abhore a vacuum. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here. I wonder if

121
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,640
 they have like a wonder. It'd be interesting because imagine if you were, imagine if there were

122
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,720
 aliens down there and they had built the ships that we see as UFOs and there is tunnels to come

123
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,080
 out through the ocean or through you know wherever, most likely the ocean. Imagine them coming out for

124
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,800
 the first time and not only seeing a blue sky and humans and cities and things like that, which they'd

125
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,080
 all be like, "Yeah, you know, there's water down there and we got people down there and we have

126
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:42,800
 cities down there." But for the first time seeing the stars, it'd be, I don't think there's anything

127
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,880
 that we can compare to that. We can think about going into the earth or going under the ocean,

128
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,680
 but things simply get black and dark. Imagine coming up for the, what's funny, I say the stars,

129
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,560
 I guess I should really focus on the main one, the sun. Imagine seeing the sun for the first

130
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,880
 time as a species and being like, "Well, that's all they say. Should have brought a poet. Should

131
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,000
 have brought a poet, Hollow Earth aliens." Probably would have had something more to say than, "Well,

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,520
 anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next story." Now our next story is quite grim and quite

133
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:24,480
 odd. Very, very bizarre mystery story and it's one of those stories where in the end nobody wins,

134
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,840
 which usually makes it the most grim type of stories. We're going back to the year

135
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,760
 1922. Let's go ahead and let's see. We're going to take the Jason Jalopy because we're going to

136
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,560
 have to keep a low profile because there's a lot of police in this story and a lot of suspects. So

137
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:48,240
 driving across the countryside of France, it's April, it's 1922 and we're going to Brittany,

138
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,920
 France, which sounds like a really hot chick, but it's actually a city in the country of France.

139
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,600
 Brittany, France. Brittany, France. It does sound like a hot chick though, doesn't it?

140
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 Now that was probably a bad way to start. They can't really find a segue to this part.

141
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,400
 Probably shouldn't have talked about the hot chick and what's coming. So there is a young girl

142
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,560
 named Pauline Picard. So Pauline Picard is a two-year- I actually didn't know Picard was a

143
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,680
 real French name until I read this story. I thought it was just something made up for Star

144
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,880
 Track. I mean, Spock's not a real name. Pauline Picard, a two-year-old girl, hanging out at the

145
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,200
 farmhouse with her family and she wants to go out and play in the field. Now I don't have kids again.

146
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
 I didn't know two-year-olds could talk very well, but that becomes a main point in this story.

147
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,600
 But the young girl, Pauline, goes, "Mama, mama, can I go? Can I go into the fields and play around?"

148
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,200
 And the mom's like, "Yes, Pauline, you can do that. Watch out for Klingons." The mom is like, "Yes, yes,

149
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,480
 wee-wee. Wee-wee. You can go and you can play." Now I don't actually know if they said "wee-wee"

150
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,280
 because they actually spoke a language known as Breton. I don't know if that's like an offshoot

151
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,800
 of French, like we have English and then we have whatever they speak in the South, in the Cajun

152
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,680
 land. Oh yeah, I gotta stop doing accents anyways. Pauline Picard's running through the field.

153
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,760
 And mom's like, "Oh, she's such a wonderful little girl." But then after a couple hours,

154
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,880
 the mom's like, "Dinner time, we're eating French food." And the Pauline doesn't show up at all.

155
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,280
 So mom starts to get worried, goes out looking for a confinder. The mom alerts the authorities,

156
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,960
 they come out there. I don't know where the father was at this point, but eventually he does show up

157
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,480
 at some point. They, actually that's interesting, that we'll get to the father in a second, but

158
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:43,600
 they go out. Eventually 150 people are searching the farm. No trace of Pauline. No trace at all of

159
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,960
 Pauline. And after three weeks, they're like, "She's not here anymore." Like this, sorry, sorry

160
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:58,880
 French mom, but we think she's gone. But so the search party ended. Like it started off strong

161
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
 and then people kind of started to peter out. It's kind of like when a concert's over, people show

162
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
 up, they're ready to go, and then after a while they get bored. But on the fourth week, a month later,

163
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,120
 after she disappeared, a police officer arrives at the Picard's door. I'm trying so hard not to

164
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,720
 make star-track jokes. The police officer has a photograph of a young girl that says, "Is this

165
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
 your daughter? We think we found her. Is this your daughter?" And the mama goes, "Oh my god,

166
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,640
 that's my daughter." And she gets the husband over there and he's like, "Oh my god, that's a

167
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,960
 daughter." And the cop's like, "Okay, calm down for a second." We found her 200 miles away. So there

168
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,760
 was another city 200 miles away. Now this is 1922. It's not like you were able to hop a plane back

169
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,640
 then and get stuck in the airport overnight. But she ends up 200 miles away. And the reason why

170
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
 the cops noticed her, because she was just wandering the streets of this town all by herself.

171
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,480
 Some accounts she was with an old woman in rags, but other people are like, "No, she just wanted

172
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,720
 to be by herself." Either way, it's creepy. So the... how do you just wear rags? Do they just

173
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,720
 mean like you had raggedy clothing? Or was she literally like wearing dish rags? So anyways,

174
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,960
 they never found out the truth to that. The old woman either disappeared or never existed in the

175
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,080
 first place. There was just a one rag laying in the gutter. But the cops do and the parents go

176
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:20,080
 and they go to this town 200 miles away. And they're like, "Oh my god, it's Pauline." But...

177
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,800
 And this is where... so we just have a missing child, a missing child found. But this is where the

178
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,200
 story gets bizarre. As they start to interact with Pauline, they notice a few key things. One,

179
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,160
 she does look just like Pauline. She's emaciated. She's a little starved. Now they're like, "Well,

180
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,080
 that's weird. Our daughter was chubby. You're not. You're not her daughter." But it did kind of set

181
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,960
 them off. But that wasn't the only thing. She didn't speak Breton. She didn't speak that language.

182
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,160
 She couldn't communicate with her parents and her brothers and their sisters. But when they

183
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,960
 brought Pauline home, the brothers and the sisters were like, "Pauline! Pauline, you're back!"

184
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,760
 Neighbors were like, "Oh my god, I'm so glad you found your daughter." Other people recognized

185
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,960
 her as Pauline. But she didn't speak that language. And she interacted with her mother and her father

186
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:16,880
 and her siblings as a child would a stranger. Is it happy? Hey, nice to meet you. My name's Pauline.

187
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
 Really, I think that's my name by the way. Let's shake hands. You got anything to eat? But it wasn't

188
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,640
 in the loving way that she interacted with them before or a child would interact with a parent.

189
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,480
 So something was off. Now, the police were saying, "Listen, it's quite likely that your daughter's

190
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
 going to be acting weird for a while because it's quite likely, unfortunately, that she was abused."

191
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,400
 And she might be dealing with some sort of traumatic experience. So she's going to act a little weird

192
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:50,880
 for a while. At one point, a guy, a friend of theirs apparently named, I don't know how to pronounce

193
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,520
 this, but I'm going to say call him Eve's Martin. It's that Y-V-E-S, Eve's Martin. Eve's Martin is

194
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:05,760
 hanging out of their house. And he goes, "No, so Eve's Martin, maybe it's Yeves. Yeves Martin

195
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:14,640
 shows up at the Picard home and they're drinking Earl Grey tea, hot." And he goes, "Is it true?

196
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,800
 Is it true that Pauline is here? That that girl that is walking around is Pauline?"

197
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,240
 The parents go, "Yeah." And he goes, "God is fair. I am guilty." And he runs away.

198
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,800
 I'll show you what. Parents are like, "What? A weird, weird, weird thing to say."

199
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:42,800
 Three weeks after she is found, a cyclist is riding around the property of the Picards.

200
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,840
 And they had a farm, so it wasn't like doing wheelies in their front yard, but he's bicycling

201
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,320
 around their area. And he sees something you don't ever want to see. He sees a child's body,

202
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:04,800
 a little girl's body. No head, no hands, no feet, and a little stack of clothing next to the body.

203
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,480
 The body wasn't wearing any clothes. And it totally freaks him out, obviously. He takes off,

204
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,960
 he goes, gets the authorities. The cops have to stand there for three days, because it takes

205
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,280
 that long for the prosecutors to get out there. I guess they had different divisions. They didn't

206
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,960
 have a SVU and a criminal intent. So the cops would enforce the law, but to get the detectives

207
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,200
 out there, they had to come from another area. So while they're standing there guarding this

208
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,920
 body, guarding the evidence, they notice there's something else there. There is a head, so they're

209
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,440
 like, oh, maybe it's the head of the little girl. I don't know why they sound so cheery about that,

210
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,920
 but at first they think it's the head of the little girl, but they're go, that head's kind of big.

211
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,120
 It was half eaten, half eaten head. So you can't really tell what it is. When the prosecutors get

212
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,360
 there and they start running all their investigation stuff, their tests, they realize the head is the

213
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,800
 head of an adult male. So we have a little girl whose head, I, this episode, sorry, this is kind

214
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,560
 of grim, I should have said early on, but you have a little girl with no head, no hands, no feet,

215
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,760
 and then a head, a half eaten head. It was not eaten by the cyclist. It was eaten by a bunch of

216
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:24,080
 foxes in the area. A half eaten head of a man, decapitated man. So now things are really starting

217
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,840
 to fall apart. The police immediately begin an investigation over who the bodies belong to,

218
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,560
 who the body parts belong to, and who the young girl is living in the Picard's house.

219
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:47,200
 The pile of clothes that are sitting next to the body, the mom of Pauline identifies those

220
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,440
 clothes as the clothes that Pauline was wearing the day she went missing neatly folded next to her

221
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,720
 body. The police say this area where this body was found was searched over and over and it was

222
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,600
 only 800 meters from the house. It wasn't way off in the woods. It was only 800 meters from the house.

223
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,440
 So this would have been an area that people were traveling through to and fro searching for the

224
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,680
 body. One of the cops was like, if I had dropped my wallet there, I would have found it. Like it was

225
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,880
 a place that they were constantly walking by. So they were working on the theory that these body

226
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:26,240
 parts were dumped recently. And this whole thing happened. So she went missing. Pauline was found

227
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,880
 in the city two miles away a month later. And three weeks after that, they find this stuff.

228
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:38,240
 They find a head that's been eaten and a body that hasn't. The police start looking at suspects.

229
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,600
 The first one obviously is Yev's. So they're like, oh, so a guy came in here and like freaked out when

230
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,000
 he found out your daughter was still alive. And they're like, yeah, it was super weird. So they go

231
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,880
 track him down. He got committed to a mental institution and was completely incommunicable.

232
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,320
 He was just blah, blah, blah. And the cops are like, we're not going to get anything from this guy.

233
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:07,040
 He's just lunatic. He's a nut guy. And obviously, I guess I should say this, huge news story,

234
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,560
 global news story at this point. Everyone is reporting it. Huge national news story, huge

235
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,080
 international news story. The media was like, the kind of the theory was that he had a traumatic

236
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,640
 brain injury shortly before his outburst. So they think that that causes insanity, not the guilt

237
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,920
 of this murder. Then there was the theory that the father killed her because the father had a violent

238
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,080
 temper. And that's why I was thinking it was interesting because he wasn't there when she

239
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,600
 went missing. But now that I think about it, he was probably just at work in the mill shop or

240
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,760
 making shoes or something like that. But he was a suspect for a while. They did have this

241
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,480
 suspect, this other suspect called Christoph Karamon. Christoph Karamon. The morning that

242
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,120
 Pauline, this is weird, the morning that Pauline disappeared, he was a first off, he was an umbrella

243
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,440
 salesman. Odd. I mean, either you're selling them during the rain and people are like, now just run

244
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,600
 to my buggy, or you're selling them during the summertime and being like, you never know.

245
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,880
 But apparently back then there was umbrella salesman. This guy sold them. So he was at the

246
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,440
 house eating breathics with the cards. The morning that Pauline disappeared. And he was always like

247
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,800
 cuddling her and like telling her, I'm going to find you a good home. And that's creepy. And

248
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:31,520
 somebody apparently overheard him saying that Pauline was going to go away with him and stuff

249
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,880
 like that. So creep check 123, like, guys, a total weirdo. But the police said that his alibi checked

250
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,360
 out. So he must have been going to an umbrella sales convention or something like that that morning.

251
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,760
 But he was acting like a total weirdo. And he was rubbing up on her and stuff like that,

252
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,800
 cuddling her. I don't know. It's all gross. Anyways, if it's not your kid, you should keep

253
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,040
 your hands off. But anyways, so he got cleared of it as well. So we're still back to the three

254
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:07,280
 main mysteries. Who killed the girl? A girl. They still don't know if it's Pauline. Who killed the girl?

255
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,360
 Whose head was next to her? And who's the little girl living in the house? Little two year old

256
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,560
 quote unquote Pauline Picard. Unfortunately, none of those questions are ever answered.

257
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:34,640
 But the parents say, we think that the body in the field was Pauline. And this little girl in our

258
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:43,120
 house was not. So they take Pauline Picard, they take her back to the town 200 miles away the

259
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,120
 way they found her from, give her to a bunch of nuns. They weren't just walking on the street. It was

260
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,840
 like a nunnery convent, convince the word I'm looking for. They say, here, take care of this kid.

261
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,800
 We don't know who it is, but it's not ours. They erected a gravestone and put the date of death

262
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:08,160
 for Pauline Picard as the day she went missing. And that was that. No one was ever caught for this.

263
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,040
 They never identified the head. They couldn't figure out why the body parts weren't found during

264
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,120
 the original searches. So they do believe that they were dumped after the fact. Imagine, just imagine

265
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,920
 that. And that there's been a couple other stories in true crime where someone's gone missing and

266
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,120
 then someone's found and it's not the correct person. That would be like losing them twice.

267
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,840
 She goes missing. You find her, you bring her home, you find out it's not her. And then you take her

268
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,400
 back. You're basically losing one child and giving up another one. The question, the biggest question

269
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,000
 to me is this. I actually have two big questions because I read the story multiple times and all

270
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,800
 the details are pretty much the same, but somebody would have had to dump those body parts.

271
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,760
 Most likely, most likely, because it was so close to where they set off the original search.

272
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:11,520
 Whose head is that? I think that is, to me, the big clue. A half-eaten head next to a body that

273
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,080
 hasn't been eaten really makes you think that these crimes took place at different points.

274
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,960
 Was there a half-eaten head somewhere and it was taken there? Did someone just have a

275
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,600
 calvocate of body parts? Was someone still out there brutally murdering children and adults

276
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,120
 and anyone who got in their way and just dumping their body parts? Was it a rage-filled incident

277
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,160
 from a father or a neighbor and they had to make it look like some sort of creepy

278
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,920
 ex-files crime to make it not look so domestic? Who knows? It's a true mystery, but this is what I

279
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:54,320
 think is really sad. I personally, and I have no proof to back this up, I think that the girl in the

280
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,400
 town 200 miles away was Pauline Picard. I think that any sort of differences in her personality

281
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:07,520
 or things like that could be attributed to physical or emotional or mental trauma. I find it odd that

282
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,040
 you could find somebody who looked like your daughter 200 miles away to the point where everyone in

283
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,840
 town is convinced that's your daughter. Where you're convinced that's your daughter, except she's

284
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,040
 just a little skinny, and to spend three weeks with this person and then you find another body that

285
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:32,240
 happened to have the same clothes on or off as the matter is and then decide that's not your daughter.

286
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,720
 I think if you didn't have a good understanding of how the brain works after trauma, you may think,

287
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,440
 "Well, that's weird. She's not speaking the same language and she's not acting the same, so this

288
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,360
 probably isn't the same person." If someone did that today, if someone went through a traumatic

289
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,120
 event and they used to be happy go lucky and now they're kind of swollen, you wouldn't say, "Well,

290
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,960
 that's not the real person anymore. The other person must have just never shown up. That's not

291
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,280
 my sister. My sister used to be real happy and now that horrible thing happened to her, she sits

292
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,000
 around in cries all the time. That's not my sister." It just seems like a bizarre overreaction.

293
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,480
 There was one other theory I wanted to touch on real quick before I wrap this up, but

294
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,760
 there was another theory to get this is just an urban legend in town. There was a rich couple who

295
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,640
 was due to get an inheritance, but to get the inheritance they had to have a child.

296
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:28,000
 And their daughter died, so they left that body in the farm and took Pauline, but then eventually

297
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,120
 Pauline got loose. It's interesting because that story makes absolutely no sense based on the facts

298
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,560
 we have. They'd have to come back to the place to drop the body off because it wasn't found initially.

299
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,040
 Why would they let Pauline get away if it was all part of the scam? But it's interesting to show how

300
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,160
 communities and people want so hard for there to be a reasonable explanation for something that

301
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,840
 they just kind of make stuff up. But the saddest part is, is that whether or not that is Pauline

302
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,960
 or it wasn't in the town, whether or not Pauline was really killed in the field or Pauline ended

303
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,720
 up 200 miles away in that town, she was an orphan, like they just found her wandering the streets.

304
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,920
 No one in the town claimed her as a daughter or a sister or a friend or anything like that. She was

305
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,120
 a young girl wandering 200 miles away. She was allowed to be taken 200 miles back to the Bacard

306
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,280
 home and no one was like, "Hey wait, no, no, no, that's my niece." Like she was completely alone

307
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,160
 in that town when she was discovered. The rag woman non-withstanding because we don't know if that's

308
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,040
 true. But even the rag woman wasn't like, "Oh no, no, no, she works for me." Like you have this young

309
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,440
 two-year-old girl found 200 miles away taken to another place. After three weeks taken back to

310
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,600
 that town, dropped off with a bunch of nuns. Two years later she died during the measles outbreak

311
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:49,760
 of 1924. Just a little girl, a little mystery. No one ever claimed her, no one ever loved her.

312
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,720
 She just existed and then she didn't. And if it wasn't for this mystery,

313
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,080
 the world would have never known she existed.

314
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:09,040
 Was she the missing girl or was she just a lonely child wandering the streets of a city

315
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,600
 looking for someone to care?
