1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 Cursed media.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,240
 It's a topic so many people love to talk about, including myself, but is it possible that

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,240
 the "cursidist" of media is hiding in the most unlikely of places?

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,080
 And then we travel to Orange County, California, to spend the night in a haunted hotel.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,520
 But what happens when we find out that the most bizarre hauntings aren't caused by ghosts

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,520
 or demons?

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,840
 It's something much, much closer to home.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:46,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,960
 I'm still a little under the weather.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,800
 I'm still deciding whether or not I'm going to work tomorrow.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,640
 But something that I've always decided is a good thing.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,840
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,480
 Everyone give a warm, fuzzy hug to Mustache.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 Woohoo!

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,720
 Yeah, come on in Mustache.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,240
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 Jump on our faces.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,160
 Mustache, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
 I do.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,120
 Just helps to read the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,800
 Now Mustache, long, luxurious Mustache.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,080
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,160
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,000
 We're going to fly all the way out to Owl City.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,640
 I ordered a COVID test on Amazon.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,360
 It hasn't shown up yet.

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,160
 I'm still complaining after the air.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
 You're like, "I don't want to be on this Durgible with you.

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,520
 Why'd you pick the most contained vehicle?"

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,440
 Well, you guys cannot breathe in the same sweat everywhere you guys are all slipping

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,680
 a puddle to sweat.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,000
 Mustache is this dripping wet facial hair just sitting there.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,440
 You guys don't have to stand next to me, but let's take a look at this conspiracy.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
 I thought this was real interesting.

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,240
 It popped up on the X-Board the other day.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,760
 This type of conspiracy, we've covered a ton of different times on the show.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,440
 It's one of the most popular conspiracy theories out there.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,120
 I think even if you just kind of have a passing interest in the paranormal and the world of

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,200
 conspiracy, you know the stories of cursed media and you know the stories of people,

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,920
 say, selling their soul for fame and power and stuff like that.

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
 We've talked about that before.

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,040
 We're going to take a look at a couple interesting examples of what people find as creepy or

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 unsettling music.

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,640
 I'm not talking about like some ghoul sitting at an organ deep in some gothic church.

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
 Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:34,320
 The

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:59,560
 story is

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,440
 these theories kind of popped back in the forefront and it was no longer that heavy

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,160
 middle group with the long hair and the loud guitars were secretly Satan worshipers.

56
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,120
 It was now that everybody was a Satan worshiper, that all of these pop stars from Rihanna

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
 to Katy Perry to those only ones that come off the top of my head.

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
 I'm obviously Britney Spears.

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,120
 You're not going to mention the one you love the most.

60
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,280
 Britney Spears got into it really late in the game.

61
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,440
 The theories that Britney Spears was hiding, Illuminized symbolism in her music didn't

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,920
 really start until her album.

63
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,040
 I don't remember the name of the album, but the song was "Dance Until the World Ends"

64
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
 or I think the song was called "Till the World Ends".

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,560
 That album was when people really started looking at it.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,760
 When she was the bubblegum pop, I mean you might be able to find some examples of YouTube

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,560
 videos saying that oops I did it again, had some hidden message or hit me baby one more

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
 time.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,400
 Like yeah, I've heard that if you play hit me baby one more time.

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,520
 It's like hey, Satan.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
 All that stuff right?

72
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,440
 She didn't really get like Rihanna is so closely connected to hidden messages in her music

73
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,280
 that in one of her videos she made fun of it.

74
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,680
 In one of her videos she labeled herself queen of the Illuminati.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,440
 She was so connected to this conspiracy theory she was acknowledging it.

76
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,160
 You can take any song and backmask it and find some weird stuff.

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,380
 Then there are some songs that you backmask and you're like there's definitely something

78
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,720
 wrong with this right?

79
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,920
 You can take any song and play it backwards.

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,560
 You can take my podcast and play it backwards.

81
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,800
 I'm sure you'd find hidden messages.

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,520
 But the end of the day would just sound like me talking backwards.

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,240
 But then there are other songs that have all the symbolism just in the song and in the

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,520
 video makes you go hmm.

85
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
 And then there are other songs that you when you backmask you're like ugh.

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,400
 It's like no this seems to be something a little more sinister here.

87
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,800
 But I remember I used to be really into this like I used to really watch those YouTube videos

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,940
 where they would like take down moment by moment of Rihanna's song like Umbrella.

89
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,700
 Or I would read articles on Vigilant Citizen that did this and they'd go like the Umbrella

90
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,340
 is Satan.

91
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,980
 The Umbrella in Rihanna's song is referencing Satan and she's like protect me.

92
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,980
 Protect me.

93
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
 I don't remember the lyrics.

94
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,020
 I don't think she was pleading for help from her Umbrella.

95
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,900
 But basically that's what Umbrella is doing.

96
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,220
 The idea of like if you watch the music video like this black liquid spillin' all over her

97
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,680
 and that's supposed to be Satan's love or something like that.

98
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,600
 I used to be really into that.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,800
 I used to be you obviously don't want to tone my voice I'm not so much.

100
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,760
 I do think people do hide imagery or again not so subtly hide imagery in their videos.

101
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,560
 I'm not denying that it happens but I just kind of got over it.

102
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,200
 You know Rihanna's a lovely woman right.

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,120
 I'm not a huge fan.

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
 There's maybe one or two songs of hers that I really liked.

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,160
 But when I see this thing pop up on the X board where they're talking about unexplainably

106
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,420
 creepy songs and one of the first songs that pops up is Owl City's song Fireflies.

107
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,700
 I was like what?

108
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,020
 Huh?

109
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,660
 It kind of took me aback because long time listeners of the show and that you'd have

110
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,420
 to be listening to this show like every episode since like episode 30 to...

111
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,420
 Oh you just heard one episode in particular it was a behind the scenes episode I did.

112
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:21,080
 Fireflies is the reason why I started this podcast.

113
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
 Had...

114
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,720
 Let me go into the conspiracy theory and then we'll backtrack there.

115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,040
 They're saying the song Fireflies by Owl City is there's something when you listen to it

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,360
 there's something wrong with it.

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,440
 Whether it's the opening synth chords.

118
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
 Whether it's the nonsensical lyrics.

119
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,760
 And they're saying the whole song is about someone trying to fall asleep but they can't.

120
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,900
 And does that mean is them falling to sleep part of falling slave to the matrix falling

121
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,340
 slave to this consumer lifestyle that's been built and since they can't fall asleep to

122
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,660
 it they're actually perceiving the world in a different way.

123
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:08,340
 Is it the fact that why would the song that was created by a quote very strange socially

124
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,660
 awkward Christian dude with insomnia unquote.

125
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,880
 How did this song go from a kid in his parents basement banging it out on a keyboard to going

126
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,120
 number one in 27 countries.

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,240
 That's a common trope when you look at a song and they go why is this song so popular.

128
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,280
 Why is this song so popular.

129
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,640
 There must be some sort of menacing message behind it because we all know that the world

130
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,960
 is controlled by these evil corporations or when I say evil I don't mean they're putting

131
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
 profit first.

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,260
 The monically controlled organizations why would fireflies be allowed to go number one

133
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,020
 in a world that is so corrupted by evil.

134
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,820
 And I found it fascinating and a bunch of people were chiming in they're like oh yeah that

135
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:56,460
 song always creeps me out there's something so unsettling about that song what does it

136
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
 mean.

137
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,800
 It doesn't make any sense.

138
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,040
 Who are the fireflies where did the 10,000 lightning bugs show up to give him hugs.

139
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
 We need answers.

140
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,900
 It might sound like I'm simping for Al City okay and maybe I am.

141
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,860
 Maybe I am but this is the least creepy song in the world.

142
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,620
 This is the least creepy song in the world.

143
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,620
 For me it is the opposite of that.

144
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,780
 I was so shocked that anyone would think this song is creepy.

145
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,980
 It's a good song but if you don't like it that's fine.

146
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,660
 If you hate it that's fine too.

147
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,180
 I don't care about any of that stuff.

148
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,700
 It's creepy.

149
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
 And this is so...

150
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,400
 Here if Al City's song Fireflies did not exist neither would this podcast.

151
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,040
 I will bet a dollar to a donut.

152
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,440
 I will bet 10,000 hugs from lightning bugs on this.

153
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
 This song didn't exist neither would this podcast.

154
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
 I've told this story before.

155
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,200
 I'm going to try to tell a condensed version of it now and I'll put an episode in the show

156
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
 net that kind of explains it a little bit more.

157
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
 Look I'm a creative guy.

158
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,420
 I just want to have my finger in some sort of creative project.

159
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,940
 I used to write all the time.

160
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,780
 Well actually no that was a problem.

161
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,020
 I used to talk about writing all the time and I'd spend all my day coming up with these

162
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,660
 stories and these whole novels and these characters in my head and the sequels for the

163
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,460
 novels and the franchises and the movie trailers and all that stuff and I would not put pen

164
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,960
 to paper.

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,820
 What?

166
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,940
 I wasn't doing anything.

167
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,300
 This podcast didn't exist.

168
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,780
 My entire life was this.

169
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,980
 I'd wake up in the morning miserable.

170
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,080
 Because I'd wasted the previous day and then I'd get up and I would get ready for work

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,400
 and I would go for work and the whole time I'm at work I would keep coming up with these

172
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
 stories.

173
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,360
 I'd be laughing so hard at the more comedies either but for whatever reason everything I

174
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,880
 wrote eventually became a comedy.

175
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,000
 I would be laughing and I'd be thinking I'll do that part.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
 It's going to be totally awesome when I finally write it down.

177
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,400
 I'd be at work and I'd be thinking about okay dude when you get home you're just going to

178
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 put pen to paper.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,840
 You're going to write just this scene.

180
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,760
 Even just this scene would be awesome.

181
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,300
 And I'd be thinking about this while I'm at work and I'd be walking home for work and

182
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,820
 I'd be like oh man dude I'm going to put pen to paper dude this is going to be dope.

183
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,220
 I got all this cool stuff and then I'd come home and I'd say but first dinner and a little

184
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,900
 light entertainment of course.

185
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,940
 It's been a long day at work.

186
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,620
 And then it would be 11 o'clock at night and I'd still have been watching YouTube for

187
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,100
 the past seven, eight hours right.

188
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,020
 And I would trudge into the bedroom miserable.

189
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
 And I would lay there.

190
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,560
 I would lay there open-eyed in my bed going man I wasted another day.

191
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,040
 I didn't get anything done.

192
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,360
 I wasted another day and I feel like I failed myself.

193
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,040
 I feel like a bum.

194
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,040
 Tomorrow will be different.

195
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,360
 I would convince myself as I tried to fall asleep.

196
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,840
 Tomorrow I will put pen to paper.

197
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,660
 I did that for years and years and years and years and years and they had me starting

198
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,440
 the podcast originally it was supposed to be a springboard into a creative writing thing.

199
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,260
 I was going to basically I don't know how I thought I was going to do this but I started

200
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
 thinking about doing a podcast.

201
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
 Oh I should do a podcast.

202
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,700
 I should do a podcast about this.

203
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,860
 I should do a podcast about that.

204
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,180
 I should do a podcast that's a springboard for this creative writing thing.

205
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,580
 La la la la la.

206
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,260
 And I still wasn't doing anything and I'd still walk home and I'd eat dinner and I'd

207
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,480
 watch YouTube videos all day long and I'd go to bed miserable.

208
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,880
 Whether I was trying to come up with something to write about well I had the ideas I just

209
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,880
 wasn't putting pen to paper or I was thinking about doing a podcast and it was kind of bouncing

210
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,200
 around on my head for like two or three years.

211
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,540
 One day I was walking home and on my iPod out of the thousand songs I albumed there

212
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,840
 1500 however many songs are there.

213
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,960
 Fireflies starts to play.

214
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,020
 Now it's another first time I'd ever heard that song.

215
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,100
 I downloaded it.

216
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,980
 I had it on my iPod.

217
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,340
 But that song playing at that moment it was divine.

218
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:17,220
 Not inspiration divine motivation.

219
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,140
 That song I listened to that song and I said when I get home I'm going to start the podcast.

220
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,880
 Whenever it becomes I'm going to start the podcast.

221
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,920
 I had a couple ideas kicking around.

222
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,280
 I had read some weird articles.

223
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,760
 I always read weird articles.

224
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,120
 And I let that song play on repeat.

225
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,640
 I listened to that song for half hour straight as I'm walking home.

226
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:51,360
 And I felt like if I listened to another song if I let this moment go I would come home,

227
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,060
 eat dinner and watch YouTube.

228
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,840
 I held on to that song and played it on repeat over and over and over and over and over again

229
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 until I got home.

230
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,260
 And I recorded the first episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

231
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,220
 At that time it was called The Fourteen Family.

232
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,140
 It was supposed to lead into a...

233
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,040
 I mean again like it was supposed to lead into a fictional writing project which never

234
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,540
 manifested.

235
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,920
 Shocker, right?

236
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,020
 I wasn't writing for whatever reason but then I realized I just I also want to just tell

237
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
 stories.

238
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,000
 That's what I want to do.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,160
 Whether I ever write again we'll find out.

240
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,280
 But I just because I'm telling these stories and I released those three episodes and I

241
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,960
 said let's see where this takes us.

242
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,320
 But that moment wouldn't have happened.

243
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,840
 I would still be that miserable Jason.

244
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,960
 Well I can honestly believe this.

245
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,240
 Had it not been for Fireflies.

246
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
 I think there should...

247
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
 Here's the thing.

248
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,240
 I don't think it's just the song.

249
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,760
 I'll agree with the original poster.

250
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,660
 I don't think it's just the song.

251
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,780
 I think it is something else.

252
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,040
 I think it is something else.

253
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,860
 Even the guy who wrote it, Adam Young, he is Al City.

254
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,060
 It's a music project he has.

255
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,660
 He talks about when he wrote it.

256
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,940
 He suffers from insomnia.

257
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
 He went down to the basement.

258
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,820
 I think he was living with his parents at the time.

259
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,860
 He goes down to the basement and quote.

260
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,200
 I was just sitting at the keyboard just fooling around.

261
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
 Not really trying to write anything.

262
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,040
 Over the next couple hours that song came together in the most natural way.

263
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,160
 I can't explain it.

264
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,560
 But it almost wrote itself.

265
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,280
 Now you'll hear that phrase bandied about by a lot of musicians.

266
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,040
 You'll hear it about books sometimes as well.

267
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,160
 The characters are just so alive I'm just kind of writing their story down.

268
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
 And that's true.

269
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,940
 But it doesn't happen all the time.

270
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,580
 And I think that when you do have those moments where the song just completely comes together

271
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,740
 you have to wonder are you as the artist composing that?

272
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,820
 Or are you as the artist reaching out somewhere else and putting this together?

273
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,980
 And the song went number one in 27 countries.

274
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,460
 It wasn't just a blip.

275
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
 Right?

276
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,340
 It was like Jason Ampley on the radio for like 10 years.

277
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,900
 But you know what I mean?

278
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,400
 How many people has this song touched?

279
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,520
 How many people have just heard the song and liked it?

280
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,240
 How many people have heard the song and not liked it?

281
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,320
 I didn't like it when it first came out.

282
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,160
 Honestly thought it was pretty dumb.

283
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,000
 But over time like a lot of pot music it just kind of wears you down.

284
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,080
 But again could that just be the...

285
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,360
 I don't think that this is just the song and it could be wrong.

286
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,360
 It could just be a song but what would make me think it's more not just a song is that

287
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:47,500
 it can both heal and enlighten and it can also repulse and disgust.

288
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,140
 And I never really thought of it like that as well.

289
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,140
 Something that's very powerful tends to have very powerful reactions.

290
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,500
 That'll be in said though.

291
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,340
 I wanted to touch on one other thing because I could easily go that song inspired me.

292
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,740
 This song makes you uncomfortable.

293
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,980
 Whatever.

294
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,500
 The back masking thing though.

295
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,100
 I wanted to touch on that real quick because as I was researching this stuff people started

296
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,120
 talking about creepy music and somebody posted a song.

297
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,000
 There's a YouTube channel called...

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,480
 You know you're getting quality content when there's a YouTube channel known as Skitso

299
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,680
 Like a Boss where he plays back masked versions of songs.

300
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,880
 Like I said you could play this podcast backwards.

301
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
 It's probably gonna say some weird stuff.

302
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,480
 You can play Britney Spears backwards.

303
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,740
 You strain your ears hard enough you're gonna hear some weird stuff.

304
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:46,100
 And then there are songs that when you hear back masks they're super unsettling.

305
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,820
 So in that vein so many people falsely to this podcast are gonna start having all these

306
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,740
 demons invade their dreams.

307
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:01,740
 In that vein I'm going to play for you the backwards version of Beyonce's Single Ladies.

308
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
 Not the whole thing.

309
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,180
 Not the whole thing.

310
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,260
 Just to snip it.

311
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,320
 It's unsettling.

312
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,660
 This is one of those things like there's just something about it that is unsettling.

313
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,960
 What's interesting is when you watch the YouTube video you'll see the quote unquote what she's

314
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,980
 saying backwards in the captions.

315
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
 They type it out.

316
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,700
 It'll be like "I'll say...

317
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
 I'll say..."

318
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,440
 And it's like an EVP.

319
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,400
 You don't know if that's actually what they're saying.

320
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,980
 Some EVPs are super clear.

321
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,860
 Some back masking is super clear.

322
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,480
 Sometimes it's just you have no idea what they're saying.

323
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,180
 You're putting these connections together but even if you don't know what the lyrics

324
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,460
 are because it's actually just the lyrics backwards.

325
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,140
 But I'm gonna play a little bit of this backwards.

326
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,140
 It's just unsettling.

327
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,140
 It's just unsettling.

328
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,780
 I don't think this song could get anyone off their buttons.

329
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,100
 Start doing a project of anything that would get them off their butt to shut it off.

330
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,060
 But now you have to listen to it.

331
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,780
 This is so atrocious and creepy.

332
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,780
 Let's check it out.

 [MUSIC]

337
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,780
 I always think it's interesting.

338
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,780
 I'm guilty of this too.

339
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,780
 Skitso Lykavos said in the description of this video, quote, "I've discovered Satanic

340
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,540
 lyrics in reversed songs.

341
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,420
 I'm exposing Lucifer.

342
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:06,380
 Yes, I have seen him with my own eyes in the summer of 2012."

343
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,140
 Okay I would love to hear more about that story.

344
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,140
 Really really would.

345
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,500
 I'd love to hear more about that.

346
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,220
 I do stuff like that occasionally.

347
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,900
 But I'm just very curious.

348
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,620
 It was Skitso Lykavos.

349
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,180
 Was he normal-brained?

350
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,860
 Just an employee before he had this meeting with Lucifer?

351
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,220
 What turned him into Skitso Lykavos?

352
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,620
 And actually I'm less interested in how you got your name.

353
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
 That was just a joke.

354
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,620
 I want to know about you seeing Lucifer with your own eyes.

355
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
 Fascinating story.

356
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,540
 Terrifying backmasking.

357
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,620
 An interesting story about the song that created the show.

358
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,500
 So maybe there is something behind it.

359
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,060
 Mustache, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

360
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,060
 We are leaving behind Owl City.

361
00:20:51,060 --> 00:21:00,180
 Take us all the way out to Orange County, California.

362
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,940
 Orange County, California.

363
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,740
 We're standing outside the Olive Hotel.

364
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,980
 I looked this place up online.

365
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,780
 It's even for the area it's in.

366
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,380
 I was reading all these reviews.

367
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,980
 They're like, "Listen, we get it.

368
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,460
 This is a bad area.

369
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,540
 You're staying here because you wanted to go see the Dodgers player."

370
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,300
 All the reviews are like, "This area is really bad.

371
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,980
 If you're from out of town, I hope you're aware of that."

372
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,980
 However, they said that Olive Hotel is centrally located.

373
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,300
 So you can go to all of these theaters and you can go to all of these restaurants.

374
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,420
 So for $78 a night, which is a steal.

375
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,140
 I don't know if it's still that price.

376
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,900
 A lot of these reviews are old, but for $78 a night, you could do worse.

377
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:49,700
 But the reviews also say, "I hated this hotel even though it is centrally located and there's

378
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,020
 only $78 a night.

379
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:00,260
 The staff was rude and the place was infested with packs of rats and cockroaches everywhere."

380
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
 It's all bad, right?

381
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
 That's all bad stuff.

382
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,740
 I think if I went to a place and the staff was really cool and nice and there were packs

383
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,900
 of rats, I wouldn't be there.

384
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,780
 One person wrote in their review that they were looking underneath the bed in the hotel

385
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,260
 room, which that's your bed.

386
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,500
 If you're in a seedy hotel room and you go, "Oh, I'm going to look underneath it."

387
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,420
 If you dropped your medicine bottle or your glasses and they fall underneath the bed of

388
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,980
 a hotel in a bad neighborhood, it just counted as a loss.

389
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,020
 You're looking underneath those glasses to drive.

390
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
 Call an Uber.

391
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,580
 She pulled out a giant dildo underneath the bed.

392
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,340
 Again, that's kind of on you.

393
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
 Those are all the bad reviews.

394
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,860
 I did find one good review.

395
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,580
 If 5 out of 5 stars, this was the whole review.

396
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:52,100
 5 out of 5 stars, quote, "You can find hookers everywhere."

397
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,500
 I mean, yeah, I guess that would be 5 out of 5 stars if that's what you're looking for.

398
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,700
 Orange County Seedy Hotel centrally located.

399
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
 I don't know.

400
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,180
 I don't want to get sued by these guys.

401
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,540
 The staff does seem pretty rude.

402
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,060
 They might come after me.

403
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,900
 They're like, "Follow him, packs of rats."

404
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
 They're each armed with a giant dildo.

405
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,700
 But that's not why we're here.

406
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
 We're not here.

407
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
 I just thought that was funny.

408
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,060
 I love reading bad reviews of places.

409
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
 That's not why we're here.

410
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,660
 The story I'm about to tell you is actually kind of...

411
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,500
 When we play it out, when we extrapolate it out, it might be one of the craziest stories

412
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,220
 I've covered on this podcast, honestly.

413
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,500
 According to theshadowlands.net, which is a big ghost website we look at, and I found

414
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,300
 this story a couple other places as well.

415
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:46,620
 In one of the rooms at the Olive Hotel, if you check into this room and you're getting

416
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,140
 your stuff put away right, you're like, "Oh, dang it, you're losing your collectible marvels

417
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,140
 that are all over all under the bed."

418
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,580
 You're like, "Oh, man, I'll start collecting something else tomorrow."

419
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,780
 When you go to put yourself in the closet, you open the closet door and there's a man

420
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,860
 hanging there.

421
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
 And this is an apparition.

422
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,340
 I mean, there's a chance that you might actually find a guy who just hung himself at this hotel.

423
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
 Don't discount that.

424
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,340
 If you open the door and there's a dude hanging there, don't be like, "Oh, it's just a ghost.

425
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
 It's just a ghost."

426
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,180
 And then you go to sleep and some guy just hung himself.

427
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,700
 You're like trying to sleep and missing persons, police are knocking on the door.

428
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,540
 They're like, "Hey, is Gary in there?"

429
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
 You're like, "What?

430
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
 No.

431
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,300
 Hey, officers, can you give my marvels from under the bed?"

432
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,500
 If you open the door and you see a man hanging, don't always assume it's a ghost, right?

433
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,620
 You're like, "Oh, it's boring."

434
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,620
 But this is a ghost.

435
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,220
 This isn't a man who just recently killed himself at the Olive Hotel.

436
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:45,780
 Apparently, for the past 50 years in this particular room, when you open the closet

437
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,580
 door, you'll see a man hanging there.

438
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,540
 And it looks like it doesn't happen every time you open the door, because then you'd

439
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
 be like, "Ah, ghost!"

440
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,820
 And you shut the closet door and you're like, "Oh, but I gotta put my stuff in the closet."

441
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,020
 So then you open the door back up, you're hanging the shirts, you're like moving his

442
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
 body to the side.

443
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
 He's kind of like swinging back and forth.

444
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,380
 I think it just appears there once, and then you freak out and he's gone.

445
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,660
 Most ghosts, if you see a ghost walking out the hallway, you're like, "Ah!"

446
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,700
 And then it just freezes there.

447
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
 Like it dissipates.

448
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,420
 It goes into a puff of smoke or whatever.

449
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,420
 This guy, that would be so annoying because you would really need to use that.

450
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,100
 You're all trying to iron and the body's swinging there and knocking the iron around.

451
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,140
 You're like, "Ah, you're ruining my shirt, dead man."

452
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,460
 So I think it just dissipates.

453
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
 You see it once and it dissipates.

454
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
 "Oh, here's the thing, dude.

455
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
 Here's the thing."

456
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,180
 If you opened your closet door and you saw a dead man hanging there and then he poofed

457
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,980
 away to a puff of smoke, you're still not putting anything in that closet.

458
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,980
 You're not like, "Woo, that was close.

459
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,380
 I thought I was gonna have to put my suitcase next to this decaying ghost."

460
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,660
 No, you just wouldn't put stuff in there.

461
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
 You just wouldn't put stuff in there.

462
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,220
 I think you'd be like, "My suitcase can sit in the middle of the hotel room for all I

463
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,980
 care."

464
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,860
 And I read that and I go, "Okay, this guy, he hung himself 50 years ago in this closet

465
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:04,260
 of this hotel room and to this day, if you're unlucky enough to stay in the olive hotel

466
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,100
 in the first place and then you get this room, you open the door, you'll still see him hanging

467
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
 there."

468
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
 And I thought about it.

469
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,380
 I go, "Okay, it was so funny because this was one of the stories I was researching while

470
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,460
 I was eating bagels the other day at Freshies, the best bagel shop in town."

471
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,380
 I'm sitting there and I read that and all of a sudden I had an epiphany.

472
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,780
 I had an epiphany.

473
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,180
 Both of these stories I picked for a reason to be on the same episode because both of

474
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,060
 them are about this podcast in a way.

475
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,660
 First one obviously was about the inspiration of the podcast, but the other one I've talked

476
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,580
 about this several times on the podcast, right?

477
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,300
 I've talked about this several times on the podcast.

478
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:48,700
 When I first moved in, I sensed the presence of an old man in my apartment.

479
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,220
 He was just wearing his underwear.

480
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,380
 But other than that, he was fine, right?

481
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,180
 I didn't get a super sense of menace from him.

482
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,260
 I was obviously unsettled because I didn't expect to find an old person in his underwear,

483
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,420
 even mentally, right?

484
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
 Like I didn't see him.

485
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:14,820
 At that moment, I just had the sense that there was this old man in my closet in his underwear.

486
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,380
 And I thought it was weird when I moved in that there is a deadbolt on the outside of

487
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,380
 the closet.

488
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,620
 So that was odd, right?

489
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,540
 Who normally has a deadbolt on the outside of their closet.

490
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,620
 And I never got any sort of ill feeling from this spirit.

491
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,500
 But I didn't like the idea of something else being in here.

492
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,340
 So at the time, there was a little shop in town called Sparkling Creations that sold gems

493
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,700
 and rocks and sage.

494
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,580
 My friend Lana used to work there.

495
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,980
 And I went there and I bought some sage and I was going to smudge the place.

496
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,780
 I was going to smudge out the spirit.

497
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,860
 I was basically going to make the light the sage up and kind of walk around the house

498
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,860
 and purify the place.

499
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,460
 And I remember I, this is just like with the podcast, I kept saying, I'll do it tomorrow.

500
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
 I'll do it tomorrow.

501
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
 I'll do it tomorrow.

502
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
 And I did that for like a year and a half, like two years or whatever.

503
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,940
 There's like a spirit hanging out in my place.

504
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,980
 And I was like, I'll get rid of it tomorrow.

505
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
 That lazy.

506
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,260
 And I remember one day I finally go, okay, that's it.

507
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,500
 I'm going to definitely smudge the place out tomorrow.

508
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,540
 And it wasn't because I was feeling creeped out.

509
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,140
 It wasn't because I was starting to get unsettled.

510
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,060
 I just didn't like the thought that I wasn't the only one here.

511
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,100
 And I remember I finally go, I'm going to smudge it out tomorrow.

512
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,860
 Like I had become resolute.

513
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,220
 And that while I went to bed, I would sleep out on the couch.

514
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,220
 I would sleep out on the couch and I have a bed.

515
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,580
 That's just a weird Jason quirk.

516
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
 I can have a bed.

517
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
 It's totally fine.

518
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
 I'll sleep on the couch.

519
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,060
 And in the middle of the night, I woke up and I remember it was one of those things.

520
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,700
 It was like, I don't, the terminology is weird.

521
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,020
 It's not, it wasn't a waking dream.

522
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,780
 I was half awake maybe.

523
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,860
 Like I don't really know how to explain it.

524
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:56,540
 But anyways, I woke up and standing in my kitchen doorway with the light on back lighting

525
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,900
 him was the old man standing there, still in his underwear.

526
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
 It's still totally fine.

527
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,220
 Just walk around his underwear.

528
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,220
 And he's standing there and he goes, hey, dude, I didn't know I was scaring you.

529
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,500
 Like I didn't know that I was bugging you so much.

530
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,060
 There's my bad.

531
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,260
 Just please don't smudge the place.

532
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
 Please.

533
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,380
 I'm, you know, like, don't do that, please.

534
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,140
 And I remember not like responding to him or anything like that.

535
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,740
 And just kind of telling me this.

536
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
 And I did come to the conclusion.

537
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,700
 I was like, yeah, it's not bugging me, whatever it is, it isn't bugging me.

538
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,180
 It's never done anything weird or anything like that.

539
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,940
 So I decided not to smudge the place.

540
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,500
 I decided not to smudge the place at all.

541
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,100
 Now I've seen other stuff in my apartment.

542
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,500
 There was an episode, I've done a whole episode on my haunted apartment.

543
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,660
 There was like a bloated purple corpse sitting on my couch one day.

544
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,340
 I've only seen him that one time.

545
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,900
 That was super bizarre.

546
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,140
 But as far as the old man goes, you know, I've never had any problems with him.

547
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,140
 And that was that, right?

548
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,660
 I never smudged the place.

549
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,900
 He's never left.

550
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:07,660
 What's interesting is, so I record this podcast in the haunted closet, which I've stated

551
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,780
 is where I sensed him in the first place.

552
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,540
 But even when I first saw him, again, he wasn't like this Medicine spirit.

553
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:23,140
 I personally don't believe whoever inhabits this closet hung himself or killed himself

554
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,860
 in any sort of way.

555
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,420
 He's just in the closet.

556
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,100
 And I'm reading this story and I go, that's super interesting.

557
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,700
 Why is he in the closet?

558
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,300
 Why out of all the places you can inhabit in this apartment?

559
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,940
 Why do I most strongly associate him with the closet?

560
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,940
 Why is it when I'm recording stuff, I pick up weird noises in the closet?

561
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,860
 Because I don't believe that he ended his life in here.

562
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,780
 I do believe it's likely someone put a deadbolt on the outside of the closet door because

563
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,300
 they were also getting that feeling that there was something in the closet.

564
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
 I do believe that.

565
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,420
 I could be wrong.

566
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,660
 But I don't believe that he killed himself in the closet.

567
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,620
 I don't believe that he took his life here.

568
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,300
 So why would he be in here?

569
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,540
 And I started to think about it.

570
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,820
 I have some really, really different views as far as the afterlife goes and things like

571
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,380
 that.

572
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:25,660
 I do not believe in a linear system of reality.

573
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,980
 I know that I started recording this podcast X many minutes ago and it's been playing this

574
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
 long.

575
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:37,460
 I don't think it's as long as a linear rule set we use to view reality, but I don't really

576
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:48,540
 believe that all of reality is linear.

577
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,380
 I believe it's possible that when you have someone who feels like they are reincarnated

578
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,620
 of a past life that they could be living that exact past life right now and the life of the

579
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,420
 21st century person and 14 or 15 more lives and other time periods, they're all happening

580
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,980
 at the same time.

581
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:17,340
 I believe that if you have a child who dies and then that child goes to heaven and then

582
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:26,780
 you live another 30, 40 years on earth, that that child has missed you for a single moment.

583
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,700
 As far as they're concerned, you're there right with them.

584
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,660
 They're not up there kicking bricks for 30 years, looking down, waiting for a mom to

585
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,660
 come home.

586
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:42,820
 Everything happens instantly and that opposite ends of the time stream and tangled up a thousand

587
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,740
 million different ways all at the same time.

588
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,300
 And taking all that into account when I'm thinking about the old man in the closet, I

589
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,580
 start thinking, I don't believe he killed himself in here, so why would he be in here?

590
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,500
 Of all the places he could possibly be, why would he manifest in the closet?

591
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,380
 And remember, there are different ways for ghosts to be here.

592
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,060
 You could be psychic pain.

593
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:17,060
 Somebody dies a violent death and now their image is there, but it could also be the opposite.

594
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,900
 You could have somebody who's experiencing strong emotions of any kind, great emotions,

595
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,180
 of passion, creativity.

596
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:36,540
 They're also infusing the area with their art, with their love.

597
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:44,140
 What if I'm the man in the closet?

598
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:54,180
 I spent so much time in here talking with you, telling these crazy stories, looking at all

599
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,980
 these amazing events, things we can analyze and joke about and get scared of.

600
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:07,420
 I've spent more time in this closet than probably anyone has ever been in this closet before

601
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,740
 since this building's been built in the 50s.

602
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,420
 You could take the longest resident who's ever lived here.

603
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:21,940
 They have spent one-tenth of the amount of time I've been in this closet.

604
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:32,100
 And I'm creating this thing that I love to share with people, to share with you.

605
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:42,300
 And I sit in here and I think and sweat and speak.

606
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,460
 I've infused this closet with my energy.

607
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
 100%.

608
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,100
 I've been in this closet more than anyone else has ever been inside this closet.

609
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:00,700
 What if the old man in the underwear, also a spoiler alert, I'm very rarely wearing all

610
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:06,380
 my clothes because it's so hot in here, I'm always recording these episodes in my underwear.

611
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,540
 Enjoy drawing that fan art.

612
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,340
 What if I'm the old man in the closet?

613
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:26,100
 What if I put so much energy into this closet that it left a mark in the past as well as

614
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
 the future?

615
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:32,700
 Because I don't think the old man died in here.

616
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,660
 What would the old man have been doing in this closet by himself?

617
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,140
 What if I'm the ghost?

618
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,380
 I'm seeing my own spirit.

619
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,260
 It's a theory I have because I can't think of why else he would be in this closet.

620
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,860
 The other theory we have about ghostly hauntings, and we'll wrap it up like this, generally

621
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,260
 it is a psychic recording.

622
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,780
 It is something you can interact with.

623
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,220
 This is something I've definitely been able to interact with like you could talk to me.

624
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,780
 It would be a sense of talking to my own ghost.

625
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,540
 We have the idea that to dismiss that theory, there's also the idea that hauntings can

626
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
 come down.

627
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:20,100
 They can only manifest in specific geographical locations due to formations in the rocks or

628
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:26,340
 the water underneath or nearby or just some sort of lay-lined type of psychic energy.

629
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,460
 It could be that this closet is a nexus for something and the ghost isn't me.

630
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,940
 It's far less of a bizarre theory than that.

631
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,100
 Just an old man ghost who can manifest in the closet because that's just where everything

632
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
 kind of crisscrosses.

633
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,820
 That's why we pick up the EVPs, that's why we see the dog walking around back and forth

634
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,180
 outside occasionally, doesn't have an all the time.

635
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,660
 The closet's definitely haunted.

636
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,820
 The closet's definitely haunted.

637
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,060
 The question is by what?

638
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,300
 I don't think it's an old man who killed himself in the closet.

639
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:59,100
 So why is he manifesting in the closet?

640
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,780
 I've spent more time in this closet than even the people who built this closet.

641
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,900
 You know what I mean?

642
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,260
 Most people are in and out of their closets.

643
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,540
 I'm in here for at least an hour a day.

644
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,180
 Sometimes much longer than that, right?

645
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,300
 Sometimes much longer than that because the episodes get edited down from what you hear.

646
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,420
 I've been sitting in here and I'm thinking and sweating out to keep adding that.

647
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,700
 I'm leaving my residue everywhere.

648
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,140
 What if I'm the man in the closet?

649
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,460
 What if I'm the ghost in the closet?

650
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,140
 And the fascinating thing about that theory too is imagine I move on from this place physically,

651
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
 right?

652
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,140
 I move to another house.

653
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,300
 I have a professional recording studio built into my basement.

654
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,340
 But that wouldn't negate all of the energy I've spent here.

655
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:50,380
 It wouldn't negate the piece of myself that I've pulled out and created this space and

656
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,660
 soaked these walls with my own energy.

657
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:01,380
 So it still is me, even though I've moved on.

658
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
 I don't know.

659
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
 It's super...

660
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
 I read the thing.

661
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
 I read the...

662
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,140
 That was the whole story about Olive Hotel.

663
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,580
 Man found hanging in the closet.

664
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,140
 I thought it was super creepy.

665
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,380
 But then it made me think, if this guy didn't kill himself in this closet, and I don't think

666
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,660
 he did, why is he coming out of the closet?

667
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,460
 Why am I sensing him in the closet?

668
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:30,060
 And then I thought, what if I am the man in the closet?

669
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,620
 The world of the paranormal isn't as cut and dry as a lot of people think it is, right?

670
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,060
 It's not just about ghosts are caused by this.

671
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,420
 Shadow people are caused by that.

672
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,020
 Ghosts are this, aliens are that.

673
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:48,820
 It truly is a world of mystery and wonder.

674
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:54,220
 That's why I love exploring it every single day with you guys.

675
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,220
