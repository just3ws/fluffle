1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 Are zoos using fake animals?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,000
 And one of the worst school shootings you've never heard of today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,700
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,700
 Hope you're having a great day.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,500
 I'm having a great day. It's a little hot.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,300
 I know it probably sounded like a broken record at this point.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,700
 Actually, that doesn't make sense because broken records don't really play.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,700
 I guess this saying should be... I sound like a scratched record.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
 Got a dentist appointment I gotta go to in a bit.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,200
 They're just gonna go in and do a little checkup, shave some teeth down, something like that.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,700
 I don't have a problem going to the dentist. I know a lot of people do have a dentist problem.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,700
 I've had some pretty rough dentist experiences. Apparently when I was a kid, I don't remember this,

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,700
 but the dentist slapped me. My brother saw it and got all mad.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,700
 Because I was being loud and like crying right in his face.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,700
 Dental slapped me, but that was back in the 70s, so maybe dentists were more surly back then.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,700
 Then once I went to the dentist and I had diarrhea, and that was a nightmare.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,700
 Because I was having a tooth replaced. I was having like a cap.

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,700
 My tooth had fallen apart in the back and they had a build, like a new tooth around it.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,700
 And the whole procedure took maybe about... Normally would take maybe an hour and a half, but you know, you have diarrhea.

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,700
 So it's gonna take a little bit longer. I had to keep getting out of the seat to go use the restroom.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,700
 At one point I get up and the dentist was like, "Don't bite down. There's a metal rod sticking out of your gum."

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,700
 I haven't built the tooth up, the metal rod hasn't been measured. Don't bite down, whatever you do.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,700
 So I go into the... I'm just blood spilling out of my mouth. I got like cotton all in there.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,700
 I felt like I was a cinnabite from Hellraiser. It was horrifying.

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,700
 But you know, again, he got it done. He was professional. I think it would be nightmarish for most people,

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,700
 but you know, it's just a procedure. I don't have any trouble going to the dentist.

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,700
 My teeth aren't the greatest anyways, but still, I don't have a problem going to the dentist.

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,700
 So before we get started, I think I have to also address an error from yesterday's episode.

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
 It's linen, graduate fool. That was the name of the episode.

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,700
 It got super hot in my apartment yesterday. So I said, "I'm gonna go to the library and just edit the episode

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,700
 and edit and upload and all that stuff. I'll do it at the library,"

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,700
 which has really good air conditioning that's right across the street.

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,700
 In fact, of all my stuff, now obviously all my recording equipment is at my apartment.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
 So I go across the street and I'm listening to the episode.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,700
 I'm getting all the links together for to post in the show notes.

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,700
 And I kept looking for the book Stalingrad, Siege and Symphony, and I'm looking all over for it.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,700
 Nothing's coming up. I can't find it. I'm getting really frustrated because I was like,

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,700
 "I know I just saw the..." I just saw the link when I was at my apartment. Why can't I find it now?

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,700
 The reason why is because the book doesn't exist. It's not Stalingrad I was talking about.

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,700
 It was Leningrad, two completely different cities and two completely different parts of the country.

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,700
 Now, I know I get a lot of words mispronounced. I know I mispronounced a lot of words, I guess is the right way to say that.

42
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,700
 And I know sometimes I can flub my facts, but letting that one stand, I was like, "I just can't let this..."

43
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,700
 No. People will be pulling their hair out if I keep calling it the Siege of Stalingrad.

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,700
 And this book and the Symphony and people will be like, "This guy is a total idiot."

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,700
 But I had none of my recording equipment there. All I had was my laptop mic and of course I'm in a library.

46
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,700
 So how do I fix that? I just begin recording again and start going, "Leningrad."

47
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,700
 "Leningrad." "Leningrad." Trying to find the best take and people are kind of looking around like,

48
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,700
 "What the heck is this guy doing? I'm sitting in my headphones on."

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,700
 On my laptop, just tube nobody. I don't have a phone in my hand. I'm just going, "Leningrad."

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:44,700
 So I had to say it low enough that not everyone was disturbed and the FBI don't think I'm talking to my handler over in Moscow.

51
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,700
 So anyways, if you listen to that episode, you know what here, I'll play it.

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:55,700
 If you missed that clip, because people jump into the podcast every so often, again, I don't expect everyone to listen to every episode.

53
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,700
 I'm appreciative if you just listened to one episode. I have a great time just knowing people are enjoying the show.

54
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:07,700
 But I'm going to go ahead and play a quick, quick clip from yesterday's show if you didn't hear it, so you can hear exactly what I'm talking about.

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,700
 If you're out of toothpaste. Now here's the thing, Siberia is blisteringly cold.

56
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,700
 I read a book about the siege of Stlin and Grad. I think it was just called "Stlin and Grad." It was an amazing book.

57
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:24,700
 So the story was about a symphony about Stlin and Grad and the orchestra in the city under siege by the Nazis

58
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,700
 trying to get people together to perform that symphony.

59
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,700
 So there we go. That's what happens when you don't double check your research.

60
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,700
 And again, I knew it was Linengrad. Absolutely, because I pulled the book up while I was talking about it.

61
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,700
 But when I packed everything up, I had cleared that link out. I figured out it would be no problem.

62
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:55,700
 And I'm glad I did, because otherwise the siege of Stlin and Grad is not where your butthole froze shut. That was the siege of Linengrad.

63
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
 Let's go ahead and get started here.

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,700
 Generally, I try to start off with a lighter story first, or kind of the more whimsical story first.

65
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:11,700
 But today, because the story we're going to cover is so disturbing, I'm going to go ahead and go in with the lead, the big story of the day.

66
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,700
 And that is the school shooting one.

67
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:22,700
 One of the conspiracies on the conspiracy list that we've been investigating this podcast was something called the 2006 volleyball incident.

68
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,700
 It's one of the ones that gets a lot of requests, because it's just such a bizarre combination of words.

69
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
 What is the 2006 volleyball incident?

70
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,700
 So of course, that was something that I got requested a lot of something I was personally curious about.

71
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
 What is the 2006 volleyball incident?

72
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:49,700
 What I came across, obviously, links below, the theory is that there was a shooting at a volleyball game back in 2006, and 14 people were killed in South Dakota or Nebraska.

73
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:59,700
 And then everything was covered up by the media, and people's minds were erased by MKUltra, or it was a PSYOP that they were testing before Sandy Hook.

74
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:16,700
 They wanted to see if they could get people to believe something that never happened, and once they realized the test was completely wiped everyone's minds, or it's the Mandela effect that it actually happened, and we don't remember it because we shifted into another universe.

75
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,700
 All of those are fake. None of those happened.

76
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:30,700
 2006 volleyball incident is just a word soup. If some words were put together to make people curious about the phrase, there's absolutely no proof that there was a volleyball shooting in 2006.

77
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,700
 However, so we're going to debunk that, unless, of course, more information comes forward.

78
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,700
 But out of all the research I did, so of course, like I said, I always approach these conspiracies as if they're real.

79
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:53,700
 So I began looking for an incident in 2006 involving a shooting. I came across a school shooting that I had never heard of that should be one of the ones that is constantly talked about when we talk about this era.

80
00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:03,700
 Not only does it have elements of school shootings, all this horrible stuff that comes to school shootings, it has children being killed, it has alone gunmen, it has someone coming into school with multiple guns.

81
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,700
 It also has elements of sexual assault and Me Too, the Me Too movement.

82
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,700
 So I'm surprised we don't know about it. I'm sure there are listeners who know about it.

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:22,700
 And I may have heard about it at the time, but the fact that it's disappeared into the consciousness of America is quite odd because it's actually very, very horrifying.

84
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:30,700
 It's a very horrifying event. So what happened was back in 2006, that's how I found out about this, there's a high school called Platt Canyon High School.

85
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:40,700
 Now there was a man who they saw driving around the parking lot. It's just, you know, typical normal September morning.

86
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:50,700
 A couple students saw a man parking looking at the school. They didn't really think anything of it. They thought it was a little suspicious, but not enough to warrant any sort of attention.

87
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,700
 And they'd see the car drive away and then, you know, a while later another group of students would see someone sitting in their car looking at the school.

88
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:04,700
 Eventually this man, Dwayne Roger Morrison, you know why they put middle names into serial killers?

89
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:14,700
 So there's not confusion with people. So because I'm sure there's a lot of Dwayne Morrison's, but there's not many Dwayne Roger Morrison's.

90
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,700
 That's why generally serial killers will have their middle name. Not all the time. I don't know Jeffrey Dahmer's middle name or Ted Bundy.

91
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,700
 Some of them are just so tapped into the consciousness that it's when it's reported. It's like that.

92
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:37,700
 But if you notice most serial killers and school shootings, stuff like this, infamous people, I should say, they put the middle name in there to kind of so everyone doesn't get lumped in.

93
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
 Not everyone has to change their name.

94
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:47,700
 So at 11.40 in the morning, Dwayne walks into the high school, walks into a classroom, apparently at random.

95
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:57,700
 The teacher asks, "What are you doing here?" He fires a shot in the air, tells the teacher to leave, tells all the boys to leave, and separates the groups of girls.

96
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,700
 Picks out seven of them, tells everyone else to leave.

97
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,700
 The cops, of course, everyone, there's a lockdown at the school. Everyone's supposed to stay in their classes. This guy's like in his 50s. He's not a student.

98
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:22,700
 He's in this classroom, all the schools locked down, the police show up, the police are trying to negotiate with him, and all get into the weird conspiracy stuff at the end here, because there's some really weird, complicated stuff going on here.

99
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:38,700
 Anyway, so he's in this room with seven students, seven female students, lines them up on the wall, begins walking up to each one, they're lined up, puts a gun to their head, pulls them to the middle of the classroom, sexually assaults them.

100
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:46,700
 Walks them back to the wall, grabs the other one. Does that seven times?

101
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:57,700
 Imagine being in that line, and they're facing the wall. They don't know what's going on, but the one girl said she could figure that out because you could hear clothes being taken off.

102
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,700
 And then, of course, eventually it became her turn. Horrific. The waiting of that.

103
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:12,700
 The actual event, obviously, but the terror also comes from waiting for that. And there's an interesting thing there as well.

104
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:26,700
 He says he has a bomb in his backpack. He has three things of C4. The police are being held out. The police are outside. They don't rush the place because he has hostages. This isn't an active shooting event.

105
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:36,700
 And what happens is, it started at 10 in the morning, so now we're close to about 12.35, so this is not an instant thing. This is an ongoing negotiation.

106
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,700
 The cops are talking to him, trying to get him out of the room. He begins releasing hostages because he's communicating with the police.

107
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:55,700
 The hostages come out and say, "Yeah, he's sexually assaulting us in there." So at that point, the sheriff's like, "Okay, we have to storm. We have to get him out of there. We have to storm it."

108
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:08,700
 So the police make the decision to rush the building, rush the room. They get in the room. He's hiding behind two of the girls, like a coward. Like a piece of shit.

109
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:19,700
 I really kind of made that makes me mad. He's hiding behind the two girls. The police are getting ready to shoot him. He opens fire on the SWAT team.

110
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:32,700
 One of the girls, Emily, was her name, was, so you know where this is going. There's gunfire coming right over her. She runs.

111
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:45,700
 He then takes the time to take away from aiming at the police to shoot the girl. And he puts the gun in the head and kills himself. Like a coward.

112
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:53,700
 So the young girl was life-lighted out and eventually she didn't make it. She passed away.

113
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:07,700
 Now, that's horrifying. That's absolutely horrifying. And you know, that's that story. And again, that story is something that I'm surprised at.

114
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:19,700
 If my goal in life was gun control or ending the patriarchy or anything like that, this would be something I'd be talking about all the time. How is this lost in consciousness?

115
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:26,700
 And you could say, "Well, we've just had so many school shootings. We've had so many school shootings." But I mean, this is particularly horrifying.

116
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:35,700
 What's interesting about this story, though, what makes it different than just this true crime event that happened that people have forgotten about,

117
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:43,700
 is the conspiracy angles to it. There's a lot of stuff we don't know about this. We don't know why he did it.

118
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,700
 The police have never said what he was asking for in the negotiations. The police have not revealed that.

119
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:58,700
 The police have revealed that he wanted to leave, but even in the reports the police will say, "We don't want to talk about the whole length of the call."

120
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,700
 And that might be standard procedure. But still, I think it's weird because they would play into his motivation.

121
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,700
 We don't know why he picked that classroom, and that's fine. It was probably just a random thing.

122
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,700
 There's been allegations that he was like a porn addict, and that's what led him to this.

123
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,700
 When they got his backpack, it didn't have any bombs in it. It was full of duct tape, a knife, and sex toys.

124
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:27,700
 So he came prepared to do this. But why? We don't know.

125
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 I searched all—before I recorded this, I wanted to really give it a good college try to find out why he did this,

126
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,700
 figuring out if there was something about this. I found out he wrote a letter. I had to find that letter.

127
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,700
 I absolutely had to find that letter. And after a bit of research, I found it.

128
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:56,700
 No mention of girls, no mention of schools. What seems to have precipitated this was he bought a Harley-Davidson motorcycle,

129
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,700
 and he feels he got ripped off because he bought all these aftermarket parts, and they were subpar.

130
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:09,700
 And in this letter, there's two elements to the letter. One is he's really mad at the Harley-Davidson people,

131
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,700
 and he was calling them up and arguing with them to the point where they actually called the police on him.

132
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,700
 And the letter makes it look like he's going to go shoot up the Harley-Davidson place,

133
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,700
 because he's like, "Hey guys, he wrote it to his family members, and he goes, "I don't know what I'm going to do,

134
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,700
 but I know I probably will never see you again." And the Harley-Davidson people ripped me off.

135
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,700
 That's the second part of the letter. The first part of the letter is he goes to say,

136
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,700
 "I know you guys are my family, but I want to let you know my father abused me.

137
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,700
 He abused me my entire life. I never had a childhood. It was absolutely terrible."

138
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,700
 And what a key point of that letter is was the waiting was the worst part.

139
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:58,700
 The physical and the emotional abuse was terrible, but knowing he was looking for me,

140
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,700
 knowing because he would hide in these places in the house, he would try to avoid his father,

141
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,700
 he'd go to school. That was his only safe place. He says, "For six hours a day, I was completely safe,

142
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,700
 but I knew when I got home, my father was going to abuse me." He doesn't really go into what the abuse is,

143
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,700
 but he says the waiting is the worst part. Knowing that he's looking for me is the worst part.

144
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:27,700
 And how does he spend his last two hours on the planet Earth? Making people feel that fear.

145
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:35,700
 It probably made him feel extremely powerful. Not a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a cyclo, for that matter.

146
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,700
 Battlefield Earth was... I was watching clips of that last night for whatever reason.

147
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:47,700
 But yeah, his last moments on Earth was sharing that fear and that terror with just girls.

148
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:54,700
 And in the only place he ever felt safe, he turned into a place of hate and anger and fear.

149
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,700
 Getting back of the world. For what?

150
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,700
 I mean, he had his own pain, and I feel sorry that anyone has to go through that,

151
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:12,700
 but the key is not to share your pain. Crazy. So yeah, I would be curious to hear what those conversations were with the police,

152
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,700
 what was actually going on. You know, really the girls in the room would remember,

153
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,700
 but I hope they've forgotten about this event as well. It's doubtful.

154
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,700
 But I hope everyone's kind of moved on with their own life and kept going on.

155
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,700
 But that's that school shooting. I came across that while I was researching the made-up 2006 volleyball incident.

156
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:40,700
 Instead, I found 2006 Platte Canyon shooting. Which to me is more horrifying than a one girl getting killed.

157
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,700
 This story is more horrifying than 14 people getting killed in the government erasing everyone's memory

158
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,700
 and shifting us into another reality. Because one deals with actual human evil,

159
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,700
 and the other one deals with fantasy elements.

160
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,700
 Okay, so that was a rough one. I thought it was rough at least.

161
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,700
 I don't like hearing about stuff like that, but I think it's important to kind of talk about and go into.

162
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,700
 It was fascinating. Human, you know, the way his mind was working.

163
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,700
 So let's get to a fun story. Because I came across this, this morning actually,

164
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:26,700
 and I just thought it was adorable and funny. And I can kind of see how their heart was in the right place, honestly.

165
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,700
 I don't think it's as bad as people think it is.

166
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:36,700
 So, in Cairo, there's a zoo that has these two zebras.

167
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,700
 They're, you know, hanging out in the little zebra enclosure, and kids are like, "Look, mommy, a zebra! Look at it! It's a zebra!"

168
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,700
 And the mom's like, "Yeah, it's a zebra, honey."

169
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,700
 Well, one guy was looking at him, and he's like, "Uh, that's not a zebra."

170
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,700
 And he's kind of looking at it, and he gets his camera out, and he's like, "Hey, man, take a picture. Take a picture of me."

171
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,700
 "Take a picture of me next to this." "Zebra."

172
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,700
 The picture's online. I'll post the links, but this is not a zebra.

173
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:21,700
 It is a donkey, a white donkey. I'm assuming it was white with black paint striped on it, or black ink, and the ink is all smudged, so it's obviously not a zebra.

174
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,700
 And so, you know, of course, people are like, "Hey, what's going on? Why do you have this fake zebra?"

175
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:40,700
 Now, I don't have a quote from this zoo, but there was a zoo in Gaza that also had painted donkeys to look like zebras, and they said, "Well, we couldn't get zebras because of the Israeli blockade."

176
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
 "Couldn't get zebras in." And this was the quote.

177
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,700
 "The first time we used paint, but it didn't look good."

178
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
 So, apparently, yeah, they used some sort of ink.

179
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,700
 And then the quote goes on to say, "The children don't know, so they call them zebras, and they are happy to see something new."

180
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:03,700
 See, you know, little kids don't care. I guess if you're an adult and you're like, "Oh, that's not a zebra," but you know, it's like a Santa Claus thing.

181
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,700
 Like, little kids just want to see a zebra.

182
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:22,700
 And I mean, that's adorable. If you pay to go to the zoo and you see a donkey and it's painted as a zebra, I mean, are you really ripped off because all the other animals, you get to see the lion, and you get to see, oh wait, the lion is fake too?

183
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:34,700
 So, in China, so all give the people in Gaza, yes, they can't get zebras in because there's a blockade.

184
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,700
 They paint a donkey fine. And Cairo, it's a little less forgivable.

185
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,700
 In China, okay, so here's the thing. You have a donkey painted with black stripes, it's a zebra.

186
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,700
 In China, people want to go see the lion. They want, you know, they're going to go see a lion here.

187
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:03,700
 It was a dog. It was a big, hairy dog. Just hanging out, walking around. It looks nothing like a lion.

188
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,700
 Donkey, zebra, I can kind of see it. The height's a little bit different.

189
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,700
 Probably would have been better off getting a horse and painting it, but that's probably harder.

190
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,700
 This is clearly a dog. It is a Tibetan mastiff. It's a large, hairy dog.

191
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:34,700
 So, they were saying that they had put it in the lion cage as a safety issue, but they don't really say if it's, like, was the dog not being safe?

192
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
 Or was there a lion roaming around or whatever?

193
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,700
 Then they found a dog in a cage labeled wolf. Okay, I can kind of see that.

194
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,700
 Then in the leopard cage, there was a white fox.

195
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,700
 So basically that's not a zoo. That was all in one zoo.

196
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,700
 So you go to see the lion, it's a dog. You go to see a wolf, it's a dog. You go to see a leopard, and it's a fox.

197
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:14,700
 Now, the Chinese park are like, "Oh, no, no, no, we just have to kind of move stuff around. We're not short on funds, but we're trying to breed a dog and a wolf for whatever reason, and we just want to kind of move and stuff around."

198
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,700
 This was just a bad day for everyone to show up.

199
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:26,700
 I just think it was funny, they had a quote here. I can't say the person's name, not because it's rude, but because I can't pronounce it.

200
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,700
 And it's also like a Twitter handle or something like that.

201
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:44,700
 This quote I thought was funny. "If this works, why would people even bother to go to the zoo? Children will cry out. Look, a lion came out at the side of a Tibetan mastiff. Or look, it's a rat seeing snakes on the street. This is totally absurd."

202
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,700
 The rat and the snake, I mean, if you're trying to pass off a fox as a leopard, maybe, yeah.

203
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:58,700
 And I can see that from a learning perspective. If some kid sees a Tibetan mastiff walking down the street, they're like, "Oh my God, there's a lion. Everyone run, run." I get that.

204
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:09,700
 Donkey, zebra, I'm cool with. Dog, lion, no. Fox, leopard. That's a rip-off. That is a rip-off.

205
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:16,700
 And then someone else says, "Why doesn't the zoo simply put the zookeeper in a cage with the sign gorilla on its gate?" Why not?

206
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,700
 We're actually going to be covering the history of human zoos coming up.

207
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:27,700
 And I thought about saving this story for that, but after the volleyball story, I just needed to have something a little more light-hearted.

208
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:36,700
 And I think just the fact that little kids are having a good time while their adults shake their fists at the nearby zookeeper, and he just shrugs his shoulder and be like, "It's a job,"

209
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:43,700
 because he's eating a banana and he's climbing in the cage. I wanted to contrast it with something a little bit lighter.

210
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,700
 Well, I hope you guys had a great time listening to today's episode. I had a great time having you here. I always had, like, having people listen.
