1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 A creepy apparition makes itself known, but what does it want?

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:15,680
 And then we travel to Hawaii to take a look at a family that has recently rented a house.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:23,160
 At first they begin to experience minor disturbances, but as mysterious events after mysterious

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,880
 event continues to manifest in this house, the family has to wonder if there's a poltergeist

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,440
 haunting them.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,840
 However the truth is far more terrifying.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:49,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,160
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for this upcoming weekend.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
 I might go see the new Ant-Man movie.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,680
 I hated the first one, I thought it was awful, and I didn't watch the second one, but something

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,080
 tells me that surely maybe this third movie will be entertaining.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
 Probably not.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,120
 But at the very least I'll be able to eat some popcorn and drink soda.

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,600
 You're like, "Jason, you can do that.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,640
 You don't have to go see Ant-Man to drink stuff.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
 I'm all dehydrated.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,240
 I was like, "Oh, I'm only an Ant-Man movie would come out.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,440
 I haven't had a drink in 10 years."

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,000
 But that's probably what I'll do this week.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,600
 I hope you guys have more entertaining plans than watching Ant-Man.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,680
 But someone who's always entertaining no matter the circumstance, he needs a horrible car

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
 accident and he's doing a dance.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 He's doing a dance.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
 Dancing is waiting to Dead Rabbit Command right now.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,800
 Everyone give it up for one of our legacy Patreon supporters, Bougas.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 Woohoo!

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 Yeah, come on in, Bougas.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 Yay!

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,760
 Welcome into Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,880
 Bougas, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, it's totally fine.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
 It really is.

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,640
 Just help support the show by getting the word out.

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,280
 That is another way you can really help Dead Rabbit Radio grow.

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,680
 Bougas, let's go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robot.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,400
 Captain this boat all the way down to San Francisco, California.

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
 Splash!

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,960
 We're all rowing this rowboat while Bougas is looking all admirably standing on the bow

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,520
 of it.

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,120
 We finally get to San Francisco and this is a story that has very, very specific coordinates.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,600
 I love stuff like this because you can kind of go there and double check it.

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,560
 Although this story, this story may be like, "No, I'm good.

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
 I don't need to go to that haunted house."

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,000
 Apparently, we don't have the exact house address, but this takes place in San Francisco

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,640
 on 23rd Avenue near Lincoln, which is right across the street from Golden Gate Park, which

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,440
 if you're not from California, it sounds beautiful, right?

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,720
 Golden Gate Park, you imagine in San Francisco and like it's just, you know, San Francisco

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,560
 stuff, hilly and grass.

53
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,320
 I lived in the Bay Area for a good period of time and you couldn't catch me in Golden

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,020
 Gate Park for nothing.

55
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,560
 You cannot pay me to go there.

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
 Maybe it's better now.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,480
 It's probably far worse than it was in the '80s, but Golden Gate Park, locally, I don't

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,920
 know if it's as internationally known as, say, what's the big park?

59
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,600
 Central Park in New York.

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 Central Park in New York, again, things could be different now, but when I was growing up,

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,880
 it was the same thing with Golden Gate Park.

62
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,040
 You can be there during the day, but if you're out after the sun sets, you're dead.

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,920
 You're basically dead.

64
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,000
 The police won't even go there to help you.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,760
 They, once the sun, once the sun no longer gives its life-giving light on the world,

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,880
 these giant parks just become murder factories.

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,200
 It's basically the purge every night.

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,880
 At least that was my, how it was brought to me as a child.

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,000
 I was basically told, don't ever go into Golden Gate Park at night.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,560
 And really not during the day either because there's a bunch of drug users and stuff like,

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,820
 I don't know, maybe it's better.

72
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,980
 Probably not.

73
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,000
 But anyways, the reason why I bring all of that stuff up is if you want to talk about

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,200
 a place with an aferi as haunting, which is what we're going to get into right now, it

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,200
 totally makes sense that it's across the street from this park.

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,560
 Because a lot of bad stuff happened there.

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,240
 A lot of bad stuff happened there.

78
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,720
 23rd Avenue, near Lincoln, across the street from Golden Gate Park.

79
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,560
 Someone posted this story online.

80
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,980
 It's very, very short, but the visual is just terrifying.

81
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:56,500
 This person said, they go online, they go by the name Spooky Inky, 987.

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,180
 So if you can't trust a guy named Spooky Inky when it comes to ghosts, who can you trust?

83
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,220
 He said, I used to live in this house next to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

84
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:17,320
 And one day I was there and I saw something come out of the wall.

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:29,720
 It bubbled out of the wall and it was a dark cloud made of human skulls.

86
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:39,660
 And he's watching it bubble out of the wall.

87
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,380
 But this dark cloud of human skulls was bubbling out of the walls.

88
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,020
 And he says, the bubbling was he would watch these human skulls get bigger and bigger and

89
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,420
 bigger, about the size of a human skull.

90
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,380
 And then it would begin to shrink into a tiny skull.

91
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,100
 And then another skull would appear.

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,540
 But it was like, all this was happening at once.

93
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,200
 It was basically like this roiling mass of human skulls growing and shrinking, enveloped

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,760
 in this black cloud that's phasing through this wall.

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,360
 And he says, it came out of the wall and for around 10 seconds it sat there, hovering in

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,440
 midair, continuing to boil and bubble out human skulls.

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:35,540
 And then after 10 seconds it slowly began to ooze backwards into the wall.

98
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,540
 That's it.

99
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,980
 That's the whole ghost story, right?

100
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,060
 That's the whole ghost story.

101
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,060
 But when it's that insane, do you need more?

102
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,900
 Like if you saw that, if you saw that, you go in there with your EMF detector and you

103
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,400
 got your little tape recorder to record EVPs and you're like, yes, we're going to go ghost

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,280
 hunting, maybe we'll pick up a voice of an old lady who got murdered in Golden Gate Park.

105
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,520
 And you got all your equipment set up, right?

106
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,080
 You're ready to spend the night.

107
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,840
 And then all of a sudden a undulating mass of human skulls float through the walls.

108
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,600
 You'd be like, okay, that's all the proof that I needed.

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
 We're leaving now.

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 We're leaving now.

111
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,440
 You probably want to stick around a little bit longer.

112
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,620
 But you know what I mean?

113
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,220
 Even a hardened paranormal researcher would be like, that's the most insane thing I've

114
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
 ever seen.

115
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,060
 I've seen a lot of ghosts floating down hallways.

116
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,140
 I've heard some spooky noises and abandoned asylums.

117
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,540
 But a floating mass of human skulls growing and shrinking.

118
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,500
 Yeah, that is going to go on my resume.

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,020
 That is quite the feat.

120
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,420
 Very, very interesting ghost story.

121
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,860
 He actually posted it.

122
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,620
 Someone was asking online.

123
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,840
 What are some physically unusual ghosts that you've come across that you've seen?

124
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,680
 People who've seen paranormal stuff.

125
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,960
 What some physically unusual ones.

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,720
 And that was the one, there was a lot of them, but that was the one that really stuck out

127
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,840
 the most to me.

128
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,960
 There was another one where a guy said he saw a Civil War ghost.

129
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,320
 But this might have been on a different forum, actually.

130
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,280
 This might not have been in the same question.

131
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,560
 But he said he saw a Civil War ghost, but half of its jaw was torn away like the cheek.

132
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,500
 The sinus cavities were torn away and he could see the teeth.

133
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,780
 He could see like the open jaw and the teeth and everything like that.

134
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780
 It was a very mangled up ghost.

135
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,660
 Which is interesting because we're going to talk about this at the Oregon Ghost Conference

136
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,660
 on March 24th.

137
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,620
 I'm giving a presentation there at 6pm March 24th in Seaside, Oregon.

138
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,260
 We're going to talk about stuff like that.

139
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,420
 Why some ghosts appear incredibly grisly while others just seem, I mean, everyone dies one

140
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,040
 way or the other.

141
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,760
 Not all deaths, but a lot of deaths are gory.

142
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,120
 Getting ripped apart by lions or getting ripped apart by dogs or falling to a thresher, a

143
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,640
 wheat thresher and then spitting your guts out all over the wheat.

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,280
 You know, are you just now going to float around for the next hundred years?

145
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,200
 Are you going to hunt the farm as a, it's like floating entrails?

146
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,040
 Just floating around the farm?

147
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,160
 They're like, "Oh, Billy, Billy and his entrails floating around."

148
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
 No.

149
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,060
 Traditionally, what we see in Ghost Lord is people who die, like you fall into a machine,

150
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
 you get shredded up.

151
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,420
 You're not now a floating pile of guts.

152
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,420
 You're Billy.

153
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,740
 You're just like the ghost of a guy walking through the field.

154
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,660
 And they're like, "He's never left the wheat thing done."

155
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,140
 I don't know anything about wheat.

156
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,820
 We hired Billy because the government paid half of the salary.

157
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,620
 We just kind of let him hang out.

158
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,300
 But now he just walks around the wheat.

159
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,420
 We see old Bill, old Billy boy walking around the wheat.

160
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,260
 It's not this horrific vision of guts everywhere, but sometimes it is.

161
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,280
 Sometimes it is headless ghosts, like we talked about earlier this week.

162
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,440
 Sometimes it's a civil war ghost with half of his face missing.

163
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,280
 But then other civil war people get just blown to bits and they show up back at the house

164
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,440
 of their sweetheart.

165
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,080
 They finally made it home, even in death.

166
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,200
 And they're walking around with their ghost girlfriend.

167
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,520
 She jumped off the building when he died during the battle, jumped off the top of their house

168
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,460
 and now their ghosts are sitting in the tea room.

169
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
 Every so often you look in there and you see this young couple.

170
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,220
 So how come that happens?

171
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,300
 But this other dude has half of his face for eternity.

172
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,540
 But even this boiling mass of human skulls, this goes beyond ghosts.

173
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,580
 This is such a demonic image.

174
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,940
 But what is it?

175
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,700
 What could it possibly be?

176
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,380
 What is this trying to tell us?

177
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,120
 What does this manifestation say about the world of the paranormal?

178
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
 We don't know.

179
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,960
 This is one of those things that's so far outside the norm.

180
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
 What's interesting, and I'll wrap it up like this because I can talk about this forever,

181
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,840
 what's interesting is that this is the type of imagery you see in horror movies.

182
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,600
 So people who don't follow paranormal, people who aren't like paranormal researchers like

183
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,800
 us or people who are at least interested enough in the paranormal to listen to podcasts and

184
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,080
 read articles about it, they assume this type of stuff is far more common.

185
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,940
 They assume poltergeist activity is more common and these type of monstrous entities coming

186
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,520
 out and ghost killing people, all of those things are extremely rare.

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
 Extremely rare.

188
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,020
 Visually seen a full body apparition is rare.

189
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:31,020
 Being killed by a ghost is, I mean it happens, but it's such a small percentage of actual

190
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,380
 ghost sightings.

191
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,300
 You could almost statistically say it doesn't happen.

192
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,740
 And then like this.

193
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,120
 A ghost appearing in monstrous forms, inhuman monstrous forms.

194
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
 Again, it's happened so rarely.

195
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,160
 They might as well not exist as well.

196
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,640
 So fascinating story coming out of San Francisco, quite short but quite terrifying.

197
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,320
 Boogus, go ahead and call in the carbonar copter.

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,720
 We are leaving behind San Francisco.

199
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,840
 Make sure you got your wallet on you because we were near Golden Gate Park.

200
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,560
 We're leaving behind San Francisco.

201
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,940
 Take us all the way out to Hawaii.

202
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,180
 I wanted to do a real quick Dead Rabbit Recommendance.

203
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:23,100
 I swear that I had talked about this but I couldn't find in any of my notes any mention

204
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,820
 of it so I definitely want to recommend this and it's very topical.

205
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,340
 We've been talking about this for the past couple weeks, not only on the show but in

206
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,380
 society in general.

207
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,220
 There's an anthology film called Doomsday Book.

208
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,720
 It's a South Korean anthology film.

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:48,100
 There's three different stories but the second story, I mean I saw this over 10 years ago

210
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,560
 and I think about that second story all the time.

211
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,000
 It is one of the coolest pieces of sci-fi.

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
 Very thought provoking, right?

213
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,160
 You're stuck in my head.

214
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,240
 It's called the second, you mean you watched the whole thing.

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,900
 You can watch the first story is okay and the third story is kind of funny but the second

216
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,260
 one is some of the coolest sci-fi that I've come across.

217
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,180
 Really, I'd rank it up there with some of the best.

218
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,220
 It's called The Heavenly Creature.

219
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,620
 The movie itself is called Doomsday Book but the second story on that is what I want to

220
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,780
 highlight, The Heavenly Creature and what it is the story of.

221
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,020
 It's basically the story of a robot repairman.

222
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,240
 It takes place in modern times but technology is a little more advanced.

223
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,960
 There's a robot repairman who gets called out to a Buddhist temple to repair a robot.

224
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,480
 This robot was originally purchased and they are all over the country as a tour guide.

225
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,380
 It has this memory and it will walk around and go like this fountain was built and so

226
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,600
 and so and then it would walk a little bit through the Buddhist temple and look it over

227
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
 there.

228
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
 There is a bench.

229
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
 That bench is brand new.

230
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
 They just installed that last week.

231
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,300
 This robot would give tours and the Buddhist temple calls up the company and says, "Hey,

232
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,620
 our tour robot is malfunctioning."

233
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,060
 So they send a repairman out and he gets there and he's like, "Where's your robot?

234
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
 I'm here to fix it."

235
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,660
 And they go, "Come with us."

236
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,620
 And they lead him into the temple and the robot is praying.

237
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,140
 And they go, "This robot malfunctions."

238
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,220
 It thinks it's Buddhist.

239
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,320
 It believes in all of the tenets of the Buddhism religion.

240
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,360
 And the repairman is like, "What in the world?"

241
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,400
 And it's super interesting.

242
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
 It's quite long too.

243
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
 It's not like a 10 minute short.

244
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,640
 I think it's like 40 minutes long.

245
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,280
 The thrust of the story is some of the monks are saying, "This is totally legit."

246
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,360
 He actually believes.

247
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,800
 It's not just that he has this memory and can cite everything about our religion.

248
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
 He believes in it.

249
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:02,860
 And not only does he believe in it, he might be the Buddha because he has been able to

250
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,180
 release himself from all attachments.

251
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,180
 He can truly, when he meditates, he thinks of nothing.

252
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,260
 He has truly learned to cleanse his mind.

253
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,660
 He is devoid of all sin.

254
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,380
 He might be the Buddha.

255
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,140
 And the other group of monks are saying, "Yeah, his mind is clean because he can literally

256
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,500
 shut himself off.

257
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,200
 It's a machine.

258
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,160
 He can't actually believe this stuff.

259
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,880
 He's just a machine.

260
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,080
 A tour guide, really.

261
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,520
 So he knows everything about it, but he can't believe it.

262
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,240
 And the technique, it's super interesting because you see that kind of argument going

263
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,640
 on and then we get to see the robot following the tenets of Buddhism and how that's affecting

264
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,280
 everyone of the temple.

265
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,280
 And the repairman is trying to figure out what to do.

266
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,220
 So you have all these different stories going on.

267
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,540
 Do you shut him off?

268
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,220
 Because that's what the officials of the temple want.

269
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,020
 They just want him to shut off.

270
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,580
 Or do you let him continue to work?

271
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
 It's super interesting.

272
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,580
 I really, really love that short film.

273
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,460
 I've watched it a couple of times over the years.

274
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,820
 And we've been talking so much about AI recently that I was like, "I got to mention this.

275
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,020
 I really got to mention this."

276
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:21,020
 It's called, the full movie is called Doomsday Book, but the second feature, I barely remember

277
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
 the first.

278
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,320
 I think it had somebody do a zombie's the first movie maybe.

279
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,400
 But the second part, the heavenly creature is fascinating.

280
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
 It's just great sci-fi.

281
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,880
 Really, it's just really, really good sci-fi.

282
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,560
 So Dead Rabbit Radio recommends checking out Doomsday Book.

283
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,960
 That is the movie you will look for if you want to check this out.

284
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,040
 Doomsday Book.

285
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,440
 And the second feature is the one about the robot, the Buddhist monk robot.

286
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,880
 It's just absolutely fascinating even to say that.

287
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
 And yeah, it's great.

288
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
 I really, really enjoy it.

289
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,100
 So we just go ahead and land this carpenter copter in Hawaii.

290
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,420
 Specifically we're in Honolulu and when we land, we're all stretching our legs out.

291
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,100
 We're like, "Yeah, dude, this is awesome.

292
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,500
 We're running into the sand."

293
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 Weee!

294
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,660
 In the waters, we're swimming like sea turtles.

295
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
 We're just totally relaxing.

296
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,780
 It's been a long time, if ever, that we've had a vacation spot and a Dead Rabbit Radio

297
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
 episode.

298
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,380
 So we're just chilling on the beach, catching some rays and enjoying the beautiful Hawaiian

299
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,580
 islands.

300
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:23,080
 And while we're doing that, a family is headed out to a new house.

301
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,280
 This is a house they've just rented as they are going to live in Hawaii for a while.

302
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
 We have the Campbell family.

303
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,760
 This story starts in May 2019.

304
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,880
 You have the Campbell family, James and Brittany Campbell.

305
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,600
 And he brought two boys with him from a previous relationship, but together they're one happy

306
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 family.

307
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,120
 There's a couple dogs as well.

308
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,260
 James was just loving life.

309
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,460
 Now James is in the military and he was now going to be stationed out of Hawaii, so that's

310
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,860
 why they're renting this house.

311
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,660
 And I mean, what could be better, right?

312
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,540
 Young family, young love, beautiful location.

313
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,700
 It's all going to work out.

314
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,100
 They move in in May and there's a slow unboxing process.

315
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,100
 So it's not like they're in a hurry to get all the, every box unpacked.

316
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,480
 You know, you're just going to let the process play out.

317
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,400
 But by the time they go for a vacation in September, it's been quite a few months, they

318
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,280
 still have a lot of boxes in their garage.

319
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,840
 They go for a week-long vacation in September 2019.

320
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,920
 When they come back, Brittany goes into the garage to grab something and the boxes in

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,600
 there are all opened up.

322
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,980
 And things, the way Brittany described it was she said things were thrown out of the

323
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:53,140
 boxes, but then they were thrown into piles.

324
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,880
 So there was an order to it, but it still appeared like things were just pulled out and thrown

325
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,040
 in every direction.

326
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:06,000
 And yet you had these different piles of items that were related.

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,400
 She calls in her husband James.

328
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,740
 James, James, come in the garage.

329
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,600
 I think someone's broken into the house.

330
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,360
 That would be your first thing.

331
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,680
 Someone was rummaging through your boxes looking for valuables.

332
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,200
 So James comes into the garage, he looks at it.

333
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,520
 He also assumes they've been robbed while they were gone for a week.

334
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,680
 But after checking through everything, it appears that nothing has been stolen.

335
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:34,120
 At least nothing of value, nothing they could notice was missing from the boxes or the piles.

336
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,680
 Everything seemed to be there.

337
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,200
 These figures, maybe one of the dogs did it.

338
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,440
 Maybe one of the dogs opened up all these boxes and threw the things into very specific

339
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
 piles.

340
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,640
 You're going to quickly learn that James, while probably a good father and husband,

341
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,600
 makes a lot of really boneheaded decisions this whole story.

342
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
 And this is 100% a true story.

343
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,680
 There's been a bunch of news coverage of this, all sorts of stuff.

344
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,240
 It's absolutely insane.

345
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,600
 James, probably a good guy, makes a lot of weird moves in the story.

346
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:23,360
 Anyways, a week later, Brittany is at home alone and she hears the front door slam.

347
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,560
 And it's loud.

348
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,400
 It's like an angry slam.

349
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,160
 She's in the house and she's home alone, but she assumes that it's James and the kids coming

350
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
 back.

351
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,160
 "James?"

352
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,960
 House is dead quiet.

353
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,360
 "James, did you just come in?

354
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
 What was...

355
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,360
 Did you just slam the door?"

356
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,640
 No answer.

357
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,680
 Later when James and the boys do come back home, she asks him, "Hey, did you come back

358
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
 earlier?"

359
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,600
 And he heard the front door just like slam shut.

360
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,360
 He's like, "No, no, actually we're just coming back right now."

361
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,600
 I wasn't here earlier.

362
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,200
 She goes, "That's so weird because I swear that I heard the door slam shut."

363
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
 And he goes, "Well, you know, maybe it was the wind.

364
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
 Did you leave the door open?"

365
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,040
 She's like, "No!

366
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,880
 Someone would have had to open it to slam it shut.

367
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,320
 Maybe it was the wind."

368
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,160
 Later that same night, Brittany wakes up in the middle of the night because she hears

369
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,000
 the sound of a door opening.

370
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,520
 "Wake up, James.

371
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,000
 James, wake up.

372
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,800
 James, I think someone's in the house.

373
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,080
 I'm hearing a door open up."

374
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:56,000
 Remember, just a week ago, somebody was in the dogs.

375
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,520
 Somebody or something got into their boxes and was throwing stuff everywhere.

376
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,200
 Earlier that day, a front door was slam shut.

377
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,520
 Now she's hearing a door handle being jiggled.

378
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
 He says, "You're just being paranoid.

379
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,560
 I'm not even going to get out of bed.

380
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,360
 I am not even going to get out of bed, Brittany.

381
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,160
 I think you're just being paranoid.

382
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 Don't worry about it.

383
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,520
 Don't worry about the sound of people trying to get into our house."

384
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,720
 Well, he goes back to sleep.

385
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,840
 She goes down and she checks.

386
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,440
 I don't know if it's exactly the front door.

387
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,000
 It might have been the back door, but it was one of the doors leading outside.

388
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,440
 She goes down and she checks the door.

389
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
 It's unlocked.

390
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,960
 She then locks it, goes upstairs to tell James, "Hey, listen.

391
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
 I think someone's in the house.

392
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,120
 I just found the door unlocked.

393
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,560
 I know that I locked it when we went to bed."

394
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,480
 She wakes him up and James is so mad that she keeps waking him up.

395
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,480
 Over her being paranoid, they start fighting.

396
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,400
 They get into a full argument in the middle of the night about whether or not Brittany

397
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,640
 is being paranoid because she thinks somebody is coming into their house.

398
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:18,800
 And while they are having this argument, they hear the back door slam shut.

399
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:30,040
 Both of them clearly hear that back door slam shut and James goes, "It's just the wind,

400
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
 baby.

401
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
 It's all the wind.

402
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,440
 I'm not even going to check.

403
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,040
 I'm a service man.

404
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,240
 I've been tasked with protecting America's freedoms, but walking to go check that back

405
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,440
 door, I didn't sign up for that.

406
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,720
 I didn't sign up for that.

407
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
 You're just being paranoid.

408
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,480
 That was just the wind.

409
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,800
 We're going back to bed."

410
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,600
 Several days later, James is alone in the house.

411
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,880
 Here's the point time where James gets a taste of it.

412
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,160
 James is alone in the house and he's playing the piano.

413
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,800
 Now he's not a supervillain.

414
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,440
 He's not the fan of the opera.

415
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,800
 I don't know if that's a thing.

416
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,040
 I guess people do sit in their house all alone and play the piano.

417
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,760
 That sounds menacing in and of itself.

418
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,680
 Just sitting in a house alone playing the piano.

419
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
 I don't know.

420
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
 Is that a thing?

421
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
 But he did it.

422
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,080
 I'm sure Lex Luthor's done it a couple of times.

423
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,120
 He's sitting in his house, playing the piano.

424
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,600
 When all of a sudden he gets the feeling that somebody's watching him, that unmistakable

425
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:39,440
 feeling that somebody has their eyes locked on you, and he turns and he looks and the

426
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,400
 drapes were shut.

427
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,280
 So he couldn't see outside the window, but the way that the sunlight was hitting the window

428
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:55,800
 so perfectly, he clearly saw the silhouette of a man standing outside.

429
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,640
 He sees the silhouette of a man standing outside as a window.

430
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,120
 He can't really see who it is.

431
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,000
 He just sees the outline of an adult male perfectly framed by the sun, beaming down.

432
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,520
 This dude's staring at James.

433
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,480
 James sees the silhouette watching him play the piano.

434
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:28,200
 The silhouette then runs away and James goes, "Hmm, that must be one of my neighbors I haven't

435
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
 met yet."

436
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 They were just curious.

437
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,880
 They walked right up to my window in the middle of the day to hear me play piano.

438
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 They didn't knock on the door.

439
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,640
 They didn't introduce themselves.

440
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,720
 They just stood menacingly right outside my house, staring at me while my back was to

441
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
 them.

442
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,240
 It must just be a neighbor.

443
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,480
 Now I'm not saying he had a run out there with a crowbar or anything, but at this point

444
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,320
 he should be putting stuff together that whatever is going on, it is connected and it is unusual

445
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,920
 and it is something you should be afraid of.

446
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,160
 A couple days after that, the family decides to go to the movies.

447
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,600
 And there's this thing where Brittany likes to bring her favorite blanket to wrap herself

448
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,280
 up in the movie theater.

449
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,920
 But she can't find it.

450
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
 And they look all over the house.

451
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,840
 I'll be honest, this family, at least the parents, seem a little high maintenance, but they can't

452
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 go to the movies so they find Brittany's favorite blanket.

453
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,400
 The kids are looking for it.

454
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,880
 James is probably pretending to look for it.

455
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
 He's like, "Ah, not this again."

456
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,080
 Brittany's tearing the house up and down looking for this blanket.

457
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,800
 They can't find it anywhere.

458
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,840
 Whatever, we'll just go to the movies.

459
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
 Let's just go.

460
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,320
 Brittany's finally given up finding this blanket.

461
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,780
 When they come back from the movies, right when they walk into the living room, sitting

462
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:59,440
 on the couch, neatly folded up, is Brittany's blanket.

463
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,840
 So at this point, there is no more, "This is the wind.

464
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,040
 This is the neighbors.

465
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,640
 You're just being paranoid."

466
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,960
 Something is going on in this house.

467
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,800
 And really, the smartest move anyone's ever made in any of these type of stories, they

468
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,000
 leave for three months.

469
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,680
 They're like, "We're not even going back to this house.

470
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,200
 Get what you have on you.

471
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,120
 We're out of this house for three months."

472
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
 And you would have to think.

473
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,400
 I read a bunch of articles on this.

474
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,240
 At no point did they say we thought it was a ghost.

475
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
 But you would have to think.

476
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,780
 At a certain point, you would go, "It has to be a ghost."

477
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:44,120
 Because what other phenomenon could possibly do this?

478
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
 It's in the house.

479
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,440
 It's rummaging through your stuff.

480
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,720
 It's opening and closing doors.

481
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,760
 Now, you would assume it was like a burglar, but what type of burglar is going to fold

482
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,760
 your blanket?

483
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,200
 Like burgle your blanket and then bring it back.

484
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,960
 It's all nice and washed with a little note from the burglar.

485
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
 Doesn't make sense.

486
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,920
 You have the person standing outside.

487
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,400
 And honestly, I would be shocked if James told Brittany that happened.

488
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,760
 He might have told her about that way after the fact, but I doubt Brittany came home from

489
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,760
 work and he's like, "Honey, you won't believe what happened today."

490
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,800
 A neighbor stopped by and she's like, "Oh, really?

491
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
 Which one?"

492
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 And he goes, "I don't know."

493
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 He was a silhouette.

494
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 He was a stationary silhouette.

495
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,680
 He's standing right outside the window staring at me while I played the piano.

496
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
 She's like, "What?

497
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
 That's not a neighbor.

498
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,320
 That's probably the same weirdo who keeps opening and closing doors."

499
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,320
 I doubt he told her about that at the time.

500
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,160
 They leave the house for three weeks.

501
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,320
 They figure whatever is there, I don't know actually what they were thinking.

502
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
 I mean, you have to come back, right?

503
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,120
 You rent the house.

504
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,800
 You've already signed a lease.

505
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,040
 You'd have to come back at a certain point.

506
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:56,520
 But anyways, after three weeks, they come back to the house and right when they're pulling

507
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,400
 up, I mean, they don't even get in the house.

508
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,520
 This already goes insane.

509
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,720
 As they're pulling up to the house, James sees that his bike that he left in the garage

510
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,560
 because that's what you do when you're going to be gone for a period of time so people

511
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,840
 don't steal stuff.

512
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,480
 As he's pulling up, he sees his bike sitting in the driveway.

513
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,160
 At that point, they open the garage and it is a complete mess.

514
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,760
 It's just completely tore apart.

515
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
 Stuff's everywhere.

516
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,520
 I'm assuming they left the kids in the car because at this point, they're like somebody's

517
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
 in the house.

518
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,560
 It could be a pulled or guys, right?

519
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,840
 But they open the garage, they see all these junk strewn everywhere in the garage and then

520
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,920
 there's a bunch of prescription bottles.

521
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,000
 They're not James and Brittany's prescriptions.

522
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,720
 There's a bunch of medicine there and they're like, "What in the world is this?"

523
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,640
 So Brittany calls 911.

524
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,320
 James, this is probably what I would do but I would also think I was being boneheaded in

525
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
 this.

526
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,200
 Brittany's on the phone at 911.

527
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,120
 James grabs a hammer out of the garage and decides to go into the house.

528
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,640
 Somebody is getting their brains beaten out tonight.

529
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,520
 James goes to open the front door and he can't.

530
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,840
 Well, I mean, technically he could.

531
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,240
 He did just a little bit but then he felt a force pushing on the door from the other

532
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,960
 side.

533
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:38,680
 And James hears a very calm voice say, "This is not your house."

534
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:48,680
 James put that phrase to the test when he proceeded to kick his way through the door,

535
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:55,280
 kick the door open, knocking the guy to the ground and then dragged him outside of the

536
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
 house.

537
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
 This was not a ghost.

538
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
 It was not a fan.

539
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,720
 It wasn't a neighbor.

540
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,680
 It was a dude named Ezekiel Zayez.

541
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:13,680
 He's a 23-year-old man and he'd been living in the house with them.

542
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,960
 The police show up, right?

543
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,360
 They arrest this guy for breaking and entering but the truth was going to be far more insane.

544
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,160
 Like we're just getting started with this story.

545
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,000
 I know we don't have a lot of time left but his story is insane.

546
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,880
 This guy was living in the house with him undetected.

547
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,840
 I mean, he wasn't doing the great job on the undetected part.

548
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,920
 He kept making a lot of noise when he was coming and going.

549
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,960
 And the police don't know how long he was there.

550
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,680
 The police don't know if he was there for a long time.

551
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,520
 They don't know if he showed up during the week they were gone on their first vacation

552
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,600
 but he was living in the house while they were there.

553
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,960
 But he wasn't some homeless bum.

554
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,080
 He might have been a homeless bum but his goal wasn't just to find a place to live and

555
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,240
 he'd have access to delicious food as long as he snuck around at night.

556
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
 No.

557
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,720
 He was using a laptop computer.

558
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,400
 One of James and Brittany's laptop computers.

559
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,520
 So funny because Brittany goes, there was some webcam footage.

560
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
 He was doing like this.

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,800
 He was doing this video blog apparently and there was webcam footage of him completely

562
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,560
 naked sitting in Brittany's office chair and she's like, "That's so gross.

563
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
 He was naked.

564
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
 He was in my chair."

565
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,040
 I was like, "Listen lady, he did way grosser stuff.

566
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,720
 That's really the thing you're complaining about than you are very, very isolated.

567
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,920
 You've lived a very comfortable existence because that wasn't the worst thing he did

568
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,440
 that he sat with his balls touching your leather chair."

569
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,800
 No.

570
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:47,560
 On a computer he began writing the Omnivore Trials.

571
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,920
 That's not a spin off of Hunger Games.

572
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:58,080
 The Omnivore Trials was his research paper.

573
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:07,400
 The full title of it was The Omnivore Trials, A Rehabilitation for Rat-Like People.

574
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,040
 And this was a diary of sorts.

575
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,840
 It talked about him breaking into the house.

576
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,960
 It talked about how he observed the Campbells, aka the Rat-Like People.

577
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:26,480
 He considered they were simply test subjects and he was a researcher compiling notes.

578
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:34,920
 His goal, he was going to turn these Omnivores into Ezekiels.

579
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,640
 That's what the prescription medication was for.

580
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
 I would love to get my hands on this document.

581
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
 They haven't released it to the public.

582
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,800
 Probably completely terrifying.

583
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,000
 They don't want to inspire any copycats.

584
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,720
 His goal was to drug the family, all of them.

585
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,960
 The husband, the wife, and the two kids.

586
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,200
 And give them "corrective surgeries."

587
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,000
 He went into detail how he wanted to give them sex changes.

588
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
 He wanted to drug this family and then...

589
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,040
 What do I have to go into detail?

590
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,240
 You're like, "Oh, I wonder what that means, Jason."

591
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,600
 Go into detail about that.

592
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,160
 What did he plan on doing to the kids?

593
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,680
 I don't think I have to go into detail.

594
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,840
 He wanted to give them all sex changes.

595
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,240
 He wanted to do that.

596
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,080
 He also wanted to do hand transplants, which I mean, at that point.

597
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,920
 If I'm tied to a chair and someone goes, "I'm going to cut off your genitals."

598
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,480
 I'm like, "No!"

599
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,760
 And then he goes, "And then I'm going to cut off your hand."

600
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,320
 I would be like, "You might want to start with that one.

601
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,600
 That one's not as threatening."

602
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,640
 I mean, I want both my hands, but if you're trying to psychologically torture someone,

603
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,600
 start by saying you're going to cut off my hand.

604
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
 And then my genitals.

605
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
 I'm all giving him advice.

606
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,240
 I'm like, "If you really want a good cut, hold the salt like this."

607
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,640
 No, he talked about doing limb transplants.

608
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,480
 He wanted to cut hands off some of the family members and give me hilarious.

609
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,400
 This mom woke up and she had her little son's hands.

610
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,440
 He's like, "Oh no, these hands haven't even gone through puberty yet.

611
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
 There's no hair on the knuckles."

612
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,920
 I don't know why she would complain about that.

613
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,640
 She's like, "Come on, man.

614
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,120
 Give me my husband's hands.

615
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,920
 Give me them hairy knuckles."

616
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,480
 But yeah, he wanted to do hand transplants and sex changes.

617
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,400
 And this would turn them into Ezekials.

618
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,280
 I'm sure there was other stuff he wanted to do.

619
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,480
 Again, that's why I kind of want to get my hands on this talking book, my transplanted

620
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
 hands on it.

621
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,760
 Right now I have the hands of an elderly grandmother.

622
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,840
 I want to get my hands on this document.

623
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,280
 I want to see what else he was up to.

624
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,440
 That can't be it.

625
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,520
 He can't be like...

626
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,840
 I imagine there's more.

627
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,560
 I imagine he's sicker than that.

628
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,880
 But I mean, that's pretty bad, right?

629
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
 Four?

630
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
 Four?

631
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,760
 You're like, "Jason, you wanted to give this a family of four forced sex changes."

632
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
 And you're like, "Oh, come on, Ezekiel.

633
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,600
 You can do better than this."

634
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,640
 Maybe I do give advice to weirdos.

635
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,000
 The police don't know how long he was there.

636
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,680
 They do realize that this guy is a menace.

637
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
 He'd broken into this house.

638
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,160
 He was threatening to mutilate this family.

639
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,800
 And in typical police fashion, they let him go.

640
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,480
 I'm not joking.

641
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,840
 The police didn't let him go right there, but he got basically a charge for burglary.

642
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
 That was it.

643
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,160
 You got a charge for burglary.

644
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
 And I don't know.

645
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,040
 I don't know if it's even the police officers themselves, but a judge was like, "Well, you

646
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
 know what?

647
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,960
 We'll let you go free until your trial."

648
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,320
 Maybe it was a low bail or whatever.

649
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:47,380
 So this lunatic who had been hiding in his family's home was allowed to walk free shortly

650
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,000
 after his arrest.

651
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,100
 Then what happened was he went to a Buddhist temple.

652
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,920
 He went to a Buddhist temple in Hawaii and vandalized it.

653
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,880
 And that was when the court system was like, "What?

654
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,080
 You painted on that building?

655
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,120
 You sir or a menace to society?"

656
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:10,080
 They threw him in jail long term for that.

657
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,320
 Breaking into someone's house, talking about cutting a bunch of dicks off, that's totally

658
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
 fine.

659
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,880
 That's what we do here.

660
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,640
 But vandalizing a building, they've gone too far.

661
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
 And it is a religious structure, I get that.

662
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,400
 But I'm assuming even most Buddhist monks would be like, "Wait, that guy wasn't already

663
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
 arrested?

664
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
 Wait, what?

665
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,800
 How was that guy even free?"

666
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,200
 It's nuts because he gets to that vandalism charge and the burglary charge.

667
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,280
 He ends up in prison in 2020.

668
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,000
 And that's when, if you don't remember, we had all those COVID lockdowns.

669
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,880
 And I remember when I, because I have friends that are in prison, I remember thinking about

670
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
 my cousin Billy.

671
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,120
 I was like, "Dude, it's crummy out of prison during all this COVID stuff.

672
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
 I'm locked down.

673
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,320
 This is like the initial two weeks, right?"

674
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,840
 And I was thinking about my cousin Billy.

675
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,920
 I was like, "Dude, that must suck.

676
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,960
 You're locked up and you're in prison and all of a sudden you have this disease flowing

677
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
 around that nobody knows about.

678
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
 How much it must have sucked?"

679
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,760
 Well, that's what Ezekiel was going through.

680
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,240
 I get careless if he had a sucky experience in jail.

681
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,560
 But in 2020, he got COVID.

682
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,640
 And he was put in this cell with three other prisoners who had COVID at the time.

683
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,000
 They were just trying to isolate them.

684
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 This is super early days.

685
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,640
 I don't think they do this anymore.

686
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,720
 This was the super early days of the outbreak.

687
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,000
 So you had Ezekiel, this lunatic, and then you had another guy.

688
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,320
 We don't know who that guy was.

689
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,960
 But then we had a career thief.

690
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,440
 Listen, this guy wasn't an angel.

691
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,240
 This other guy, his name was Vance Grace.

692
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
 He was 62 years old.

693
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,240
 He dealt drugs and he was a career criminal.

694
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,080
 He'd been in and out of incarceration throughout his life.

695
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,520
 He was one month away from being released.

696
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,720
 He's 62 years old.

697
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:03,040
 He gets COVID and they throw him in this cell with Ezekiel who proceeds.

698
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,680
 We don't know why he did this.

699
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,360
 Because again, the guy's a lunatic and the third inmate was just watching this going,

700
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:16,360
 "Oh my God, apparently there's a safety button you can hit in this isolation cell that helps

701
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,880
 the guards get in.

702
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
 Helps the guards get in faster.

703
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,840
 I don't know if they call it the snitch button or what.

704
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,120
 But I assume you're going to have to use it from time to time."

705
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,640
 Who knows why he did this?

706
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,920
 They've never really figured it out.

707
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,440
 But Ezekiel knocked Vance to the ground and began attacking him.

708
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,080
 The 62 year old man who was a month away from getting out, he begins attacking him.

709
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,800
 And when the guards are alerted, the third prisoner's like, "Help!

710
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,960
 This guy's getting murdered in here."

711
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,400
 The guards are trying to get into the cell and they're like, "They can't get in."

712
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,920
 And now Ezekiel has this man, has Vance on the ground and he begins stomping on this

713
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,440
 old man's head.

714
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,840
 And the guards are trying to get in and that's when the third inmate has to activate a button

715
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,160
 from inside the cell that'll help the guards get in quicker.

716
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,560
 This is so bizarre.

717
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,600
 But anyways, maybe they just made this story up because people were wondering, "Hey guards,

718
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
 what took you so long?

719
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,680
 This old man was getting assaulted in the cell and they're like, "Well, you know, the

720
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,560
 button on the inside that opens the door."

721
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,280
 They're like, "Wait, there's a button on the inside of cells that opens doors?

722
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
 I don't get it."

723
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,720
 But anyways, the guards finally get into the cell and Vance is already dead.

724
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,160
 Like he just got stomped out by Ezekiel.

725
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,440
 And Vance's son is suing the prisoner.

726
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,200
 They go, "You dropped the ball a hundred different times there.

727
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,880
 One, you didn't get it on the cell quick enough.

728
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,480
 Two, he goes, "My dad shouldn't have been in there in the first place."

729
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,320
 Like you put him in with dangerous people.

730
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,200
 You put him in with psychopaths.

731
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,920
 And he was just a thief and you just go, "Oh, he has COVID.

732
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,320
 Let's just put him in a cell with other people who have COVID."

733
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,640
 And he goes, "You're responsible for my dad dying."

734
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,840
 I definitely think there's a lawsuit there, right?

735
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,880
 Because the prison made that situation happen.

736
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:16,080
 But after that, Ezekiel is now getting charged with murder.

737
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,520
 He's now getting charged with murder.

738
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:25,680
 And he is determined to be too crazy for trial.

739
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,680
 The court psychiatrists say, "This guy is certifiably insane.

740
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,640
 We can't hold the trial right now."

741
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,240
 And what they do when they do that is they put you in a mental hospital until you become

742
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,720
 fit for trial when you can actually comprehend the charges against you.

743
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,160
 And then they will put you on trial.

744
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,320
 That's how this system works out.

745
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,440
 And I imagine he was showing psychotic behaviors in prison.

746
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,840
 And that's why the guards should have known better than to put these people in the cell

747
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
 together.

748
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
 But they were just like, "Everyone has COVID.

749
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
 You're all going in here."

750
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,920
 Because if you're so insane, usually like people can be be, Jeffrey Dahmer was found

751
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
 fit for trial.

752
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,920
 Like you can be an insane person eating other people.

753
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,480
 And the court goes, "Yeah, you know, you're sane.

754
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,760
 You have to be pretty bad off to get one of these too insane to be held fit for trial."

755
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,720
 So I doubt, I'm sure that he was showing symptoms of this for a while in prison.

756
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,840
 He was definitely showing them outside of prison.

757
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,880
 He was breaking into people's house trying to cut their hands off.

758
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,000
 So they put him in a mental hospital where he will be held until trial.

759
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 But here's the creepy boy.

760
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 If that really takes it, it was all creepy.

761
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 It was all terrifying.

762
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,120
 As you're listening to this episode, you're walking around the broom.

763
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,520
 You're checking your attics and everything.

764
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,520
 You're like, "I don't know.

765
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
 Man, this episode is kind of creepy.

766
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
 I was hoping it was just a ghost.

767
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,520
 I was hoping it was just as much as skulls floating around.

768
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,040
 Now this is real life."

769
00:42:52,040 --> 00:43:01,920
 He was put in the mental hospital and there is no word of what has happened next.

770
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,920
 Nothing.

771
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,280
 Nobody knows where this guy is.

772
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,680
 They don't even know what hospital he's in.

773
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,920
 I couldn't find any articles that talked about that.

774
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,280
 This was actually, there's a bunch of stories about the Campbell family.

775
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,600
 It was an episode of a show, like there's some lifetime I think, or a TLC show called

776
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,360
 Living in My House, or some weirdo in My House, you know how all their shows are.

777
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,800
 It's real life stories about people who live in other people's houses.

778
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,200
 You're like, "Yeah, Jason, that's Airbnb."

779
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,400
 No, I think they call it frogging or fragging or something like that.

780
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,000
 That's where someone lives in your house and you don't know it.

781
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,960
 There's enough of these that they have an entire television show about it.

782
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,520
 This story was highlighted on there.

783
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,920
 This is a high profile case.

784
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,720
 There's a ton of articles about it.

785
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,760
 You have an open lawsuit as well.

786
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,160
 Whenever you have an open lawsuit, there's constantly information coming in because Vance's

787
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,680
 son is suing the Hawaii Department of Corrections.

788
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,360
 Where is this guy now?

789
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,480
 Because I'll tell you this.

790
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,680
 I do not trust the system to keep us safe.

791
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,680
 I read more than enough true crime stories where people, I don't know just for example,

792
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,680
 break into a house and want to chop off people's genitals and then they're allowed to walk

793
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,520
 free.

794
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,880
 I read stories all the time about killers who get paroled.

795
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,400
 I actually covered a story recently on my TikTok.

796
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:37,520
 A guy was acquitted of double homicide, a gangland slain at a recording studio.

797
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,000
 This guy shot two people at a recording studio execution style.

798
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,600
 He was found not guilty and then nine days later kills his girlfriend who was carrying

799
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,760
 his baby.

800
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,840
 She was five months pregnant, nine days after being acquitted of a double homicide.

801
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,160
 The system is not set up to protect us.

802
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,920
 So when they say we're going to put him in a mental hospital and we're going to keep

803
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,400
 him here until he's fit for trial and then we're going to move.

804
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
 I don't believe you.

805
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,440
 I don't believe you because I have eyes and I read the paper and they're not saying where

806
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,120
 this guy is.

807
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,240
 Nobody knows where he's at.

808
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,840
 Court documents, reality television shows, journalist writing articles, they don't know

809
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,320
 where he's at.

810
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:35,560
 And because the system sucks, because it does not protect us, it is possible that he is

811
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,880
 in your house right now.

812
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,880
 Right?

813
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,380
 It's possible.

814
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,200
 If you live in Hawaii, it's probable, right?

815
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,000
 It's most likely going to happen at some point that Ezekiel will be in your, is basically

816
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,560
 classified as some sort of spider.

817
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,760
 Now they're like, well, if you live in Hawaii, you might run into an Ezekiel hiding in your

818
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
 cupboards.

819
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
 It is possible.

820
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:08,640
 It is not outside the realms of possibility that right now Ezekiel is hiding in your house.

821
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,200
 So sleep tight, dear friends.

822
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,040
 Have a pleasant dream as you drift off to sleep.

823
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,920
 You didn't notice that you're milk, you drink warm milk every night, don't you?

824
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,120
 You didn't notice the taste at a little odd this time.

825
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,200
 It tasted like crushed up prescription medication.

826
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,040
 You're like, hmm, just like grandma used to make.

827
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,840
 My grandma, who was a drug dealer, had to hide evidence all the time in my milk.

828
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,840
 Oh, this taste reminds me of good.

829
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,880
 And your eyelids grow heavy and you're fighting the sleep.

830
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,480
 All of a sudden you see your bedroom door open and Ezekiel walks in.

831
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,480
 You know what's Ezekiel?

832
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,720
 Because he's wearing like a super village shirt with a big E on it.

833
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,480
 He's like, ah, yes, sleep, my pretty sleep.

834
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,240
 Soon you will wake up with new hands.

835
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,240
 You're like, what?

836
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,800
 You dude, you know how terrifying that would be?

837
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
 You're falling asleep.

838
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
 You've been drugged.

839
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,760
 And the guy's like giving a speech about what he's going to do to you.

840
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,840
 He's like, oh yeah, these are particularly nice genitals.

841
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,000
 But I have some much, much better for you.

842
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,400
 I found the perfect match.

843
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,520
 And you're like, ah, you're all snoring.

844
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:37,000
 You're snoring like it's a bobbycut.

845
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,760
 As he begins to saw your hands off, it could happen.

846
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,600
 It could happen tonight.

847
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
 You don't know.

848
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,400
 We don't know where this lunatic is.

849
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,240
 Right now he could be waiting for you to take a drink of that milk.

850
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,920
 He's going to turn you into an Ezekiel.

851
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,160
 Welcome to the new world.

852
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,160
 Hope you enjoy.

853
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,160
 You enjoy baby hands.

854
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,880
 Hope you enjoy having tiny, tiny hands.
