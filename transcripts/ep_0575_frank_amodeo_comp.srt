1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
 What would you do if someone magically appeared in front of you and gave you earth shattering news?

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,800
 And then we meet a man who believes it's his life mission

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
 To conquer the planet

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,400
 From an early age he set out with one goal

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,600
 To be a one-man Illuminati today on Dead Rabbit Radio

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,240
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,960
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,900
 So we're gonna slide right into this first off. Let's give a shout out to our newest patreon supporter Devon

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,940
 Devon thank you so much for supporting the show. He's doing a little mock rain in the corner

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,880
 He's doing that dance since the year 1997 apparently but Devon's having a good old time doing that dance

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,000
 Devon you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you can't support the patreon

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,580
 I totally understand just spread the word about the show that also really really helps out a lot

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,720
 But Devon when you're done doing the mock rain and he's still doing it

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
 He still has a couple more verses to go, but he's finally done

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,760
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalabi drive us out to Brazil

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:20,040
 Driving down the long lonely highway that stretches all the way from America to Brazil is there one?

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,280
 Specifically we're going to Marisol. That's in Sao Paulo

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
 Brazil

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,080
 Also hit that little time travel button because we're going back to the year 1983. It's March 30th

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,640
 1983 and it's late at night and as we're driving down the road we come across the man

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,040
 He's not named in this so let's call him Gary Gary is a night watchman at his job and he's just doing his thing

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,760
 He's watching stuff. He's perfect for it. He has eyeballs. He's born to do this job

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,220
 He's watching everything and then right in front of him a

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,800
 Humanoid appears

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,060
 This creature with for lack of a better word. It's not necessarily an alien or a cryptid

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,000
 But this humanoid appears right in front of him has dark skin and red crinkly hair

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
 like that's kind of an odd combination begin with but

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,680
 Also the fact that he magically appeared in front of you

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,360
 And this stranger is standing right in front of Gary and says

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
 We have a kid

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
 Her name is Azalea

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,560
 you

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,400
 Figure disappears

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
 into a puff of smoke

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,880
 You don't see that often. You don't see that very often outside of a looney Tune cartoon person appears

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:44,640
 Disappears in a puff of smoke says we have a child together named Azalea. That's it. That's the whole story

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,600
 Now what's funny is that that story is

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:55,280
 More perplexing than so much other stuff we talk about on this show because if it had been a great alien if it had been a

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,760
 Ghost I've mentioned this before on the podcast. You have mythology. You can plug that into context

40
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,800
 You're like, oh here's a ghost I can do research and maybe the place used to be haunted or it's still haunted

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,400
 There's a ghost here

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,880
 But maybe someone tragically died here if it was an alien that would appear you go

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,880
 Oh human hybrid experiments like I must have been abducted at some point

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
 Just a dude showing up

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,160
 Saying hey, we have a kid together disappearing. That's way more perplexing

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,240
 There's no way to put that into the catalog of paranormal events

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,600
 The less context the more bizarre like where do you go from there? How would you ever research that?

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 How would you deal with that?

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,160
 Like if an alien showed up and was like, oh, I abducted you like a long time ago. We had a baby together

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
 I'd want to see the baby

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,880
 Maybe hold it how weird it looked I'm like gross. Yeah, that's a gross little baby. They're like, but it's yours

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,480
 Don't you have an attachment to it? I'm like no super super gross, baby

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,860
 You could probably like explore it more but just some dude with crinkly red hair showing up

54
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,800
 You like what and the puff of smoke? I don't know why keep getting like fixated on the fact that there's just like someone saying

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,920
 We have a kid he had disappeared in a puff of smoke. That's super weird in and of itself

56
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,800
 No wonder why if a ghost can have a kid with a person we've covered stuff like that before with crazy women saying that ghosts have been

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,880
 Pregnated them, but they were nuts

58
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,480
 Outside of people being nuts. Could you have a ghost baby?

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,920
 could you have a if you can bang an alien and have a

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,880
 Alien baby and apparently you can bang this dude

61
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,000
 You can bang this dude if you want a kid named Azalea. Could you bang a ghost?

62
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,960
 Did you have a not talking about suck you by either like an actual ghost like some woman who died in the 1800s who looks kind of

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,280
 You know kind of hot and that old pioneer clothing and then like can you banger?

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,300
 That is the immortal question that is truly what every paranormal investigator really wants to know

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,980
 I don't care about orbs

66
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,760
 EVP meters nothing like that and I bang it can I have sex with a ghost and

67
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,480
 preferably like if it's preferably a living baby

68
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,000
 Which would be hilarious to watch a ghost walk around she's like I'm getting pregnant

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,720
 He's like a full-on little baby person that's totally solid inside of a ghost keeps falling out

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,640
 She's like, uh, this is gonna be a long nine months. He has to hold it in or

71
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,440
 Barring a real-life baby from a ghost and maybe the baby has like ghostly eyes

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,040
 Like the eyes are like a ghost blue

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,120
 Barring a human baby born out of a ghost

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,840
 Casper

75
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,720
 I want to if I'm gonna bang a ghost lady if she gives birth to Casper

76
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,560
 That'd be dope because Casper was pretty cool like I mean for what he was he was a bad cartoon

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,240
 But out of all that era of just like really cheesy cartoons you could kick it with Casper

78
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,520
 That is my that is my side to tracking from that

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,340
 Otherwise bizarre story. What would you do if someone just appeared in front of you and said they had a kid?

80
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,600
 Obviously in real life, you'd be like no we don't but if they magically could appear and disappear in a puff of smoke

81
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:07,280
 You'd kind of wonder if maybe at some point you had banged dude and you had a daughter and then what again?

82
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,760
 Super perplexing the less information the scarier really maybe someday he'll meet Azalea

83
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:19,440
 Devon let's put you in that carboner copter. We are going to fly on out to Florida

84
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,300
 Now Devon I chose Devon to be the pilot on this episode

85
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,260
 Because he has the military chops that are going to be needed to keep us safe during this episode

86
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,620
 So everyone gear up put on your BDUs get your guns cocked

87
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,100
 Make sure no teachers are putting bullets in backwards. That's yesterday's episode if you didn't hear that one all of our bullets are in the

88
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:48,780
 Right way we are flying out to Florida Devon's given us the a okay because he is bringing us now over the business a

89
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,500
 Frank Amodio

90
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,940
 It's a very unassuming business just sitting there

91
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,340
 You wouldn't even think anything of it as you're flying 15,000 feet over it

92
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:08,300
 You wouldn't think anything of it if you were walking into the front door, but this business is owned by a man who will someday

93
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:16,740
 Conquer the planet before we get started here. I got to give a shout out to two people first off the person who recommended this story to me

94
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,060
 Der Grob man on YouTube

95
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:27,540
 He recommended it to me about midnight the other night and I was up till about two to thirty reading this article

96
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,780
 Very very fascinating story. Thank you so much for sending it over and I want to give a shout out to the author of the article

97
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,740
 Matthew B Cox he wrote an article called its insanity the bizarre story of a bipolar

98
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,580
 Megalomaniacs insane plan for total world domination. That's not clickbait

99
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,260
 That's what we're gonna be talking about and Matthew did an amazing job and did a ton of interviews with this guy

100
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,780
 Wanted to give a tip of that to him most of the information I got is from his article

101
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:02,800
 I had other sources as well, but as far as all of the interviews and things like that Matthew did an amazing job

102
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,620
 Frank Amodio knew from childhood

103
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,180
 That he was destined to rule mankind

104
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,940
 Divinely destined. It's not just like he woke up one day and goes hey, I want to do that

105
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,820
 He's pointing at a globe someday. I'm gonna own that as a toddler

106
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,600
 These are stories that he told at least as a toddler. He walked away from his daycare

107
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,740
 I don't need you daycare you suck little toddler dudes walking out as little jammy jams. He walks into traffic

108
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,380
 You're like Jason this guy's supposed to rule the planet. He doesn't even know what traffic is

109
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,740
 Well, he is a toddler you would think he would die

110
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,700
 Because generally when toddlers walk into traffic, it's not good. It's not a happy ending

111
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,380
 Eventually a good Samaritan found him and ran over him a couple times like oh

112
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:54,060
 But don't he just ran over the footsie part of his pajamas didn't hit him take some drops him off at his parents house at age

113
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:01,620
 6 he was walking along the train tracks walking tight rope style on the train track and he's walking and then all of a sudden

114
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,620
 He hears a voice in his head saying get off the tracks

115
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,100
 So he got off the tracks and a train drove by almost killed him

116
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,460
 If you hadn't heard that voice in his head

117
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:18,660
 Or if you hadn't heard the sound of an 800 ton mechanical beast from behind him, I don't know if he was listening to Walkman

118
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,340
 I don't think the voice in your head is really what you need to listen to you need to listen to that

119
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:32,000
 Three years later so when he was nine he said that his aunt was like hey

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,500
 Frank you want to come hang out I forgot your name and looked over at my notes. Hey my favorite nephew

121
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
 Frank

122
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,740
 Why don't you come over my place and let's just like hang out do a bunch of stuff, you know like walk on train tracks

123
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,540
 We know you like that

124
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,140
 I got a lot of traffic by my house and Frank's like now I'm good because he actually hears a voice in his head saying don't go to your

125
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,980
 aunt's house tonight and

126
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,060
 Then the next morning his aunt was murdered and her body was found in a dumpster

127
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,980
 She'd been murdered in a fiance's best friend killed her

128
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,340
 So basically he was having these near misses and the fact that he was surviving these things

129
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,020
 meant that God was willing him towards a greater destiny and

130
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,720
 Also, he should probably get his hearing checked because he didn't hear a train coming and as he gets older

131
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,700
 He has a pretty varied life

132
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,380
 He was like going college double major doing all this stuff at one point the CIA was trying to recruit him

133
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,500
 But then his dad felt ill so a lot of this story makes you think that this guy is making this stuff up because we cover

134
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,380
 Blowhards all the time on this show, but early in life. He's telling me stories

135
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,700
 I got a skim over a bunch of the stuff because it's just like he was a lawyer and he was a guy

136
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,740
 It's very very fascinating story and you can read the article for more in-depth stuff

137
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,260
 But I want to kind of get to the meat of the conspiracy realm of it in college

138
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,700
 He comes up with a plan called capital Genesis

139
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,060
 Which is described basically as benevolent

140
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,700
 capitalist

141
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
 fascism the world would be run by

142
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,300
 Corporations and he would run the corporations he basically wanted to push out

143
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,860
 Governments and politicians and create a corporate structure that would rule the planet. He said quote by 2012

144
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,940
 I expect I'll have offices within one hour of every human alive

145
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,560
 Everywhere and the thing was is he was a good businessman

146
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,180
 He knew what he was doing, but he was also this is where we start to get an allegedly type of stuff

147
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,580
 But he was also really good at

148
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,420
 Hiding numbers from his time as an accountant. So he set up this is how his businesses worked he would

149
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,740
 Find businesses that were having financial trouble because he was a bankruptcy attorney by trade before he started this thing

150
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,600
 He would find companies that own a bunch of money to the IRS and then go to the IRS and say hey

151
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,580
 We'll set up a payment plan. We'll pay make these payments every month or every year however the plan was set up or

152
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,220
 I can gut it right now

153
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,860
 I can declare bankruptcy right now, and you'll never get the money and IRS is like yeah, yeah, yeah

154
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,380
 I mean we'd rather have some money later than no money now

155
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,080
 So they're working and while he's doing all this stuff

156
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,380
 He realizes that he can skim

157
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,340
 IRS money from the payroll tax of all these different corporations

158
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,460
 So he'd buy a company they'd pay payroll tax

159
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,860
 But he would take tax dollars from the payroll tax because the IRS is thinking they're gonna get paid in the future anyways

160
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,940
 It was this really weird financial scheme he had going on

161
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,660
 So not only was he getting money from the business as it was continuing to turn a profit because he's revitalizing it

162
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,700
 He was also getting extra money from all of these companies skimming a little bit out of their payroll

163
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,940
 Taxes because the thing is a dictator needs money

164
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,580
 So he wasn't just investing in businesses to help people out or to make short-term goals

165
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,260
 He was going to use this money to fund his plan of world domination

166
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,940
 This all kinds of starts to pick up around 2005. So first he's buying little firms here and there

167
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,980
 There's a little shop in Florida that needs some help. Here's some place in Saskatchewan that needs bigger investment

168
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,580
 He's building up this portfolio of money-making businesses. Then he starts to invest in tactical operations

169
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,940
 He was basically investing in security companies that were then being

170
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,420
 Contracted out by the US government to go do things in other countries that the US government didn't want to be tied to

171
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,380
 Snatching grab operations. You send some people over there. He sends six dudes twelve dudes

172
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,340
 Whatever it is, they'll grab a drug lord off the street grab a witness that the government wants

173
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,180
 Snatch up a terrorist take him back. So he wasn't just running a bunch of kinkos on the side

174
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,740
 He was actually starting to build a security

175
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:47,020
 Operation he buys a couple fighter jets. So right there right there. You should start getting alarm bells

176
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,780
 Sure, people do have private security concerns, but he starts buying fighter jets

177
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,860
 He starts to invest in a factory in Russia. He's going global. He invests in a factory in Russia

178
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,660
 He knows that he needs to be all over the planet if he wants to take over the planet

179
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,180
 He's going he's very successful

180
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,340
 He gets this reputation of taking businesses that otherwise would fail and revitalizing them

181
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:17,900
 Sure, he's skimming a little off of the back end, but nobody really knows that and even the people who work with him

182
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
 Some people kind of knew what he was doing

183
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,140
 Everybody knew that he had bigger ambitions and I should touch on this as well. I touched on it in the headline

184
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,460
 He is bipolar. He's manic depressive

185
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:35,140
 So the people at his job would see him like in this like raw raw super energetic

186
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,100
 This is the way the company's going. Let's all get together and you'd really get everyone all psyched up

187
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,780
 But then he would fall into a deep depression early in his career. It seemed to be worse

188
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,300
 He would just shut down for weeks at a time, but now he's on a roll

189
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,100
 He's just constantly pushing forward and people who work for the companies. They're all making a ton of money

190
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,380
 They know he keeps talking about like taking over the world

191
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,980
 They're like, dude, it's kind of weird. You keep wearing that co-work commander outfit to work

192
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,420
 But we're all making money. What could go wrong?

193
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:09,460
 The democratic republic of konga was having this big election and because of his reputation of kind of

194
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,780
 being able to save companies being really good with numbers

195
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,500
 A one of the political parties reached out to him and said hey listen, there's like 32 people running for president of the

196
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,020
 democratic republic of konga. We would like you to come out

197
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:31,060
 And talk to us and see give us some ideas on how we can if we win how we can revitalize the country

198
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,860
 And then we'll use that as our political platform and it's funny

199
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,460
 Let me take a break here real quick. This story should show more than anything the power of the law of attraction

200
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,820
 There's tons of successful businessmen all over the world

201
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,180
 That would never be contacted by the democratic republic of konga

202
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,820
 But because he was so driven on this idea of having this political power

203
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,260
 It's it's 100 law of attraction. I'll throw I know that sounds mystical to some of you guys

204
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:02,500
 But he's so focused on that. He's putting out into the universe. This is the type of connections he wants and he gets them

205
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,660
 Democratic republic of konga one of the political parties reaches out to him. He goes. Yeah, sure

206
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,220
 He goes over there and he sets up this plan with him and he goes. Okay. Here's what here's what you guys should do

207
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,220
 Take all the mineral wealth in the democratic republic of konga because there's a ton of it

208
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,140
 It's worth like billions if not a trillion dollars worth of minerals over there

209
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,820
 We're going to sell the mineral rights to a middle eastern investors. They'll invest in the country. They'll build up the infrastructure

210
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,460
 It'll be great. It'll be great for everybody. Everyone gets money. Everything gets stabilized over here

211
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,780
 But because he's talking about bringing in foreign investments because he's a foreigner himself

212
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,820
 He has a security team on the ground to work with this political party

213
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,700
 They get arrested because there are a bunch of foreigners

214
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,980
 They're talking about bringing in outside interests and people are super suspicious of them and they're all thrown in jail

215
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,580
 at this point franc's really upset because this is almost like a

216
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,260
 Black eye on this idea that he's going to rule the world someday like his people are actually being detained

217
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,780
 He ends up calling the state department the united states state department

218
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,540
 He's like you guys got to get my people out of there

219
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,060
 They were being used as a propaganda tool every show after they were being marched out put guns to their head

220
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,340
 And then ha ha we're not going to kill you today and take them back into the jail

221
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,540
 So that's a war crime. You can't actually do mock executions. You oddly enough can do real executions

222
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,540
 but the state department is trying to get this all settled and frank tells the state department i have

223
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,500
 100 men ready to go. I have hellfire missiles

224
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,220
 If they try to do anything to my contractors i'm going to level the city

225
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,300
 And his contractors are eventually let go they leave the country

226
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,140
 So after that this is his first big public step into

227
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,340
 International politics. It's actually a news story and people are going how did this guy in florida

228
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,820
 assemble a bunch of shock troopers and hellfire missiles and everything like that

229
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:55,380
 How did this go on but again? It's not raising red flags nato says, you know what we kind of we kind of like your style

230
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:03,140
 How would you with all your business acumen and your security connections like to actually host a nato meeting that we're going to have in latvia

231
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
 Now of course he's like oh

232
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:11,140
 Why you had me at latvia? I was totally down. They're like that was the last word in the sentence. He goes it doesn't matter

233
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,900
 I'm totally down with that. He also meets with president bush president george busch jr at the time

234
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,580
 He meets with them

235
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,220
 They have a meeting about this whole thing that happened in the democratic republic of congo

236
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,740
 Apparently also at that meeting george busch goes walks up to franken goes. Hey, I heard I read the after action report about congo

237
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,180
 And I heard what you said about leveling the city. You're my kind of guy. He's all elbowing him in the ribs

238
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,020
 We both love blowing up cities, don't we so frank is on his way man

239
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:46,420
 President thinks he's pretty dope dude. He's getting invited to nato. He has this small security force

240
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,500
 Everything's going great

241
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,820
 But the people he was backing in the democratic republic of congo election

242
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,140
 They lost the guy the president who had his people arrested won

243
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:03,380
 But frank never passing up an opportunity to take over the planet frank tells the president of congo

244
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
 Yeah, you won and I backed this other guy

245
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,860
 But let me tell you my plan and he lays out that idea about selling the rights to the middle east

246
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,780
 And they're like that actually is a good idea. We need a lot of money invested and the president goes

247
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,860
 You know what I really have a problem with is there is a ethnic group in the area called the buji mai

248
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,380
 He goes they're pretty cool dudes, but no one really likes them

249
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,260
 They're kind of like this impoverished part of our country. They're basically the equivalent of an american hillbilly

250
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,020
 He goes no one likes them. They're kind of out there all by themselves

251
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,900
 I would really like to see them lift it up as well

252
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,340
 So we can have a more unified country because there's like millions of them

253
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,820
 And so frank's sitting there and he goes hey, tell you what I got a plan

254
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,500
 I will guarantee each of them military training

255
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,860
 I have the people who can do it. I have the resources to do it

256
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,740
 I will train all the men of the buji mai region

257
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,780
 There's two million of there's two million of them

258
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,980
 So basically what you are doing is for free because i'm going to train them

259
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,060
 You're going to have a two million man army to help stabilize your country and then later you can help stabilize other parts of africa as well

260
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,340
 presidents like that sounds amazing and frank

261
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,300
 Frank knows what he's doing. He's building a two million man army for him

262
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:22,260
 This is the start of capital genesis. This story is 100 true and it happened just a few years ago

263
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,620
 And it would have kept going on. He would have had this little building in florida and done all of these things made all these maneuvers

264
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,780
 Start an army

265
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,780
 Had it not been for one conversation

266
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,180
 In latvia at the nato summit that he helped organize

267
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,500
 Someone goes hey, so what happened? What exactly happened in the congo?

268
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,780
 Like I read on the newspaper like your people got kidnapped

269
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,620
 And they were there for a couple days and apparently you made some moves and the state department made some moves and they all got let go

270
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:59,300
 What actually happened and he begins talking to all of these nato representatives about capital genesis about his plan

271
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,980
 To take over the world now people will say that the pesh modal writes songs about it. It happens

272
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,220
 But this guy has hellfire missiles

273
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,620
 This guy has a small amount of troops that he already threatened to level the city

274
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,540
 But while he's at this meeting he says he's going through the plan quote once i've created a military

275
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
 a million

276
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,540
 UGMI soldiers i'll use them to stabilize central africa

277
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,020
 Then someone asked what's your objective?

278
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,620
 frank says well obviously once i've built up my peacekeeping force i plan on taking all of africa

279
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,220
 And then he goes on to say he's going to continue to build his military

280
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,700
 He goes a five million man military capable of policing the planet

281
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,660
 We won't need nato anymore

282
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,500
 Probably not the best thing to say to nato meeting probably not the best thing to say at all

283
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,740
 He laid out his plan. He thought the plan was so genius anyone who heard it would have to go along with it capital genesis

284
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,100
 A worldwide corporation ran by him and he had already been taking his first steps

285
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,220
 Now he ends up leaving the nato summit later

286
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,260
 It's not like he's like gotta go once he realized that he revealed his plans the nato summit goes as normal

287
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,340
 But by the time he's headed back home to florida on his private jet

288
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,060
 There are already phone calls

289
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,460
 To the united states government because people are starting to put two and two together one

290
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:28,180
 He has what seems like unlimited wealth two. He already has a private security. He already has quite a few private security forces

291
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,540
 But one was ready to go with hellfire missiles three. He owns fighter jets

292
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,100
 These are all red flags that should have popped up earlier

293
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,860
 But the biggest one for that company. I said that he invested in in russia. He was a factory

294
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:48,260
 That up until a few years before he invested in it built intercontinental ballistic missiles

295
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,580
 By the time his plane landed in florida his companies are already being hit with subpoenas

296
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,380
 The government is sending out people

297
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,460
 Figure out something that this guy's doing illegal because something is wrong and they tried

298
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,700
 Over and over and over again and they could find nothing

299
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:15,380
 Even though he was doing this thing where he was kind of digging into the payroll taxes that money was going to be paid back

300
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,220
 Eventually

301
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,940
 He was saying we owe you 10 million dollars in taxes. I'll declare bankruptcy or you can just pay you later irs

302
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,900
 They go. Yeah, they owed for past taxes. He was taking out current taxes

303
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,180
 It was this weird scheme. It sounds pretty illegal. It probably was illegal

304
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:41,140
 But the government couldn't prove that he was doing anything illegal. He hadn't done anything illegal as far as they could tell

305
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,140
 July 2008 they still can't find anything that's going on with this guy

306
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,700
 But they do get his lawyer

307
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,660
 They're somehow able this is really interesting this article. I read they lean on his lawyer

308
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,660
 I don't know what they found on this lawyer

309
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,180
 I don't know if the lawyer is a good guy and developed a conscience and you know

310
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,700
 Didn't want to take over the planet or if they found something on him

311
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,780
 I'm not for sure but the but the government leaned really really hard on his lawyer

312
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,340
 His lawyer goes listen. You got to take a plea deal for this

313
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,540
 Take a plea deal for pulling money doing this tax scheme

314
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,180
 Do a couple years in prison not a big deal

315
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
 Frank won't do it

316
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,660
 The lawyer goes okay. Well, you know that whole manic depressive bipolar thing you have going on

317
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,780
 I'm going to have you ruled incompetent by a judge

318
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,660
 And then the decision isn't yours

319
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,500
 And you would think that it would be very very hard to do no

320
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,980
 No, not in this dude's case because the government already wanted to clamp down on him

321
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,900
 The lawyer has frank this guy who owns all these companies

322
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:48,580
 Declared incompetent and sent to the mclean psychiatric hospital at that point. He is diagnosed with bipolar disorder

323
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,820
 Which he does have earlier in life. They didn't really know what that was back in the 60s 70s 80s

324
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,700
 There wasn't really a thing. You were just depressed and that even wasn't a medical condition

325
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,540
 He was medicated very heavily a september 22nd 2008. So just a couple months later

326
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:13,060
 His lawyer has frank in court and says hey my client is now ready to plead guilty. He's competent

327
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,620
 We know he was in that psychiatric hospital for a while

328
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,220
 He's now ready to plead guilty to these charges your honor and the judge looks over at frank and he's literally

329
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,860
 Druling as he's sitting there. He's so pumped full of anti psychotic medicine. He's drooling in court

330
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,940
 The judge is like, okay, I'll take it. I'll take it. Yeah, he seems competent in totally

331
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,260
 He owns 70 companies and it taken a total of 64 million dollars

332
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,460
 In the end through all sorts of other shenanigans that were going on in the end. He did get

333
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,300
 Sentenced because he plead guilty. He was competent even though he's all

334
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,060
 Quite guilty. He got 22 years in prison. He's still alive. He's still in prison

335
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,860
 For quite a few years. He was drugged out of his mind

336
00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:00,740
 Not by choice the prison authorities were keeping him on drugs and then when he finally gets off the drugs

337
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,860
 It had been a couple years. He's a lawyer by trade

338
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,340
 He starts to realize stuff. He goes first off

339
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,300
 I was a ward of the state when I was declared incompetent

340
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,500
 I was a ward of the state and by not having my own

341
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,460
 It doesn't matter whether or not i'm competent or someone else says i'm competent if i'm still a ward of the state

342
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:24,580
 I can't take a plea deal to when I was declared incompetent. There was someone else who was appointed as my

343
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,780
 Guardian it wasn't a lawyer. They should have been present as well

344
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,660
 When I took the plea deal

345
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,180
 Even the judge said had I known he was a ward of the state

346
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,180
 I can't take a plea deal if someone's a ward of the state. You should have realized the guy was drooling

347
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,460
 That should have been your first thing

348
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,300
 But he goes maybe there was just a really juicy steak and I couldn't see so the judge was like maybe that's why he was drooling

349
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,940
 The government actually did take a look at all of his findings frank puts this thing together and goes to the government

350
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,660
 Look at all these problems with the trial and my lawyer didn't have my best interest in mine

351
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,180
 A lawyer has to have your best interest in mine. My lawyer was actively working to get me thrown in jail

352
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,940
 So this stinks. I need to be let out and the government looks at it and they go you're right

353
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,860
 You're right. However, you only have one year after you are sentenced

354
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,940
 To argue that your lawyer didn't have your best interest in mine. It's like five years later

355
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,980
 He's like, yeah, but I was struck down the government was pumping me full of drugs and they're like, no, that's the deadline, dude

356
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,740
 so

357
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,140
 Frank still sits in prison now actually runs a law firm in prison

358
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,100
 He's constantly getting inmate sentences reduced some of them released

359
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,660
 He has other inmates working as paralegals

360
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,380
 Oddly enough, he stole about 60 million from the government through that IRS scheme

361
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,580
 He saved the government 83 million dollars

362
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:54,340
 In housing criminals by getting them let off to wrap this up. Let's go back to matthew cox's article here

363
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,660
 I'm gonna read you this passage from it and it really should give you an idea of where

364
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,220
 Frank's mind is at right now

365
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:08,500
 Matthew asks quote, how long did you think it was going to take for you to conquer the world and become emperor?

366
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,580
 Frank says you keep speaking in past tense

367
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,380
 I'm going to do this

368
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,540
 I will be emperor

369
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,020
 I will be emperor

370
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,820
 When Matthew says, you know, you're kind of getting getting older Frank completely dismisses that there's still time

371
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,540
 Moses started when he was 80 when I walk out of those gates

372
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:38,900
 My legions and I will march on washington burn the miserable constitution and the president will kneel at my feet

373
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,140
 My flag will fly above every city in this country

374
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,220
 and then

375
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
 the world

376
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,300
 It's interesting to look at a megalomaniac who failed

377
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,500
 Which to be fair, I guess a lot of them do

378
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:02,020
 But to have someone who actually dedicates their life to trying to take over the planet every edgy teenager imagines it, but he actually

379
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,700
 Took steps to do it actually may have

380
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,420
 Succeeded given a long enough time the idea of him marching out of jail with his legions and the president kneeling before him

381
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,220
 That's obviously a delusion of grandeur now

382
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:22,260
 But if his plan had been able to continue and he had amassed a five million man army in africa

383
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,060
 I don't know if the president would be kissing his feet, but he'd definitely be in a position of

384
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,460
 immense power

385
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,740
 And this is a type of person I talk about when I always talk about the Illuminati when I say I don't think there's one group

386
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,100
 Controlling the planet

387
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,220
 I think there's dozens if not hundreds of smaller groups each maneuvering their way

388
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,940
 Each one trying to conquer the planet

389
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:50,180
 But their alliances and their infighting and all this stuff going on and that represents the chaos of the world

390
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,340
 This is what i'm talking about this man became a key player

391
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,700
 He was just some college student who was a lawyer for a while

392
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,020
 He kind of bumbled his way through life

393
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,220
 And ended up coming very close

394
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:09,380
 To being a dominant player in world politics. This is the Illuminati

395
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,700
 It's people like this and whether a couple of them team up to form a group

396
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,660
 Or you just have a lot of lone wolves out there. These are the people that can really affect

397
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,820
 world politics

398
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,300
 It doesn't take a group to control a television station. It just takes a guy like this to own a television station

399
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,900
 And the creepiest thing is that this is chaos

400
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,620
 This is full chaos. It's almost more comforting to think that one group

401
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:42,820
 Rules the entire planet because that way you can focus all your energy on one group and everything that goes wrong

402
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,300
 You can ascribe it to that one group

403
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,060
 But to know that there are people like this in our lifetime

404
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,740
 Who are able to maneuver this and the only thing that tripped him up was him opening his mouth in front of the wrong people

405
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,660
 That's terrifying because that's pure chaos had he gotten an icbm

406
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,220
 And he was in a manic episode

407
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,020
 And he's threatening to destroy cities

408
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,220
 Raw chaos

409
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,380
 Knowing someone is in control even if they are evil can be more comforting than

410
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,740
 thinking that random people can just pop up

411
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,500
 By a missile factory and start taking over the world

412
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,660
 That's why more people want to believe that 9/11 was an inside job versus

413
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:31,460
 Some dude 3 000 miles away gets 19 people to change the scope of american history

414
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,220
 Because chaos is terrifying

415
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,180
 And control is comforting

416
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:44,500
 That's why people like frank scared the government into doing whatever it would take to get him behind bars

417
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 Because people like frank are true loose cannons

418
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,380
 And he's not alone

419
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,220
 There's probably thousands of other people out there just like him

420
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,460
 Who not only dream about taking over the world. We all do that

421
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,860
 Reshaping the world in our image, but knowing how to do it

422
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,900
 The government was able to stop frank will they be able to stop the next one?

423
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,780
 And the next one and the next one?

424
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,460
 Or will there be a day when you wake up a new flag is flying over your city?

425
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,260
 You see the president on bended knees

426
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:25,540
 Kissing the foot of a man you never even knew existed

427
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,460
 But is now the king of the planet

428
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,380
 We may think that sounds far-fetched, but to frank

429
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,100
 It's just a matter of time

430
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,620
