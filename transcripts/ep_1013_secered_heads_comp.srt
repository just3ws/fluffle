1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 A man finds himself pulled into the bowels of hell.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,160
 And it turns out that hell isn't what you thought it was.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,640
 I mean, it is eternal torment, but we'll get to that story.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
 It's quite odd.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
 I was a little disappointed.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,120
 I was a little disappointed how hell turned out.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:30,680
 And then we meet a young boy who has a terrifying dream of a blood-soaked bathroom.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,320
 But that's all it was, right?

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 A dream.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:42,040
 Well, that's what he thought, until as an adult he found himself walking into that exact

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,760
 same bathroom.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:57,400
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,600
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,480
 Hope it was lots and lots of fun.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,560
 So we're going to get started right away, first off.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:18,080
 Everyone who always knows how to have fun, whether it's the weekend or not, is today's

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
 book buyer.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
 I think I need to give you guys an official title.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,360
 I got a new book sent to me, so everyone get on your feet and give a round of applause

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
 for Tayshana.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
 Woohoo!

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
 Yeah, walk on in, Tayshana!

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,520
 Bringing that book cart and all of them books.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,080
 Tayshana recently purchased off my Amazon wish list the book about the history of Black

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,320
 Buster video called Built to Fail, the inside story of Black Buster's incredible bust.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
 I actually got this book.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,160
 Thank you so much, Tayshana.

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,720
 I got this book as I was leaving to go to the doctor to get my COVID medication.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,760
 They put me on some pretty gnarly antivirals and they locked me.

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,960
 They didn't lock me.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,040
 Let's not exaggerate, but I did have to sit in this pod outside of the medical center

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,000
 for a while and I read like half the book.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
 So it was a great timing.

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
 I love Blockbuster.

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,680
 I love those video stories.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
 It's a really interesting book.

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,720
 The answer, it starts off by saying, "I'm sure you think that Blockbuster failed because

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
 of Netflix."

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
 That's what everybody thinks.

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,880
 That's what even Blockbuster executives think.

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,800
 The reason why it fell apart was because Netflix came around and knocked them off, but that

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 is not the case.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
 That is not the case.

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,160
 The book does a really good job detailing the fall of Blockbuster video.

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,040
 And that was a big part of my childhood.

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,760
 So thank you, Tayshana, for sending me that book.

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,120
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,160
 If you guys can't support the show, if you guys can't buy me books, that's totally fine.

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,360
 It really, really is.

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
 That helps out so, so much.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,160
 And I see you guys doing it.

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,960
 I see you guys talking about it online.

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,040
 So that is absolutely fantastic.

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:57,280
 Tayshana, let's go ahead and I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,360
 We're going to drive all the way out to Michigan.

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:10,560
 And we're not going to be spending a lot of time in Michigan.

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,520
 So if you're hoping to go see all the tourist sites in Michigan, are there any?

65
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
 Probably not.

66
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,080
 But if you were hoping to see those things, walk around, you're like, "Well, that's about

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
 it.

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
 Nothing historical happened here."

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,960
 We're not going to be here for long.

70
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,560
 Don't worry.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,640
 Because we're actually going to hell.

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
 We're going to hell.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,880
 I'm sure that's far more entertaining than Michigan.

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,080
 But we have to make a stop here because we're about to meet a priest named Gerald Johnson.

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,080
 And Gerald Johnson recently posted this story on TikTok about the time he went to hell.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,280
 I know it's a little weird, right?

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,960
 There's going to be a lot of questions you have about this.

78
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,640
 I actually think he probably did really experience something.

79
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,840
 It is kind of weird that if you had happened to plummet through multiple dimensions and

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,800
 found yourself in the one known as hell, you would post about it on TikTok.

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
 Maybe he's given sermons on this.

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
 I don't think the first thing he did when he came back to life is like, "Give me my

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
 phone.

84
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,200
 I have to release a one minute long video on this."

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,240
 He probably talked to his congregation and things like that.

86
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,640
 We know about it because of his TikTok videos.

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,200
 It's gone viral.

88
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 The time he went to hell.

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,840
 I mean, if anything's going to go viral, right?

90
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,680
 It's the story of a priest who went to hell and came back.

91
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,880
 Gerald Johnson said back in 2016 he had a heart attack.

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,200
 Michigan was just too exciting for him and he's like, "I can't take it anymore."

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,840
 He had a heart attack and he said, "I felt my soul leaving my body.

94
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
 This was it.

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,800
 I was done and it was time for me to go up and sit with the Lord in heaven because I'd

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
 done nothing but good works on earth.

97
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,600
 I dedicated my life to Christ."

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
 So that's part of the deal, right?

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
 I did that.

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,520
 So now I get to go to heaven, but what he realized very quickly was that he was headed

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,200
 in the wrong direction.

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,800
 So he says that hell, literal hell, the dimension that souls go to be tormented until the end

103
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,960
 of time, is in the middle of the earth.

104
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,200
 He goes, "That's true.

105
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,560
 There's not a molten core there.

106
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,680
 Well, it is probably pretty hot down there."

107
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,200
 But he goes, "You actually go through the planet.

108
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,240
 You're going through the crust.

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,680
 You're going through the mantle."

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,160
 All that stuff is just like you're bored.

111
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,200
 You're looking at your watch as you're passing dinosaur skeletons.

112
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,800
 And then finally he found himself in hell and he couldn't figure out why he was down

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 here.

114
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 He should have gone to heaven.

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,720
 All of the good works he's done, why is he in hell?

116
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,280
 Just the theory, just the idea right now of a priest going to hell, that in and of itself

117
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,040
 is fascinating.

118
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,800
 The end near-death experience is being negative is also super fascinating because we see most

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,120
 near-death experiences are heavenly or this peaceful utopia, pure bliss.

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
 We did a whole episode on negative near-death experiences.

121
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,160
 I'll put that in the show notes.

122
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,520
 But we're about to meet a man we've already met and we're waving goodbye to his soul.

123
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
 He's getting dragged in hell by demons.

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
 We're like, "See you later, man."

125
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
 We're taking the watch off of his body.

126
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,560
 He's getting pulled into hell.

127
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,880
 But he goes on to say the things I saw down there were "indescribable."

128
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,480
 Which I would imagine, I was saying about this the other day, I will be disappointed if the

129
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,960
 afterlife has a floor.

130
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,080
 I was looking at some image, some fractal version of the afterlife and there was a floor.

131
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,000
 And I go, "I'll be really disappointed that when I die and I go to the world after this

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,880
 one if there's ground.

133
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,600
 I want nothing underneath me.

134
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
 I just want to fly around."

135
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
 And not land.

136
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,080
 But knowing that there's ground is a limiter.

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,640
 Even if I could fly through the ground, I'm like, "Oh, now I'm just underground.

138
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
 It's kind of boring.

139
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
 Like, are there tunnels down here?

140
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
 I don't know.

141
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,440
 But I don't want there to be any ground."

142
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 Does that make sense?

143
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
 You're like, "No, Jason, that might be the weirdest thing you've ever said on this fly

144
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
 to gas."

145
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,400
 And you said a lot, "If I die and all of a sudden I'm standing on a cloud, I'm going

146
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
 to be like, "What's in this cloud?

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 What's in this cloud?

148
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 I have this first thing.

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
 Not where all my loved ones.

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,680
 Did we win the war against the insectoids?"

151
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,960
 When I die, the first thing I'm going to ask is, "What's in this cloud?"

152
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,560
 I'm all swimming around in it.

153
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,880
 They're like, "Oh, you're destroying our firmament."

154
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
 No ground.

155
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
 I don't want any dirt.

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,240
 Not that I'm against dirt, but what I'm saying is ground is a limiter.

157
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,560
 So if I die and then I just appear on a slightly more peaceful earth, I'm going to be kind

158
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
 of bummed out.

159
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,720
 I mean, I love earth.

160
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,080
 But I wonder just how abstract things are.

161
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,960
 So when he said what I saw was indescribable, I go, "No ground, no ground, right?

162
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,200
 There's no ground down there."

163
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,800
 I think me and Mr. Johnson, I don't know if he goes by Father Johnson, but because I

164
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,360
 don't believe he's a Catholic priest, but me and Gerald Johnson, where we differ, I think,

165
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,040
 is that when I say indescribable, I would think it's so abstract that the human mind,

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,360
 there's no words in any known language that can explain what's in front of me.

167
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,840
 Like, it is truly indescribable.

168
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,760
 He then goes on, though, to describe in relatively, I mean, it's just, it's underwears.

169
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 Underwhelming is what I'm kidding.

170
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
 That was the long way to say it.

171
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,640
 I was like, "Oh, that's hell."

172
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
 Sounds kind of lame.

173
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,160
 Now, again, if you were there and you knew you were going to be there for all of eternity,

174
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,600
 you'd be the most horrific place to be, it was indescribable.

175
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,640
 But then he tells us, he gives us two anecdotes from hell.

176
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,460
 One is terrifying, but still a little underwhelming.

177
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,320
 He says when he's down there, he goes, "Everything is spoken of telepathically.

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 You instinctively know what's going on everywhere."

179
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,440
 Now, that's cool.

180
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
 That's cool detail, right?

181
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
 That would be something I would think would happen in the afterlife, the limitations of

182
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
 language.

183
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
 Why would those be a thing in the afterlife?

184
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,120
 Most people probably had their tongues ripped out the first time they showed up there.

185
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,360
 But anyways, he comes down and he goes, "I knew all this stuff instantly telepathically."

186
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,120
 He goes, "I saw a demon."

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,680
 He didn't explain what the demon looked like.

188
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,440
 Was it like a really cool demon?

189
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,080
 Was it CGI?

190
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,880
 Looked like a guy in a rubber suit?

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,960
 We don't know.

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,320
 But anyways, he saw a demon walking by.

193
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,760
 Which ever is there, that's kind of funny, right?

194
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,080
 You're just like, "Oh, no, I'm in hell."

195
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,000
 And the demon's like, "Hey, hey Jerry."

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 This demon walks by and he has a human pet.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,680
 He said there was a human walking on all fours like a dog.

198
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,080
 His eyes bulging out of his head.

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,160
 And this demon had a leash around his neck and was walking him like a dog.

200
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,560
 And the dude's skin was completely burned off.

201
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,120
 It was just all like just open sores, muscle tissue being exposed to the element.

202
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,640
 And he's crawling on the ground, his eyes bulging out of his head, and the demon is

203
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,160
 walking him like a dog.

204
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,920
 And he goes, "I telepathically knew that this is creepy."

205
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,120
 Like again, you can hear like Jason that dog part was pretty creepy too.

206
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,720
 I thought this was creepier.

207
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,200
 He said, "I knew that when that man was born on earth, that demon who's now walking him

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:51,840
 like a dog, that demon was sent up there to torment him from babyhood to adulthood to

209
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
 death."

210
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,160
 This demon had followed this man around from the time that he was a child to the time that

211
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,360
 he died constantly tempting him, constantly leading him from the path of salvation.

212
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,880
 And the demon had won.

213
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,240
 The demon had broken this man over the course of his life and now this man will forever

214
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
 be a slave in hell to this demon.

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,760
 And he goes, "That's how demons work.

216
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,560
 If they can earn your soul, if they can constantly keep you off the right path of why you were

217
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:34,200
 put here on earth in the first place, they have you as their slave forever in hell."

218
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
 I was like, "That's really cool.

219
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,080
 That's really cool world building."

220
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,520
 I had never heard that theory before.

221
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,560
 I mean, obviously demons tempting people.

222
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,760
 That's nothing new, but the idea that the demon gets something out of it other than

223
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,040
 just satisfaction of leading people astray.

224
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,520
 It was the fact that they earned that soul in hell.

225
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,320
 I was like, "Wow, that's really creepy."

226
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,480
 But I also keep picturing this guy walking on his hands and knees.

227
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,440
 Now see, if I went to hell, here's the thing.

228
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,280
 I would imagine things way grosser than that.

229
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
 You know what I'm saying?

230
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,680
 The goal is what you can imagine.

231
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,440
 And please don't say what is going to come out of your mouth, because I'm sure it's horrific.

232
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
 So not what you imagine.

233
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,840
 It's what's really down there.

234
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,640
 If I saw a man walking on all fours on fire, it's going to all been burned off, and a demon

235
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
 had a leash around his neck.

236
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,680
 I would wonder, I'd go, "Hey demon, why does he still...

237
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,880
 I'm hoping the demon's out there like, "Oh, we didn't think about that."

238
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,360
 Wouldn't it be better instead of him walking on his hands and his knees?

239
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,440
 Why don't you cut off his calves so then he's walking on like open stumps as well?

240
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,240
 Because a dog doesn't have long legs.

241
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
 He walks on all fours.

242
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,680
 I'm just going to cut the legs.

243
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
 I'm just going to give you the claim.

244
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,840
 We're all going to take care of it.

245
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,560
 I would assume or turn him into a dog.

246
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,040
 Turn him into Snoopy or something.

247
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,880
 Turn him into a dog, but with a human brain.

248
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,360
 He's constantly like, "No, no, I used to be a man.

249
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,240
 I used to be a man, and now I'm Snoopy in hell."

250
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,440
 There's way worse stuff.

251
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 You know what I mean?

252
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,440
 So, I mean, it's like that is really cool world building, the fact that the demons earn

253
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
 your soul.

254
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,040
 But like, listen, just to be clear, I don't want to walk on all fours for all of eternity.

255
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,040
 That would suck, but I think it would be way worse if I was walking on like open stumps.

256
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,320
 Like, yes, Jason, you're right.

257
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,640
 You're right.

258
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,840
 Demons aren't cruel enough.

259
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,440
 Well, if you think that, we got one other place to visit.

260
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,840
 This guy listed two places.

261
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,440
 One, he saw a dog walk by, and not a dog.

262
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,840
 He saw a man acting like a dog walk by.

263
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,960
 And I also thought that's some people's fetish.

264
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,440
 If they read that, they're like, "Get the hell please."

265
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,280
 They're like, they used to be really good people, and now they're like just start messing

266
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
 stuff up.

267
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,440
 They're like pushing kids over, and then they're like, "All right, I'm going to go and tell

268
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,880
 them to be one of those dog people for eternity."

269
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
 Ruff, ruff.

270
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,320
 You know, like, people are into that.

271
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,080
 Some people are into that.

272
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,320
 There's another part of hell that he went to that is all music.

273
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,720
 All music all the time.

274
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
 It's very interesting.

275
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,360
 I remember, it is stated that Lucifer, I don't know if it's actually in the Bible, but it

276
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,640
 might be.

277
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,800
 But I remember growing up that hearing that Lucifer was the angel of music.

278
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:41,680
 And there was always a group of Christians who believed that music itself was satanic.

279
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,200
 That's interesting because music is such a part of the human condition.

280
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,440
 Any baby, any baby at all, will start moving to a rhythm.

281
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,680
 It's just part of the human condition.

282
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,160
 There's a demon behind him dancing.

283
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,480
 He's like, "Oh, we're going to have a fun time when you're in hell as an adult dog."

284
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,920
 But anyways, as babies dance, everyone has some sense of rhythm to them.

285
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,520
 Part of the human condition, but I've also heard that Lucifer is the angel of music.

286
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,920
 Like, all music comes from Satan, even Christian music.

287
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,840
 I actually want to do a little more research on that.

288
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,520
 I might do a, that is a topic one of these days because it's fascinating.

289
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:26,440
 Anyways, this part of hell is the musical part of hell, but it's demons singing the

290
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,160
 songs and you're trapped there and you have to listen to demons sing these songs all the

291
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
 time.

292
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,480
 I mean, this is a big ramp down from the guy who's a dog walking around on hot coals

293
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,760
 for the rest of time versus you sitting there listening to music.

294
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,680
 You're like, "Okay, this is bad, but it's not that bad."

295
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,440
 You're pointing out at that guy.

296
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,200
 He names, here's the problem.

297
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
 I remember my dad said this.

298
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,400
 My dad's Southern Baptist minister growing up.

299
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,840
 He goes, "Don't ever describe heaven or hell."

300
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,040
 He goes, "Most religions don't really go into detail with the afterlife because the thing

301
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,360
 is, is it gets outdated really, really quickly.

302
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,120
 If you had a religion today, if Southern Baptists were using the definition of heaven based

303
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,720
 on statements made in 30 AD, it would be completely outdated.

304
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,480
 It would be stuff like, you'll sit there and you'll see wheat fields as far as the eye

305
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,160
 can see and all of the olive and date trees you could ever imagine."

306
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,840
 People now are like, "I don't want any of that stuff.

307
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,200
 I have a gluten intolerance and I hate olives."

308
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,480
 So you can't really go into detail of what heaven and hell is because the terms just

309
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
 become outdated.

310
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,120
 I think that's the thing here too.

311
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,120
 You can detail hell and you can go, there's a satanic symphony there to punish people

312
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,880
 specifically who listened to secular music on earth and didn't listen to music that

313
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,520
 uplifted God's message.

314
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,240
 So now they're trapped here.

315
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,880
 But he names the songs.

316
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,400
 Like if you just leave it at that, you're like, "Oh, that would be horrible to hear

317
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
 a bunch of demons.

318
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,640
 This horrific cacophony of guttural noises."

319
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,120
 No, they're actually singing, "Don't Worry, Be Happy."

320
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,120
 What do you imagine would get kind of old after the one billionth time?

321
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,640
 Don't Worry, Be Happy and apparently also Rihanna's song Umbrella, which has long been

322
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,840
 rumored to be a love song written to Lucifer to begin with.

323
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,640
 But I mean, like that, it's just from the novelty alone, right?

324
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,200
 It would be like going to see the Chuck E. Cheese band do their version of Like a Virgin

325
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,320
 by Madonna, right?

326
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
 Just the novelty of it.

327
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,080
 Sure, it's going to sound terrible, but it would be something you could say, "It was

328
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
 so weird.

329
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
 I went to Chuck E. Cheese the other night.

330
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
 They were playing Like a Virgin."

331
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,880
 You're like, "What?"

332
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
 So that's it.

333
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,600
 That was all that he could tell us about hell.

334
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,880
 He might have other stuff that truly is indescribable.

335
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,360
 It was like a very short TikTok video and he says, "Just talking about it makes his

336
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
 nauseous."

337
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
 Oh, I guess I should wrap up this story.

338
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,200
 I was like, "Oh, and he's still in hell to this day.

339
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 He's TikToking from hell."

340
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,800
 He said that while he's in hell and he's listening to this horrific music, he's like,

341
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,920
 "No, no, Bob McFerrin, what have you done to my soul?"

342
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,640
 He starts to get really mad at God and he's like, "God, I was your servant on earth.

343
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,040
 Why did you send me to hell?"

344
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,000
 And God reaches down and picks him up and is pulling him out of hell and he goes, "I

345
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,680
 thought this was interesting because this is true, I think, for everybody."

346
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,200
 He goes, "You did good stuff, but you hated your enemies.

347
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,920
 Not only did you hate your enemies, you in your heart wished that I would punish them.

348
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,120
 You wanted divine eternal punishment against people who had simply wronged you over on

349
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,720
 the galactic scale fairly minor things.

350
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,320
 You're not on earth to wish my punishment upon other people.

351
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,400
 I've forgiven you.

352
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,600
 If you can't forgive them, then are you truly forgiven?"

353
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,960
 It was basically like a life lesson and brought him back to life.

354
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,360
 He said, "Go forth and tell the TikTokers what happened here."

355
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,280
 It's an interesting story.

356
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,920
 I think he had some experience.

357
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,080
 I'm not saying that he's making it up or he's a fraud or anything like that.

358
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,880
 I think he probably did have some sort of experience.

359
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,760
 They do have negative non-death experiences.

360
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,400
 I just thought it was fascinating, one that you had a man of the cloth get thrown to hell.

361
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440
 And then also just like, "Yeah, I feel like that hell was a little underwhelming."

362
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,160
 I guess I just thought it was going to be, there's going to be like more pizzazz or something

363
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
 like that.

364
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,320
 Or even just scarier, right?

365
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,880
 What would be scarier to you?

366
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
 You die because that's already terrifying.

367
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
 I couldn't mention that sometime we're all going to die.

368
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,560
 You die and then you find yourself walking on all fours.

369
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,920
 You're on fire.

370
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,400
 Your skin's been seared off and there's a demon as at least around your neck.

371
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,360
 Now again, some of you guys are like, "You like that stuff?

372
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,440
 You're totally into it.

373
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,200
 What scarier though that?"

374
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,360
 Or you die and it's pitch black.

375
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 You can't see anything.

376
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,360
 I'm just going to start listing off a bit of this stuff.

377
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
 I think you guys know where this is going.

378
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 Imagine it's in the pitch black.

379
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
 Forget being able to see other stuff because then you can be like, "Hey, Johnny, you see

380
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,560
 a guy being treated like a pony?

381
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,760
 A demon's riding him?"

382
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,240
 You're like, "That guy's way worse off than I am.

383
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,740
 I'm just walking."

384
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,720
 That guy has a demon on his back.

385
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
 You're pitch black.

386
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
 You think you're all alone.

387
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,840
 There's no one around you and your skin is falling off.

388
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,200
 You can actually feel it melting off of you.

389
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
 You're trying to keep it out of your mouth and out of your eyes and stuff like that.

390
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,720
 You're just screaming and then, okay, I'll just stop because I can honestly go on for

391
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
 another five minutes.

392
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 I was like, "And then the maggots show up."

393
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,760
 You can feel the last meal you ate before you died rotting in your dead corpse of a

394
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,920
 stomach and then the maggots are filling you up.

395
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,000
 You're like, "Bloat flies are shooting at me."

396
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 That's what hell.

397
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,280
 That's what I would imagine hell was like, right?

398
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,840
 You can feel your body decaying in the grave and then, okay, never mind, never mind, I'll

399
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,240
 stop, I'll stop.

400
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,840
 I just thought there'd be more of a disaster.

401
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:44,680
 If hell is just people walking on all fours listening to bad pop songs, that's not too

402
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
 bad.

403
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
 That's not too bad.

404
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:55,000
 But on between bursting and between bursting in the darkness, your body just being exposed

405
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,840
 to the elements of millions of maggots hatch.

406
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,280
 It comes to filling out your innards or listening to "Don't Worry, Be Happy."

407
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:10,160
 I think, Father Jerry Johnson, I think his hell is probably better.

408
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,400
 Tayshauna, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonic copter.

409
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,160
 We're leaving behind hell.

410
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 We have new pets.

411
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,680
 We have this little-- don't bring them on the helicopter.

412
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,760
 It's like, "Oh, he's so cute.

413
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,120
 I want to save his eyes are bulging out."

414
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,640
 We're going to save this guy.

415
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,040
 We're taking this guy out of hell.

416
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,920
 Tayshauna Flyus out of hell.

417
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:41,680
 We're going to head all the way out to a house in the suburbs.

418
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,120
 So we're walking out of the carbonic copter and we see this house.

419
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,240
 Looks like every other house in the area.

420
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
 We don't have a location for this story.

421
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,400
 We don't really have a time period as well.

422
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
 Or names.

423
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,560
 This was posted online by someone going by the name Emotional Crest 1272.

424
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,440
 We're going to go ahead and call her Carla.

425
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,840
 One day Carla's sitting at home alone with her stepdad.

426
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,680
 We're going to call him Tony.

427
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
 Now Tony's the stepdad.

428
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,800
 He's a relatively recent addition to this family.

429
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,200
 He's been with them for a couple of years.

430
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,440
 You have Tony, you have Carla.

431
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,560
 You have Carla's mom, Carla's little brother.

432
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,560
 That was the family unit for years until Tony showed up.

433
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,600
 And they've gotten married at this point.

434
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,080
 Not Carla and Tony.

435
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,200
 Tony and the mom have gotten married at this point.

436
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
 He's officially part of the family and they're making it work.

437
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,640
 They're really making it work.

438
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,960
 But one day mom's gone, little brother's gone.

439
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,800
 It's just Tony and Carla sitting on a couch watching television.

440
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 Watching a movie.

441
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,960
 In the middle of the movie Tony goes, "You want to hear something just crazy?"

442
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,200
 Like, "I've told your mom about this and I don't really think she believed it that much."

443
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
 Or, "Alright, I don't know.

444
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,160
 I don't know."

445
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,000
 But this story is insane.

446
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,680
 This story is so crazy.

447
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,560
 Who's going to turn down an offer like that?

448
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,800
 You're sitting at home alone with someone and they go, "Hey, you want to hear something

449
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 insane?"

450
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,360
 Carla goes, "Sure, yeah, what do you got for me?"

451
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,680
 Tony says, "When I was a boy, I was a boy."

452
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,800
 This is long before I met your mom.

453
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,720
 Long before you and your brother were even born, really.

454
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 When I was a boy, I had a nightmare.

455
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,440
 I woke up into the dream and I walked through the house.

456
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,720
 It wasn't the house that I lived in as a boy.

457
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 Never been there before.

458
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:59,840
 I walked through this house and I find myself in the bathroom of that house.

459
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:07,560
 And in this bathroom, there's a witch or to be more specific, a witchy looking woman.

460
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,840
 That's how he really described it.

461
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,960
 It was a woman who looked like a witch but I'm standing in this bathroom and there's

462
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,440
 this witch standing there and she's laughing maniacally.

463
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,240
 And he goes, "Carla, this is the weird thing.

464
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,000
 I had that dream."

465
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,640
 And it's terrified me so much.

466
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,960
 I remembered the exact details about the bathroom, including the pattern of the bathroom tiles

467
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,520
 on the floor.

468
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
 It terrified me.

469
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:42,680
 I thought about that dream for years and years went by and I started dating your mom.

470
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,960
 You remember that old house you guys lived in?

471
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,320
 The house you guys lived in when me and your mom started dating?

472
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,480
 Carla's like, "Yeah, I remember that."

473
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,800
 And then he goes, "I remember the first time I came over to that house.

474
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,520
 When I went into the bathroom of that house, that was the bathroom from my dream.

475
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:11,520
 It was the exact same bathroom I saw years before I even met your mom.

476
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,640
 Long before you two were even born, I had this dream that I was in the bathroom at your

477
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
 old house."

478
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,200
 Carla's like, "That is insane.

479
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 That's an insane story.

480
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,840
 What are the chances of that where you see in the future?

481
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
 Coincidence?

482
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,040
 How many different layouts of bathrooms can you have?

483
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 That is quite odd."

484
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:38,760
 Tony goes, "That's not the insane part."

485
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,200
 Tony said when I was a kid, I had this dream that I walked into a bathroom, a bathroom

486
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:52,040
 that I didn't recognize until years later when I swung by your old house.

487
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,440
 Had a dream that I was in this bathroom and inside the bathroom was a witchy looking woman

488
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,040
 laughing maniacally.

489
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:10,680
 The bathtub in that bathroom was filled to the brim with blood.

490
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:21,840
 When I look into that bathtub and floating in the bathtub of blood was three severed

491
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,320
 human heads.

492
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,040
 The witchy woman is cackling.

493
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:41,360
 Her laugh is echoing through this small bathroom as I'm looking down at these three heads floating

494
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,240
 in a pool of blood.

495
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,920
 Now when I had that dream as a young boy, I didn't know who those three heads belonged

496
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,240
 to.

497
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:01,600
 But eventually, years later, I recognized them.

498
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:13,960
 They were the heads of your mother, your brother, and you.

499
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,280
 Tony said, "I never told you guys that story."

500
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,200
 I didn't even tell your mom that story as long as you guys lived at that old house.

501
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
 Never told you.

502
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,000
 Because I figured it would terrify you.

503
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,800
 Freak out, right?

504
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,440
 But since we've moved, I've told your mom, now I've told you, "Wait for the little

505
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
 brother to come home.

506
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
 I'll tell him too."

507
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,880
 You guys have told your mother, I've told you, "I don't know what it means, really.

508
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,840
 It's just a horrifying nightmare.

509
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,240
 I knew exactly the bathroom that I saw in my dream when I walked into it in real life.

510
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:55,000
 And then one day, dawned on me, I recognized those heads of those you guys."

511
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:04,160
 Carla said, she goes, "I did end up asking my mom if she had ever heard this story."

512
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,680
 And the mom responded, "Yeah, he told me about that."

513
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,520
 But didn't seem to offer any other sort of read on how she felt about the situation,

514
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,400
 was she concerned?

515
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,800
 Did she brush it off?

516
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 Did she think he was joking?

517
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,560
 And that's the other thing, Carla, though.

518
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,680
 She goes, "I don't know if he's messing with me."

519
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,320
 Like he could just be making this up to push my buttons.

520
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,800
 I mean, you know, everyone wants to be at a severed head in a bloody bathtub.

521
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,360
 Is he making it up to push my buttons?

522
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,360
 If that's the case, why would he tell my mom about it?

523
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,760
 Did he make it up as a joke?

524
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,200
 Did he make it up to scare me?

525
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
 Or is it real?

526
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,600
 And she goes, "Really?

527
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 Either way, it's terrifying."

528
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:56,400
 Like if he's just joking, it's a pretty terrifying joke.

529
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:04,600
 But if he's telling the truth, it's a fascinating story, right?

530
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
 There's some key details missing again.

531
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,640
 We don't know really the age that he had the dream.

532
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
 Was he like seven?

533
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,960
 I guess it doesn't matter if he's seven or 27.

534
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,440
 The fact is he had a premonition.

535
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,400
 It's interesting because it's half of a premonition, right?

536
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,560
 He was able to visit a bathroom that he wouldn't see until the future.

537
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,240
 He was able to recognize the severed heads in the blood that he wouldn't meet until the

538
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
 future.

539
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
 But he hasn't chopped off their heads.

540
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,240
 So it was a premonition of something that just some of the details were real.

541
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,840
 But what's interesting about this story, I read this, it was posted online.

542
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,360
 And kind of the gist I was getting from Karla was, "This is really creepy, but at least

543
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,760
 we don't live there anymore."

544
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,040
 So the danger has passed.

545
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,000
 Other than the fact that you may have a stepdad who, if he's joking, is telling a terrible

546
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 joke.

547
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,720
 It's actually kind of funny if he's joking, but to the kid, we don't know how old she

548
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 is either.

549
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,520
 The idea, I guess, kind of is that the danger has passed.

550
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,840
 And even he felt like that.

551
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,520
 He did not tell them about this while they stayed at that old house.

552
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,280
 He waited until they moved on.

553
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,080
 And now, listen, let's look at the story from his point of view.

554
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,480
 I'm sure he was absolutely terrified when he first had the nightmare, but then meeting

555
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,640
 a woman and joining her family and becoming part of that family and having that image in

556
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,080
 the back of your head that you saw their bloodied heads float around and about to pull a block.

557
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,000
 You're like, "Do you, Taker?"

558
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 "I do."

559
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And then you go to kiss the bride.

560
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,440
 And it's like you're just imagining a severed head with a bridal veil on.

561
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,800
 Like, did he have flashbacks to this?

562
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,520
 The kids are like, "Let's go to the water park."

563
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,440
 He's like, "No, no.

564
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
 It's Red Die Day."

565
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,040
 At the water park, did they do that?

566
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,000
 They should totally do that when they just put Red Die everywhere.

567
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,600
 My point is, though, is his point of view, once they moved out of the house, he probably

568
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,160
 figured the threat was gone.

569
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,280
 Whatever it was, right?

570
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,000
 Was he the one who chopped their heads off?

571
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,360
 Did the witchy woman chop their heads off?

572
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,400
 Was it symbolic?

573
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
 Was it literal?

574
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
 It doesn't matter.

575
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 We don't live there anymore.

576
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,000
 The danger has passed.

577
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
 But has it?

578
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,000
 It's not like that house was blown to smithereens.

579
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,560
 It's not like the new owner came in and did a complete remodel on the bathroom.

580
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,080
 They just moved out.

581
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,560
 That same house from that dream may be sitting there, bathroom completely untouched.

582
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,680
 Just because they don't live in the house anymore doesn't mean the premonition won't

583
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,000
 come true.

584
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,640
 Just means it didn't come true then.

585
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,760
 Was the dream a warning of something that could happen to this family once he entered

586
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,480
 their lives?

587
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:18,640
 And more terrifying is this dream a warning of what he himself may do to this family.

588
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:26,960
 If you had that dream, and then years later you met that family in real life, would you

589
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,800
 ever let your guard down?

590
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,960
 Because on the one hand it could be that this family was butchered by a third party, but

591
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,480
 on the other hand there's such a layer of malevolence to this story that it almost seems like Tony

592
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,480
 himself is the murderer.

593
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:59,400
 I don't know why I get that feeling, but I feel that that's what this story is describing.

594
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:05,320
 This young boy is not seeing the work of some maniac.

595
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,800
 Well he is, but he's the maniac.

596
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:17,400
 Everything about it just feels so deeply personal.

597
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,800
 The threat has not passed.

598
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,160
 This is a prophetic dream.

599
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,120
 The threat has not passed.

600
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:37,720
 If anything, it's become more of a reality because now Tony is a part of the family forever.

601
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,240
 I'm not saying Tony is a murderer.

602
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:50,320
 I'm not saying Tony has these dark thoughts when he's sitting with his family.

603
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:59,480
 I'm not saying that someday Tony is going to slaughter his wife and his two stepchildren.

604
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:09,080
 I'm not saying any of that, but if it did happen that's the kind of dark and evil twist

605
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:16,080
 ending that would cause a witch to cackle with glee.

606
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:23,080
 I'm not saying that.

607
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,080
 I'm not saying that.

608
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
 I'm not saying that.

609
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
 I'm not saying that.

610
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
 I'm not saying that.

611
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
 I'm not saying that.

612
