 A hero risks his life to save an innocent bystander.
 What would you do if you were driving through the woods and you spotted a bizarre man walking
 across the street?
 And then we traveled to Columbia to take a look at the bizarre story of a series of

 Is it possible that a man was trying to harvest the blood of young people?
 Or was everyone simply wrong?
