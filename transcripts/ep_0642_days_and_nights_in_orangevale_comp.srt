1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 What would you do if you went to the bathroom one day and you saw an eyeball looking at

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
 you?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,560
 Not your own eyeball, not that you're looking in the mirror, someone else's eyeball.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,760
 And then, no more fooling around on Dead Rabbit Radio, we're gonna take a look at a brand

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,260
 new theory that apparently is a 2000 year old ritual.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,220
 Is there any truth behind the story of the 40 day season of the blood sacrifice?

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,880
 Is the next month and a half going to be the most bloodiest time in human history?

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,200
 Fold onto your hats, boys.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Draining blood.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:53,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,440
 You like that excitement of my voice?

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,840
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,400
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,040
 I am having a great day, and I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,760
 I gotta say this, I just recorded an entire episode of Dead Rabbit Radio about the blood

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 sacrifice.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,680
 That's a super exciting story I talked about in the video.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,240
 You know what, before I do this, let's bring in our newest Patreon supporter.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,360
 Sliding in the Dead Rabbit Command right now, he has shoes made of snakes.

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,280
 He's not great shoes, he's just supposed to have snake skin boots.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,760
 He skipped a step and just got the snakes tied to his feet.

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,000
 It's Chime Chili, he's dead.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,600
 He's like floating in.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,560
 His corpse is being dragged by snakes.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,040
 Everyone give a round of applause.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,280
 If you clap loud enough, he'll come back to life.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,160
 Give a round of applause for Chime Chili and also we'll give him some anti-venom.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,360
 Chime as you get roused from your coma, shaking you, I go, you're gonna be our captain on

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
 Pilates episode.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
 He's all pale.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
 He's like, what?

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
 What?

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 Where am I?

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,280
 You're gonna be our captain on Pilates episode if you guys can't support the Patreon or if

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,320
 you've never been bit by a snake.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
 That's fine too.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,920
 Hopefully, hopefully you haven't.

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,560
 Just spread the word about the show.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,360
 Really, really helps out a lot.

42
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,840
 Now Chime, as you're getting a blood transfusion, you're getting blood from me.

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,600
 You're getting the best blood on the planet.

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,840
 Man, I gotta tell you guys what happened.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,720
 So I recorded an entire episode about the 40 day blood sacrifice.

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 In short, I'm gonna turn a 20 minute segment into a five minute segment from March 22 or

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
 March 19.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,960
 That's kind of wiggly, but from now until May 1, there's supposed to be some sort of

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,960
 mass casualty event and it's a sacrifice to the pagan god, Baal.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,360
 You're like, Jason, that's amazing.

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
 Why don't you cover that?

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,840
 Well, I did a full 20 minute segment on it and I was talking about a Reddit account

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,520
 called ConspiracyBeerMe, which we actually covered in our Nashville bomber episode.

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,720
 It's a great segment.

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,800
 I really, really like it.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,040
 I recorded it all and the whole thing was like, ConspiracyBeerMe, the Reddit account

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,160
 believes this, believes that, believes this, believes that.

58
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,960
 As I was editing it, I did a little more research.

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,640
 It turns out that ConspiracyBeerMe is a podcast and they're a bunch of comedians.

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,440
 And I thought, as great as this segment is, and I thought, as great as this segment,

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
 someone's vacuuming now, great.

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,160
 I recorded a whole segment, I gotta rerecord this, someone's vacuuming.

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,600
 I'm just gonna have to deal with it.

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,120
 As great as this segment was, I couldn't edit around me saying they believe that and

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,280
 it would be no different than someone saying that I believe monkeys don't exist and their

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,120
 episode just came out today.

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,740
 So all of that stuff combined might have been able to edit around it, but they just dropped

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,120
 an episode today about this conspiracy.

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
 So if you want to know more about it, I would recommend checking out ConspiracyBeerMe.

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,800
 I think in their podcast, I'll put the link in the show note, I may replay my segment

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 in the future.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,040
 I think ConspiracyBeerMe is a bonus episode or something like that, because it is a really

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,440
 funny and formative segment, but I don't want to step on another podcast's toes and

74
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,400
 I definitely don't want to keep throwing them under the bus.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,520
 So we'll see what we do.

76
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,400
 Just know that somewhere out there in the Dead Rabbit universe, there's a really cool

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,080
 segment that maybe someday will get played and now I need to fill 20 minutes.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,480
 I need to admit, maybe not that long, but I gotta tell you some stuff.

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,120
 The second segment is sticking around.

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
 Literally it's a sticky story.

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
 So I'm not...

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,680
 That's stupid vacuum.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,360
 I'm not just...

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,440
 Yeah, I'm having a great day, right?

85
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,760
 And now someone outside is talking.

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
 This is beautiful.

87
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
 This is beautiful.

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,280
 The 40 days of the feast of ball have begun.

89
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,000
 They've begun at my house as there's chaos everywhere.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
 So chime, chilly.

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,120
 Let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy.

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,040
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command and we are going to go to my old hometown of

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,280
 Sacramento, California.

94
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
 We're headed down.

95
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
 We're going back in time.

96
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,360
 I wanted to tell you some stories that happened to me when I was younger because you guys

97
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 seem to like that stuff.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
 You guys seem to like that stuff.

99
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,860
 It doesn't require a lot of research.

100
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,860
 It actually happened to me.

101
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,640
 I'm going to tell you about some bizarre events when I was younger.

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,720
 So first off, I'm trying to figure out the best order for this and most interesting to

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,840
 even more interesting.

104
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
 Chime, chilly.

105
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
 Drive us down Greenback Avenue.

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,960
 That's kind of the main thoroughfare through, oh, you know what, while we're here in Orangeville,

107
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,040
 Orangeville, California, which is a suburb of Sacramento, this is an interesting story.

108
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,240
 These are all going to be just kind of weird asides.

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
 Some of them supernatural.

110
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
 Some of them true crime.

111
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,680
 That basically sums up my entire life.

112
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
 It's one or the other.

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,200
 Today, I was walking through town.

114
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
 I'm not in Orangeville.

115
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
 I'm walking through town.

116
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,400
 I'm looking down and I see someone standing in the middle of the sidewalk wearing black

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,360
 boots with red shoelaces.

118
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,920
 I look up and it's just like a dad.

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,800
 He has his kids around there, his wife standing there.

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,560
 He's on the phone.

121
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,480
 He's wearing black boots with red shoelaces.

122
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,680
 Here's the thing, where I'm, he was a white dude.

123
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,000
 And where I'm from in Orangeville, Sacramento area, a white man wearing black boots with

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,560
 red shoelaces means that you've killed a black person.

125
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
 I don't think this guy did.

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,520
 I hope he didn't, right?

127
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,960
 I hope he didn't.

128
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,840
 But I thought it was a really interesting thing because there are so many hidden symbols.

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,240
 I don't know if you knew that and that might not be a universal thing.

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,240
 And so it's super bizarre because I am mead.

131
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,480
 I had a friend who did that once, not killed a black person, but I had a friend who was

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,120
 wearing black boots with red shoelaces and I go, don't do that.

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,360
 And he's like, what do you mean?

134
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,840
 I go, if you walk into the wrong part of town and someone sees that, they're going to assume

135
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,000
 that you've murdered someone of a different race.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,720
 You're going to assume you've committed a hate crime, the worst hate crime, murder.

137
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,520
 The vacuum is getting closer, so let's keep going here.

138
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,720
 I thought it was, and it's just a different way of living.

139
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,120
 Same thing like you'll see people with spider web tattoos on their elbows, huge white supremacy,

140
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
 where I grew up at least.

141
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,200
 If you had that, that means you were a white supremacist.

142
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,720
 Other people go, oh man, don't look cool.

143
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
 Don't look like Spider-Man.

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,280
 They're letting themselves get bit by radioactive spiders to make the tattoo even more authentic.

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,440
 So the thing that, when you grow up in a crime-ridden area, you look for stuff like that.

146
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,320
 I've said this before, if you want to know what gang controls your area, go to the local

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,800
 gas station and see what color hats and bandanas they sell.

148
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,600
 Because if you go to an area and all the hats are blue and the bandanas are blue, that means

149
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,160
 it's a crypt-controlled area.

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
 Walmart's will do it too in their budget clothes section.

151
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,840
 I remember when I first moved up here, I saw a bunch of clothes that were purple and silver

152
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
 and I go, Latin Kings.

153
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,680
 This is Latin King territory.

154
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
 So there's that.

155
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,280
 You're burning all your clothes now.

156
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,520
 You're burning all your clothes and getting rid of your shoelaces.

157
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,840
 It's easy to accidentally do that stuff.

158
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,440
 It's easy to accidentally appear that you're affiliated with a gang and that could lead

159
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
 you into really bad stuff.

160
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,600
 So Orangevale, California, let's talk about a weird story now.

161
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,320
 That was our true crime story.

162
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,560
 I remember once, I don't know if I've really talked to you and I've been reluctant to because

163
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,320
 it's so ridiculous.

164
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,200
 Like, I used to, I don't want to say practice magic.

165
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,600
 I don't want to say that, but I used to study magic.

166
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,880
 And I'm not talking about card tricks because I did that too.

167
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,800
 When my parents got a divorce when we moved from San Lorenzo to Sacramento, I was really

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,240
 into doing card tricks and I actually used, it's so bizarre.

169
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,720
 It sounds so fake, but I used card tricks to convince the kids at the new school that

170
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
 I was psychic.

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,360
 I actually talked about the divorce story and the story about the man with the knives.

172
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,400
 I used to be a really good student who was trying out for the football team and had a

173
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
 girlfriend and all that stuff.

174
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,160
 Then when I transferred schools, I just gave up on all of that and I started hanging out

175
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,360
 with the rougher kids.

176
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,840
 I hung out with rough kids in San Lorenzo too, but I just sat on the back of class and just

177
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,960
 drew or scribbled and stuff like that.

178
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,160
 Played and mashed with all the kids.

179
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
 I'm like, who are you going to marry?

180
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
 You live in a shack.

181
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
 Because I can't draw.

182
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,640
 So that was the only thing I could do.

183
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,520
 But we did all that stuff and I brought, I had a deck, a deck of marked cards.

184
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
 Really really good marked cards.

185
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,680
 No one else could tell that they were marked.

186
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,200
 I convinced the kids that I was psychic.

187
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,000
 I was the new kid who would come from the Bay Area in 1992, 1993.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,400
 I was able to convince them I was psychic.

189
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,120
 I also started an underground newspaper and that made me super cool.

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
 I got dragged into the principal's office.

191
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,040
 There was a huge controversy about it.

192
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,080
 The whole thing of the underground newspaper was why don't we all, all the different cliques,

193
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,200
 the jocks and the nerds and the magicians, the powerful magicians, why don't we all

194
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,920
 team up and run the school?

195
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,640
 We're like, I'm the principal now?

196
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,560
 No, it's just like I said that all of these cliques were created by the administration

197
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
 to keep us divided.

198
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,800
 And if we all gave up our normal, like, these barriers are meaningless.

199
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,120
 The jock and the nerd, they're meaningless.

200
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,400
 The jock and the nerd, the vacuum cleaner that's getting closer and closer, they're

201
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,880
 all meaningless.

202
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
 So let's all unite.

203
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
 There was no goal.

204
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,520
 It wasn't like, and then we'll run the school and we'll set, we'll set the times that we're

205
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,280
 supposed to show up and we'll have turkey every day for lunch or whatever.

206
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
 It's nothing like that.

207
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,120
 It was just let's quit dividing ourselves among these arbitrary lines, arbitrary, damn it,

208
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,840
 arbitrary, whatever, these lines that we've made up or that the administration has made

209
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 up.

210
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,600
 And it's so funny because that philosophy, first off, it's super basic, but that philosophy

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,880
 is something I've always held.

212
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,000
 I think when we have these religious differences, you worship different gods and have different

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,320
 religions, that's fine.

214
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 But to think that I hate you because you have this different religion or you have this different

215
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,600
 skin color or you're from this different culture or different political belief or whatever,

216
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,760
 I think is always, someone's always pulling the strings and inflaming those things.

217
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,480
 And if we could say, listen, you're completely different from me, we have nothing in common

218
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,120
 at all, except for the fact that we exist together on earth, let's team up and not kill

219
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
 each other and move forward.

220
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
 That's always been a philosophy of mine.

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,320
 But I was doing it, I was in high school, you get dragged in front of the principal's

222
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,880
 office as an adult, nobody cares.

223
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,800
 People just kind of keep on going about their lives.

224
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,880
 But anyways, so yeah, I got dragged in front of the principal and I did that whole like,

225
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,400
 yeah, whatever, bro, like, what are you going to do?

226
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
 Because I didn't care at that point.

227
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 My entire, like my family had fallen apart and stuff like that.

228
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
 And I was just doing what I did.

229
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,720
 I will say this though, I remember being very, very popular because of that underground newsletter.

230
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,680
 I remember people were like, this one girl came up to me and she goes, wow, you're just

231
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,040
 like Christian Slater and pump up the volume.

232
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,720
 And I thought, I just kind of nodded.

233
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
 I didn't know what she was talking about.

234
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,880
 I hadn't seen the movie, had a vague idea.

235
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,960
 Anyways, so that's just a high school, oh no, because I was a magician and I was tricking

236
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,160
 people with my cards.

237
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,040
 I also was steady and when I was in college, I started studying like magic, like sorcery,

238
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,160
 because I was having these encounters with ghosts and demons and stuff like that.

239
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
 And I thought, well, how do I fight back?

240
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,720
 Like, I've watched this great documentary called Buffy the Vampire Slayer and sometimes

241
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,240
 you have to use magic to fight these things.

242
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,120
 So I started buying books at a local witch store and was reading about magic and things

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
 like that.

244
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,080
 And I'll probably tell more stories about that.

245
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,120
 I'm just so reluctant because it's so ridiculous, right?

246
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,720
 It's so ridiculous.

247
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 But I did it.

248
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 I did it.

249
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
 I gotta be honest.

250
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,840
 And as much as I talk trash about witches and stuff like that and how much I want magic

251
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,960
 to exist, I used to like do rituals.

252
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,800
 I don't do them anymore, but I used to do rituals.

253
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,040
 And I remember one night, it was me, my buddy, I think it was Steve, I think it was my buddy

254
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,880
 Steve and my cousin Rachel.

255
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,120
 I said, this is gonna sound completely made up and ridiculous, but just roll with it.

256
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,560
 Out of all the stuff I've said on the show, this is the most ridiculous thing.

257
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,440
 But it's not even my most ridiculous story.

258
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,960
 I remember I had performed a spell.

259
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 So dumb.

260
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,720
 I had performed a spell that in theory would turn us invisible.

261
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,800
 Would make it to, it wasn't that we would be like, now you see meeting?

262
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,960
 It would be that unless someone was specifically looking for you.

263
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,680
 They couldn't find you.

264
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,880
 So I lived in my grandma's house and my grandma was like, Jason, are you done doing the laundry?

265
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
 And I'm just like standing there, she would see me.

266
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,080
 But if she was just kind of walking around waiting for the adventurers of Lois and Clark

267
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,080
 to come on, I would just be like, won't I be the predator in the living room?

268
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,680
 She's like, why is the television so blurry?

269
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,360
 Move out of the way, blur?

270
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
 Whatever.

271
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
 Like it's so ridiculous, but I remember doing it.

272
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,000
 I knew what you were gonna ask for, this spell.

273
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I'd have to find it.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,960
 And it wasn't an easy spell to do.

275
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:45,200
 It wasn't like mirror, mirror, make me not seen by anyone who, unless they want to gleam

276
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,720
 or something, it wasn't anything like that.

277
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
 It required all these banishing rituals and stuff like that.

278
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,640
 So, so ridiculous.

279
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,960
 I'm totally fine.

280
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,920
 Chum Chilly is like just standing there with his arm spread wide.

281
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,880
 What are you talking about?

282
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,080
 What is going on?

283
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,680
 You once claimed that you turned yourself invisible.

284
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,040
 Well, hold on.

285
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,600
 It's actually good that we're in the Jason Jalopy because this 100% happened.

286
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,920
 This 100% happened.

287
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
 My cousin is a bit of a wild child.

288
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,200
 And we were driving through, I said, hey, yeah, I think I cast this spell where we're

289
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
 invisible unless people are looking at me.

290
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
 And Rachel's like, oh, really?

291
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,600
 I mean, they were humoring me.

292
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,640
 Steve was like, oh, you know, they knew me well enough.

293
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,320
 And I was just like, yeah, it's supposed to do that at least.

294
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,080
 So for whatever reason we went for a drive, I think we're just going out to Denny's or

295
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,600
 Keros or something like that.

296
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,280
 It was me, Rachel.

297
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
 And I think it was Steve.

298
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,160
 It might have been Josh, but I'm pretty sure it was Steve.

299
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,600
 And we get in my car and we're driving through Orangevale.

300
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,720
 And I remember Rachel sitting in the back seat and we're driving and there's a car coming

301
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,240
 the opposite direction.

302
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,520
 And Rachel leans her, Rachel, my cousin, she was probably like 15, 16 at this point and

303
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,760
 she was over in my grandma's house all the time.

304
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,560
 We're driving down the road and a cop car is coming in the opposite direction.

305
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:12,640
 She leans her head out of the back window and as we pass by the cop, she screams as loud

306
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,080
 as she can at the police officer.

307
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,400
 Now we all grew up in Orangevale, which basically meant you were fearless of the police, right?

308
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,200
 You either had a bunch of interactions with the police and they pulled you over all the

309
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,040
 time or you knew how to outrun the police in Orangevale.

310
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,800
 You knew the roads, they knew the roads, but you had to figure stuff out.

311
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,400
 So that totally made that was totally within Rachel's character to do that.

312
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,920
 And she leans out the back window and she might have been a little bit younger, but

313
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,640
 yeah I think we were going to Keros or something like that.

314
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,280
 She leans out the back window and she screams and I'm driving and I see her maneuvering

315
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,920
 in the back and as we pass the cop, she sticks her head out the window and goes, "Ahhh!"

316
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,640
 She yells at the cop and I turn, I was flipping out dude.

317
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,360
 Because although you're fearless of the police, you want to limit your interactions with them,

318
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
 right?

319
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,760
 But if you have to interact with them, whatever, you'll say what you're going to say and they

320
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,640
 search your car or they don't.

321
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,960
 So you never want to have anything in your car in Orangevale.

322
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,560
 I remember once I got pulled over, I had a baseball bat in my car.

323
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,640
 Because yeah, in California that's illegal, you can't just have a baseball bat in your

324
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
 car.

325
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,800
 I'm recording this actually as I'm holding a baseball bat for whatever reason, but she

326
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,600
 screams and I turn around and I'm like, "Rachel, what are you doing?

327
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 What are you doing?"

328
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,720
 And she goes, "We're invisible, right?"

329
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,120
 She's kind of laughing and Steve is like, "Oh great."

330
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,840
 Steve had like 10 pounds of cocaine on him.

331
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,680
 No, just joking, he was straight and narrow.

332
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,600
 We're driving down the road and we're all waiting for that cop to bust a U.E. because

333
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,640
 at the very least they see a girl stick her head out of the back window and scream.

334
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,120
 So the cop doesn't know what's going on.

335
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,320
 But they never... nothing.

336
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,880
 They just kept driving as if we were invisible.

337
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,960
 So is that proof that we actually turn invisible?

338
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
 The fact that...

339
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
 That's the end of the story.

340
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
 That's the end of the story.

341
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,040
 I thought eventually you'd go to Denny's and no one served on you.

342
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
 No one waited on you.

343
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,480
 You were standing waiting for a while.

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,560
 I remember a couple times that night we were speeding because at this point I wanted to

345
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
 see whether or not it was actually real.

346
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,240
 I remember we were doing some other unsafe traffic stuff and there was a lot of cops.

347
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,560
 I think that happened later on.

348
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,760
 We saw another cop and I just was driving as fast as... not as fast as I could, but I

349
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
 was driving very fast.

350
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,040
 The cop didn't pull us over.

351
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,280
 So at that point we did actually think maybe we are invisible if nobody is looking for

352
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,600
 us.

353
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,800
 And let me tell one more... one more story about my time.

354
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 This is another weird story.

355
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,000
 We were driving... it was this time it was me and Steve.

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,920
 And I think Mauricio might have been there.

357
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,360
 We're driving on the same road, actually in the same area that Rachel leaned her head out

358
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 the window and yelled.

359
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,640
 This right next... it was on a greenback and hazel.

360
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,200
 We're driving down greenback one night.

361
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,080
 This story... it's hard to say whether or not it's supernatural or just straight up weird.

362
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,320
 We had just started our nightly adventure or weekend adventure to go ghost hunting and

363
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,240
 go eat at caros or denies or wherever we're headed.

364
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,600
 We're driving on the road and a dog shows up.

365
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
 Chimechillie's leaving.

366
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
 No Chimechillie, come back!

367
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
 Come back, bro!

368
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
 Come back!

369
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
 You're gonna like this story.

370
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,480
 If you like mysterious dogs, you're driving on the road.

371
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,760
 And this big dog starts walking across greenback lane.

372
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,920
 It's a very busy road, but we're out at like 11 o'clock at night.

373
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,120
 We see... I mean this lane is like a giant German shepherd.

374
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,920
 It's like standing in the suicide lane and the yellow lane.

375
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,000
 It's like a four lane road standing in the middle of the road.

376
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I think it was a suicide lane.

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,360
 But anyways, the dog was in the middle of the street and I start to slow down and the dog's

378
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,760
 looking at me and it walks and it's stopped in the middle of the road.

379
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,080
 There's no traffic behind us because it's late at night and I look at Steve and I'm like

380
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
 "What the hell?

381
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,840
 Where did this dog stand in the middle of the road?"

382
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,920
 So I go to drive around it and the dog starts walking and now I'm like in the other lane

383
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
 and the dog's standing in that lane now.

384
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
 And I'm like "What in the world?

385
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,120
 Like he wouldn't let us pass."

386
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,040
 So I go "Let's pull into the Safeway parking lot and then we'll go through the parking

387
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 lot and get away from the dog."

388
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,360
 Because at this point, like on the one hand I'm afraid the dog might get hit.

389
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,040
 On the other hand, the dog's kind of being a jerk for not letting us move.

390
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,160
 So as I'm pulling into the Safeway parking lot, he starts walking and I'm like "What

391
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,280
 in the world is going on?"

392
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,640
 And then I get into the parking lot and the dog walks up to the car and is now standing

393
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
 right in front of the car.

394
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
 At this point we're laughing really, really hard because we're thinking "What is going

395
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
 on?"

396
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,200
 And I go to...no joke, this actually happened.

397
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,520
 I go to back up and the dog gets on its hind legs and puts its paws on the hood.

398
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,400
 That's how big it was by the way.

399
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,440
 It's standing there with its paws on the hood just looking at me.

400
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,160
 And I'm half expecting this guy to turn into a full werewolf and devour us all.

401
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,400
 And I'm also laughing and me and Steve and I think Marie Sue, he's like half there, half

402
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
 not, I don't remember.

403
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,080
 We're laughing really hard because this dog has basically stopped our journey right when

404
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
 it started.

405
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,960
 And as funny as it was, we were also getting this sensation that this dog wanted us to

406
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,880
 wait.

407
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,320
 This dog was delaying our journey for one reason or another.

408
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,720
 I remember kind of having that sensation as we were watching this whole thing unfold.

409
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,200
 And he stayed on our car for I think, I don't know, it was like 15-20 minutes.

410
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
 I mean like it was a long time, remember at a certain point we're like "Is this dog ever

411
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
 going to leave?

412
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
 Are we stuck here?

413
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,160
 Is the rest of our existence stuck in this car with this dog?"

414
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,720
 And after a prolonged amount of time, the dog got off the car and just walked away.

415
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,640
 And I remember at a certain point us thinking "The dog is keeping us here for a reason."

416
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,000
 We're not supposed to leave for a reason.

417
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,280
 But then afterwards we went on our destination to go get dinner or something like that.

418
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,320
 A weir, I mean like wasn't it an omen?

419
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,120
 Was it something that had we left earlier we would have gotten a car accident or gotten

420
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,960
 a fight which was normal in Orangevale?

421
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,520
 You know who knows what would have happened.

422
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
 Who knows what would have happened.

423
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,920
 Did that dog save our life?

424
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,560
 Or was it just, it was uncharacteristic behavior for a dog.

425
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,640
 They normally don't stop traffic and they normally don't, once they do stop traffic

426
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,240
 if that happens they don't follow you into a parking lot and prevent you from leaving.

427
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,920
 So just an odd, Orangevale was such a weird town.

428
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,400
 Such an odd place and just a couple odd stories from that.

429
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,080
 Yeah and I hope that you enjoyed that.

430
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,560
 I hope it didn't come off as filler material.

431
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,400
 Because I do think, I mean it technically was, I couldn't run the other story.

432
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,440
 But these are stories that I've thought about telling from time to time.

433
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
 So yeah I hope you guys did enjoy that.

434
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,680
 Chime, chili, let's go ahead and call in that car runner copter.

435
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,800
 There's a dog, there's a dog standing on the helicopter.

436
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,760
 We have to sit there for like 20 minutes to take off.

437
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,760
 But eventually we give the doggy some pets.

438
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,080
 There was no way I was getting out of the car to pet this thing dude.

439
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
 It was massive.

440
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,880
 I wasn't going to go into Safeway and buy some treats.

441
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,400
 I remember us thinking, oh dude and I do.

442
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,280
 I remember this now.

443
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,000
 When the dog, after a certain point, the dog was on the front of the car with his paws

444
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 there.

445
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,560
 I go, let's slowly, this is 100% true, let's slowly back up.

446
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,680
 And I remember slowly backing up and the dog kind of readjusting it first and then getting

447
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,320
 off the front of the car.

448
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,440
 And then we see it walk and now it's standing behind the car.

449
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,240
 I remember that fully because it was like a werewolf movie.

450
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,600
 I remember we were like looking from side to side as it, where did it go, where did

451
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
 it go?

452
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,080
 It's all coming in through the air vent.

453
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,400
 It walked and stood behind the back of the car.

454
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,040
 So Mauricio must have been back there because he must have looked out the window.

455
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,080
 He was just behind the car, he was just behind the car.

456
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,880
 And I won't say for certain that it put its paws on the back of the car, but it did stop

457
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 us from backing up.

458
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,800
 And I remember start slowly moving forward again.

459
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,040
 It walks in the front of the car and stands on it again.

460
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,840
 I do remember that happening and then at that point we weren't moving at all because I didn't

461
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,720
 want to accidentally back over the dog.

462
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,120
 I couldn't for certain see it when it was walking me on the car.

463
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,440
 It would not let us leave.

464
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
 I remember that now.

465
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,560
 It was walking along the side of the car and got behind us.

466
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,280
 And then eventually just after a period of time it just walked away.

467
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,640
 So Chime Chili, Chime Chili is already flying away in the cover to cover to.

468
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
 No, come back, come back.

469
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,120
 We are leaving behind Orangevale, California.

470
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,240
 We are saying goodbye to the puppy and we're saying goodbye to invisible me.

471
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
 We don't know where he's at.

472
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,560
 So we're just waving everywhere.

473
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,080
 Let's leave behind this area and these stories that I just kind of had to remember for this

474
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
 segment.

475
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
 I'm heading out to Central London.

480
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,760
 Joel McHale and Carrie Bache lead an all-star cast in the dark romantic comedy Happily.

481
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 The film centers around a couple who, after 14 years of marriage, discover their friends

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,680
 are resentful of their constant public displays of affection.

483

 When a visit from a mysterious stranger leads to a dead body, they begin to question the

484
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,160
 loyalty of their so-called friends.
