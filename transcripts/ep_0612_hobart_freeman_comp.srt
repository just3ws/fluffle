1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 When a band was hired to play at a Russian nightclub, they thought they were just going

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,160
 to have an easy gig.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,120
 Instead, they came face to face with a bizarre mystery.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,160
 Then we take a look at a cult in modern day America that local authorities blame for almost

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,400
 100 deaths.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,680
 They're still in operation today, and one of my listeners used to be a member.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,680
 You'll hear her story today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,160
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,360
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away first off.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,480
 Let's go ahead and introduce our Patreon supporter for the day coming into Dead Rabbit Command

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,480
 right now.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:23,480
 Hi, I'm Jason Carpenter.

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:42,240
 I'm

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:02:09,960
 Jason Carpenter.

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,360
 So let me give some shout outs to you before we start the story.

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,240
 First off, Ira Onok is the one who sent me the story, so thank you so much.

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,760
 I hadn't heard of this story before.

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
 Really appreciate it.

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,240
 I got most of my information from a YouTube channel called All Things Creepy.

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,720
 If you like this channel, I'm sure you'll like All Things Creepy.

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,960
 We talk about a bunch of creepy stuff, but it's just not the name of the show.

25
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,680
 But there's this, so check them out.

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,560
 Also I needed some translation on this because it's in Russian.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,760
 There's English subtitles, but we've been tricked before in stories from other languages.

28
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
 People put fake subtitles.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
 So I reached out to a listener who I knew could speak Russian.

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
 Spiritual Abortion.

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,840
 Spiritual Abortion did a secondary translation just to make sure that's what they said.

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,920
 I want to give another shout out to Spiritual Abortion.

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,360
 Due to the first 90 days challenge, he just released his first EP.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
 So that's what the 90 day challenge can do for you.

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080
 It's nothing I'm selling, it's no gimmick.

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,400
 Try to make these next 90 days really count in your growth.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,840
 It was the kick in the pants he needed.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,720
 He said to get his EP done, I'll put a link in the show notes to one of his music videos.

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,400
 It's not safe for work, it's sludge metal.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,880
 So I can't understand it anyways for all I know.

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,960
 Maybe it is safe for work.

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
 Maybe it's about work.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,480
 Check out his channel.

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,920
 It's amazing that he got that album done and just think about what you can do for these

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,800
 next 90 days to be a better you as well.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
 Garrett, go ahead and stop right here.

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,040
 We're standing outside this Russian nightclub.

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,480
 Now what happened was back in 2013, there's video footage of this.

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,840
 A band is playing some music.

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
 The power goes out.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,640
 And this video footage you're seeing of the audience, the power goes out and yet there's

52
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,520
 like a split second.

53
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,040
 All of a sudden you can see three pairs of glowing eyes.

54
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
 Everything else is pitch black.

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,680
 The headline of this YouTube video, glowing eyes caught on tape at Russian nightclub.

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,560
 I'm like okay, I appreciate it.

57
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,400
 I don't want to be super dismissive, no one's going to send me stuff.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,280
 I resend me this, I watch the video and I go okay, glitch.

59
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,720
 You guys don't understand how much stupid reptilian footage I have to watch because

60
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 of this job.

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,600
 I watch every time somebody glitches in a video, I have to watch it.

62
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,200
 This one might be the real reptilian.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,960
 Did you know Barack Obama was a hologram?

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,920
 Barack Obama's a hologram now.

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:29,480
 Which I love the idea that we have the capability of creating AI perfect holograms and reptilians

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,640
 can perfectly disguise themselves but the camera at MSNBC can foil this entire plot.

67
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,440
 Like they've perfected this alien technology.

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,240
 It's lasted throughout the millennia across the galaxy.

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,280
 But somehow some cameraman can butterfinger a button and all of a sudden shhh.

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,400
 Anyways, so you know what, I actually want to do something.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,800
 I would like to meet somebody who believes that this is real, that this phenomenon in

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
 the video digital.

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,680
 What it is, it's like artifacts.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,120
 It's artifacting in the movement in the face.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,280
 It's totally explainable.

76
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,760
 I would love to meet someone who believes that and I can replicate that on them.

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,840
 Would they think they are a reptilian?

78
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,440
 You could replicate that effect and would they be like oh no there's claw on their face

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
 off you're like ahhh.

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,040
 The joke's over, the joke's over, it's just a prank.

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,320
 They're like all reptilians die.

82
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,720
 But anyways, I watched the video.

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
 I saw the people's eyes glow.

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,320
 I go it's artifacting, it's something like that.

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,640
 But as the video continues, because I don't just poo poo it, I mean I poo pooed it then

86
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,920
 but then I kept watching the video.

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,480
 There's a clip of a guy in the band, the lead singer in the band and he's like we saw it

88
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,640
 too.

89
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,040
 We were standing there, we were playing the music, the power went out and I looked out

90
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,960
 into the crowd and I saw a bunch of glowing eyes.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,920
 So it was more than just the three and it wasn't a video artifact thing, it was live.

92
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,640
 People standing there, no video cameras, just their eyeballs, just nature's video cameras

93
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,240
 aka the eyeball.

94
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
 They're seeing it.

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,880
 This is the whole band panicked.

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,080
 They left, they left the show.

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,360
 Now the interviewer goes who was at the party and the guy's like yeah right.

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,600
 Because these were the richest of the rich.

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,840
 This was a private elite party.

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:18,600
 There was also a testimony from a supermodel named Natalia Boydanova and the band guy was

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
 named Sergei Shernov.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,320
 He's actually a really big like ska musician.

103
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,880
 This wasn't just some hobo who showed up with this ragtime band of animated bears.

104
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,120
 This was like a really well known ska musician in Russia.

105
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
 He's been around for years and years and years.

106
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,480
 This is like a blip in his career.

107
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,600
 Like when you look him up and you type in his name, you have to type in like his name

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
 and then glowing eyes.

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,800
 Because normally it's just like articles about his musical career and his different

110
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
 bands and stuff like that.

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
 So this wasn't his claim to fame.

112
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,640
 So that does make the story more valid that you have this high profile guy and then you

113
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,440
 have this high profile supermodel who was in the crowd as well and she said yeah I was

114
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 standing there.

115
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,440
 She said a totally different angle and she turns and she can see people's glowing eyes

116
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,320
 in the pitch black room.

117
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,560
 So we have three different witnesses.

118
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,280
 It's really important when you look at this stuff.

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,220
 We have three different witnesses all from different angles.

120
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,280
 One witness is the band.

121
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,480
 So there's like actually five witnesses there but they're all viewing it from the same angle.

122
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
 They see it.

123
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,360
 Then you have someone in the crowd turn and look from her angle and sees it.

124
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,960
 And then we have the video footage which shows it.

125
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,760
 So there's a lot of conspiracy theories about this and you would have all things creepy

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
 went over these.

127
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,520
 So I'm kind of cribbing on his notes but it's a really cool channel.

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
 You should check it out.

129
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,600
 I'm sure you guys are already familiar with it.

130
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,200
 And it's the same thing that you would guess.

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,680
 As I'm telling this story you probably came up with these theories as well.

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,080
 Aliens that these are some sort of hybrid alien creatures.

133
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
 Androids that's not the first thing that would pop in my head right.

134
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,480
 I think androids are pretty low on the list of Russian C-3PO.

135
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,440
 There's a gold robot wearing a gold chain unbuttoned shirt and dress shirt made of silk.

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,920
 I don't know I would really want to think of androids.

137
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,160
 That would be way down on my list.

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,680
 But aliens androids are demons.

139
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,200
 Would be one that would pop up.

140
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,680
 Like demonically possess people making their eyes glow.

141
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,400
 But then we get into something that's a little more likely.

142
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,760
 I mean I believe in demons and I believe in aliens and I guess I believe in androids.

143
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
 I mean there's no reason for me.

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,920
 They'll be here eventually.

145
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,120
 But I don't think there's automatons walking around right now.

146
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,400
 But Natalia she said that someone else in the crowd after this had gone on.

147
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,400
 Someone else in the crowd gave their opinion that it was stem cells.

148
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
 It was stem cell therapy.

149
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,680
 And what's funny because this video I'm surprised they didn't touch on adrenochrome.

150
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
 Because that is instead of androids I would have gone with the other a conspiracy theory.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
 Adrenochrome.

152
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,800
 That's what I would have gone with.

153
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,080
 Not saying it's true but if someone said pick conspiracy theories what make people's

154
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
 eyes glow.

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,560
 It's like well supposedly you get injected with adrenochrome in the eyeball or something

156
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,760
 like that.

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,960
 Stem cells which is far more realistic than adrenochrome because we did a whole episode

158
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,320
 on that and it doesn't work the way the conspiracy theorist think it does.

159
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,120
 But stem cells.

160
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,480
 It's basically like gene spicing gene editing stem cells and things like that.

161
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,920
 And I looked into it and there actually is the ability to make your eyes glow in the

162
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,420
 dark.

163
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,840
 It is possible to do that.

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,200
 They just take the stem cells and they take a couple of glow sticks from the dollar store

165
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,480
 and they're like mixing it up.

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,560
 Apparently you can do that.

167
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,280
 The question is is this their eyes glowing in the dark is it the bug or the feature?

168
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,560
 Like it could be something that these incredibly wealthy dudes are doing this because it's

169
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,040
 cool to make your eyes glow in the dark or it could be they are receiving some sort of

170
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,600
 life enhancing or super super strong super strong Russian soldiers and the side effect

171
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,840
 is your eyes glowing.

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,680
 And it's funny because a stem cells is one of those things that like I was vaguely aware

173
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,520
 of back when the early 2000s when George Bush was like we're not going to allow stem cell

174
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,280
 therapy in the United States and I remember thinking is the president of the United States

175
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,000
 really talking about like cloning technology like he was who was saying like we can't have

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 clones and I was like what sci-fi world do we live in?

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,400
 The coolest one it turned out because this place is pretty cool.

178
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,520
 I didn't know in advance to the point I always thought it was still theoretical and they

179
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,920
 were still kind of goofing off stuff nerds in a laboratory throwing stem cells pouring

180
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
 them down each other's backs.

181
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,600
 I saw this article the other day this woman had some macular degeneration what they'll

182
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,840
 do is they'll take belly fat out of your stomach and they injected into your eyeballs.

183
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,720
 They actually there's a couple there's a couple steps in between that they have to like remove

184
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,960
 stuff they just don't go like I hope you ate a bunch of Taco Bell last night we need all

185
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,480
 the fat cells we can get they have to like separate it they get out the stem cells they

186
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:50,020
 injected into her eyes and she went blind but apparently people do that that's an actual

187
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,520
 therapy that people do for macular degeneration oh gross like all of it's gross getting

188
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,600
 the stuff taken out of your stomach then having having some guy with a little ladle going

189
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,240
 hmm just right stem cells are just ready to get injected in your eyeball and then she

190
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,760
 got injected into her eyeballs and then the retinas peeled away.

191
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,440
 This happened multiple times you think after the first time people would go maybe this

192
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,200
 isn't a good therapy for people who are losing their vision to make them go even more blind

193
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,000
 it's unlicensed so stem cells have that's the thing when I watch this video it's like

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,800
 yeah but stem cells are still like theoretical no no they're actively being used they're

195
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,920
 being injected into people's eyes as we speak so it's possible that these guys just thought

196
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,560
 it'd be really cool to have glowing eyes so they could have other things going on and

197
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,680
 this is the side effect or could be a bunch of androids it could be proof that the C3

198
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,080
 POs are about to take over the very polite world order is about to begin.

199
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,880
 Garrett let's go ahead and leave behind Russia I'm gonna tashi the keys of the Carbenter

200
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,160
 Copter we are headed back to an undisclosed location in the United States.

201
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,660
 As we're flying out there I gotta give a Dead Rabbit Recommends I can't tell you anything

202
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,440
 about the movie I'm just gonna tell you to watch it you're gonna enjoy it.

203
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
 I actually was recommended this movie by a Dead Rabbit radio listener named Christopher

204
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,240
 Padmos he sent me this movie he has watched everything on the Dead Rabbit Recommends list

205
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,520
 he goes I'd either seen it or when I was watching it being like oh do this this movie's nuts

206
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:26,040
 so I have a movie to give to you it's called Freaks it's not the old 1930s Freaks one

207
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,080
 of us one of us with the circus freaks it's a new movie it's 2018 it's called Freaks

208
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,480
 it's on Netflix it starts email Hirsch and Brewster don't look at the trailer poke your

209
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,400
 eyes get stem cells in your eyes if you even come close to look don't watch the trailer

210
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,800
 don't look at the movie poster don't read the synopsis just watch the movie there's

211
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,560
 a magic to the storytelling in the movie which is incredibly hard to replicate it doesn't

212
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,360
 have a twist it's just a very unique way to tell a story like you start that movie you

213
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,900
 don't know the genre you don't you if you don't know the genre all conventions are

214
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,920
 gone because if it's a romantic comedy you know certain things are gonna happen if it's

215
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,200
 a drama certain things are gonna happen you go in you start the movie and here's a little

216
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,120
 fun game because after I finished it I go that's fascinating you watch that first scene

217
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,120
 and then you just pause it for 20 seconds a minute and imagine what the last scene of

218
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,400
 that movie is going to be and then start the movie up again again it's not a twist it's

219
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,320
 a really interesting thing it's not a twist but you have no idea where things are going

220
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,120
 and it's one of those rare movies and I've only seen like this done two or three times

221
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,560
 each scene basically informs what happened in the scene before it you watch a scene and

222
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,200
 you don't really understand what's going on it's not an art house film either it's a

223
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,720
 it's so amazing it's each scene of the movie you watch it and you go very interesting the

224
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
 acting is great all this cinematography is great everything like that but I don't know

225
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,560
 what's going on and the next scene gives you a little bit of information that makes that

226
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,320
 first scene makes sense and then that third scene gives you a little bit of information

227
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,160
 that makes that second scene make sense it's so dope dude I'm I normally include the trailer

228
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,920
 in the show notes because people sometimes have a hard time finding the movie I'm not

229
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,760
 doing that I'm including a clip from IMDB of one scene near the beginning of the movie

230
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,360
 if you're on the fence watch that scene it gives nothing away it basically it's just

231
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,400
 that scene I showed it to Sabine and she goes the first thing she goes she goes that that

232
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,200
 acting I was like I know just in that two minute scene you're like these people know

233
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,640
 their roles it's brilliant freaks Christopher thank you so much for sending it over I'm

234
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,080
 recommending all of you this weekend to watch freaks 2018 it's on Netflix I'm sure you can

235
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,680
 find it other places but if it's white and shows much of circus freaks that's not the

236
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,920
 movie I'm recommending that movie's okay too but check out freaks

276
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:29,480
 11 children, no postnatal care. She's just suffering. The pain is constant. No pain medication. No treatment. She is just withering away in her home. She has eight surviving children.

277
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:43,480
 One is less than a year old. She has to take care of all these kids. She has to homeschool them. And she is in physical agony because of Hobart Freeman's teachings.

278
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 By May 2007, she couldn't deal with it anymore. She broke one of the most important rules laid forth by Hobart Freeman. You have to have faith.

279
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:05,480
 God will take care of you. She called up her mother-in-law. They took her to the hospital. Here's a quote from the email that I received.

280
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:20,480
 "It didn't take long for them to find out the source of her agonizing pain. A tumor of cervical cancer the size of a four month old baby inside of her with limbs wrapping around her organs shutting down her system.

281
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:32,480
 They got her one treatment before she decided that she was to come back home and to trust God." That was in May of 2007, by August of 2007.

282
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:52,480
 Bella said she could smell her mother's body rotting. Nothing helped. And there really weren't giving her anything. Pray the pain away. She would scream constantly.

283
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:10,480
 One night, Bella's older brother was woken up when he heard the back door slam. And he ran out of the house, followed his mother, and got to her just in time. She had taken a knife outside with her and was ready to end her life.

284
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 After that, she was put into a hospice, separated from her husband, separated from her kids. Just a few days later, she passed away.

285
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:36,480
 After she died, her husband, Bella's father, had the body cremated, went home, and burned all the possessions of his wife. The memory was gone.

286
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 He ended up becoming an alcoholic after it. The children, Bella said, "We are all basically illiterate." And by May 2008, so half a year after all of these events, child services come, and they remove the children from the house.

287
00:25:50,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 Bella's doing great now. She's doing perfectly fine now, but this was her upbringing. It's fascinating to look at a cult in this perspective.

288
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 The email that she wrote, it's different than, because it was to me. She's a listener of the show, so it was a message to me.

289
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:23,480
 It was interesting to read it like that. I've read accounts from cults, and I've watched YouTube videos from people who have escaped cults. There's something different about it when someone who was involved in a cult, born into it, she had no choice.

290
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:32,480
 And writing to me, and she had written to me before as well, just talking casually, so it was an interesting thing for this to come out.

291
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:48,480
 To read this account from somebody that you had been talking to, and then they feel comfortable sharing a story with you. And you can imagine this story played out at least 100 times in the Faith Assembly.

292
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:59,480
 100 families went through this. Hey, how's Uncle Joey doing? I heard he had really bad diabetes. I get the worst. He had diabetes 3.

293
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 And someone going, "He stopped taking his diabetes medicine." What? Yeah, he threw it off a cliff and a bunch of ants showed up. I didn't even know they liked insulin.

294
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:17,480
 Why? Well, because he is following Hobart, Hobart freeman. His Faith Assembly has been tied to at least 100 deaths. You have to wonder about all these families.

295
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,480
 The mother goes out to the barn. They're ready for their new little baby brother. They're going to have so much fun playing with the baby brother.

296
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:32,480
 And then a couple hours later, the mom comes back. There is no baby brother. That happened. That story happened. And it happened over and over and over again, at least 100 times.

297
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:46,480
 Those are the ones they could calculate. Those are the ones they knew of. In some ranch out in the middle of nowhere, far away from Indiana, where they're not paying attention, that no one knows about this cult outside of the people in it, none of the local authorities.

298
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:54,480
 And you have people suffering and dying and nobody knows why. It's tragic.

299
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:06,480
 Hobart freeman, his legacy is one of death. There are still people who follow the Faith Assembly and they could probably say, "Well, you know, we have these good beliefs and stuff like that. We do this community service for the Lord and all that stuff."

300
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 It's fine. That's awesome. But it's still a legacy of death. It's still a legacy of death. And not only a legacy of death, a legacy of preventable death, Hobart freeman's teachings convinced a woman that she could rot in front of her family for months on end and it was all okay.

301
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:39,480
 Tomorrow, God will cure that. I believe God gave us medicine and gave us the intelligence to figure these things out to prevent this.

302
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:49,480
 I think both can be applicable. You can have faith and have faith in that your doctor is going to heal you. To Hobart, that would be heresy.

303
00:28:49,480 --> 00:29:10,480
 He doomed Bella's mom to not only die, but to suffer for months and die. To bury her children and then die. And to convince her husband that her memory was worth nothing after she died.

304
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:28,480
 Hobart freeman's legacy is a legacy of death and the terrifying thing is he's not the only one out there. There are many other people who believe they have the answer and there are even more people who are lost and looking for any answer.

305
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:38,480
 When these two groups of people meet, tragedy and chaos are the only result.
