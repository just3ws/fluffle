1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 Tonight a game show reveals a terrible secret

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,480
 What would you do if you found tiny people taking a bath in your bathroom sink?

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,360
 What and then we travel to West Virginia or a small creek

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,720
 bubbling

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
 through the dark forest

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,600
 Actually has a powerful secret. Is there a ghost in West Virginia?

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,960
 That can warn us whenever a president will be assassinated today on Dead Rabbit Radio

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:45,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,040
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too feeling a lot better

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,840
 I think you guys can hear that on my voice

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,640
 Still have the cough that coughs been around for a couple weeks now, but we got a lot of stuff to cover

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,600
 So let's go ahead and jump right into this now. This show is a daily show

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,360
 So this is happening tonight, but this also takes place in Germany. So by the time I'm recording this at 7 p.m. On

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,320
 March 24th by the time by the time I'm recording it. It's probably already happened in Germany, but still

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,600
 That's our timely music news so Big Brother is the show where you get the contestants

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
 They sit in the house and then like people get voted. I think I've I

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,680
 Can't ever say that I've ever watched more than a few episodes of it, but they get voted out

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,120
 I believe and

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,280
 If they win money or something or they win the house

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,320
 I don't know maybe the end the last person in the house actually owns the house

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,800
 But it was a British show and then it was spread all over the world

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,580
 Big Brother Germany is going on right now. There's a couple other big brothers going on right now and the the idea is this

23
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,800
 10 people or whatever you're chasing any basic research

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,400
 You get a group of people in a house

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,220
 They're totally cut off from the outside world and they bicker and squabble and us

26
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,080
 Normals us homo sapiens get to watch these guys 24 hour on camera feed

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,440
 Technically, we're the big brother. We're the observing audience

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,080
 But there's actually a big brother in the house that can give news alerts or it doesn't really give news alerts can

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,960
 Prompt drama basically there's an overriding force in the house

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,040
 So people get voted out of the house and then there's like this huge crowd

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,920
 Because you go in and you're a nobody and then you come out and your celebrity people have been watching your antics for a week

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,120
 Or two or three or four however long you last on the show

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,320
 Yeah, you come out and you find out you have a fan base and or a bunch of stalkers, but

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,240
 You know, I'm so we have two different things going on. We have a bunch of people isolated in a house

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,920
 And they have no access to the outside world. They have no television. No news nothing the big brother show in Germany

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,960
 It started on February 6th this season started on February 6th into that time

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,560
 coronavirus you had like maybe

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,160
 Couple dozen cases in Germany a couple dozen cases in America and stuff like that

39
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,120
 They've had no news about what's going on in the outside world. This is there's a lot of stuff this messed up about this one

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,320
 They're not telling them about it. They're not this is the gimmick. Okay, this is what they're doing tonight on IT on live TV

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,960
 They're going to announce to these people who have been sequestered in their house since February 6th

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,000
 They're like ladies and gentlemen for the first time in big brother Germany history

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,240
 We're gonna let you guys know what's going on in the outside world. Whoa. What's it gonna be?

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,560
 Everyone's sick. There's a there's a disease rampaging across the planet. Be like what?

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,720
 I want to know that they're getting ready to announce that on live television tonight

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,000
 There have been so when someone gets voted out of the house and other person takes their place

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,520
 The people who have taken their place one person just entered the house a couple days ago. I hope they tested them

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,240
 I hope they made sure the guy wasn't sick and they said you cannot mention what's going on outside at all

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,360
 Even the pandemic especially the pandemic you can't say anything where they've been teasing

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,220
 They've been advertising this tune into night where we let ten people know what's going on and that's horrible

51
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,920
 That's horrible and that definitely raises the stakes for the show because now you definitely don't want to get voted out

52
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,000
 Because you know where you're at you're isolated you're in the lap of luxury you have unlimited food and water now

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,480
 You're like oh my god

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,360
 I live in an apartment with like ten other roommates and they're super disgusting

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,120
 Please don't vote me out like the stakes for the show are so high now

56
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,320
 So and I guess I should say this when we had a similar thing here in the States

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 9/11 happened and they were doing a season a big brother and the rule was don't tell anyone what's going on in the outside world

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,620
 But one of the girls in the house lost somebody in 9/11

59
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,520
 So they did say hey guys

60
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,760
 We got attacked by terrorists and they kind of broke the rules for that and they a couple other seasons are doing big brother right now

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,600
 They've broken the rules for that but to let them know what's going on in the Canadian big brother. This was Crete. This is creepy

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,920
 Canadian big brother right the way I described you remember the people get voted out and they leave and there's like a massive crowd outside the house

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,680
 Charing you were nobody two weeks ago, but now we love you

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,400
 Recently they had the vote out thing right and

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:21,240
 They voted the person saying goodbye to him and they walk out the door and everyone's like getting ready to hear the abhorious applause

66
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,180
 It's dead silent outside because there's no audience

67
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,720
 Social distancing the Canadian television network or whatever didn't have anyone come they you can't be that close to anyone

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,320
 So you know the gimmick of the show you've been watching it growing up and now you're on it

69
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,160
 You know what to expect someone walks out the door. It's dead silent outside

70
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,440
 The people are like

71
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,240
 Because they have the hour-long special that you can watch on television and then you can watch them on webcams

72
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,840
 When people were watching the webcam footage after the person leaves

73
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,120
 People in the house are waiting to hear the roar and they don't hear anything

74
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,560
 And then they're talking among each other later that night and the people are like why didn't why didn't we hear anything?

75
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,880
 Another person's like, I know that was really weird right and they're yeah

76
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,900
 Yeah, like did they like soundproof the house somehow which would be impossible, but

77
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,920
 That's what they're thinking. That's the only thing you can think of like they must have somehow created some sort of did the Canadian television

78
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,080
 use all that money they got from Degrassi High and build like a

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,440
 soundproof

80
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,000
 sci-fi dome around the building like what and they start discussing why weren't there anyone outside and

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,840
 Then the big brother who like I said can speak in this intercom system over the house to talk to them as these people are trying to figure out

82
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,680
 What could possibly be going on outside that there was no one there to greet the person exiting the house

83
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,240
 The big brother voice speaks from above and says please stop talking

84
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,880
 Everyone in the house just gets quiet

85
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,160
 They did eventually a couple days a couple days later

86
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
 Tell the big tell the people in that house what was going on and that's why there was no crowd

87
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
 But again definitely raises the stakes for the show. You don't want to get voted off now

88
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
 I wanted to cover that story for two reasons one

89
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,680
 I think it's absolutely inhumane to make people fight to stay in a house when this is going on - I want to talk about a

90
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,000
 Show called

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,440
 Dead set this is and when I was reading this article

92
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,360
 They talked about the show dead set dead rabbit recommends dead set it is a show

93
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:34,520
 About the big brother house in Britain, which is where big brother originally started the big brother house and all these people

94
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,280
 They're totally isolated

95
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,960
 They're a bunch of like you get all these strangers put in this house together and they have 24-hour cameras on them and a zombie apocalypse starts outside

96
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,080
 It's it's one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen it was actually a mini series

97
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,880
 But I have it in the show notes. You can watch it on YouTube. I also got that movie dig. I said it was super rare to find

98
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,000
 I found that on YouTube. That's also in the show notes for this episode as well, but I definitely watched dig

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,920
 I watched the other night. It's still an amazing documentary, but dead set

100
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,260
 It's and then they're in the big brother house and zombies are laying siege and this one girl's boyfriend is like

101
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,000
 Trying to get to the big brother house to save her. It's really dark

102
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,800
 So you may want to save it till after all this is done, but

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,400
 Definitely it's on their dead set dead rabbit recommends dead set and dig. It's such a great documentary

104
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,880
 I also want to say this

105
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
 I've reached my level with

106
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,120
 Coronavirus like news

107
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,400
 I don't even read it anymore and I would suggest to most of you guys if you haven't reached it to stop reading it

108
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,080
 I know the basic stuff. Don't take ibuprofen. They say don't take ibuprofen

109
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,240
 Keep your hands washed it can stay now. They're saying it can stay on services for 17 days

110
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,200
 But then you look into that and it's like it doesn't it's not contagious at that point

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,680
 You know, I just know if I get cardboard from outside. I don't touch it for 24 hours anything

112
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,000
 You know what the basic stuff I stopped reading all of the horror stories about it

113
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
 I don't even look at the headlines. That's not true. I look at the headlines

114
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,080
 But I got tired of clicking on these clickbaity links

115
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,800
 And finding either fake information

116
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,080
 That makes it far more horrible than it actually is

117
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,200
 And there's a lot of that going on. It's really weird

118
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,520
 I found stories that were 100% that were absolutely horrifying

119
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,200
 I was like, oh my god

120
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,360
 And then other people goes that twitter from that doctor who's telling you that story from italy that he's misspelling words

121
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
 He misspelled his job

122
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
 That's not a real tweet. This is fake stuff

123
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,440
 But they're getting clipped in hammock. It's scary. Don't get me wrong. It is scary and you should

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
 Social distance and if you can self-isolate and do all these containment things

125
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,600
 I'm not saying that it's fake or anything like that

126
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,520
 But what I'm saying is that we can overdo on the scary news about it. We need to know the basics

127
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,760
 That's the same thing. There's one thing between knowing about ices and then watching ices be heading videos, right?

128
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
 You get the point. There's a there's a brutal terrorist regime

129
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,280
 Taking over swaps of the middle east. You should be aware of basic facts

130
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,440
 But that doesn't mean you have to go start reading articles where it's telling you what they did

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,520
 Stuff like that. So that's that's the approach I've taken towards this

132
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,760
 I got the basic information and I think it was really overwhelming for me, honestly that first week and a half

133
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,120
 We're still in it, but just reading so every hour looking for new articles to read about stuff

134
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
 And it was really really affecting me. It was really getting to me. Doesn't mean I'm ignoring the danger

135
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,880
 But it doesn't mean that I'm overwhelming my sense of self and my

136
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,400
 My like you don't want to get too anxious about it. You just want to be careful. That's the main thing

137
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,720
 This is something that we and now this is turn kind of preachy

138
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,560
 But I just I want to be preachy right now because I don't I don't I know that we already feel isolated just in a normal life

139
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,520
 And now that we actually have to stay away from people

140
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 We can feel it even more isolated

141
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,360
 So don't ignore the news, but know your limit. I've reached my limit

142
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,160
 Now I'll go to websites a look at the headlines

143
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,240
 That's it. I've reached my limit. I'm doing what I can do

144
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,080
 And I'm I'm no longer clicking on these horror stories of this person suffering from this or this

145
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,720
 I got really too deep into it

146
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,200
 And it was just too much people may say, ah, you're putting your head in the sand, but I say no

147
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,280
 I think it's the same thing as

148
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,920
 Knowing about a global terrorist group versus having to delve into what they do when they enter a village

149
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,880
 You don't need to know that information. You just know that they exist

150
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
 and stuff like that so

151
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,600
 Know what the problem is know how you can prevent it yourself

152
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
 Know what you can do to not get yourself sick or other people sick

153
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,200
 And then go on you don't have to be clicking on every single creepy twitter or article that has a sad headline

154
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,280
 Just keep going forward. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story though

155
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,680
 Our next story takes us to Malaysia. So let's hop on board the carpenter copter. We're flying out to

156
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
 Salingh Bahru Salingh Bahru

157
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,760
 You guys know where that's at, right? I hope so because I don't I'm flying the carpenter copter. We're flying out there

158
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,720
 It's march 1989. We're gonna meet a little kid, right? So nine-year-old boy his name's faizul. Affindi

159
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,080
 And he's walking to school

160
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,800
 He's a little backpack. He has it over one shoulder because he's one of the cool kids

161
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,720
 He's not one of those lamos that has it over. I used to be that kid

162
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
 I didn't want to put my backpack on both

163
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,760
 Both shoulders because it looks super lame and then like your back starts to hurt

164
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
 But the time you get to high school and the books are super heavy

165
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
 You're like, oh you look like quasi moto every time you walk everywhere

166
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,760
 But anyways, I still did it nowadays. I put it on both shoulders because I don't care

167
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,160
 Faizul is walking on the street to school and he sees this guy walk by now

168
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,640
 That's normal, right? A lot of times when you're walking on the street other people are walking on the street too

169
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,440
 But this guy was only six inches tall and this little dude

170
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,560
 Is just kind of walking by now here's the thing you're walking on the street you see a six inch person

171
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,040
 Which is unreasonably small

172
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,280
 Obviously there are people there are little people and they'll be like three feet two feet tall

173
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,120
 But six inches is is not normal for anything outside of a uterus, right?

174
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
 But you see a little six inch person walking on the street. What do you do quick?

175
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,400
 Quick reaction time. What do you do now? I would

176
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,200
 Probably like jump back

177
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,240
 And then I would um regain my composure because I'm cool and I'd put my

178
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,720
 Easily take my backpack off because it's only on one shoulder and then I'd get down on one knee and go

179
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,600
 Who are you?

180
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
 And I'd try to communicate with this six inch person

181
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
 Faisal does what I think I think you'd basically have three reactions

182
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,520
 You'd run away

183
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,560
 Because it's super spooky you try to talk to the six inch dude

184
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,280
 Or you'd grab it because anything that's small enough to grab now again. He's a kid

185
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:06,080
 But I can understand why he grabbed it because actually no I can't because I think kids don't normally walk around grabbing squirrels and stuff like

186
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,680
 I mean babies, maybe but I mean now that I think about it. What if this was just a six foot guy?

187
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,440
 Faisal was walking on street. Would he be grabbing on it? Get off of me kid. What are you doing?

188
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
 But he grabs the six inch dude the little guy little guy

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,720
 bears his teeth and then begins super scratching him up

190
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,520
 And scratches him up so much that fazal drops the dude

191
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,240
 Guy runs into the bushes

192
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,520
 And they're thinking okay, that's bizarre right a little feral, you know, it's not that he just scratched him up

193
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,360
 Bared his teeth and then scratch him up

194
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,680
 It wouldn't make sense for a six inch person to have some really good self-defense techniques

195
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,240
 Not that it has to know like chokeholds and stuff like that, but that it would have claws

196
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
 I wonder

197
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,320
 No, that's not wait a second think about it

198
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,760
 Small animals have claws and big animals don't right so like cats have claws

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,760
 And then tigers have claws like tigers aren't small. Well think about okay

200
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,120
 You have like birds they're tiny they have claws right, but then humans don't

201
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,960
 And then cats have claws because you know, they're like claw on it

202
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,160
 Mice and stuff like that

203
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
 Why don't dogs have claws? Why don't dogs?

204
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,280
 What would that be like good when they're like attacking bears and stuff like that bears have claws

205
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,480
 They're pretty big that doesn't work in my hypothesis. But this is what I'm getting at hippopotamuses rhinos

206
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
 Elephants they don't have claws

207
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,240
 So I think the bigger you get the less likely it is you're going to have claws

208
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,840
 If you have claws you need every advantage possible to have what if

209
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,920
 Everyone says that cats are small tigers, right?

210
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,280
 So like there's a bunch of tigers running around and they kept having

211
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,600
 Having babies and the babies got smaller and smaller and that's where house cats came from

212
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
 I'm going to give a different idea

213
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,520
 You're like Jason that's nobody said that that's no scientific theory

214
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,520
 You have what if all cats started off as little and then they got big and that's why they still have their claws

215
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,840
 But then a thousand years from now lions and tigers will no longer have claws because they'll not need them

216
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,040
 What do they use claws for anyways? They don't they don't really climb trees like

217
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,800
 Why do bears have claws actually like isn't just because gorillas don't have claws, right?

218
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,520
 So I I'm going to stand by my theory. I'm going to stand by my theory that the bigger the animal

219
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,320
 The bear doesn't count the bigger the animal the less likely it is to have claws

220
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,400
 Because if an elephant had claws is an elephant eat meat that might be the thing maybe it's meat eater

221
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,080
 Wait, no, but rhinos. Oh wait. No, that's it. That's it

222
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,000
 Meat eaters have claws and omnivores and herbivores

223
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,280
 You have elephants being like ah rip and open but in every minute. Okay, so where was I at?

224
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,520
 Oh, so so this guy must be a carnivore because he has claws. That's what I was trying to get at

225
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,040
 I wonder if there's a carnivore. Never mind. I'm not gonna. Okay, so

226
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:07,120
 That's that april 1989 one month later. Selang Bahru Malaysia. We're still here. We never left town

227
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,960
 We've been eating their delicious noodles. I'm assuming that they eat noodles over there

228
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,920
 We're eating noodles and rice and it's so super tasty

229
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,320
 It's tasting so good in my little quarantined belly

230
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,720
 tasting so yummy

231
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,320
 We're gonna meet a dude named nor osmy mod jamal nor osmy mod jamal

232
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,880
 He's walking home from school. It's coming the opposite direction, but the same area

233
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,680
 I don't actually know if it's the same geographical area, but same town. He's walking home from school

234
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,720
 He is sees walking across the street

235
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,800
 Two six inch dudes one of them is actually a girl

236
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,120
 So two six inch dudes one of them is wearing a brown shirt and shorts

237
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,320
 Which is actually kind of comfortable because malaysian is pretty tropical

238
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,480
 They're not dressed like the leprechaun. They're not dressing like big old hats and stuff like the jackets

239
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,120
 That's actually a good point. The leprechauns dressed up like

240
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,560
 Okay, wait a second. I'm thinking of the leprechaun from the leprechaun movies. That's not his actual

241
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,160
 But leprechaun wears a jacket and you wear like big old socks and pants like pants like shorts

242
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,720
 They're shorts, but he has like long so because irland is cold irland's cool

243
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,160
 but if you had

244
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,520
 Cryptids in more tropical areas, they'd be wearing like little sun hat and like

245
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,560
 Bermuda shirt little short-sleeve shirt

246
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:30,000
 You wouldn't want to see like if you are a cryptid if you were a mythological creature in a warm climate

247
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
 You would dress accordingly. That's actually really interesting because it shows

248
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,680
 Well, it shows one of two things

249
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,960
 It shows that cryptids would have to maintain some sort of internal body temperature that they're also

250
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,320
 Effected by the climate or that the people making up the stories make them up in a way

251
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,520
 That's relatable to the people in their culture. i.e. if you were in irland and you were talking about a leprechaun

252
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,640
 You wouldn't say he was he had a boogie board and it wears shorts and no shirt people be like

253
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,240
 But it's run any freeze to death and why does he have a boogie board? What's a boogie board?

254
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,160
 So it's one of those two things most likely the second one. Anyways, he's walking on the street

255
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,920
 He sees two six inch people one of them is wearing a brown shirt brown shorts

256
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,320
 the other one is wearing a brown shirt and a little skirt and

257
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,880
 He sees these little guys and he does this is what I think would be more likely than reaching out and grabbing one

258
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
 He starts chasing them

259
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,280
 Now I said I would sit down and go. What's your name? But if it was like walk

260
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,520
 I would also probably be likely to pursue them as well. I'd still want to talk to them

261
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,040
 But that's a pretty natural thing. He starts chasing them and they take off into the bushes

262
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,760
 But a few days later nor this kid nor is at home

263
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,280
 So he walks into his bathroom and there's like you have like the bathroom sink

264
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,400
 And he sees one of the little dudes just kind of hanging out sitting on like the porcelain

265
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,960
 Just hanging out just chilling on his sink. What the world's going on?

266
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,440
 And then he looks and he sees that the basin of the sink is filled with water and the other one's totally naked

267
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
 Washing itself now. I don't know if it took like a sliver of soap

268
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,280
 Aye, laddie. Gotta get clean irish spring. Maybe this is a really commercial for irish spring

269
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,080
 The little dude is washing himself which

270
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,160
 that

271
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,880
 Would be awesome, right? I would do multiple things right there one. I'd get a camera now to be fair

272
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,040
 That's not I'm not pervert. I'm not a pervert. I'm not gonna post these photos on found cryptids new dot com or like

273
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,680
 Cryptids on camera stuff like that. I'm not trying to be a pervert because there's a there's a naked cryptid in my sink

274
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,560
 I'd grab a camera for proof because no one's gonna believe you obviously

275
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,240
 And then I would still try to talk to the guys, but then I would sell the water online a bunch of weirdos and be like

276
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,360
 Hey guys, how would you like to buy water that a six inch person took a bath in?

277
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,960
 And they would respond man or woman and I'd go

278
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,480
 Doesn't matter a six inch person took a bath in this

279
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
 Okay, it was the woman. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'll buy it to buy it. So anyways

280
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,520
 He doesn't specify if it was the dude or the girl who was taking the bath

281
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,960
 But we'll just assume just to make the story a little more sexy

282
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
 It was a six inch woman in there

283
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,640
 And so anyways, he's watching her take a bath and then he reaches in a court. This is the instinct

284
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,360
 He goes to grab the girl in the sink

285
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,080
 and surprise surprise

286
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,240
 He gets attacked he gets bit really really hard and dropped sir and the two little people took off now

287
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,840
 He goes to tell his parents obviously asked to explain why his hand is bleeding profusely. What happened to you?

288
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,680
 I tried grabbing a naked woman. No mom. Don't give me that. She was only six inches tall

289
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,120
 Okay, I'm not pervert. Well kind of a pervert. But what would you do?

290
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,760
 He tells his parents this and this story I got both of these off of that website think about it docs.com

291
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,600
 Historians with this sentence quote. He told his parents about the incident

292
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
 But they did not believe him

293
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,240
 Unquote isn't that the the tragedy that lives on forever

294
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,520
 Haven't we all been there that moment where we got bit by a naked six inch woman and we went to our parents the people who love us so much

295
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,200
 Mom dad. I got bit by a tiny person taking a bath in our sea

296
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,720
 And then you being not believed that is the true tragedy of this world

297
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,440
 Let's go ahead and move on to our I find that story funny. I like that story

298
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,040
 I like little people running around I think it's cute. I mean the the constant assaults by the giants

299
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,040
 Maybe not so cute, but I do find it fascinating and it makes you think what would you do if you saw a tiny person

300
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
 I think I would try to talk to them

301
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,600
 And probably take pictures of them and sell their bath water

302
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,640
 But I don't think I'd be grabbing them all the time just because they're tiny because again

303
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
 I don't grab mice that are running around. Let's go ahead and move on to our last story

304
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,920
 We're headed out to west virginia all of this information I got from an article

305
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,600
 I want to give credit where credit's due from a website called west virginia explorer

306
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,400
 The article is horse creek ghost set to foretell the demise of presidents and it was written by david sibray

307
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,600
 So let's hop back on board the car. Let's take the jason jelopy. We haven't been driving for a long time. We're in melasia

308
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,320
 Fine. Let's hop back on the carboner copter. We're gonna fly out to west virginia. We're gonna learn about the horse creek ghost

309
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
 april 8th

310
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,240
 1865

311
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,920
 Major walter hansen and his buddy elisha miller. Those are some old-timey names for you are hunting

312
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,360
 They're out hunting by horse creek in west virginia and they hear something the bushes turn around quickly

313
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,280
 They spin around to face the noise think it's a deer an elk possibly an elk with claws

314
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,400
 They've evolved they eat meat now and is the majors ready to face this evolution abomination

315
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
 A woman steps out of the bushes

316
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
 Dressed in all black clothes

317
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,160
 soaking wet

318
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,960
 She points her finger at the man and says

319
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
 Lincoln will be gone

320
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,120
 For the full moon rises

321
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,920
 And they're like what because lincoln's still president and then she I don't know if she flashes away

322
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,680
 Or she just kind of like points at him for a while then kind of puts her arm back down

323
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,520
 This just stands there silently and then is kind of like i'm gonna i'm gonna go back into the bushes

324
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,880
 She turns her walks away. She simply disappears now. It's 1865. It's not like you can just pick up a newspaper

325
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,880
 Major Walter Hanson said it took him two months to find out that abraham lincoln had been shot

326
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,360
 By the coward what was his name and i remember jimmy olson. What was that guy's name?

327
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,280
 Lee Harvey olswald. No, that was the other guy

328
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,400
 Who was the guy who shot lincoln not erin burr and then he jumped and he like

329
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,360
 Fell day jumped and he like slid down a curtain all dramatically. What was his name? Dude. He was that actor

330
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 um

331
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
 Who shot lincoln?

332
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,240
 And then he ran and then he hid in a barn and then the authorities surrounded you're like jason

333
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
 You know all this stuff. You you don't know his name. They said the barn on fire and he died

334
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,040
 There's always been that big conspiracy theory that he didn't die in the barn

335
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,680
 That he got away. What was his name?

336
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,520
 Patton hallswald it started with an o. I think it had an o in it, right? I'm gonna google it here real quick

337
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,280
 Had an o in it that that's specific. Let's see. Um, who killed lincoln?

338
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
 What

339
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:12,320
 What was his name perkins john wilkes booth see there's three o's in it. That's what was throwing me off

340
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,480
 There's too many o's is throwing me off john wilkes booth shoots a ram lincoln

341
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,080
 Uh, then does all that other stuff I said and may or may not have gotten away with it

342
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,800
 But anyways now we're going to go to the year 1881

343
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,560
 And this guy named clide purdew and his wife doesn't matter what her name is are driving are

344
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,920
 Writing their horses or whatever down this same street by horse creek in west virginia

345
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,720
 And this one's interesting. So the first time you had the woman i'm gonna assume she was hot coming out of the bushes

346
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,440
 Dressed in all black dripping wet this one you still have the black clothing. So this thing comes out in a black shawl

347
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,560
 That's still dripping wet, but this time it's a flaming skull and crossbones. It's kind of weird

348
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,080
 They're driving down the road and they see this flaming skull and crossbones with a wearing a black dripping wet shawl

349
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,000
 up here in front of them and the skeleton guy goes

350
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,040
 James carfields going to be assassinated

351
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,720
 Again, I don't know if it faded away or just kind of floated there for a while

352
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,120
 And then they drove past it and they're like waving to it in the rearview mirror or they're on horses

353
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,000
 So they were just I don't actually know whether what were cars

354
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,920
 I was thinking that I was like cars who are around in 1881, right?

355
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,960
 But like there was only like two of them and you're like Jason this might be your least informed episode ever

356
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
 That that may be true, but I think cars were around in 1881, but nobody had him

357
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,920
 So I think these guys are on horses. It doesn't really matter as no bearing on the plot

358
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,600
 The point is is that a flaming skull and crossbones said that james garfields are going to be assassinated and he was

359
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,760
 in 1881

360
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,120
 1963

361
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
 There's this dude named max alberts. Tell me if this is the most depressing job possible

362
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
 He's a traveling

363
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,400
 I mean how much money could you possibly this is the albundi of the 1960s

364
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
 He was a traveling magazine subscription salesman

365
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,880
 So you would just walk around the country or drive around the country because I know cars were invented in 1963 or they were around

366
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,480
 And you go knock on people's doors and says would you like to buy 12 issues of this life magazine?

367
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,720
 Like how much money could you possibly make doing that?

368
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,240
 It's ridiculous. I mean and then you basically or you can buy a magazine and all those little cards fall out of it

369
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,320
 That you can do subscriptions and stuff like that for complete. That's so sad

370
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,080
 That's so sad, right? But anyways, this guy maybe it was his favorite job in the world max albert's

371
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,480
 traveling magazine subscription salesman

372
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,840
 I remember once this this salesman came to my mom's house. Why was my house too when I was a kid?

373
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,480
 She this traveling salesman came to our house to sell us like a vacuum cleaner or set of knives or whatever he was selling

374
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,520
 Right and we had a little bowl of milk laid out

375
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,560
 For like a local cat. It wasn't our cat was like a stray cat, but we fed him fit of milk every day

376
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,200
 I mean if we were you know, we didn't know that milk causes cats to have diarrhea everywhere

377
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
 But it wasn't our cats and we didn't care and so we'd set this milk out

378
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,280
 And I remember one day my mom like I see her talking at the door and she's like no no

379
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,960
 That's okay. We don't want anything and then she goes. Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry and um

380
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,600
 Then she shuts the door and I was like what what happened and mom goes

381
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,480
 Oh my oh my goodness. I feel so bad. I feel so bad. I go what what okay now

382
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,520
 What's going on? She goes well this man came to the house and he all he looked down on his luck

383
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,320
 He looked like things were not going well in his life and he's a door-to-door salesman

384
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,800
 so that's a really difficult job and he already looked like things weren't going well and

385
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,200
 Knocked on the door tried selling my mom something. She said no and then as he went to leave he stepped

386
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,000
 he stepped

387
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,440
 He stepped in the bowl of cat milk spilling cat milk all over his pant leg, right

388
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,120
 It wasn't cat milk. It wasn't milk from a cat

389
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,200
 But it was it was a sizable amount of milk. He got her all over his leg

390
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
 And I remember my mom was she felt really bad about it because here you have this guy

391
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,160
 Who's already things aren't going good for him now he has milk all over his clothes the worst material because you got to wash it

392
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,240
 Right away. Otherwise you're going to start smelling like sour milk. It's all over his sock. It's all over his shoe

393
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:25,920
 And my mom's telling the story and she can't finish it without kind of smiling, right? Because it's also kind of it's like

394
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,560
 You're so down on your luck and then you get milk

395
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,640
 And then you get milk all over you and we always we always felt super bad for the guy

396
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,440
 But me and my brother and my mom always used that as

397
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,720
 An end of a phrase whenever we were talking about bad news

398
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,160
 We're like, yeah in johnny not only did he fall down and break his ankle

399
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,360
 But then his girlfriend left him and then he stepped in some milk

400
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,880
 Like that was always the way for us to end a phrase of a streak of bad luck was stepped in some milk

401
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,800
 So maybe that maybe that salesman is listening to us right now

402
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,080
 Anyways cat milk aside or just milk for cats aside

403
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,480
 1963

404
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,600
 Max albert's is driving down the street. He sees the woman. It's a woman again this time

405
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,440
 Dressed in all black soaking wet clothes now. This is interesting

406
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:19,360
 Because all of these stories were a local legend in the area and then they became campfire stories that people told all over west virginia

407
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,080
 And then they were collected

408
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,080
 In a book of writings by a guy named jim comstock. He wrote wrote about this story in the 1970s. It's been

409
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,440
 nationwide sense

410
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,200
 This one's interesting because this one he's driving down the road and this phantom this woman walks out of the bushes

411
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,000
 Dripping wet black clothes a phantom an oracle of death and the guy doesn't hear what she says

412
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,600
 He's driving down the road and he sees her step out into the road

413
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,000
 And she points at him and he's she's saying something but he doesn't hear what she's saying what what i'm sorry

414
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,520
 Lay what she's like kennedy will die. He's like, well, I can't hear you. I'm like what car's super loud

415
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,200
 She's like i'm trying to warn you kennedy's gone. He doesn't stop

416
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,160
 He just keeps on driving and this story is included in this collection because in 1963 is when kennedy died

417
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,280
 Now he apparently told people when he got to the next town of super weirders or haven't on the road

418
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,920
 This woman popped out of the bush just started yelling at me

419
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,400
 And I just kept driving and people are like, uh, and then kennedy dies that year

420
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,120
 What's interesting about that part of the story is that

421
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,760
 If the story is made up

422
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,360
 That wouldn't be in there, right? If the story is 100% made up

423
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,280
 You wouldn't add in a part where the guy doesn't hear the warning

424
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,080
 Does that make sense like if you're I've always you I've used this for a couple different times a couple different episodes

425
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,240
 If the story is made up, it should be more

426
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,040
 A little more sensational doesn't have to be over the top

427
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,120
 It doesn't have to be that she actually like hopped out of his glove box and said lee harvey all's well

428
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,280
 It's going to shoot you don't have to have it that dramatic, but he should at least have heard the warning

429
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,560
 Because if you're making it up you can change the facts here if you want

430
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,640
 The fact that he didn't hear the warning at all and simply told someone later that this happened and everyone was like, oh

431
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,240
 Makes me think that the story might be true

432
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:15,840
 So that's kind of creepy that for whatever reason this location now there are five different places in west virginia called horse creek

433
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,640
 Nobody knows which one

434
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,240
 It actually is which again makes me if it was made up

435
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,120
 You would say it was this horse creek and this location and these these are what happened each time

436
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,520
 This is what the person said you can make it super specific because you're making it up out a whole cloth

437
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,320
 This is the interesting part. Let's say that this is true. Let's accept that these stories are true

438
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,360
 There's a location for whatever reason horse creek in west virginia

439
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,840
 That a phantom will appear whenever a president is assassinated

440
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:51,280
 If that story is true, you know as well as I do that there is a secret service agent

441
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 in that area now

442
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,640
 The first time there was no secret service back when Lincoln was killed. You didn't know what to think about

443
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
 And the second time when garfield died, you'd be like, oh, that's kind of weird, right?

444
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,880
 But by the third time that it happens, you know if the cia is testing like psychic abilities

445
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,760
 Walking through walls all this stuff. You know that someone in the government has heard these stories and said

446
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,840
 Let's find this horse creek. There's only five of them

447
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,360
 And if they don't know which one's which you could have someone in each location

448
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,760
 You could easily pay someone to just fish all day long at horse creek

449
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,120
 It doesn't have to be the same guy. They can work shifts, but you'd have someone there all the time

450
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,080
 What would it really cost you have five locations?

451
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,600
 Rotating shifts you have two to three people working a camp at a time. So for 15 employees

452
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,640
 You could predict whether or not a president was going to be assassinated

453
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,600
 And what's interesting is that the last sighting was in 1963

454
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,800
 And all of these sightings the person warns of the death ahead of time

455
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,840
 Let's them know it's coming

456
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,400
 So is it possible that after 1963 word gets out about this urban legend of west virginia

457
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,200
 Which is right in that hub of you have the pentagon you have Langley all that stuff. They say let's take some agents

458
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,240
 Have them camp out

459
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,080
 Big big ol they can sit there and make s'mores all day long big ol jamboree. We can come and visit on the weekends

460
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,520
 And if this happens again

461
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,320
 Will be warned in the 1980s the Reagan was almost assassinated he was shot

462
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
 You got a secret as the guy was pulling the trigger putting bullets into Reagan

463
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,120
 one of the secret service agents jumped in and stuck his finger in between the trigger

464
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:45,120
 And the other part of the gun where the trigger goes he stuck his finger in behind the trigger

465
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,560
 So another shot couldn't get out. That's one in a million

466
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,160
 That's what training's for sticking your finger as it's going pop as that trigger's pulling back pop

467
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,760
 Pop his finger goes in and jams the gun. He can't get another shot off

468
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,880
 Is it possible that on that day people were prepared for an attack?

469
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,200
 On the president. Is it possible that there are creeks in west virginia staffed by secret service agents?

470
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,320
 Just in case

471
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,720
 It may seem like a tall tale. It may seem like a campfire story

472
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,080
 But when you have the life of the leader of the free world on the line

473
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,800
 Is it really that much trouble to have a couple secret service agents fishing?

474
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,600
 hunting and waiting

475
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,600
 For a spirit to warn them of an assassination

476
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,520
