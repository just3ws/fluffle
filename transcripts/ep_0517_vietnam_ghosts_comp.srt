1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 When it comes to sports, these two players bring new meaning to the term "double-double."

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we travel to Vietnam to take a look at a few odd ghost stories coming out of that region of the world.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 When the United States sent in their troops to try to deal with the Viet Cong,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 little did they know they may be going face-to-face with this supernatural foe today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover today.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So we're gonna slide right into this like it's just one big old slip and slide.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 First off, while we're going down the slip and slide, let's give a high-five to our latest Patreon, Robert Paulson.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 He also did the artwork for the Ouija flyer that we have, so thank you very much for that.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 He got a shout-out for that. Now he's getting a shout-out for being a Patreon supporter.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Really, really appreciate it. Once again, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, totally understand that as well.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Just help get the word out about the show really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Robert, let's go ahead and touch you those keys of that Dead Rabbit Durgible because we are flying to a basketball game.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble, bump, bump, bump, bump, whatever sound those balls would make.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Bump, bump, bump, bump, apparently they're drawn. They're bouncing Frisbees off his stuff.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 They're playing this basketball game. We're flying high above the stadium.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We got the best seats in the house if you haven't had telescopes for eyes.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We're watching the Washington Wizards play the Boston Celtics. It's April 30th, 2017.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I want to give a shout-out to Roger Sherman. He's a journalist for TheRinger.com.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 He's the one who brought this to my attention. We're watching this game, Washington Wizards vs. the Boston Celtics.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And during the game, ahhhh my ankle!

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Little whistle, little Simbo willy whistle. Mark Hefe Morris.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 He plays for the Washington Wizards. Ahhhh my ankle, he's down on the ground.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 He's like, "Wizards, help me with your magical powers." The team's like, "We're not real wizards, bro.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 We've been telling you that all season long. He's like, "Help me, almighty ones."

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So Mark Hefe Morris is helped, isn't helped by his wizard cohorts.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 He's actually taken out of the game and the medics check him out.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 His ankle got hurt really bad and people are like, "Oh man, this is the Eastern Conference semifinals.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 This is a very important game and this is bad."

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Mark Hefe Morris suffered a pretty bad ankle injury. Who knows when he'll be able to play again?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 May 2nd, 2017. It's the next game of the playoffs.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And announcing Mark Hefe Morris, he's running out. He's jumping extra hard on his ankle.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 See guys, we are wizards. I healed my ankle.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Oh yeah, yeah, and his Celtics are kind of looking at each other.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Like that's kind of weird. He's doing jumping jacks.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Doing one leg of jumping jacks. He's totally showing off at this point.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Both the Celtics are like, "What?" And the ref's like, "Woooh, play ball!"

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So they're dribbling. And Mark Hefe Morris actually plays his best game of the playoffs.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 On this busted ankle. He's spinning around on his ankle after each shot he's doing ballet moves.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So the conspiracy theory starts.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Not that they're actual wizards, not that they actually performed some sort of black magic back there.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 They sacrificed the bust in Celtic at Full Moon. Used his essence to heal Mark Hefe Morris.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 No, it's actually more interesting than that because it's real, maybe, allegedly.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Mark Hefe Morris has an identical twin named Marcus Morris.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 They're both professional NBA players.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Marcus was with the Detroit Pistons, and they had already been knocked out of the conference.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I guess you could say their Pistons were out of alignment.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 A, A, is I'm nudging Robert Paulson. He's trying to fly the dirge.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Get it, get it. Keep nudging him. Keep nudging him for the rest of the episode.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 The Detroit Pistons were out of alignment. They couldn't fire on all cylinders.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So they got kicked out of the conference.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 So his brother, Marcus Morris, was just hanging out, racing at home.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And this is a conspiracy theory that Mark Hefe and Morris switched places.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 The guy who played in that other game was his brother.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Now, of course, you could push back and say, "Yeah, they're identical, and yeah, they are both professional NBA players."

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But have they ever done anything like this before?

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 They actually have played for each other before.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 They did it before back in 2013, when they were playing for the amateur athletic union basketball.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 One of them got injured, and the other one was fouled out, so they just swapped jerseys.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And the dude who fouled out went in and played his brother.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Now, Mark Hefe Morris is covered in tattoos.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And so is Marcus Morris, which usually would be a way to tell him apart, but they have identical tattoos.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So there's two questions here. One, did they do it? And two, doesn't matter.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 That second question is, yeah, it would totally matter, because so much money is on the line.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Otherwise, you could just have, you could only, like, imagine you're a basketball coach, right?

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And you're at, like, the hospital, right?

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And you're, like, looking at all these babies, and you're like, "I'm looking for the newest NBA players.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I got a scheme going." And they're like, "Sir, get out of here. You're not even wearing protective gear."

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 He's like, "Yeah." So he comes back in, he's disguised as a doctor now, and he's like, "Hmm.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Yeah, look at this one. It's a little pudgy. Look at this guy.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Can't even support the weight of his own head. Ah, these babies suck."

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And then he turns around and he sees triplets, and he's like, "Hmm."

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 He goes to the parents, and he goes, "Tell you what, I'm big shot sports agent guy.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 What if I could guarantee you that all of your kids will be major league basketball players?"

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And the guy's like, "What are you talking about? They're like three days old."

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He's like, "Hear me out. Hear me out."

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And then we put him in an elite training school, and we train him. But here's the kicker.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Here's the kicker, guys. Only one of them will play at a time, seeing the other two.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 They're all to get matching tattoos as well. He says that under his breath, not super loud like I did.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And you get one of them. We'll get them. We'll come up with one singular name for them.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 The other two will just be hiding in the shadows.

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And then if something happens to the first one, then the second one can sub in.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I actually realize this is a terrible idea because you have to not only hope that one of them

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 is genetically gifted enough to become a professional athlete and have the drive to do it,

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 you have to get all three of them.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Because what makes sense if you had the first one get injured, and he's like this super tall, lean,

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 hardcore basketball player, super dedicated, and then the second one goes in and he gets like DUI or something.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 He can't. He couldn't even make it to the stadium. He got pulled over.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And then the third one's just like some dude. He's like some architect or something.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 He doesn't have all of his tattoos or of like building blueprints and stuff like that.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 He's getting ready to break his brother out of prison.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Yeah, it wouldn't work. He would be so sorry if there was a sports agent right now writing down notes.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 He's like, "Whoa, this podcast is gold. I can't wait to do this."

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Step one, invade a maternity ward.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But did they switch places? We will never know.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 The only people who truly know that is the Morris Twins and they aren't talking.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I was trying to think of a twin pun. What's a twin pun for like being quiet?

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Because they...

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Because they're just quiet. Because they're just... they're gonna keep in secrets and getting the same tattoos.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 That's all I can come up with.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Email me your twin/quiet jokes. I will enjoy them greatly.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Robert Paulson, let's go ahead and jump out of this dead rabbit dirgeable.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Pair shoot down. It's a very inefficient way to switch vehicles.

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And then we're going to take the carpenter copter.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Let's go for a little ride.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So Robert, take us on out to the Bronx. It's 1965.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Now we're gonna meet three young friends, William, John and Jerry.

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 These kids have all been friends since high school. They're walking through the alleyways.

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I just imagined Bronx is just one giant trash strewn alleyway with like doors every so often.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Come home, Willie. They're pushing each other through the garbage strewn alley.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Hoping one of them has a superhero origin story. They're trash man.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 They were trashed and they were pushed into a barrel of radioactive trash.

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 They do it all day long and then they come home and they're like, "Oh, I don't have any superpowers."

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 They were friends from kindergarten to high school.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And in 1965 is when they're graduating.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Now William and John, both, their families are better off.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They live in the much better alley, but they live in the nicer alley full of nicer garbage in the Bronx.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So they're able to actually afford to go to Notre Dame.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Jerry didn't really have that. He was raised by a single mother.

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They had just a single trash can. They didn't have a full dumpster like William and John.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 He wasn't able to go to Notre Dame.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And William said that he lost contact with Jerry over the years, which is what happens to all of us, right?

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 We all lose contact with Jerry's.

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Now while he's in Notre Dame, during the summer he comes back home and he works the construction job.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 William, I'm talking about William here.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 In 1967, it's one of those summers he's working construction.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 He's staying with his mom and he said the work was just grueling.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I mean, construction work is always hard labor.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 So one day he's walking home to his mom's house and he could barely lift each foot off the ground.

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He's like, "I wish I had a twin. I wish I had a twin that could walk home and then I would just magically appear at home."

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Or better yet, just show up to my job in the first place.

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 But I don't. He's walking home and as he's walking through the neighborhood, it's starting to get dark.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 The street lights are kind of on. That moment of dusk.

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Now in his neighborhood they have St. Helena Church. It's on one side of the street.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 On the other side of the street is Gleason's funeral home.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And as he's walking through his old neighborhood, he actually sees Jerry, who I hadn't seen in years.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It had been two years since he even talked to Jerry.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 He sees Jerry exit a building and is now walking towards William.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Now we've all been here, guys.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 We've all been here where we're just really tired. We're exhausted.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 We see someone or we look at our phone and there's a phone call coming through and we just don't want to pick up the phone, right?

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 We're just so tired.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Now it's William at this point.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 William has just had an exhausting day. It was a super hot summer.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 He pulls his hard hat down a bit, kind of shadows his face, looks down,

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 pretends that he doesn't see his old friend Jerry and walks right by him.

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 When he gets home, his mom is on the phone and he can tell almost immediately something is wrong.

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 His mom is on the phone with his friend John, who he'd known all of his life and was currently in Notre Dame with.

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And the mom hands the phone to William.

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Says, "You gotta talk to John."

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 William grabs the phone and John says, "I have bad news.

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Jerry Fox. Jerry Fox was killed in Vietnam.

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 His body is at Gleason's funeral home and he'll be waked there tomorrow."

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Now this obviously doesn't make sense to William.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 He just saw Jerry just a couple minutes ago walking out of the street

159
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 and he realizes that the building he saw Jerry walk out of was the funeral home.

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He said, "I didn't even know Jerry was drafted.

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I didn't even know that he had gone over to Vietnam. What are you telling me? He's dead now?"

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 John's like, "Yeah."

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Now if you were able to go to college at that time, you could actually defer the draft.

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But because Jerry didn't have the opportunity to go to college, he got drafted.

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 William doesn't believe this.

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 William's saying, "I just saw him down the street and John's like, 'Listen, I don't know what that was,'"

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 but he's passed away. He's dead. They're going to have a service tomorrow.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 This is the neighborhood they all grew up in. They all worshiped at that church.

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Maybe a couple weirdos worshiped at the funeral home. I don't know.

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 But it was this area they grew up in. It would make sense that Jerry's body was brought back there.

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 The next day William is at the wake and he meets Jerry's mom.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Once again, he knew her growing up, but she's just besides herself, right?

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 She's upset about the whole thing.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So what happened was, and this detail actually gave Jerry's mother a sense of comfort

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 because she knew this was the son that she raised.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 On July 12, 1967, they had the battle of Map Sheet 65363.

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I mean, not everything's the battle of the Bulge or the battle of the Rhine.

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Most battles are just fought as coordinates. They're just a little ledger sheet.

179
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 This is a true story, by the way. I was actually able to find the battle that this kid fought in Diden.

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So the main story that William is telling, he wrote himself on the Notre Dame alumni blog.

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And there's tons of photos, not photos of ghosts and stuff like that.

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 There's a blurry photo of Jerry walking on the street. This is about as well documented as a ghost story as you can get.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It's a very fascinating story.

184
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 But I was able to actually find this battle that he fought in.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It was in the La Drang River Valley. Jerry and 24 other men in Bravo Company were caught in a sustained ambush.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I was reading the battle report. It was just wave after wave of Viet Cong repenting them down.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 The US Army was trying to send in helicopter units reinforcements to get these guys out of there. They couldn't.

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 There was just too much enemy fire. There was environmental issues as far as smoke and fog and everything going on.

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You had like a new commander in charge of the area. You had just basically a cluster of bad events going on.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 The soldiers who came to Jerry's mother's door to give her the news of her son told her, "Your son fought to the last bullet."

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 He was actually the last man standing in his group.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And he just kept firing and firing and firing, killing as many of the enemy as he can.

193
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 He was the last one and then they shot him in the neck. He died very quickly.

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Now that would be a horrible thing, obviously, if someone came up to you and said, "Hey, this happened to your loved one."

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 But it could also give you a sense of one that he died quickly, right?

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 They're not like, and then after the fourth day, the bullet wound infested and the maggot set in.

197
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 A bullet to the neck is a pretty quick end. But also knowing that your son was a hero, not only a hero, he's a tough guy.

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He's from the Bronx. Everyone was dead and he wouldn't give up and he kept shooting until he couldn't shoot anymore.

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 But William had another issue going on here. He wasn't just mourning the death of his friend.

200
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 He was incensed with the fact that he turned his back on his friend when he needed him the most.

201
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Obviously, William couldn't be there in Vietnam with him.

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 But he took this encounter with Jerry as Jerry reaching out to him.

203
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 A lifelong friend that not even death could separate, that his friend walked out of that funeral home as a specter, as a ghost.

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But William was just too tired to bother. He pulls his hat down and keeps on going.

205
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 That haunted him. That action haunted him for decades.

206
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 He always thought, "I turned my back on Jerry when he needed me most."

207
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And it's really interesting to take a look at this blog. It's going to links in the show notes, of course.

208
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But he ends up, the story doesn't end there for him. That's obviously the end of the ghost story.

209
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 But he carries this guilt for decades. To this day, he wears a bracelet with his buddy's rank and date of death on it.

210
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 He wears this metal bracelet on his hand. He says, "Whenever I'm sitting there and I think I can't do it, I can't do it."

211
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 He has his voice inside of him saying, "You're living for two people. You gotta do it."

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 He uses it as a motivating factor.

213
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 At one point, he visited with his family, the Vietnam Memorial. He's there with his granddaughter.

214
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And he finds his buddy's name and he begins sobbing. His granddaughter's like, "What's wrong? What's wrong?"

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And he's like, "What do I tell her that I turned my back on my friend?"

216
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 This is something that's haunted him. It's funny because the ghost part of it, the haunting part of it,

217
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 it wasn't what tormented him as it would normally be in a story. It's the ghost in your closet that torments you.

218
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Not the fact that you left the ghost in the closet all these years. You're like, "I should have invited him out for brisket."

219
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 This idea that he let his friend down, he ends up even later visiting Vietnam.

220
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And he said that he wasn't able to visit the battlefield, which probably a great idea.

221
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 There might be some like, "Pungy" sticks out. There's some landmines.

222
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 When he was in Vietnam, he actually forgave the people of Vietnam for killing his friend.

223
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 He was able to go, "I can understand why this was going on. I don't harbor any ill will towards your nation."

224
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 He forgave the people of Vietnam for killing his friend. And even then, he couldn't forgive himself.

225
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 He ends his blog when he's talking about all of these things he's done to kind of change his life.

226
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 He ends his blog with this phrase, "It works, but does it atone?"

227
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 So even after all that, even after living his life for two people, trying to honor Jerry's memory, forgiving the people who killed him,

228
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 he still doesn't know whether or not he atoned for walking past that ghost.

229
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I think it's a really interesting story because you have the paranormal aspect. And again, this is about as well sourced as a ghost story can be.

230
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Most ghost stories are, "I saw something." All this stuff with the orbs and the stuff like that, that's actually less reliable,

231
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 because we can replicate orbs right away.

232
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But when you have a guy who saw this ghost back in 1967, spent his entire life trying to get over that,

233
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 and then goes to a Notre Dame alumni website, writes the story out with photos of himself using his real name,

234
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 that's about as well sourced as a ghost story can get. Really.

235
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And the fact that the battle took place, the guy was really alive, all of this stuff, you can verify everything.

236
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 This is probably as well sourced as they get. So I find that fascinating.

237
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 It takes a lot to put yourself on the line, especially when you're like a professional in the world too.

238
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 It's interesting because a lot of times that the worst damage we can do is the damage we do to ourselves, right?

239
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Sometimes we damage ourselves more than any ghost or ghoul. Good.

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Now let me go ahead and wrap it up like this, because that's a fairly kind of downer ending.

241
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Let's go ahead and end it like this. Robert Paulson, we're firing up that carbon helicopter one last time.

242
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 We're going to Vietnam. We're back in time, the Vietnam War is in full bore at this point.

243
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 We're flying over the battlefield. This is a really, really odd story. It's not super long, but so I found out about the story of William and Jerry on a website called military.com.

244
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And the article was "Four Creepy Ghost Stories from the Vietnam War". It's written by Blake Stillwell.

245
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Now it's military.com. It's not an actual, it's not run by the military as far as I know the US military.

246
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 That'd be horrible editor to work for, right? Constantly screaming in your ear.

247
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 It's pretty much stuff like, oh, a drone, beat an airplane in a race or something like that.

248
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And then here's some new, look at brand new guns for 2020. These guns shoot 100 times faster. It's military stuff, right?

249
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But every so often, you know, Halloween comes up. People want puff pieces and things like that.

250
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So Blake Stillwell wrote "Four Creepy Ghost Stories from the Vietnam War".

251
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 One of them was the story of William and Jerry.

252
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 They had one about a Saigon hotel that supposedly haunted that the bodies of four dead virgins were buried under each corner of it to protect it from curses or stuff like that,

253
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 because it had 13 floors. Here's a tip. Just build 12 floors so you don't have to bury virgins under it.

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But that's a real legend in the city of Saigon. That's a real hotel.

255
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Now one of the stories was from Reddit's No Sleep subreddit, which is like horror based.

256
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Some people say it's real. Some people say it's fake. But it's easy to get tricked with No Sleep.

257
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 If you're not familiar with the subreddit, if someone just goes, "Hey, you got to read this crazy story from Vietnam".

258
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 It was about a guy, a tunnel rat. It was about a guy who was crawling through tunnels in Vietnam who ran into ghosts.

259
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They ran into ghosts down there, which makes sense because, you know, they're super spooky.

260
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Tunnels are super spooky anyways and these things were death traps.

261
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Those were three of the stories. This was the fourth one.

262
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And the reason why I wanted to set that up, because two of those stories are true.

263
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 William and Jerry in the Saigon hotel. The No Sleep one. May or may not have been.

264
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 It's, you know, it's spooky tunnel stuff. The last one was this, though. I found this really odd.

265
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 He said that Blake Stillwell tells a story about how when the Marines got into Vietnam, the first thing that it was fine locals to help guide them through the jungles.

266
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 There's an indigenous group of people in Vietnam known as the Montenard, is the indigenous people there.

267
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 They hated the North Vietnamese. They're like, "Yeah, we'll totally help you". But we're not taking you through there.

268
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 The Marines looking. They're just pointing to the jungle and they're like, "Well, we need to know the jungle".

269
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 We'll show you that jungle over there, that lightly jungled jungle.

270
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And over here where there is no jungle, it's a river, but not there. Not in the jungle itself.

271
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 The deeper it gets, we're not going to do that. The Marines are like, "What are you talking about?"

272
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 So, all countries basically a jungle. They said, "You got to understand, in the jungle lives the maw".

273
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 In Vietnam culture, "maw" is basically a catch-all term for any sort of supernatural being.

274
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 It could be a friendly poltergeist, it could be a horrible malevolent spirit, it could be a demon, it could be a cryptid, it's a maw.

275
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 So, we'll lead you all around the jungle, but we're not going to go in there.

276
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 1965, top brass in the US military starts getting reports of Marines encountering things in the trees.

277
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And they're like, "Viet Cong, did you shoot them?" And they're like, "No, no, no, they were moving too fast to be human."

278
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And they just get written down in a report somewhere and filed away.

279
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But these reports kept coming out. The Marines are like, "We know why the guides won't lead us deep into the jungle,

280
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 because the problem is, is whatever these things are, live in darkness."

281
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And the jungle is so thick in some places, there is no sunlight coming through the canopy.

282
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 It could be in the middle of the afternoon, and there's a creature up in the tree.

283
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 They allow a little report, file it away.

284
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 You begin to have incidents where Marines were coming back and saying, "We had a firefight with something."

285
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Okay, what was it? Was it a tank? Was it a bunch of vehicles? No, no, no, no, no.

286
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Something came out of the trees and they're like, "Great." They're starting to write it down.

287
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 These things are being reported to be bulletproof. They could move too quickly.

288
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Sometimes they would have fangs, glowing eyes.

289
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Sometimes, as troops were moving through the jungle, one of them would be swiftly snatched away,

290
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 and they would catch a glimpse of their fellow soldier being dragged up into the jungle.

291
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 They'd go for pursuit, obviously. Maybe they would find him dead, or maybe they wouldn't find him at all.

292
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Write it down in a report.

293
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Blake Stillwell, in his article with this, he says, "These stories of soldiers being snatched away,

294
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 of being devoured by these creatures that were bulletproof, they were too fast to stop,

295
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 is the real reason why Agent Orange was used in Vietnam."

296
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Agent Orange was a defoilant. You would just pour it out of helicopters and airplanes,

297
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 and it would land on trees and they'd all melt, and then you would basically have a big old, flat area,

298
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 that you could see for a mile, much easier to move tanks and troops through,

299
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 and a lot harder to hide in if it's just an open plane.

300
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I had to do a bunch of research on Agent Orange. I actually have personal experience with Agent Orange.

301
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 My uncle was exposed to it in Vietnam. He was in a helicopter. He served in Vietnam.

302
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 He was in combat in Vietnam. He would talk about, "You just have barrels of Agent Orange just sitting out in the open."

303
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Like, nobody knew. I mean, it rotted plants to the root, right?

304
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 The government's like, "It's totally fine. It's named after Orange. What Orange thing can you think is bad?"

305
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And people are like, "Yeah, I guess you're right."

306
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 He was exposed to it. He's had some neurological issues. He's had quite a few neurological issues due to it, but

307
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Agent Orange is a real thing. We know it was used in Vietnam.

308
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It's a very, very bold claim to say that's why it was used in Vietnam,

309
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 was to destroy the jungles so they could get rid of the maw.

310
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 It could be a tongue-in-cheek joke at the end of the article. It could be something that people who really, really know military history.

311
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Because the foilants were used before Vietnam. They were used in, like, a Malaysian conflict that the British were involved in.

312
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 That was the first time they were used in widespread in war, but it would be a weird joke to make at the end of an article

313
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 involving dead virgins and a man mourning not saying goodbye to his friend, and then the no sleep one.

314
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Which, to be honest, I didn't read that one. It was like six parts. It had to be at least 10,000 words.

315
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 I was like, "Ghost in the tunnel. Get it. Maybe it's the best thing ever written. Maybe it's 100% true."

316
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I didn't have time, but so out of the four stories one I didn't read, two of them are real.

317
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 It would be weird at the end to kind of make a joke about something that, one, Agent Orange

318
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 resulted in massive lawsuits from soldiers against the government.

319
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 That's the real reason why you guys have neurological damage veterans. It was to kill the ghost.

320
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I'm wondering if there is any truth to this.

321
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Were there really US troops fighting ghosts in Vietnam? That's obviously the most interesting question.

322
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 But two, is it possible that that's a common conspiracy theory among veterans?

323
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Not that it was actually true, but that veterans actually have started to surmise the real reason why chemical warfare was used in Vietnam.

324
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Was not to choke out the food supply of the Viet Cong or to destroy their cover, but was for some more sinister reason.

325
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Jungles are always a place of hidden secrets.

326
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Sometimes you can be walking through the jungle and find the ruins of a civilization no one ever knew existed.

327
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 There's 500 feet off the beaten path, covered in vines.

328
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Sometimes you can be walking through the jungle and enter yourself and lay there for days, maybe weeks, screaming out in pain, screaming out for help.

329
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 But even those who want to find you never can.

330
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 The jungle may be one of the most hostile, livable environments on earth.

331
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Deserts and arctic wastelands just aren't there for humans to live in.

332
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But you can live a pretty good life in a jungle if you know the layout.

333
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 If you don't, the jungle will swallow you whole.

334
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 When the US military dropped hundreds of thousands of troops into a foreign jungle, they faced all sorts of obstacles.

335
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Other than the Viet Cong.

336
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 From disease, from predators, from hidden traps.

337
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 The jungle was a whole new battle environment for the soldiers of the US military to fight in.

338
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 But it's possible there was another foe they were fighting there, a supernatural foe.

339
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Something that never got reported back home, but that the soldiers still remember.

340
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 That day they were out with their platoon.

341
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 They encountered something and every bullet was fired and it wouldn't stop coming.

342
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 This would be one of those stories that the US military would never let get out.

343
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 They would cover it up as some sort of superstition.

344
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 They wouldn't want the world to know that there was some sort of supernatural creature that was engaging their troops in Vietnam.

345
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And not because of some sort of bizarre cover-up, not because of some sort of Illuminati thing where they want to keep people from knowing the truth.

346
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 It's actually more sinister than that.

347
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 This thing, this maw, whatever it was, would be the perfect soldier.

348
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 The military wouldn't want to kill it. They'd want to capture it.

349
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Bulletproof, agile, relentless. Why wouldn't you want that on your side?

350
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 They could have dumped the Agent Orange to make these things easier to find.

351
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Not easier to kill.

352
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Even if it killed a hundred US soldiers, even if it killed a thousand US soldiers,

353
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 that would be a small price to pay to get something like that in the hands of the US government.

354
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Because if they knowingly exposed their own soldiers to a neurological toxin,

355
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 they would be willing to do anything to obtain the ultimate weapon.

356
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And the ultimate weapon would be a creature like the maw.

357
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
