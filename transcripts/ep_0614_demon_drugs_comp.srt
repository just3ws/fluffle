1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 You step onto an elevator, ding!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 And inside this elevator is Barack Obama.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 That's odd enough. You always thought he took the stairs.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 But when you get on the elevator and he presses the button, to Mars, you go, "What?"

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 That was literally the fifth try of an introduction that someone was sticking with.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And then we take a look at a more disturbing story, and this may contain some cursed audios,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 but I'll let you know beware to shut the podcast off if you don't want a bunch of demons falling around your house.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Is it possible there's a selling point for you?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Is it possible that the connection between the demonic world and drugs is much, much closer than we ever imagined today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I hope you guys are putting some thought into what you're doing for your 90 days to a better you challenge.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I've decided what mine is. I'm going to focus on maximizing my weightlifting.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Something I did a lot in high school and college. I've done it on and off over the years.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I've actually set my goals of how heavy I want to be lifting in 90 days.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I've also cut out all nicotine, which I had been doing previous weeks, but I've also now cut out all caffeine, all sugar.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And I'm actually going to focus on, this will be hard for me, I'm going to cut out artificial sugar.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Definitely limited to the amount that I'm drinking now with all of my little fruity carbonated water drinks.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But my main focus I have on my wall, a list of all of the weightlifting goals I want to be at in three months.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Let's make these 90 days to a better you work for me, because I need your guys support too, and work for you as well.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So now's the time to kind of formulate a plan of what you think you need to do to be in a better place 90 days from now.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I wanted to share that with you because I hadn't told you what I was going to do.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 I knew it was going to be fitness related, but I really needed to narrow it down, and that actually plays into our last story, but we'll save that for a bit.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 First off, let's welcome in two Dead Rabbit Command, our newest Patreon supporter, slinking in the shadows, being pursued by a group of hounds.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's Super Fine Volpine, everyone give a round of applause to Super Fine Volpine, runs up on our shoulders, like a little fox.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 We keep the hounds at bay, one of them can be your best friend.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Super Fine Volpine is like, "No, I'm anthropomorphic fox, I'm not an actual fox that's sitting in your lap as I'm petting Super Fine Volpine."

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Super Fine Volpine, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 If you're not a fox, and you can't support the Patreon, that's okay too, just help spread the word about the show.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Super Fine Volpine, we're going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 We're headed out to a little place, you might have heard of it, no one is Los Angeles.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Dun-un, dun-un, dun-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un-un

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 [singing]

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 The UFO expert.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Maybe he is an actual lawyer, but for the rest of them you kind of just shrug your shoulders.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Really anyone can run for president if he gets enough signatures.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 But Andrew Basagio, which sounds like the worst serial ever, didn't become president, but he did do the second best thing.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 He begins going on tour to UFO conventions.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 So he's walking around with a little hat saying, "Probe me."

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And like a little button that says, "Look at my hat, it's a funny joke."

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And he's, you know, he's a lawyer, so I can make too many jokes about what he's doing at the convention, at these conventions.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I know what I would be doing at these conventions, I'd be hooking up with hot alien babes.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But Andrew's not me and I'm not Andrew.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Andrew is probably just eating basagios back in his days.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 He's like, "How come no one will buy my serial?"

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 He's eating a big bowl of basagios.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 He's going to these UFO conventions for a purpose.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 He's not going there just to hook up with hot alien babes.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 He's going there with a purpose. He's actually a speaker at some of these conventions.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And this is his story.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 He claims that in Los Angeles, there is a place known as 999 Sepulveda Boulevard.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 There's a building there.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Very, very key point.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 There's a building there. You're like, "Jason, there's a building in Los Angeles?"

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I know, can you believe it? There's a building at 999 Sepulveda Boulevard.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And when he was a child, he was part of a thing called Project Pegasus.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 You go into the building, you've got step one being in the project.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 They're like, "You're in. Like the second you walk in, you're in the program, son."

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 He's like, "What? I just came to deliver the mail."

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 You go into this building, you go to the elevator, you hit a button.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Ding! It opens up.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Why am I just describing what you do in a building now?

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It's educational podcast for nitwits.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But this isn't just any ordinary elevator.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 No, no, no, no, no. This is in a building on 999 Sepulveda Boulevard.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So you press this button in this elevator and it goes, "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 You press this button in this elevator and it goes up. It goes up like elevators tend to do. They do that 50% of the time.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 But when the elevator reaches its destination, the door changes.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 It's not any normal rectangular door for us homo sapiens.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 The door morphs like 1990s television technology. The graphics get...

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And it becomes something different.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 You pass through this door. You're on Mars.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Which is pretty dope, right? I bet you didn't know there was an elevator that went to Mars.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I bet you didn't even know there were bases on Mars.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 We don't have either of those things, but Andrew Visogio says...

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I mean, he knows more than I did. He ran for president.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So he does this. He's on Mars.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Now, he says that he was a member of Project Pegasus.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 They were constantly being teleported around to Mars.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And that's the time he gets on the elevator and he meets Barack Obama.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 He goes... Which is interesting. That's impressive, I guess.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I remember once I got in a lot of hot water when I said if I met Bill Gates, I wouldn't be impressed.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Like, he would just... I'd be like, "Oh, huh? What? I put my headphones back in?"

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I'm like, "Oh, thanks, good sir. But no, I don't want to hear about your microchip. I put my headphones back in."

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I wouldn't be impressed. Like, sure, he's like a billionaire.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I'm like, he invented computers and stuff like that in his garage.

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But I'm not impressed. I mean, like, if my buddy did it, I'd be like, super proud that my buddy did it.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 But just some random dude who did it a long time ago. I don't care.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 If I met Barack Obama, I'd probably be a little more impressed.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I'd be like, "Hey, you're that guy who won an election?"

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Because that's really what you do, right?

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 When you become a president, you beat two people.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Like, you beat someone the first time.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Like, that's the hard part, is like, winning the election.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And then there's a second election, and he beat somebody else.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I don't remember who did he beat the second time. It was Mitt Romney.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Oh, I mean, like, it's cool, I guess.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I'd be like, "Hey, you're a Netflix producer now. Can you get my show on Netflix?"

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 But like, once you've become president, the hard part's over.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Then you just kind of like, delegate and make decisions.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Like, I would be... I'm not going to say that I wouldn't be...

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I'd be more impressed to meet Barack Obama than I would beat Bill Gates.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Because Bill Gates didn't beat nobody.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Like, basically, for me to be impressed, you have to have overcome a human opponent,

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 or a bear, or a tiger.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I would be impressed slightly if I got an elevator and Barack Obama was there.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Then after I go, "Hey, it's nice to meet you."

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Then I'd put my headphones in and go, "I don't want to hear about your microchip."

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 He's like, "What are you talking about? I don't have any microchips on me."

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 He says, "I shift from side to side."

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So that whole thing aside, this is what's bizarre about it.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 He says that when he was a little kid, he met Barack Obama.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 This guy is in his 50s now, like, in his 40s or his 50s.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Barack Obama's not that old, so he would have met Barack Obama as a child.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Which is far less impressive.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It's like 100 times less impressive, because he's just some nobody.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 He's just some kid in an elevator.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Just standing there, and you're like, "Hey, what's your name?"

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And he'd go, "My name's Barack Obama. Why are you asking me my name?

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 We're both part of a top-seeker mission at a Mars."

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 How would you even remember that you met this dude?

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 You're going to Mars! There's stuff way more fascinating than the kid standing next to you in the elevator.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 But anyways, for some reason he remembers Barack Obama.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 He's hanging out in an elevator with Barack Obama.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 He's going to Mars. That's the most intriguing thing about him.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 He said that he visited Mars 40 times.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 You know, after the first 20, you stop counting, right?

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 You're like, "Oh, what am I doing today?"

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 "Oh, yeah, visiting Mars. Go up to Big Red Dusty Planet."

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It'd be boring up there.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Well, apparently he believes in this human lunar base on there.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Also, that kids are being kidnapped.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We covered that in our Earth First episode, that there's a conspiracy theory that children are being kidnapped on Earth.

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Flying to Mars, it's a 20-year journey, according to this conspiracy theory in that episode.

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It's a 20-year journey, and then they're used as slaves on Mars,

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 which at that point they're not children anymore.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 If you can have an eight-year-old on Earth, and it takes 20 years to get to the nation,

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 you have a strapping, strong, 28-year-old man running off of the ship with a wrench.

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Why are they even doing that?

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 If they have an elevator, just take all the kids to Sepulveda Boulevard.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I'm not giving the government advice on how to kidnap kids and take them to Mars, okay?

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But I'm just saying, there's more efficient ways than to take a 20-year,

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and it doesn't even take 20 years, the rocket journey.

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 That should show how old that conspiracy theory is, really.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 But he says he's been there 40 times. He also says that there's like the children being forced into slavery on Mars,

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 which is ridiculous. If we're on Mars, why don't we have robots? Like, let's just go sci-fi all the way.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 He also said there's a mass grave on Mars, and you can actually see it yourself.

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 If you've ever wanted to see a mass grave, you're like, "Another photo to add to my collection."

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 You have a wall of mass grave photography.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 There's a photo of a mass grave on Mars. He has this picture that it's not, he didn't take it himself.

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 This is like Mars rover pictures that is like this formation.

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 He goes, "Look it, that's obviously a pile of dead bodies."

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 At that point, the psychiatrist is like, "This is the weirdest Rorschach test ever."

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 But apparently there's a photo of a bunch of dead bodies on Mars.

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And this is great. I love this part. He actually wrote a paper in 2008.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 He's been out this for a while. This wasn't like something he lost the election and goes,

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 "You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna BE from Mars!" He was doing this before the election.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 In 2008, he wrote a paper about the mass graves on Mars.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 He wrote like an essay or a dissertation or whatever.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And he turned it, he submitted it to the National Geographic Society.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So they didn't run that story, obviously, because otherwise it would have been the biggest news in the solar system.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 "Mass grave found on Mars," man says. National Geographic changes their headlines, obviously, to become tabloids.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 But no, he submitted it to National Geographic, they turned it down. So you go, Jason.

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 You started the story on Friday, you left us on a cliffhanger.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Barack Obama apparently shows up in the story.

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Are you telling me that this is yet another story about a man who claims that he's been on Mars

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 and there's bases on Mars? You've covered this before, Jason. Come on, man!

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And I put my hand on your shoulder and I go, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're not even close to being done."

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 "Is that what you're gonna watch?" We actually are, but I got a bunch of details to cram in very quickly.

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 First off, 999's to Pulvid of Boulevard is a real location, but creepily enough, it's a highway overpass.

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And anyone who's been spent a lot of time in America, I don't know why, maybe other countries have this too,

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 but we have these sloping green patches underneath overpasses. They're really steep angles.

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And that's what this is. So for a building to have been there back whenever this kid was hanging out in elevators,

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 you would have had to have a building on like a 70-degree angle and it would have had to cut through a highway overpass.

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And you say, "Jason, well, I mean, that's weird if a building did exist there, but a building didn't exist there."

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 "This guy's obviously making the story up." You say, "I didn't say that. I didn't say that about the lawyer."

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 You said that. Obviously, the story is not factual, you say.

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 What's interesting is right next to 999's to Pulvid of Boulevard, like Kitty Corner to it, is the FBI building.

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 The FBI building, a massive complex in the middle of Los Angeles.

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 So is this story some sort of code? Are we supposed to be directed to the FBI office?

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Is it supposed to be some way to catch people who are going out there and the FBI's waiting for them with brick-brack?

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Just going to jump on and take their wallets?

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Why 999's to Pulvid of Boulevard? Did Basagio look up this address? Did he just figure it sounded creepy because it's like 666 upside down?

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Who knows, right? It's just kind of a weird detail to this story. He could have set a nondescript building in Los Angeles,

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 or not even named a city, and then it would have been extra mysterious.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 But he gave an address to a building that doesn't exist, that hasn't existed since freeways were built.

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Unless... So he would have never have gone there unless he was some sort of time traveler.

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And he also claims to be a time traveler, by the way. He has proof of this.

190
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He has proof of this. There is an old timey Civil War photo of a kid standing at Gettysburg.

191
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 He's just ducking his waltz or flying verbose angles. It's before the battle starts, he's standing there.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And he's looking at the camera, which is great. Time traveler 101, if you get caught, stare directly at the camera.

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Time traveler. He says that as a child he went back in time, he went back to Gettysburg.

194
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 There's a photo of all these troops. He stared at the camera, and he has giant shoes on, like clown shoes on.

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And in the background, apparently Abraham Lincoln's talking to a bunch of troops. And he said, "That's me. That's me."

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And people go, "Wait, why... First off, I think at this point people are humorinum, because people don't ask, 'How did you time travel?'

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 'Why did you time travel there? How did you get back?' They ask, apparently, 'Why are your shoes so big?'

198
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And he goes, 'Oh, oh.' He says, apparently, apparently, that when he time traveled back in time, he lost his shoes."

199
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 You didn't know that was under the rules of time travel. One, don't interfere with the time stream.

200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Two, bring shoes. Bring extra shoes. You have to first time travel back to a foot locker, and then go to your destination.

201
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 You have to see time travel back in time, and his shoes fell off or something like that.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So somewhere in the time stream, a shoe falls on Genghis Khan's head. His shoes fell off.

203
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 So when he goes to the Battle of Gettysburg, or right before the Battle of Gettysburg, he has no shoes on.

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Someone's like, 'Hey, you son, what's your name?' And he's like, 'Uh, they're like, 'Never mind. Never mind, future boy.'

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 He's like, 'Oh, no, my cover's blown.' They're like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. We see a lot of people know shoes back here.'

206
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Yeah, come here. And they gave him shoes, but the shoes didn't fit, so the shoes are big.

207
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And he's staring right at the photo. He's a time traveler.

208
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 He's a time traveling 10-year-old boy. He gets caught hanging out at Gettysburg, stares directly at the camera with giant shoes on.

209
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Now, there's a couple of, one, that story is 100% true, and if so, then we've been lied to about physics and reality.

210
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 The other option is that the story's totally made up. The photo's real. The photo is actually real, because the story has to go.

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 This may actually be one of the earliest photos of Abraham Lincoln. The photo is real.

212
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 The question is, is Andrew Besoggio in the photo with big shoes on? So we don't know the answer to that.

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 We can assume the answer is, no, that's not him, right? Because based on physics, based on current physics,

214
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 but the thing with time travel is you don't know, you don't know, right? Current is, doesn't really matter anything when you're talking about time travel.

215
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 We're actually going to get more, that's an interesting segue. We're going to get more to that in a second, but I think the whole story is a little weirder

216
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 than just making fun of a guy who says he met Barack Obama in an elevator, because I don't understand the subolvita boulevard FBI connection.

217
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And the photograph, again, is just kind of a goofy part of it, but the subolvita boulevard thing is the thing that trips me out the most.

218
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Superfine, vulpine, let's leave behind this spooky overpass. I'm going to touch the keys of the carbonicopter. We are headed out to a dark road in Kentucky.

219
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Carbonicopter is flying out there. I have a new segment for today, probably just before today, but I'm going to call it Monday Musings.

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 You guys are already shaking your head. Okay, here's some things that I thought of over the weekend that I'm going to present to you on Monday.

221
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Little brain teasers for you. A superfine vulpine is flying this carbonicopter with little fox hands. I turn to you and I go, what can...

222
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 This segment will either be completely never used again or be the most popular segment on the show.

223
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 What came first? Think about this for a second. You're going to think it's a stupid question, but think about it for a second.

224
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 What came first? The record, like an LP, the record or the record player? Think about it. Think about it. Jason, I thought about it while you were saying it.

225
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Here's another one. This is an interesting one I came up with walking down the road. There's five basic emotions.

226
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Now, some people say there's four, some people say there's eight, but I say there's five. I say there's five. You have happy and sad.

227
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 You have love and hate because like a baby will experience those things. Love and hate, happy and sad. And fear. What's the opposite of fear?

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 There isn't one. There's nothing to counterbalance that, isn't that weird?

229
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 You could say calm. That's more of the opposite of anger. Happy, sad. You can even do angry, calm. Those are more states of being than emotion, but happy, sad, anger, calm, love and hate, fear.

230
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 There's no opposite to fear. There's an antithesis to it. There's not being afraid, but that's not an emotional state.

231
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 That's a reaction to an emotional state that existed and now you're trying to not be that. Very weird thing. Here's another one. This is a bizarre one.

232
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Yo, those first two were so normal. Why aren't there more crucifixions? Now, I'm not saying like government-wise, I'm not trying to say the government should start crucifying people.

233
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Crucifixion is one of the most visual execution methods in the world. I think you'd have hanging, you'd have guillotines, and then you have crucifixion.

234
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 "Firing Squad" is in there as well. "Firing Squad" gets an honorable mention, but I'm not saying why isn't the government crucifying people. Why aren't there more serial killers crucifying people?

235
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's such a religious icon, like if you ask someone, "How did Jesus die?" They'll know it's crucifixion. Don't do that. Don't walk along the street and ask people that.

236
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 But what I'm saying is you see that it's a form of execution that is used as a religious icon. It's everywhere. Why aren't there more serial killers crucifying people?

237
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I'm not encouraging it. I don't understand that. You should see that more often. Why don't you?

238
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I can't think of a single serial killer who crucified their victims. Now, it's very hard. Crucifixion is not something that you can just do on a whim.

239
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 You have to have a giant cross to begin with, but even if you were crucifying them to a tree or something like that, it's still a lot of work.

240
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Serial killers are quite lazy, but they don't even lay victims out and crucifixion poses that often. So why not?

241
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Considering you have that religious icon and then you have people who are steeped in religion who are mentally ill. I'm not saying all people who believe in religion are mentally ill,

242
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 but you do have that subset of serial killers who are super devout and they can't deal with their internal feelings so they lash out violently.

243
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And then you have the whole satanic shock-worshipping serial killers who want to do- How come they're not crucifying people?

244
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 The people who want to defame- God doesn't exist, man. We're going to defame it all. We're going to show how evil humanity really is.

245
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 That's my impression of those serial killers. How come they don't crucify people? Why don't we see more crucifying serial killers?

246
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Again, I'm not encouraging it. Now that I say that, you guys have to admit that is an odd detail, considering that is one of the most famous ways to kill people on the planet.

247
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And we do have people, hung, and we do have serial killers who use strangulation, who use ropes, nooses, things like that, and you do have serial killers that chop people's heads off.

248
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Like, that's their go-to thing. Why aren't they crucifying people? Very, very weird anomaly. What is causing that?

249
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Superfine Volpine's like, "Dude, can we just land this carbonic object? This is super disturbing. You're basically saying you- I'm not saying I want more crucifixion serial killings. I'm just saying I don't understand why there aren't any."

250
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 [imitating the sound of the car driving by]

251
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Superfine Volpine, you see that car driving below us? I want you to hover over that. I just want you to follow it in stealth mode. We're going to follow this car.

252
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 This car is being driven by a Reddit user named Hexabyte. I'm going to play you an audio clip and I don't know, it's probably completely harmless. I've listened to it multiple times. Nothing bad's happened to me.

253
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 You're like, Jason, you just talked about crucifying people. Again, that's not what I was saying, but nothing bad has happened to me. However, I'd like to give this warning sometimes. I don't give it all the time.

254
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 This audio might be cursed. This might be some sort of cursed audio. It could be a glitch. It could be a hoax. It could be something darker than that. It could be something that'll open up a portal in your house.

255
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So, one of the four, guys. One of the four. So I'm just giving you a slight warning. I know not everyone wants portals to open up in their house. They're like, "Dude, I live here with my family."

256
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 You can skip ahead 30 seconds or however long the clip is. I don't know how long the clip is just listening to it. So, you skip ahead. You jump right in the middle as the portal opens up behind you.

257
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Skip ahead at like a minute or just fast forward or something. But I'm going to play this audio clip for you now.

258
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 [Music]

259
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 So, that is a clip from a Reddit user named Hexabyte. They were driving home one night through Kentucky. They're listening to 8.40 AM, the radio station.

260
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 You can look in the show notes to actually watch the video. They are recording with their phone. So, we see their stereo is tuned in to 8.40 AM.

261
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 We see they're driving at night and we're hearing this horrible audio. Now, it could be a glitch. Hexabyte could be pulling a hoax. It could be someone in the back.

262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 The backseat just going, "Bleh, blah, blah." And he thinks this funny friend in the backseat is choking on some Basagio cereal. But that's the backstory to this.

263
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Now, he posted this on Reddit. He's trying to figure it out. One of the Reddit users, Annie-In, did check social media for the radio station to see if anyone else reported this incident.

264
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And nobody else did. No one else reported it on social media. So, if it was a glitch, it wasn't a station-wide glitch.

265
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So, a creepy bit of audio. I always like playing that when I can. But it leads actually to another question. It leads back to issues of time travel.

266
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And it leads back to issues of drugs. When I started investigating this, I do this a lot when I'm looking at paranormal stuff.

267
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 One of the things I like about Reddit is you can look through someone's post history and you can kind of get an idea of who they are.

268
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 At least what they're posting. There was one person who told this really compelling ghost story. And then when I looked through their post history, they told a lot of really compelling ghost stories.

269
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And then, they came to the conclusion they were fake. Like, there was just too many good stories over the course of three or four years that I was like, "This is not true."

270
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 This just--not everyone--not everyone's ghost story ends with a fire department showing up and the police pulling a body out.

271
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And she goes, "No, no, no. That's the wrong body. That's my brother and the killer jumps up behind her."

272
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Like, "That might happen to you once!" But this person had all of these really, really creepy ghost stories in a short period of time across all these different boards.

273
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And then, they're all fake. So I like to look through it. It does give you an idea to kind of suss out who might be telling the truth.

274
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 When I'm looking at Hexabyte's profile, he--at one point, Hexabyte sends a message to himself, posts it on a page, sends a message to himself, and he types in, "Sorry, making sure I'm a real person. My head isn't on straight."

275
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I see posts about MDMA. I see posts about how to buy drugs on the darknet, on the deep web. Starts a thread. A silk road for a scam. Thread's removed. Starts another thread later. Silk Road for a scam.

276
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 So apparently, Hexabyte did get scammed. Like, the person was like, "Hey guys, can you help me out? Are they a scam?" And the thread gets the lady to go, "Guess I'll take my chances!"

277
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 So here we have someone who's obviously in a state of distress. They don't know what's real. They have to post messages to themselves. They're trying to buy drugs off the dark web.

278
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 We don't know which drugs. They're just trying to figure out something. They're talking about MDMA, which is meth, basically. I know it's formulated a little bit differently, but it's in the end.

279
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 A large component of it is methamphetamines. So this person's in distress, and they're using drugs either to self-medicate or for entertainment or both.

280
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 It's funny because when I saw this story, it kind of put something in my head. Is it possible that drug use lifts the veils between the realms?

281
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 It would explain a lot. And it's funny because that's actually like old school, fundamental Christian belief. That like, drugs are the demon's gateway. You can read like old chick pamphlets that kind of have that message.

282
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And I'm not saying that necessarily, because that is just like an old school message. I think if you keep breaking down your own psyche with chemicals, or bad decisions or horrible moral choices, yes, I think that can invite darkness into your life.

283
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 I'm not talking about that so much, though. I'm talking about, imagine if, let's call it the killer Bob theory from Twin Peaks. Let's imagine that I begin doing meth. I'm doing meth all the time.

284
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And you're my best friend, and we're hanging out together, and you're just like, dude, you need to stop doing the meth, man. I like hanging out with you, but this is the fifth house we've broken into tonight.

285
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Can we just go back to your place and play GoldenEye? Yes, but first, let me steal this guy's Nintendo 64. I'll be right to the cart.

286
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I'm using meth all the time. You're my sober buddy. I start complaining about seeing the shadow people, and you're like, dude, of course, man. Of course, you're playing the game Shadow Man for the Nintendo 64.

287
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but other than that, I'm seeing the shadow people everywhere, and you know it's meth psychosis, so you go home, just leave me to tear my own face off. You're like, I'll be better tomorrow.

288
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 You go home, and when you get to your house, there's a Shadow Man standing at the end of your hallway. You didn't do the meth. You didn't get the psychosis. You might be a little stressed out because I'm doing those things and you're my best friend, but you're seeing those things.

289
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Is it possible that when we do drugs, we're actually not just inviting them into our lives, but we are becoming a conduit for them into the real world, to the point that we don't know the extent of Hexabyte's drug consumption.

290
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I think the fact that they're going on Silk Road is a bad sign. I guess on the coast we're a little spoiled. You can just walk to the store and buy an ounce of weed. You know, you don't have to use the dark web for anything, and then anything else you need, you just go into the nearest city.

291
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 They have everything you want. So, and sometimes you don't have to go into the city. You just turn around and be like, hey, do you have meth? Hey, yeah, here I go.

292
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 The fact that you're buying it on the dark web, I think, makes it darker. Definitely makes it a little more solitary, unless you're a dealer. You don't have anyone to do these drugs with. You're taking MDMA and just sitting at your own house. That's just weird.

293
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Right? It's a party drug. But again, I don't know what Hexabyte's doing. Hexabyte may be the biggest drug dealer in Kentucky. I don't know.

294
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 The point is, is that there's a difference between having a couple brews with your buddies before the big game and drinking bottles of Jack alone at home.

295
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Chemically, there's no difference at all, but socially. And that's how I'm kind of viewing this as far as like just ordering this stuff on dark web, getting ripped off, things like that.

296
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So, we don't know how much drugs this guy's doing, but he definitely seems to be in a bit of distress.

297
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And what if you could do so many drugs that you are hearing voices, which is definitely possible, but you do even more drugs so other people can start to hear the voices?

298
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Could you turn yourself into a portal for the darkness, and that darkness just begins to eke out of you and inhabit the places that you go?

299
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 It's a theory, and it's not just based on this one story. This story just kind of made me compile a bunch of stuff in my head that I had heard over the years.

300
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I think a lot, there is a huge crossover between people who do drugs and people who have paranormal events. It's not 100%. It's not 100% at all.

301
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 But I would say it's like 60%, 70%. And I think it's interesting too. I think for a lot of us who have used drugs and have had paranormal experiences,

302
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 my paranormal experiences started before I started using drugs. The first time I really heard a ghost, an auditory ghost, I was 17, 18 years old.

303
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 I didn't begin using drugs till I was 21, but I believe, it was one of my theories, I'm making fun of Basagio, his Mars thing, and his time travel stuff.

304
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 I've said this before on the show, when you smoke weed, it's across the time continuum. You're smoking weed with all the future use.

305
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 So when I was 18 years old, even though I had never smoked weed yet, and on a linear timeline, I hadn't smoked weed yet.

306
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 But in the fate of the universe, I had already smoked for years and years and years, so that ghost who appeared to me when I was 18,

307
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 knew I was going to smoke only three years from now. So it came to give me some sweet ganja, some sweet ghost ganja.

308
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I'd be interesting to see how many people who have paranormal events as youngsters do become drug users.

309
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 But again, it's not 100%, there are people who have paranormal events who have never touched a drug, never touched a drug,

310
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 but I would argue they are in the minority, and I would also theorize that a lot of them were around drumroll please people who did use drugs.

311
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I think it would be very, very interesting to note people who have used drugs and have had paranormal experience, and it doesn't have to be at that exact same time.

312
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 A lot of times it gets dismissed. Dude, I was dropping acid and then I saw the craziest ghost story ever.

313
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It was called a Christmas Carol. I watched it at the local community theater.

314
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Those get dismissed because they're on drugs. You can't take that. But people who do drugs and they go, "Yeah, I normally do smoke weed,

315
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 but this night I was totally sober." I'm sure if you took that group of people and then people who have not used drugs,

316
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 but have been around people using drugs, either in their home life or people close friends to theirs,

317
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 and then people who have never used drugs and none of their friends have ever used drugs and have had paranormal experiences,

318
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 I would say they would be in the strict minority. I do think there's a connection between those two things.

319
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 What? How it works? I don't know.

320
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Hi, this is Jason from The Future. I'm editing this and it's kind of breaking up the flow, but I had to make a correction.

321
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I'm about to say I didn't have caffeine until I was 18. I really meant to say I didn't really drink coffee until I was 18.

322
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 While I was editing this, I realized I've been caffeinated since I've been about six or seven when I started drinking Coca-Cola.

323
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 So that makes what I'm about to say even more ridiculous. I haven't had, this is the first time I've gone three days outside of some sort of medical emergency,

324
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 but even in hospitals they'll give you a diet soda.

325
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 So it's, man, it's crazy to think I've been on caffeine for 40 years and now I've gone a few days without it.

326
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And just keep listening to this episode and you'll see what's going on now that I've stopped using caffeine.

327
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I thought it was an interesting thing too. We'll finish it up like this.

328
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 How even the smallest drug can affect you? I've been using caffeine since I was about 18.

329
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I wasn't into it as a teenager and I've been using it since I was 18. Nicotine's been on and off over the years, very high amounts of nicotine,

330
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 then a year or two, no nicotine and then back up high nicotine and things like that.

331
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 But I've never been drug-free until about, I don't know, three days ago where I've had none, none of it.

332
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 No nicotine, no caffeine, always been on some sort of stimulant since I was 18 years old and I didn't really think of caffeine like that.

333
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 The nicotine obviously I knew was a drug, marijuana I actually knew was a drug. Caffeine you know is a drug but you don't really care.

334
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 You don't think of it like that. I don't drink, I don't drink alcohol.

335
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 So in about three days since I've had any caffeine, the oddest thing, I went for a really long walk a couple days ago and I felt like I was forgetting something.

336
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 I felt like I was forgetting an article of clothing. It was weird. It wasn't like I was forgetting my keys or forgot to lock the door or something like that.

337
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I felt like I wasn't wearing something that I needed to wear, actually kind of looked down to make sure I had pants on.

338
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 And then yesterday I went for a really long walk, like a six mile hike. It was great.

339
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 I haven't gone on a walk like that since the pandemic started.

340
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 And I walk out of my house and I go, I'm forgetting something. I'm 100% forgetting something. I knew I was forgetting something.

341
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 I couldn't figure it out. And I got about a block or two away and I realized what I was forgetting was my backpack.

342
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Because I do often wear a backpack when I'm going to the grocery store, but if I'm not going to the grocery store, don't wear a backpack.

343
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And I'm walking out, I'm like, I feel, I can't feel the straps on me. And I go, why don't I have this backpack on? I'm missing my backpack.

344
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 This is so bizarre. I knew it took me like a couple seconds to process this.

345
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Because I go walking without my backpack as probably more often than I go walking with my backpack.

346
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 I've never had this sensation before though. I go, where's my backpack? I'm feeling around for it.

347
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 I realize I felt like a literal monkey. I felt like a literal monkey was off my back.

348
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 There's that old, old term that goes with addiction. They call it, it's the monkey on your back. It's something weighing you down.

349
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 My, for the first time since I was 18 years old, no stimulants. Nothing.

350
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 All that time I was using weed or not using weed, all that time I was using nicotine or not using nicotine, constant caffeine use.

351
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Constant stimulant in my bloodstream since I was 18 years old. I feel great. I feel great.

352
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 It's so bizarre. I felt like there was something holding on to me and when it let go, I could feel it missing.

353
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 It was that real of a sensation that it took me a day or two to figure out what it was, like to even figure out what was missing.

354
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And once I realized it was my backpack, it was like something was just holding on to my body and now it's gone.

355
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 And my body has to adjust to this new state of being.

356
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 We always talk about legalizing drugs and these drugs are safe and these drugs are bad or no drugs are bad is just the way society looks at drugs.

357
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 The truth of the matter is we don't know. This drug causes cancer. This drug can cure cancer. This drug can do this. This drug can do that.

358
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 We can run all these studies, but we are turning a blind eye to the paranormal world.

359
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 And I get it, it's not science or into, but you can run a ton of studies saying that this is great for your physical well-being.

360
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You can read, run a ton of studies saying you can have this much, but not that much. This stuff helps your mood. This stuff helps.

361
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 But we're not looking at the supernatural element of it, which might be the most important thing to study.

362
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 We can't study the world of the supernatural underneath the microscope. It can't be measured. It can't be gauged.

363
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 But that doesn't mean it should be ignored, because it is quite possible that the use of drugs, and it could be all drugs, even ones we consider to be benign,

364
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 may be affecting us far more than we think.

365
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 I'm not saying having a cup of coffee is going to open a pitch black portal in your soul that demons will pour out of, but I think some drugs might cause that.

366
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 But we don't know which ones, and what combinations, and what amounts.

367
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 All we have is a clue from a young man driving down a dark Kentucky road.

368
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 They just wanted to listen to a little bit of radio. Instead, they heard the demons that are coming out of their own soul.
