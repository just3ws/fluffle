1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 Did the red baron himself shoot down a UFO?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,960
 And then we traveled to Mexico to look at a field report prepared by the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,200
 Dr. Stephen Greer, one of the most renowned names in UFOology,

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,640
 traveled to Mexico to investigate some lights in the sky.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,080
 But instead, him and his team had a conversation with Alien Life today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,760
 *Music*

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover,

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,400
 so we gotta start rolling into this. First off, the Minecraft server is back up. It's actually a

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,520
 different IP connection address, whatever they are, but it'll be in the show notes. The number one

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
 question people ask is, "When am I playing?" When am I playing? I do have a pretty regular schedule.

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,240
 Generally, I play for about an hour or two after I upload the episode. So, generally, I'm playing the

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,280
 game from like 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, maybe sometimes 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,280
 So that's when I'm on, but feel free to go about do your own thing, build little mansions or cities or...

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,560
 I don't know, fight goblins? They're not goblins, but do whatever you want. Do whatever you want in

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
 the game, and we're gonna keep it going for a while. I think it'll be fun for people to kind of hang

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,520
 out in, so the Minecraft server is back. And as long as everything goes smoothly, we're gonna keep it

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,160
 open to everyone, and so far everything's been going quite swimmingly. So join us in the Minecraft

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,800
 server, even if I'm not there. There's a ton of other cool people on there. And now we also gotta

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,320
 say thanks to our newest Patreon, Catherine Bellingham. Catherine Bellingham. I'm going to assume

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,040
 that is a proper British name. I don't know if she's British, but that sounds like a British

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,440
 name, right? Catherine of Bellingham. So, Madame, thank you for supporting the show. Really,

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,840
 really appreciate it a lot. If you can't support the show, you can, even if you don't have a British

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
 name, you can support it if your name was like Tiktok McGee. But if you can't support the show,

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
 regardless of what your name is, you can always help out the show by getting the word out.

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,360
 Getting the word out. So if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine. Just help get the word

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,360
 out. That really, really helps a lot. Catherine of Bellingham. Here are your keys to the carbon

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
 acopter. Let's fire that baby up, and not only are we taking it up into the air, we're going back

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,960
 in time. We're gonna have fun. To be fair, this isn't the most fun time period of human history,

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,360
 but I'm a particular fan of the subject matter of this first story. So turn that dial back to

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,600
 March 13th, 1917. Go ahead, turn on that carbon acopter. Take us off. We're now back in time.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:58,400
 It's just before dawn, which war-torn Germany landscape. And the red Baron himself,

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,480
 Baron Manfred von Richthofen, is getting ready to take flight. Now, I'm a big red Baron fan.

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,680
 I actually, I'm thinking about starting writing again. I'm actually, I don't really have a lot

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,600
 of time. I don't know when I'd have time for it, but I kind of miss writing. When I was in my 20s,

36
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,640
 I wanted to write a screenplay about the life of the red Baron. He's quite an interesting figure.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,680
 And I started doing all this research, and I had an outline for it. It was just pretty historical.

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,600
 But I remember I was telling my little brother about my script, and I was like, "Yeah, yeah,

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,920
 I mean, I didn't really write much of it, but I think I wrote a couple pages of it. But I

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
 had done all this research and outline and stuff like that." And we were talking about it, and I

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,280
 said, "He has a really fascinating character. He was the first at this new device had been invented.

42
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,040
 An airplane had just been invented, and he was the best at it." Like, he, he created air warfare,

43
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,600
 and just the whole idea of air warfare. First off, you had them use the scouting missions.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,040
 Then you'd have a dude sitting in the back with a pistol, and then the other people started flying

45
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,600
 their planes. So now they're carrying rifles, and they're shooting at each other. One guy's flying

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,760
 at the other guy's trying to hit a plane with the rifle. The planes are made of paper and wood,

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,120
 and then they built machine guns on the front. You had to time it so the bullets were shooting

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,760
 as the propeller, like it was timed so the propeller would move and the bullets would fly

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,520
 in between the blades. And you're flying like 40 miles an hour, thousands of feet in the air,

50
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,000
 and you're shooting. The whole thing was nuts. It was that this insane escalation of technology

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,680
 within a matter of like a few years. They had to do all this stuff. How much armor do you put on a

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,480
 plane? And in the midst of all of this technological changes, some rich dude was like, "Oh, I can do

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,600
 that." He was flying planes around because it was a toy of the rich. And he's like, "Oh, yeah, I can

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,720
 total." He had like 80 kills in a, in a weapon of war that had never been used before. Fascinating

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,760
 character. The problem was, was that he fought for Germany. So the only thing, the, the story

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,840
 itself is super interesting. And in an isolated bubble, I think he would be considered this big

57
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,120
 war hero. I think regardless of what side you were on, because he was a villain to the allies,

58
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,000
 but they, there's still this grudging respect for him. And in Germany, in Austria and all that stuff,

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,840
 he was the hero. But any story you tell with the red baron ends with him dying heroically in battle,

60
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,760
 and then like a couple years later, Hitler takes power. So it would be a hard sell. It basically

61
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,560
 like at the end, he's like, "I may die, but hopefully, hopefully Germany is eventually victorious.

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,440
 Even though I have been shot down, hopefully someday the German people will rise up and take

63
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,360
 revenge from my dad." Like it's really, it's really hard to make that movie, right? So I, and it's

64
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,160
 also really hard for a guy in his 20s living in an apartment in North Island Sacramento,

65
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
 which if you know North Islands is not a place you want to live, to write a screenplay and get a

66
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
 green lip by Hollywood. But it's, there's stuff like that's happened. I think that is more likely

67
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,440
 than me getting my, but it was dope dude. He was like fighting blimps and stuff. And I had like the

68
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,840
 tagline, it was like before stealth he was a ghost. Like, I mean like you couldn't stop this dude.

69
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,520
 And so I love the red baron. I absolutely love the red baron. I love that story.

70
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,680
 There was a movie made on it, but it was kind of like a romance movie. And I'm like, "Ah man, I want to

71
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,640
 see like planes flying and British people being like, "Oh bloody hell, where is he?" And then blowing

72
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,920
 up and then, but again, like it's all British people blowing up. The problem is, is the side he

73
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,120
 was on. So I love the story of the red baron. I definitely recommend looking into it, but

74
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,920
 that long intro goes into this because I have a real passion for that story of the red baron.

75
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,560
 It's been a good chunk of a year looking into it. And I never heard the story before.

76
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:03,600
 March 13th, 1917, the red baron and his wingman, Peter Weitzrich, are getting ready to go on a

77
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,440
 pre-dawn scouting mission around war-torn Germany-controlled areas. So now they're flying

78
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:18,720
 around. I'm just going to make that sound for the rest of the episode. And they see in the horizon

79
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:29,120
 a disc-shaped craft. And it's coming towards them. And they see like lights ringing the rim of the

80
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,240
 ship. Now, obviously we're talking 1917, war of the world to come out, but they're not thinking

81
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,480
 anything like that. Flying saucers, that terminology didn't come out until the 40s. It was just this

82
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,120
 weird thing. The aircraft that the red baron and Peter were flying were about 50 feet wide.

83
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,040
 This thing's 150 feet wide. And they're flying the most advanced human technology on the planet,

84
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:58,880
 and you're seeing this. Now, red baron being the dope dude that he is just opens fire.

85
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:10,480
 Bullets riddling the UFO ship. The aliens probably said we don't know what they said,

86
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,600
 but the bullets just shred right through extraterrestrial technology. High-quality German-made

87
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,560
 bullets. The ship begins varying from side to side. And then crashes, clips two trees,

88
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,880
 cuts them right in half. It's coming down with that much force.

89
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,880
 Crashes. Now, remember, these planes are going quite slow. These planes weren't built for speed,

90
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,720
 or they were, but it was just the fastest they could go. They watch this UFO crash,

91
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,160
 and they're kind of flying around the area. And Peter says, he sees out of the wreckage,

92
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:49,440
 what he calls, quote, "two little ball-headed guys," unquote, crawl out of the wreckage and run away.

93
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,120
 They go back to base, and they're like, "Sir, you literally won't believe what just happened.

94
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,200
 We don't even know what a flying saucer is. We have no terminology for that."

95
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,440
 But this is what happened. Red Baron here, this dope dude, shot this thing down, and it crashed,

96
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,040
 and then two little bull dudes ran out. And the brass, the top brass. Would it be brass in Germany?

97
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,280
 The top iron of the military said, "You can't ever tell anyone this story." And the Red Baron,

98
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,240
 being the noble soldier that he-- I'm gonna get a bunch of people who are like, "My great-grandfather

99
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,040
 was killed by the Red Baron. You jerk." But anyways, the Red Baron just slightly nods. He's seen a lot

100
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,360
 of horrors of war. This was nothing to him. He's just a dope dude, so he just kind of nods, walks away.

101
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,000
 And Peter goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, like he said, like he said, ooh, whatever the Red Baron wants,

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,160
 I won't say anything either." And he also leaves. He's a big kiss-ass. So, but obviously someone

103
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,400
 says something. We have this story. Turns out that in 1999, Peter gave an interview to a newspaper

104
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,320
 and said, "This is what happened. Me and the Red Baron flying around and we shot down the UFO.

105
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,000
 We actually-- the Red Baron did, but yeah, we did, we did it. I put the bullets in the gun.

106
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,160
 That means I helped." So this story has been reported in a couple books, "Military Encounters

107
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,120
 with Extraterrestrials, the real war of the worlds." That's a real book. I checked that out,

108
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,720
 not from the library. I mean, it actually exists. "UFOs of the First World War." It's another book

109
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:31,600
 that this was publicized in. But this story comes from one source, the Weekly World News.

110
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:40,240
 Okay? So, if you don't know what the Weekly World News is, do you know what the Sun is,

111
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,760
 or the Daily Mail, or the Daily Star? Imagine something more fake than all of those.

112
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,000
 Imagine-- imagine if someone came to you and said, "I saw a documentary the other day.

113
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,560
 Did you know that vampires sparkle when they walk on the Sun?" First off, did you know vampires

114
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,720
 exist? Secondly, do you know they sparkle in the sun? Weekly World News is 100% a fictional newspaper.

115
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:12,960
 Okay? And I'm reading this UFO insight. I'm-- I'm upset, dude. I'm reading-- I wake up this morning.

116
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,360
 I'm reading this UFO insight, and I've done a lot of stories from UFO insight.

117
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,480
 I'm reading this article, and I was like, dope! My boy! The red baron shot down a UFO. And what's

118
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,160
 funny is the first thing that pops in your head is, but wait, how did he shoot it down? Like,

119
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,440
 sure, bullets are bullets, but-- and the-- I'm not gonna say who wrote the article, but in the

120
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,720
 article, it's like, yep, UFOologists do wonder how the red baron was able to shoot down a UFO,

121
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,560
 but it kind of moves on to the next point. I'm like, fine, whatever. Then he gets down to the

122
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,880
 point about halfway through the article where the author points out that the source for this story

123
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,960
 is the Weekly FN World News. That's where Batboy comes from. That's where-- that's where-- you

124
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,360
 know, like, the stories about tabloids, like, "Bigfoot is my secret lover," "The president is

125
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,600
 really a moleman." That is from Weekly World News. Weekly World News, they don't publish it anymore,

126
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,880
 but it's hilarious. I did an episode about a skeleton on the moon, which is also-- it's on

127
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,480
 the conspiracy theory, Iceberg, is also from the Weekly World News. It is 100% made up and in this

128
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,320
 article halfway through says, "Yeah, I was in the Weekly World News. Here's a quote from this

129
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,240
 article." This really pisses me off. This is a quote from this article here. "There were several

130
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
 points that would hurt Waite's ricks chances of being taken seriously." And this is talking about,

131
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,360
 like, whether or not the bullets could go through the ship and things like that. Just little points

132
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
 in the story that people go, "Oh, that doesn't make sense." So back to this. "There were several

133
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,800
 points that would hurt Waite's ricks chances of being taken seriously. Perhaps not least, that the

134
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,960
 account initially appeared in a tabloid that had a history of pushing, quote, unquote, "tall tales."

135
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,880
 The Weekly World News. At this point, my blood pressure was going sky high when I read that, but

136
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,080
 perhaps not least of the account initially appeared in a tabloid that had a history of pushing

137
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,280
 tall tales, the Weekly World News. This was as Waite's rick would later explain,

138
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,520
 because no other mainstream newspapers would run the account. That's a lie. That is 100% a lie,

139
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:21,440
 because there's no such person as Peter Waite's rick. He doesn't exist. He never existed. We,

140
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,360
 the German aces, very, very well documented people. They were war heroes. There's none of them. There's

141
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,760
 not even a German pilot by the name. Well, maybe he was gone long from Hungary. He doesn't exist.

142
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,600
 There's a photo of him, and it's really another pilot, but his face is certain. I was furious at

143
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,880
 this point. Now, that's a lie. That's a lie. I'm not saying necessarily that the author goes, "Well,

144
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,360
 yeah, but this poor 80-year-old man was like, "The world needs to know that my buddy shot down a UFO."

145
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,360
 So he goes to the Tribune. He goes to New York Times. He goes to all these newspapers, and eventually

146
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,920
 no one will publish a story, so then he goes to the Weekly World News. And when he walks in,

147
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,400
 Bat Boy's sitting in the waiting room, and he's like, "I have a story. No one else will publish it."

148
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,600
 That's 100% not true. Now, I don't know if the author of this article added that detail in.

149
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
 I don't know if it came from one of those books, "Military Encounters with Extraterrestrials"

150
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,480
 or "UFOs in the First World War." Those books also apparently both sourced the story,

151
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,760
 because this article sources those books as well. One of those books may have said, "Well,

152
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,600
 yeah, but Peter, the intrepid young, not young, he's like in his 80s, but the man who wanted to

153
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,960
 get a story out walked into the Weekly World." It didn't happen. Whoever reported it first,

154
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,160
 it's 100% a lie. This pisses me off. And it's not just because I have an emotional connection to the

155
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,240
 story of the Red Baron, because I really, really think it's cool. This is the problem with this

156
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
 whole industry. I'm not going to go on a big lengthy rant, but this is the whole problem.

157
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,400
 You know what's funny? A long time... So when you quit Patreon, and let me say this to you guys,

158
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,040
 if you guys quit Patreon, I don't care. I might have said this before, but I don't care. You donate

159
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,080
 a couple bucks, you're doing it for a month or two, and then you have financial trouble, or...

160
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,120
 I don't care, dude. It doesn't bug me. If I think you're gaming the system, if I think you're donating

161
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,280
 a dollar every two months to hear your name over and over again, obviously I care about that. I

162
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,320
 think that's rude. But one person said, "I'm too skeptical. They stopped donating." And again,

163
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
 you totally have a right to stop donating and show this whole thing. But they said,

164
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,360
 "I'm too skeptical of stuff that I don't already believe in." This is why I'm very skeptical.

165
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,000
 This is why. The Charles Dawson story that we covered, the Civil War, the world,

166
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,520
 I thought that was funny, that he kind of hoodwinked people. They didn't mean to do it. It was published

167
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:48,480
 on April 1st 10 years ago. It was a joke. This is an article that was published a couple weeks ago,

168
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,760
 and it's been repeated in books. This is why I'm skeptical, and this is why you should be skeptical.

169
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,680
 So I double-checked stuff. When I did double-check this article, I found a forum about someone

170
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,800
 mentioned it on a World War I forum, and they said that he didn't fly the airplane during that time

171
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,480
 period, that pilot didn't exist. But it pisses me off because most people don't do it. Most people

172
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,360
 don't have the time to double-check this stuff. Pisses me off. And you know what? That gives me

173
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,880
 the perfect lead-in for my next story. Catherine, fire up that carbon helicopter because I'm heated.

174
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,560
 I'm heated. Catherine's like skewn to one side of the helicopter. No, no, no. I'm not heated at you.

175
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:38,720
 I'm just heated at this whole... Catherine, go ahead, take control of the carbon helicopter.

176
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,440
 We are headed out to Mexico. We're specifically going to the Las Mitras Mountains. Las Mitras

177
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,040
 Mountains. This is back in the year 1994. It's a period of time between December 11th and December

178
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,080
 14th. Now, Dr. Stephen Greer, I think even if you follow UFOology, if you follow paranormal,

179
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,160
 you know that name. You may not know the exact context, but he is pretty much the leading UFO

180
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,920
 researcher. He's the head of the disclosure project, which is a way to get, like, civilian

181
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,200
 specialists and members of the government, members of the military to come forward and talk about

182
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,480
 how aliens are real. He's also the head of the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

183
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,240
 And... oh my god. This story is this story.

184
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,200
 We can't take this...

185
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:41,600
 When the leading people of the group are nuts, allegedly nuts, you can't take anything seriously.

186
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
 And I feel bad for the military officials and for the scientists that are getting wrapped up in this

187
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,600
 stuff. And they go, "Yeah, you're right. I do think that there might be some technology that's not being

188
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,920
 exhibited to humans, or I believe that maybe some sort of extraterrestrial..." And then C-Seti is like,

189
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,120
 "Yes, and did you know?" And you're getting these rational people who are roped into this

190
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,600
 utter nonsense. C-Seti are the ones who believe in this thing called coherent thought sequencing.

191
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,680
 So you sit out in the middle of nowhere and you focus on, like, aliens, like telepathically

192
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,400
 talking aliens, which I would be shocked if these people don't just focus on aliens all the time.

193
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,200
 "Hey, what are you having for lunch? Aliens? What's on television? Aliens? That one's true,

194
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,760
 because there's actually aliens on television." But you sit in the middle of... It's more detailed

195
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,840
 than this. Let me say this. It's more detailed than what I'm about to say. It doesn't make any

196
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,760
 more sense. It doesn't make any more sense. You sit in the middle of nowhere and you go, "Aliens,

197
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,200
 aliens, aliens." You have a little pinnit that says "aliens" on it. And then you see lights in the sky.

198
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:56,640
 And you're... Okay. Okay, here's the thing. The people who actually... Military officials aren't

199
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,760
 going to do that. And here's the thing. If that works, if that does work, then that's not an

200
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,960
 alien ship. That's some other phenomenon. One, because people think about aliens all the time,

201
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,400
 right? James Cameron, for example. But UFOs aren't buzzing his house. If you can sit in the middle

202
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,760
 of nowhere, and I'll tell you exactly what it is, actually, like, it's you... Maybe now's not a good

203
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,440
 time to do this story because I'm fired up. If you sit in the middle of nowhere and you're thinking

204
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,560
 about pot pie, and you're looking up or pulled pot, pulled pot's pot pie, you're looking up on

205
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,240
 the sky and you see a light, you probably won't even register it. You're so hungry for a brutal

206
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,920
 dictator's chicken pot pie recipe. But if you're focused on aliens and you're imagining aliens,

207
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,240
 and you do that for, say, three hours, you're eventually going to see a light in the sky.

208
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,280
 You know, it's... It's bias. And also, it could be your insanity creeping in because you're just

209
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,960
 staring up in the sky going, "Aliens, aliens." But anyway, so that's coherent thought sequencing.

210
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:05,680
 And so you have this weird philosophy that goes, "Aliens are like from somewhere within the psyche,

211
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,840
 man." And then you have military officials being like on August 2nd, 1999, a UFO. So what is it?

212
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,800
 Are they big old metallic discs that have crews in them? Or are they stuff you can summon with

213
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 your brain? But anyways, at the C-City headquarters, they have a thing called the C-City Rapid

214
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,040
 Mobilization Investigation Team. So these guys are ready to go. I imagine like some guy sitting in

215
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,680
 the home tick, tick, tick, tick on some alien forum, watching alien porn at the same time

216
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,200
 in another window, gets a phone call, "Bring, bring!" picks up the phone. C-City Rapid Mobilization

217
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,120
 Investigation Team is calling. Is Joseph there? And then, "Joseph! Your buddy's from the UFO thing,

218
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,720
 are on the phone again! Mom!" and he runs up the stairs, picks up the phone. This is Joseph. He

219
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,920
 changes, makes his voice super deep. Once his mom leaves the room, this is Joseph. Joseph, cancel

220
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:08,400
 your plans. We have a rapid mobilization thing to do. And Joseph's like, "I'm with C-City. I have

221
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,240
 no plans." Click. And so they all hop in the van and they drive out. This team involves the executive

222
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,560
 director of C-City, which is named Sherry. We have Dr. Steven Greer. There's an unnamed woman from

223
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,800
 New York. So take a pic. What are they? Like five million people there? Any one of them? A named

224
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,760
 woman from New York, a cameraman. And then there's some people from this group called the Avni Club,

225
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,560
 which is a Mexican UFOology group, UFO hunters. So they're going out to the Las Mitras Mountains,

226
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,200
 December 11th to December 14th. And they go out to the Las Mitras Mountains. And for the first two

227
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,200
 nights, they just see some lights in the sky. And Steven Greer turning around. See, I told you,

228
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,240
 we came out here looking for lights in a sky. And guess what? There's lights in the sky. They're

229
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,840
 called stars. But no, no, no, I'm not talking about those. I'm talking about that one that moved

230
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,680
 in a straight angle and then disappeared. Did you stop thinking about the aliens?

231
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,840
 That's why it disappeared. And when it's thundering, that is God-bullying. Everyone's like, oh,

232
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,280
 Dr. Steven Greer, you totally know what you're talking about. So anyways, for the first two nights,

233
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,720
 it's just lights in the sky, right? So then Dr. Steven Greer, Sherry, they're walking, this is

234
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,520
 December 13th. It's 1am. They're walking down a dirt road. Remember, this guy talks to like

235
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,280
 generals and stuff like that. Okay. This is like a high-ranking member of the UFO community.

236
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,720
 People who actually fly fighter jets and see UFOs like 30,000 feet up talk to this dude. So Dr.

237
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,360
 Steven Greer, I'm sure he's a nice guy. I'm sure he's a nice guy. Dr. Steven Greer, Sherry, all these

238
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,920
 other people. The woman from New York are walking down this dirt road and Sherry starts to feel energy.

239
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:01,840
 She's feeling energy. Now she begins to "perceive" small square-shouldered creatures in the bush.

240
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,960
 She doesn't see them. She can't see them. She just perceives them. And then she gives us a full

241
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,440
 description of them, which if you perceive something and you can't see it, but then you can

242
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,960
 totally describe it, it's called imagination. Okay. But anyway, so these small square-shouldered

243
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,200
 creatures, they come up to her knees. She says they have uniforms on that are either a dull orange

244
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,480
 or a rust color. Again, she can't see them. She can't see them at all. But she knows what color

245
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,720
 their clothes are. And she's standing there. It's 1 a.m. She's with all these people. Dr. Steven

246
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,480
 Greer is there. And Sherry's like, no, Sherry goes, "Stop. Stop what you're doing. Stop what you're

247
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,960
 doing." There are aliens, little aliens perfectly, aliens that can perfectly hide in this bush that

248
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,880
 I'm standing in front of. I can perceive them. I see these aliens in my head. No, before people

249
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,920
 run over to the bush. No, no, no, just in my head, but they're over there. And you can't videotape

250
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,200
 them. You can't videotape them because they're scared of cameras. Now, I imagine at this point

251
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,720
 that Sherry's like Steven, or she probably calls him Dr. Greer. Dr. Greer, I have made contact

252
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,560
 with bush tall aliens. The talls of bush conveniently in this bush blocking their view.

253
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,880
 And Dr. Greer goes, "Damn, I wish I would have made that up. I mean, I wish I would have discovered

254
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,920
 that as well. I wish I would have been closer to the bush and had the power that Levar Burton

255
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,280
 always talked about, the power of imagination. But alas, I don't. I do not have that power." So,

256
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,080
 Sherry is talking about these guys. Now, she has this great quote. She has this great quote, "These

257
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,360
 rich, rare exchanges with what appear to be extraterrestrial lifeforms are very delicate

258
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:56,240
 scenarios. Any sudden rash or extreme emotion or movement can thwart the entire event and bring

259
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:04,560
 it to a screeching halt and the extraterrestrials vanish." These guys fly UFOs through radioactive

260
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,920
 storms. They traverse asteroid belts that go on for light years. Alien crafts have flying past

261
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:19,280
 dying suns, but don't get mad at them. Don't get mad, right? That might scare them as they travel

262
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:27,120
 through the interdimensional barriers between sanity and insanity. But don't frown. Don't frown.

263
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,200
 They'll run away then. They'll get back in their ship and fly back through a black hole,

264
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,760
 a light destroying black hole. But don't get mad. So, again, this is absolute nonsense.

265
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:43,040
 Top-level groups. C-SETI is one of the most respected groups in UFOology, and I think part of it is

266
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,400
 people don't look into the weeds. They just see this field of all of this research. But this is

267
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,120
 the type of research that's coming out of this group. So, the aliens are telling Sherry telepathically,

268
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,360
 "We're having a hard time adjusting our energies to you. Like, we want to have a more of a

269
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,400
 communication with you, but there's something..." Let me read this next part to you, because I just

270
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,280
 can't. There's no other way. I can paraphrase this. This is going to be a long episode. It's going to be a

271
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,400
 long episode. "I can mentally hear concerned conversations going on amongst the small beings.

272
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,360
 They eventually conveyed to me the message. Again, mentally, she's very, very clear. Now,

273
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,360
 this stuff can be proven in any way, shame or form. They eventually conveyed to me the message,

274
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,720
 again mentally, that they were having difficulty adjusting our energies in preparation for a

275
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,280
 meeting, because my physical energy was concentrated on my stomach, trying to digest some food.

276
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:47,440
 Just before all this began, I had eaten half of a power bar, a dense protein energy food."

277
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,040
 So, first off, that's horrible product placement for power bars, right? Because you would think,

278
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,400
 if you're going to be walking around an area for three days pretending there's UFOs in the sky,

279
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,480
 you're going to want to have food that's easy to carry. But don't bring power bars, because if you

280
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,920
 eat a power bar, aliens cannot telepathically communicate with you. That actually should be an

281
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,680
 advertisement for, like, cliff bars. They should be, like, "Our bars are easily digestible." I'm,

282
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,520
 like, "Power bars that make it so aliens can't convince you they're really there." So, she's

283
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,680
 standing there, she ate half, if she had eaten a whole power bar, we could have been looking at an

284
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,400
 intergalactic incident. They may have just opened fire on her. But she has half a power bar sitting,

285
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:36,160
 and this is real, by the way. This is from a real report. It's not real in the sense, these events,

286
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,880
 these people were standing in the mountains, okay? I know that, but I mean, this isn't something,

287
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,920
 I didn't get this from the Weekly World News. This is something that C. Setti prepared. This is a

288
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:54,880
 report they prepared. Cherry ate half a power bar. The aliens can't communicate with her. So then,

289
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,720
 she's focusing on the, I also like how she describes it as a dense protein energy food.

290
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:10,160
 First off, we know what power bars are, but if we don't, I've never, ever heard of them refer to as

291
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,040
 a dense protein energy food. She's trying to make it sound scientific. I ate a piece of poop

292
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,360
 that tasted like chalk. There's power bar. That's the description of a power bar for you.

293
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,960
 Anyways, the aliens are like, "We really want to talk to you, but you have a half a power bar in

294
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,360
 your stomach." So then, she gives them these delicate life forms that have the ability to not

295
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,880
 only construct UFOs, but then to fly them through supernovas. They don't like power bars, though.

296
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,240
 Too much power. She says, "She doesn't say it again. She thinks it." So there's really no proof of this.

297
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,160
 Quote, "I give you permission to take it out of my body." And then this is the rest of this passage.

298
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,880
 Suddenly, I felt as if someone was standing some distance away with a fishing line whose hook

299
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,920
 was inside my stomach. It felt as if someone was slowly reeling in the line as the food came back

300
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:13,120
 out the way it went in. She just threw up. But now she says, she let's us know, she normally hates

301
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,480
 throwing up. As opposed to those people who love it, right? Everyone hates throwing up, unless

302
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,920
 you're at like 0.001%. Everyone. You don't have to. You don't. I didn't. When I was reading the story,

303
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,040
 I wasn't thinking, "Bup, she's probably one of those people who loves throwing up." I'm a skeptic.

304
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,800
 Nobody wants to throw up, especially in front of their buddies, especially not half of a power bar,

305
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,640
 because I think those things are just, they reform, like the T-1000 in your stomach. You take bites

306
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
 out of it, but in your stomach, it just becomes that black brick again. Anyways, this invisible

307
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,080
 fishing line pulls it out and she goes, "Bruh!" Throws up the power bar. Now, Dr. Steven Greer,

308
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:57,360
 he watches his executive director, who's currently believing that she sees, quote unquote, "sees"

309
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,840
 bush high creatures conveniently hidden in a bush. She throws up. And then she feels better,

310
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,080
 right? Now, it could have just been that she ate a power bar, which is what made her throw up. But

311
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,640
 no, no, no, no, it's the aliens. And then, again, another very convenient thing that's going to

312
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:22,480
 happen is that the aliens instruct Sherry and tell me, oh, tell me, this is 100% a little red writing

313
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,880
 tactic. Let me read you this thing, quote, "Soon the little beans sent," not beans, like little

314
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,960
 kidney beans, but like human beans or in this term, alien beans, "soon the little beans sent both Dr.

315
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,640
 Greer and I." So now they're contacting Dr. Greer. Now he noticed she kept winking at him.

316
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,760
 She's like, "There's aliens in the bush, wink, wink." And they're communicating telepathically,

317
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,960
 wink, wink, Dr. Steven Greer is like, "What are you talking about, you insane?" Oh, I can pretend to.

318
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,280
 The woman from New York's like, "Oh, he's so cool." Anyways, now Dr. Steven Greer is also getting

319
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,600
 messages from these made-up creatures. And the made-up creatures, let me go back to this,

320
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:08,240
 "Soon the little beans sent both Dr. Greer and I the message that if we removed our glasses,

321
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:16,000
 we would be able to see them better." What? That is something like that's not, you know,

322
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,600
 the demons in your corner and be like, "If you really want to talk to me, you have to use the

323
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,360
 wigs you bought at 3 a.m." Oh, okay, thanks. If I'm in the middle of nowhere and I hear a voice

324
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,760
 in my head saying, "Take your glasses off and you can see me better," I'm not, I'm putting on another

325
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,440
 pair of glasses, right? Because now I'm getting rushed from the woods. But these guys are like,

326
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,760
 "Yes, alien overlords, we will defeat humanity for you and bow at your feet." What else do you

327
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,160
 request? The aliens also asked them to take their hats off. So I'm starting to, I'm not making that

328
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,840
 up. I'm not making that up. The aliens go, "Mmm, yes, your glasses are up. Now how about take your

329
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,800
 hats off?" Now at this point, like some blue mist shows up and Dr. Steven Greer and Sherry

330
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:06,240
 perceive, they become aware of something in it. And she goes, "Although again we could only see

331
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,360
 him dimly, he appeared to be very humanoid." They're not wearing glasses, by the way. It's 1 a.m.

332
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,080
 They don't have their hats on. I'm sure Dust is getting in their eyes. They see a mist and they go,

333
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,160
 "Yeah, he's a tall humanoid with long, straight and silverish hair. He seemed to be wearing a light

334
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:28,480
 blue and silver uniform." But so this, now this blurry image, this blurry image in front of two

335
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,280
 people who don't have their glasses on, is floating there. Now he goes, the alien goes, or their

336
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:40,640
 imagination goes, "I would love to fully physically form in front of you. I would love to be caporial."

337
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,400
 We could have a discussion. But somebody in your group, I can sense somebody in you. That's

338
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,080
 almost inception. Your imagination has an imagination. But anyways, I can sense someone in your group

339
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,160
 would be dangerously frightened if I just appeared. Not frightened that they're stuck with two lunatics

340
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,440
 in the middle of the Mexican desert who say that there's tiny creatures telling them to take off

341
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,320
 their glasses in their hat. That doesn't scare them. Or that the blue, and that they do it,

342
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,680
 that they totally do what these things in the bushes are doing. Not that blue mist is showing

343
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,080
 them, but if he pops out of the mist and goes, "Tada!" Someone's going to have a heart attack. So the

344
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,200
 alien's like, "I'm not going to do that." And then Stephen Greer and Sherry, "Urrrgh!" They think about

345
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,280
 it. They think about it. I almost imagine it's like, you know, when two people are trying to

346
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,640
 remember the lyrics of a song, but neither of them know anything about the chorus. And they're like,

347
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,840
 trying to--these two people, they're putting on a show, right? You got the Avni, you got the UFO

348
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,600
 club there, you got a woman from New York, you got a cameraman, too. Remember, there's a cameraman

349
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,960
 here. The footage is just of a bush and maybe a cloud in the mountains. But anyways, there was no

350
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,520
 footage. There was no link for the footage, which shows how useless it is. But you know how like

351
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,880
 two people are trying to remember the lyrics of a song, but they are just waiting for the chorus,

352
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,240
 "Hold Me Close Your Tiny Dancer." And they're like, "I imagine them going like--" And then the alien goes--

353
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,600
 Yeah, yeah. And the alien's like tall and tall. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's like silv--

354
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,760
 Blue, blue. No, yeah, yeah. Silver hair. You're right. Silver hair. And he's saying that we should

355
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,840
 go shopping. No, no, no, no, no. Not shopping. We should not be scared. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the

356
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:22,480
 people in the background are like, "This is amazing. Hold Me Close Your Tiny Dancer." This goes on for a

357
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,840
 bit. They eventually go, "Well, if you won't come to us, can you take us somewhere?" And the alien

358
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,280
 goes, "That would also-- That would also-- That would also equally terrify this person."

359
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,160
 This would also equally terrify this person if you guys magically disappeared. Now again, Dr.

360
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,280
 Stephen Greer has met with members of Congress. He's met with military officials. He's met with

361
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,840
 high-ranking people. And the end of the story is them going like, "Ah, shucks. Like, I almost had the

362
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,040
 chance to talk to an alien, but someone was too scared. It was the New Yorker. It was the New

363
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,880
 Yorker girl." So because what happened was the New Yorker girl was totally freaked out by this

364
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,720
 whole thing. And she said, "If I saw an alien, I was just going to take off running through the

365
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,360
 mountains." And so they're like, "There you go. Now you military official who has to risk your

366
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,000
 entire career to come forward and say that you saw this thing, you should do that on camera. But me

367
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,240
 and my group, yeah, we just took a couple pictures of a bush and then we did a game of yes and for

368
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,760
 probably about 20, 30 minutes and then we just quit. But you, sir, go on the record. You risk

369
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,240
 your entire career and national ridicule. I'm just going to hang out. I'm just going to do this,

370
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,880
 right? And tell this story." The next day-- They do a television show the next day. I don't know if

371
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,440
 they bring this up because the audience would be like, "What? Intarnation? It's all sponsored by

372
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,960
 Powerbar." They're like, "Uh-oh." But obviously the story is ridiculous, but he's a super famous dude.

373
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,600
 And again, I'm sure he's a nice guy, right? He's definitely put in the work to build up his following,

374
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,080
 but this is the reason why people are skeptical, okay? I know that you can watch the disclosure

375
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,720
 documentary or the serious documentary. He has a new documentary on like Amazon, Netflix called

376
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,080
 "Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind." So he-- I mean, I'll give him respect. He's built a name.

377
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:18,400
 He's built a brand. And I'm sure he's a nice guy. I'm sure he's a smart guy. But come on. This is--

378
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,880
 This is obviously-- There's not a documentary about this, right? Because anyone in their right

379
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,480
 mind would go, "That's super convenient that everything-- You took your glasses off before

380
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,600
 you saw an alien or they were conveniently sized. They're bush-sized, we had a bush." Well, anyways,

381
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,120
 the next day they're doing all of these television interviews and things like that.

382
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,480
 Now it's 11.30 p.m. They're driving back to their home. Now, their videographer, their cameraman,

383
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,680
 was not here. What? He wasn't here for this part. What? Whoa, no. What could possibly happen now?

384
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:02,720
 The guy with the ability to record things isn't here. That's wacky. So what happens is, while

385
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,120
 there's no proof, Dr. Stephen Greer and Sherry and all that stuff, they see like a bright lights in

386
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,160
 the sky and Dr. Greer jumped from the suburban while it was still rolling, like an action hero.

387
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,240
 And then he like did a barrel roll and he-- his hat. He picked his hat up off the ground and put

388
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,360
 it on and then two screaming eagles flew overhead. At the exact same time. He had a 500,000 candle

389
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,480
 power portable halogen light. He's lighting this stuff up and then the light is lighting up and then

390
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,160
 they're like talking. Like he'll shine the light and then the light shines up and he shines the light

391
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,440
 and the light shites up and he goes at a certain point. There's like-- we see like this beam come

392
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:51,120
 out of the sky and we see shadows walking in front of the beam and-- but no cameraman! What? Oh no!

393
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:59,040
 Oh shucks! You guys want evidence? What? No, just ruin your military career. But I don't have a

394
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,560
 cameraman! I don't have a cameraman when I'm in Mexico to do an investigation! But no! And then

395
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,000
 they travel back to where they're staying and they get up on the roof and they watch lights and this

396
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,640
 kind of stuff. I'm not doubting that it was probably fun. I'm sure it was beautiful out there.

397
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,160
 You're out in the middle of nowhere. You get to see the Milky Way and all of its splendor and all

398
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,760
 that stuff and you-- listen, I believe in UFOs. That's one of the things that I don't deny. I don't

399
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,440
 know if they come from other planets and I think a lot of those big UFO stories have a lot of holes

400
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,320
 on them like raw stuff like Roswell or Rendlesham have some definitely big iffy things. But I don't

401
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,680
 use those to discount UFOs across the board. Like I do believe that-- first off, I do believe there's

402
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,240
 unidentified fine objects and I do believe that there is life outside of Earth. I don't know if

403
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,440
 alien-- what we perceive as aliens are actually from other planets if they're from other dimensions.

404
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,240
 If they came here millions of years ago and they're in some sort of cave system. I don't know. I am

405
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,480
 ghosts and demons and stuff like that. I believe this conversation could be the same thing. You're

406
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,960
 up in an area that it's haunted and there's a ghost. But see, it's funny because there's a--

407
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,520
 people who believe in UFOs believe for the most part of it. See, C. C. Setti's kind of pushing the

408
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,400
 goalposts. Pushing the goalposts. There are people who hunt Squatch. They're Sasquatch hunters and

409
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,680
 they look at them as a biological creature that has a tribe and mating habits and a diet. Then

410
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,640
 there are other people who believe it's some sort of spirit. Some sort of nature thing. That would

411
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,400
 be more where I'm going. I don't buy the biological Bigfoot thing. If Bigfoot sightings are real,

412
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,440
 it's some sort of paranormal activity as far as like ghost goes or related to alien activity.

413
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,360
 High strangeness. Ghosts though have the ability that you don't see them. People can go their entire

414
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,200
 life without quote unquote "seeing a ghost" but still go "I live in haunted house. I hear stuff

415
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,960
 late at night. I've never seen anything fly around. I've never seen anything super dramatic."

416
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,440
 Aliens fall more into the biological category. They have races and fleets of ships and they have

417
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,560
 command structures and the uniforms and things like that. But groups like C. Setti

418
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,920
 realize that that bar is incredibly high to prove. Bigfoot, the thing with the biological

419
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,520
 Bigfoot thing, you find footprints and you go "Well, that's what-- you deer leave footprints,

420
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,920
 people leave footprints, found a footprint." That's evidence enough. That's evidence enough for a lot

421
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,720
 of people who are squash hunters or hare because sometimes you'll just find trappings of animals

422
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,040
 in areas. You may not see an elk in your area but you'll see elk footprints. Ghosts can just be like

423
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,560
 "I bought a teacup and ever since then I've had a runny nose. Yes, it is May and I do live in a

424
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,400
 high allergy area but I bought the teacup the end of April." So aliens demand biological proof.

425
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,240
 Wreckage of ships, alien bodies or their aftermath, crop circles, catamolations,

426
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,680
 stuff like that. C. Setti is trying to push the goalposts, being like "No, no, no, no, no, no.

427
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:55,440
 Aliens can also be in your imagination. Aliens can also be this thing you sense more than you see."

428
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,400
 And they've built their whole group around this and it's interesting because C. Setti seems to be

429
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,760
 different than the disclosure project even though they're both spearheaded by the same guy. C. Setti

430
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,320
 has that "We can sit and we can imagine the UFOs, man." And again, a four star general is going to

431
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,320
 be like "What are you talking about?" Like I just had an F-18, do they still even make those?

432
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,040
 I just had an F-22 get outrun by something and I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's for

433
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:30,400
 my RAN, Russia, but I need to know. I don't think the pilot was up there being like "Dude, I can sense

434
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,040
 an unidentified area vehicle in front of me." And then one just appeared. That's not what they want.

435
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,240
 So C. Setti's moving the goalposts. The disclosure project is getting people in the military,

436
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:49,920
 getting congressional members to push for alien disclosure. But one group is fanciful. And the

437
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,240
 other group is what people normally think of as aliens. It's a biological entity that has a fleet

438
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,120
 of ships that comes from a location. Whether or not they're from another dimension or they're from

439
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,200
 another planet, they have a location, they have a society, they have a culture, they have mechanics,

440
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,720
 they have doctors, they have soldiers, they have leaders. This imagining people in the

441
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,320
 bushest thing is not that. And you... So to really wrap this incredibly long episode up,

442
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,360
 you have to be skeptical about this stuff. You have to be skeptical about this stuff. Because

443
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,200
 this is the type of stuff you're getting, right? You may get someone who is releasing the TicTac

444
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,000
 video because disclosure project has been all over that and so has to the stars. And that's the

445
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,560
 thing. I get a lot of requests from people going "Why don't you cover to the stars?" That's Tom DeLonge's

446
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,720
 UFO group that wants to push for disclosure. The reason why I haven't covered it is because a

447
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,800
 nonsense like this. That I just really need to look into why the group is... I know a lot of people

448
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,400
 think it's a soft disclosure CIA group, but people were saying that about the disclosure project.

449
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,920
 And disclosure project is run by people who believe that bush-sized aliens hide in bushes and can't

450
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,440
 talk to you because you eat power bars. So you've got to be skeptical. I know it can take the fun

451
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,160
 out of it sometimes, but if you're not skeptical, you go "You'll be... aw, shucks! Did you hear the

452
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,360
 red baron shot down a UFO?" Because that's been repeated a couple of times. It's in two books!

453
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,000
 It's in two books that have been published and are out there and people are reading them.

454
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,800
 Now, I've made mistakes on this show before as well, the Lone Pine Devils and the Civil War

455
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,000
 Aliens. And both of those mistakes, I was like, "Oh, I made a mistake. I got other information.

456
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,360
 I was wrong." Now, I can get it if someone... I'm back to that stupid red baron star and I can get it

457
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,560
 if someone came across a red baron story, but they referenced the weekly world news!

458
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,560
 You can't excuse it saying this old... Okay, I can't talk about the stupid red baron story anymore,

459
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,680
 because I'm just kidding Madigan. The point is, is that you have to pay attention to this stuff.

460
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,320
 Now, I'm going to end it on a good note. I absolutely loved reading this Mexican mountain

461
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,040
 article because it really, one, thought it was absolutely hilarious. And two, it confirmed my

462
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,800
 bias that a lot of the people who are into this stuff just use their imagination. And like LeVar

463
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,440
 Burton said, imagination is a powerful tool. It definitely kept me entertained. I was laughing

464
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,920
 out loud as I was reading this article and I hope you had an equally fun time with me talking to

465
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,600
 you about it, because I think it's absolutely ludicrous. But the next time you hear about the

466
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:23,040
 disclosure project or C-SETI or any of this stuff, and they're trying to get these high-level

467
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,560
 government officials to come forward and to risk their career to talk about secret documents and

468
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,400
 stuff that they saw, just remember, just remember, that cold night in those mountains in Mexico

469
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,120
 when a C-SETI member threw up a power bar so she could talk to an alien.
