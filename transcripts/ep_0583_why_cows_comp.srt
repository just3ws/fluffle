1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 The man who found Forrest Finn's treasure has come forward.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Not a smart idea, dude.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 What happens when you get invited to be on a game show,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 but end up naked in a hotel room instead?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we travel to the jungles of Vietnam.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 As a group of US commanders are making their way through the jungle,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 they think they're gonna take on a North Vietnamese listening post.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Instead, they come face to face with alien invaders.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 [Music]

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I just drank a Konamoka smoothie, like super fast.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I don't know why. It must have been thirsty,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 but it's actually more of like a milkshake of coffee in it.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I also have the metabolism of a 10-year-old.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So now with all that sugar and there's just a little bit of caffeine, dude, I'm like,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 super wired. So this episode might go by super fast, or it may be a disaster.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 But either way, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Flonko.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Flonko.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 He's running in. He's doing laps around us, making us dizzy.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Flonko, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We can't support the Patreon. Totally understand.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Just helps for the word about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 So now we're running in place with Flonko.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 We're trying to burn off some of this sugar.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But Flonko, why don't you run us over to the garage where we keep all of our vehicles.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 You get some deep cannon cuts, but you didn't even know we had a garage.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 As we're jogging through the underground Dead Rabbit Radio facility,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I'm gonna tell you this story. We're not taking a vehicle for this one.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 We're just running through the facility.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 This was actually recommended to me by Beatrice, a longtime Patreon,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 and she's been integral to the Forrest Finn storyline.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 She's the one who first let me know that the treasure had been found.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And then we have dramatic failure for you on Twitter.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Also recommended this story, so give him a little salute as we're running.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 If you don't know, let me do a quick catch up for the Forrest Finn saga.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Forrest Finn was a dude who buried a treasure.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 He thought he was going to die. He had cancer.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Took this treasure up to the middle of nowhere, buried it, and then decided,

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 "Nah, I'm not ready to die." And the cancer went into remission.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 He kind of went up there with the idea that he was going to kill himself.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 He crafts this poem, writes this book called The Thrill of the Chase,

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 and it was all about finding his treasure.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Now, I did a story on Forrest Finn a long, long time ago.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It was like episode 70 or something like that.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And I did the story and then at the end I go, "I don't think it's real.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I don't think he really buried the treasure. I think it was just something."

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It's an old man trying to leave his mark on the world.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 That's okay. And then I went on to tell a story about my experiences with Shadow people in Sacramento, California.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I was immediately, immediately deluged with comments saying what a horrible person I was,

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 how dare, how dare I defile the name of Forrest Finn.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I'm like, "What in the world is going on here?"

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Turns out there's a group of people called the Fanatics.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 This is like a previously on Dead Red Radio.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 There's a group known as the Fanatics.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 They're Forrest Finn devotees.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 They believe everything this man has to say and they were like threatening to sue me for libel.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And I'm like, "I didn't write anything down."

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So obviously you don't know what libel means, but as being threatened with lawsuits, as being harassed,

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 so that was going on.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So then I did an episode about them.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So this is a crazy cult.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I didn't think this existed.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 A lot of times when we think of cults, we think of these big groups, but this guy is a cult leader and he has this cult.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So because at that point I was like, they're already throwing eggs at me.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Might as well double down because I don't care.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 So I doubled down and they still were getting all antsy and stuff like that,

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 but they kind of just leveled off after a while.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 They realized I didn't have any gold on me, so they left me alone.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 They're just super, super greedy people.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Fast forward, what, a year later, I get an email from Beatrice about "Force Finn's treasure has been found."

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And so that was the big thing.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Now I said the treasure didn't exist and I was being called libelist because I said it didn't exist.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And when they found it, I'm not so egotistic.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 I go, "I guess I was wrong."

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I guess I was wrong, which you guys have heard me say that quite a few times on this show because a lot of it's speculative.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I guess I was wrong. I guess there really was a treasure.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Immediately, the fanatics started to believe there was no treasure.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 That it was all a hoax.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 It was the weirdest, it was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 They believed that "Force Finn had made the whole thing up because he'd made it and find it."

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It truly was a bizarre cult.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And it's a weird cult because the cult ended up devouring the leader.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 They started saying it was all a hoax.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 They were so close to finding it.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 See, there's a difference between people who are hunting for Force Finn's treasure and fanatics.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 There's a difference. I have to say that.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 There's good ones in that group probably actually don't have any proof.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I'm just assuming the fanatics on Reddit, they started saying, "No, it was fake. It was fake."

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And the reason why they were saying it was fake because the person who found it never came forward.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And they wouldn't reveal where it was located.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 See, that made everyone super suspicious.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But now you're all caught up.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 You're all caught up in this. And Force Finn unfortunately passed away.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 This guy didn't want to reveal he found the treasure.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And the reason why he didn't want to reveal he found the treasure,

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 because the people looking for the treasure are lunatics.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And he knew all the times that Force Finn had been stalked and harassed and threatened some dude broken to his house.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 That's why he covered it back then because that was in the news.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But there's this woman named Barbara Anderson who's who I'd still go to the subreddits for the Force Finn stuff

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 because I find it hilarious.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Barbara Anderson is suing the estate of Force Finn.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 She believes that her email address got hacked and she had the right answer.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And this unknown person had hacked her email.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And a judge in New Mexico just recently said, "Yeah, I'll allow it. I'll allow this case to proceed."

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So the person, he knew he was going to get called into this lawsuit, decided to come forward.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 His name is Jack Stoof, 32-year-old man.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And he said, "I'm the one who found the treasure. I didn't want to reveal my identity because I imagine I'm going to get harassed and stalked

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 and people are going to break into my house and everything like that."

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 There's $2 million in this treasure chest plus 10 years of fanaticism behind it.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 People are really going to be looking for this guy.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And anyway, so Jack comes to, oh, and another thing. Here's a little conspiracy thing for you.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 He's a journalist. People are, you know, suspicious.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Actually, right now he's going to medical college.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 But he used to be a journalist. He used to work for the Onion.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 So people are automatically like, "Oh, it's fake. It's fake."

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Because the second-year journalist means everything you say is fake.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 One time a journalist told me, "Happy birthday." And he wasn't. I canceled my birthday that year because I didn't want him to be right.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So that's part of the conspiracy now that he didn't really find the treasure, that it was all fake,

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 that Forrest Finn hired this random guy who used to work for the Onion, who's now working at a medical college,

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 who's now going to medical college. Forrest Finn is like, "You will be my Anakin Skywalker."

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 The whole thing is super bizarre. Best of luck to Jack.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 People are already digging through everything he's written, trying to find stuff that looks bad and things like that to disparage him,

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 because he found what they were always looking for.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Not only did he find the treasure chest, but it was a goal. People have been working on this for over a decade.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 He started looking into it in about 2018. Spent two years looking into it.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 He said, "I read the poem and I thought about Forrest Finn's emotions.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I thought about what Forrest Finn was going through."

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 He goes, "This was interesting. This is going on a little bit longer than I thought, but I think this is pretty much the end of the Forrest Finn saga.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Hopefully, I hope nothing happens to this guy."

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 He said, "When you read the puzzle," he goes, "The one thing I realized is he was basically on the borderline of being fanatic.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 He watched every interview Forrest Finn did, read everything he wrote, but he goes, "I never interacted with the community."

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So he never became part of that mob mentality. He goes, "I'd read their posts, but I never joined them."

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 He said, "Forrest Finn wasn't trying to prove how clever he was by coming up with an ingenious puzzle."

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 He goes, "That's where I think a lot of searchers went down the wrong path."

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 They were looking for these clever answers, like golem-esque puzzles. Is that a thing? Golem-esque riddles.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That's still not a thing, but he goes, "I wasn't like that. I was trying to place myself in his mental state."

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Because remember, he was going to kill himself. He was going to take his treasure up there, and I think he had some pills with him.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 He was just going to sit on the grass and die, and then someone would just stumble across his treasure.

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 So he thought about that. It would be-- What's the most suicidal place I can think of?

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So there was a location, and he went up there. He spent about 20-something days over the course of two years, and he found it.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 He found the treasure, and he took photos of it, and he let Forrest Finn know. Met Forrest Finn, and that was it.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And people are like, "Why won't you reveal the location of where you found it?"

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And he said, "Listen, this place was very special to Forrest Finn. It's where he was going to kill himself."

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 He goes, "And over the course of two years, me spending time there camping, just sleeping on the grass."

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 He goes, "It became very special to me." He goes, "I know people are going to trample all over it."

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 See, the thing is, he knows these fanatics are fanatics. He knows the type of people he's dealing with.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 If he just happened to stumble across the treasure, he'd probably be like, "Hey, everyone, my name is Jack, and I found it down the street. Here's the address."

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Not knowing how crazy this group is.

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 That, hopefully, hopefully is the end of the Forrest Finn saga, because I have a bad feeling something's going to happen to this dude.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I really have a bad feeling this guy's going to get tied up with like, like, holding rope, uh, rope-stilled skins are going to come after him.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I think this guy's going to, this guy's going to have to spend part of his two million dollars to change his name and hide himself,

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 because these people are relentless. And the thing is, is that they're relentless, but at the same time, they're kind of dorky.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 So, I don't think they're going to, well, one did try breaking into Forrest Finn's house. I don't think they'll actually kidnap him.

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I don't think they're going to do that. I hope not.

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 But, um, again, like, when they came after me, I got a bunch of legal threats and verbal abuse and stuff like that, and I'm like, "Oh, it's Wednesday."

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 This is a typical Wednesday for Jason people hurling insults at me. It's been going on for years and years. I'm used to that.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 I didn't have two million dollars on me. I didn't have two million dollars on me.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 So, if I happened to have, if I had found, dude, that would have been so funny if I had found the treasure, but I didn't think it existed, so I never even bothered looking.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 That's the end of it. I really hope this guy the best. I hope people just, like, you go to the reddit, dude, people are still like, "It wasn't real in the first place."

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 It's so weird. The whole story is so weird, but that went on way longer than I thought, but again, I think that's a good wrap up to the story.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Flonko is, we're all exhausted from running. It was a really long hallway. It's a really long trip to get to the garage.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Flonko, I'm going to go ahead and put you in. I'm going to lift you up.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Like a little boy, I'm going to lift you up and put you in the front seat of the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Central, and we are headed out to London.

167
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Car is driving down the road, and then I realize there's a massive ocean, so hydrofoil time.

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 We finally get to lunch. It's like a six-month journey. I picked the slowest vehicle, but we caught some fish, so that's dope.

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 London, 2018. We're walking around London having a good old time, eating popcorn and stuff like that, whatever they do over there.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And there's a dude in a mall, and he's on his phone, and then this other guy, we'll call him Jimmy, walks up to the first guy.

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I forgot to give him a name. We'll call him Gary.

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,940
 walks up to Gary and Jimmy's like, "Hey, hey, you. You, you, you, you" the subject

173
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,220
 of the story. And Gary's like what? Jimmy goes, "Hey, how would you like to possibly

174
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,920
 win five thousand pounds?" And Gary's like, "Who wouldn't? Who wouldn't?" And Jimmy goes,

175
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,760
 "Listen, I'm a talent scout. We have a game show going on, we're looking for

176
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,820
 contestants for this new game show." And Gary's like, "I love game shows, I love

177
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,600
 money. Count me in." So Jimmy scribbles down a little address and says, "Meet me here,

178
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,040
 at such and such a time, and we'll get you started on the game show." And Gary's like,

179
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,440
 "Dope, dude. Jimmy walks away. Now we're all standing there and I turn to you and I say,

180
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,400
 'Hey, it's pretty dope, right? That guy's going to be on a game show.'" And you're like,

181
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,000
 "Yeah, who wouldn't want to win five thousand pounds?" And game shows are pretty dope. But

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,520
 then like dark clouds come over and my face gets all overcast and I'm uncomfortably close

183
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,760
 to you and I'm staring you in the eyes and I go, "You think game shows are a game, huh?

184
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,600
 You sicko. You big ol' pervert." And I walk away. You're like, "Jason, what was that?"

185
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,960
 I turn around and I'm like, "Don't ever talk to me again, you game show fan." Throw down

186
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,120
 an egg, throw down a full of smoke and I disappear. But then I reappear behind you and I'm like,

187
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,480
 "I'm just kidding, you're my buddy." So the point of that sugar-filled intro was in

188
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,560
 London. This is real. I don't really have eggs that make me disappear, but this part's

189
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,520
 real. There was a guy in London who was going around and meeting men and saying, "Hey, you

190
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,840
 want to be on a game show? Why am I re-describing it? It's the thing I just told you." Let

191
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,240
 me just finish this story. So Gary ends up going to this address. It's a hotel. It's

192
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,640
 a hotel room, which is an odd place to have a game show. But you know, maybe it's the

193
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,760
 auditions or something like that. Maybe it's a massive hotel room with a giant wheel in

194
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,240
 the middle of it. You don't know. You don't know until you walk into the room. That's

195
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,120
 what I always tell people. They're like, "I'm really suspicious about going to this location."

196
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,600
 I throw my armor over their shoulder and I'm like, "You won't know until you walk into

197
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,960
 the room." And they're like, "Yeah, I guess that's fine." This guy goes to this hotel

198
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,200
 room and Jimmy's there and Jimmy's like, "Okay, so we're going to start the game show."

199
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,440
 And Gary's like, "What? Game show's in the hotel room?" He's like, "Yeah, well, I mean,

200
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,600
 this is just part of the game show? It's this weird, like, avant-garde thing?" Actually,

201
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,960
 I don't know what excuse he gave him. You'd have to give me a lot of excuses. I'm not trying

202
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,200
 to victim-blame about what's coming. I just don't know exactly what was said, but it's

203
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,920
 at some point during the game show, Gary starts taking his clothes off. And that was part

204
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,280
 of the game show. It wasn't like he was just like, "Hey, Jimmy, taking my clothes off."

205
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,160
 Part of the game show was a bunch of nude challenges. So Gary's taking his clothes off, being nude

206
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,400
 and stuff like that in the hotel room. Jimmy's just sitting there, I guess, taking notes.

207
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,560
 But after Gary leaves, he starts to, like, feel suspicious about it. He ends up going

208
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,160
 to the police and saying, "Hey, I think something weird happened to me. This guy asked me to

209
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,920
 be on a game show. I went to the hotel and the cops are like, 'What?' He's like, 'Yeah,

210
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,400
 I know. It was super suspicious, but I went there anyways. You know, 5,000 pounds. I thought

211
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,840
 I could win 5,000 pounds.'" Started taking my clothes off, started doing a bunch of nude

212
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,880
 challenges. So the cops actually picked this dude up. His names aren't really Jimmy and

213
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,000
 Gary. We don't know anyone's names. This is an ongoing criminal case. And it turns out

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,040
 that not only was Jimmy doing this, he's inviting men up to a hotel room and telling them to

215
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,640
 take their clothes off to be in a game show. He was recording the whole thing, which I

216
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,640
 am sure was pretty obvious. I'm sure it wasn't a hidden camera, but I could be wrong. And

217
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,880
 he'd been doing it. They had a guy come forward from 2013. He heard about this and he goes,

218
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,040
 "Oh, that happened to me. I was hanging out in a mall and some dude asked me if I wanted

219
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,920
 to be on a game show." So the cops are like, "Oh, no." Like, they thought it was just

220
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,920
 like this one... That was their official response. They put out a press release. "Oh, no." They

221
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,520
 thought it was just this one event. They arrested the dude, charged him with voyeurism and let

222
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,320
 him go. You know, able to go about town. He's able to get hotel rooms. He's running around

223
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,040
 London right now, guys. And then someone else came forward from 2013 and go, "Oh, that happened

224
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,320
 to me." So now the police are saying, "This guy could have been doing this for seven years.

225
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,040
 They have no idea how long this guy's been doing it or how many victims." It's kind of

226
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,680
 an interesting case. The headlines... I'm going to be a little old man, Jason, on this one.

227
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,680
 The headlines made me think that the guy had built a game show set. You're like, "Jason,

228
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,200
 is that really your takeaway from this story? This pervert's running around, getting young

229
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,620
 men to undress?" You know, listen. It sucks what happened to those dudes. It sucks what

230
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:41,840
 happens to those dudes. Absolutely. But whatever happened to super criminals, right? Like,

231
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,840
 this dude doesn't even go through the trouble of building a set. You're like, "Jason, you're

232
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,600
 not about to use the Riddler as an example." No, that long pause was me not me trying to

233
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,920
 find an example other than the Riddler. Whatever happened to super criminals, man? Like, people

234
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,640
 who really put artistry... And I'm not talking about serial killers, because those dudes

235
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,600
 are lame across the board. They're always big old losers. But I'm talking about, like,

236
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,480
 bank robbers where they dress up in matching outfits. Like, these are all fictional stuff.

237
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,160
 But whatever happened to Point Break or the town? You're a bank robber dressed up as

238
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,960
 another bank. It would be super confusing. It would be super confusing to you. You're

239
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,780
 getting robbed. You're like, "No, no, I'm the wrong bank." Whatever happened to the

240
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,920
 artistry of crime? Like, was that all just a lie? Like, Moriarty and stuff like that?

241
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,840
 Like, figuring stuff out? No one's stealing, like, big old diamonds anymore? No one's

242
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,560
 a Batman basically complaining? No one's a Batman villain? No one's arcade? Being like,

243
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:57,640
 "X-Men, I've got you! Once again!" Yeah, man. That's awful, dude. I mean, I guess

244
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,360
 all crime is awful in a way. But I thought by now we would have super criminals. I'm

245
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:12,240
 not, like, trying to make fun of the victims. I don't understand why crime isn't, like,

246
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,360
 what I- I don't understand why Batman's not real. You know what I mean? Nobody's putting

247
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,880
 any effort into their criminal activities anymore. I don't know, thieves, I guess. Shop

248
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,400
 lifters are pretty ingenious nowadays, but most of the time the art is gone. The art

249
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,160
 is gone. People aren't wearing matching costumes anymore. There's not- there's not a guy named

250
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,440
 the Penguin with an army of penguins. What happened to the future I was promised. So

251
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,360
 hopefully this pervert in London is put away. Get cooler criminals and again, not serial

252
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,120
 killers. Those people are lame. Oh, look at this riddle. I guess they broke the Zodiac's

253
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,240
 code. They're like, "No one had broke it for 35 years and the message they couldn't break

254
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:03,080
 was, 'You'll never catch me, coppers!'" So I guess they probably expected something

255
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,440
 more from the code. I expected something more from the code, but again, Zodiac's pretty

256
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,000
 lame. Okay, flanco. I turned flanco. Flanco is not wearing a supervillain outfit. We're

257
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,480
 all in supervillain outfits. We're dressed up as our favorite supervillains. I'm Megatron.

258
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,680
 He- he- that counts, by the way. We are headed out, so call in that carboner copter flanco.

259
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:33,200
 We are leaving behind London. We are headed to the jungles of Vietnam. Helicopters flying

260
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,320
 over the jungles. You gotta be quick. You gotta be quick, flanco, because we are back

261
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:45,320
 in the year, 1972. The Vietnam War is in full force right now. We got our guns ready. Loading

262
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,040
 them up. I'm Megatron, so just someone has me. You're loading me up. I'm like, "Ooh,

263
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,520
 that tickles. I like that." Flanco, bring that carboner copter down. We jump

264
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,600
 out. Go, go, go, go, go. We're running through the jungles of Vietnam. Now, I know exactly

265
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,360
 where we're going. We're headed to Tong Lee Sap, that's in Cambodia. It's on the border

266
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,520
 of Cambodia and Vietnam. It's April 1972. U.S. Central Command has a mission. They're

267
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,640
 gonna send out a unit of Special Forces troops. I know all my terminology is wrong, military

268
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,600
 dudes. Okay? Don't shoot me. A unit of Special Forces is moving through the jungle, moving

269
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,440
 through Cambodia. Their goal is there is a North Vietnamese listening station in the

270
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,040
 area. They figure if they can take that out, North Vietnamese can't listen anymore. It

271
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,880
 defends the entire country. It's like Battle of Los Angeles. You destroy that, everyone

272
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,160
 just falls down. But as they're getting closer to the base, they notice there's a little

273
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:50,640
 clearing in the jungle. They see a silver sphere, big old silver sphere sitting in the

274
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,960
 jungle. They're looking at each other. What's that, Sarge? One of them says, and the Sarge

275
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,960
 kind of looks a bit and goes, "I don't know. I have no idea why GSB. I'm not an AK." They're

276
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,240
 looking at this big silver sphere. They could tell it has like three legs, three little

277
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,040
 like landing things. But if they're out here in the jungle, they have a mission. Special

278
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,400
 Forces are not allowed to go, "Hey, let's go sightseeing. Let's go see the Grand Canyon

279
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,400
 center in the area to kill this conspiracy theorist who has a cabin out in the middle

280
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,440
 of Arizona." They've got a mission, right? So they see this orb. They're like, "I'll

281
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,760
 take a couple pictures of it. We've still got to go to that listening post. Maybe we'll

282
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,720
 swing back by and take a couple more pictures." But that's when they see movement. Okay, this

283
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,720
 is good. Guys, get ready. Get down. He's super loud. He's yelling. Hey, everyone, look at

284
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,080
 something's coming. Everyone get down. We're the U.S. soldiers. He goes, "Guys, guys, get

285
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,480
 down. Get down." He probably just holds his hand up and everyone freezes. They train their

286
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,280
 guns on this moving figure. Now, they may have been unnerved by the orb, but again, they

287
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,240
 got a job to do. But when they see what can only be described as a gray alien walking around

288
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,120
 the base of the ship, now things just got real. One thing they're noticing is as they're

289
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,800
 in the vicinity of this orb, even before they saw this creature, everyone felt a little

290
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,840
 uneasy. That may have been another reason why the commander just wanted a sightseeker.

291
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,160
 They felt a little nauseous around this thing. It was almost like it was putting out some

292
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:25,080
 sort of infrasound. But now that they're actually seeing this alien walk by, the fear accelerates.

293
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,320
 But again, these are trained soldiers. You have to focus. Now, in this clearing, they

294
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,000
 see this orb and then they see like these bins. There's like these metal bins around

295
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,400
 the orb as well. And that's when they see the gray alien walking around and they see

296
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,480
 several other gray aliens now, very clearly in this clearing. And they begin to watch

297
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,720
 these creatures rummage through the boxes. They'll pull stuff out of one box, look at

298
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,960
 it for a bit, maybe place it back in, maybe take it to another container in the area.

299
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,680
 And they're watching this go on for just a few seconds and it clicks to the sergeant

300
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,360
 and everyone else in that group what they're looking at. Gray alien reaches into a bin,

301
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,480
 pulls out a human arm, looks at it, places it back down. These aliens are moving through

302
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,520
 this area and it seems that just out of view there's a pile of human bodies because they

303
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,040
 keep going to this certain area and bringing stuff over and putting it into one of these

304
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:32,560
 bins. Something just snaps. The fear is gone and the fear is replaced with hate. In a second,

305
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,440
 the commander gives the order to open fire. Bullets are ripping through the jungle, aliens

306
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,680
 like oh no, oh no, I knew I should have called in sick today. They're running around, bullets

307
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,360
 are ripping through the jungle. Now what the soldiers learn very quickly is that they have

308
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,280
 to put several rounds into one of these guys to drop them, if they drop them at all. The

309
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:02,800
 aliens are traditionally gray aliens but they're wearing silver suits and as the soldiers

310
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,720
 are opening fire they see that the bullets can't penetrate these silver suits. Now I've

311
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,480
 talked about this several times on the show, the big problem with gray aliens is the most

312
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,600
 vulnerable part of their body is the most important, i.e. your head. Humans have tiny

313
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,340
 heads so we can move, right? I don't know if that's evolutionary but we have the most

314
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,600
 important part in the tiniest part of our body. The aliens are the opposite, gray aliens

315
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,280
 have giant eyes, you could throw a stick of butter and you're likely to hit the dude in

316
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,440
 the eye. And then he has butter in his eye which is the worst thing possible. So the

317
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,320
 soldiers are all shooting them and the bullets aren't necessarily bouncing off the metal

318
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:53,800
 but they're not doing damage so they just aim up like an inch and the heads start exploding.

319
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:02,240
 Gray aliens' heads were just getting split down the middle. The gray aliens, as they

320
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,000
 were getting massacred, they also had their own weapons. It's noted in this story that

321
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,400
 several US soldiers were killed by an unknown weapon. Most likely a beam weapon. Generally

322
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,200
 gray aliens are associated with a beam weapon, sometimes it even looks like a flashlight

323
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,520
 but it doesn't matter too because the US soldiers are just like "tack, tack, tack,

324
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,400
 tack, tack, tack, tack!" Just lighting these dudes up and eventually the gray aliens, they

325
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,520
 begin just grabbing handfuls of arms and legs and torsos and everything like that and just

326
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,160
 throwing them on the UFO. One alien walks up, he hits the side of the UFO, landing plane

327
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,800
 comes down, the other aliens are holding bunch of body parts, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

328
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,560
 They drag as much human remains as they can onto the ship. The door closes. An interesting

329
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,800
 detail is the three legs, the three landing legs, whatever those are called, they seem

330
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,440
 to be fused into the ship. The soldier said it was really weird because it looked like

331
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,320
 it was all one piece but then the legs retracted as it was going off. They said it just looked

332
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,680
 bizarre. It didn't look like they could do that. It was weird. It's just one of those

333
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,640
 small details that I thought it was a weird detail. They thought it was one fused piece

334
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,760
 of metal but then the legs just retract in there like, huh? Which is funny to not think

335
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,080
 about it, you just killed 20 gray aliens and you're like, "But look at those legs!"

336
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,360
 Ship flies off. They also said it didn't fly off very quickly. It's kind of like, took

337
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,120
 its time. So again, small details sometimes matter that make these stories stand out.

338
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,400
 And here's another detail. The US soldiers, they radio it in and they go, "Hey, you know

339
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,600
 that whole North Vietnamese listening station you wanted us to take out?" Well, we might

340
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,360
 be a little late. We might be a little late. And as they're waiting for other forces to

341
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,560
 come in and kind of take care of the area, like this isn't something they're not going

342
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,360
 to move on now. Like obviously this is of essential importance. What were these things?

343
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,320
 What were they doing here? They noticed that the US soldiers who got shot by the alien

344
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,200
 aliens, they're like, "Jimmy, Jimmy, you shouldn't have that game show and Jason's run out of

345
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:17,600
 names but Jimmy, Jimmy, stay with me, stay with me." And Jimmy's all, "Come on down."

346
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,960
 And then Jimmy would melt. The soldiers who had been hit by this beam weapon melted. They

347
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,200
 didn't melt like Wizard of Oz. They decomposed. Just their skin would open up and the organs

348
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,920
 would be all there and the organs would wither away. Supposedly the CIA came out here, immediately

349
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,040
 began debriefing these troops and then administered drugs to them so they would never remember

350
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,040
 it. This is where the story starts to get a little more suspicious because the story

351
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,480
 doesn't actually get revealed until the 1980s when two of the soldiers in this unit start

352
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,740
 to remember it. That can sometimes be either starting to remember the event or starting

353
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,600
 to remember that they can make a lot of money by claiming they fought aliens. But it doesn't

354
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,680
 seem like that was the case because again, this is a super obscure story. They ended up

355
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,760
 trying to track down other members of their unit and they got a hold of a couple of them

356
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,160
 and they went and met a man named Leonard Strinkfield. And that's, I got this story from

357
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,080
 ThingAbout@Docs.com. They got it from Leonard Strinkfield and it's actually interesting.

358
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,720
 He, it seems to be one of those huge UFO-ologists that no one's ever heard of. Like his Wikipedia

359
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,340
 pages, maybe two paragraphs. People talk about him in high esteem. He wrote four books, three

360
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,860
 of them which are out of print. It's 80 to 100 dollars to buy copies of these, which

361
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,900
 again are signs that the book is in high esteem. Like if the book is full of garbage, there's

362
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,260
 tons of books on Amazon that are garbage and no one will buy. His books go up to 400 dollars

363
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,620
 really for first editions of this. They were all written in the 70s and early 80s and this

364
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,300
 story is one of them. He talks about these soldiers coming to him. So I'm going to try

365
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,000
 to get ahold of one of his books. There's one that's a little bit cheaper, but it's

366
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 of a different series. I'm going to try to get ahold of it. But take a look and see

367
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,920
 more what's going on there. I find this story fascinating because it makes a lot of sense.

368
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,480
 In a war zone, aliens would rule supreme. All of their sort of experiments with cattle

369
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,200
 mutilation, kidnapping humans, doing anything like that would work 10 times better in a

370
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,100
 war zone because people would go missing, body parts would be found. Actually now that I

371
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,380
 think about it, I wonder if it's going to sound ridiculous, but I'm being totally serious.

372
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,220
 I wonder if aliens, so this is not me and the I had planned. I was going to talk about

373
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,420
 how kind of dark it is to think that while humans are fighting each other, aliens are

374
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:45,660
 watching over us. And at our lowest, most basis point, i.e. violence against each other,

375
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,280
 the aliens are kind of picking us off one by one and then harvesting us and we would

376
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,360
 never know. That was the ending I had planned, but this is the nature of the show. What if,

377
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,000
 think about it, aliens are flying around and they're abducting cowdolls for cattle mutilation.

378
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,240
 You suck them up into this ship and then you're like dissecting them and then you're dropping

379
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,760
 them off. We know aliens can do lost time and we know aliens can abduct stuff through

380
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:17,240
 walls. That's another power that aliens have. Why wouldn't it be possible for aliens to

381
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:24,180
 abduct cows while they're in the slaughterhouse? Cow sitting in a pin about to get like slaughtered

382
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,460
 and stuff like that. He's about to be let out into the slaughterhouse and aliens freeze

383
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,820
 time. Now I know why they do it in the middle of nowhere because you don't have to do all

384
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,020
 this stuff. But the aliens basically, I'm not going to say like they put on, they put on

385
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,760
 lab coats and they're dressed up ass slaughterhouse workers and they're like "hey howdy Bob!"

386
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,320
 What if, aliens are abducting cows right before they're slaughtered, taking out all their

387
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,260
 organs and then putting them back in the slaughterhouse and you go Jason, you obviously know nothing

388
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:00,320
 about slaughterhouses. It's not like the cows just are on a conveyor belt and their

389
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,600
 buttholes are missing. Humans don't carve out the butthole, at least not the first pass.

390
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,620
 They save that for the Windy's Chili. I don't know, like wouldn't it make more sense?

391
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,060
 Think about it, if aliens are cutting people up and they're using bodies in Vietnam, all

392
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,240
 war zones I think it wouldn't make sense. Aliens are using that time to abduct people

393
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:27,660
 and to observe humanity and again at our worst. Couldn't aliens also do that for slaughterhouses

394
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,340
 where they're abducting cows? How come, you know what, I don't want to keep going off

395
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,420
 on this because the episode is already running long. But how come aliens don't abduct chickens

396
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:44,240
 or pigs? Have we ever found a whale with its butthole removed? I don't think anyone's

397
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,120
 looking. They're like, "I'll be right back, Jason!" and they're getting their scuba suit

398
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,840
 and they're flying around and they're like, "Not yet, but I'll keep trying." Why is it

399
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,800
 cows? Why don't we see, I know like they'll have like chicken mutilations but most of

400
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,960
 the time those are associated with like hoodoo and those are usually found in areas where

401
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,460
 you have religions that practice chicken sacrifice. But how come if we have all of the, I know

402
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:17,060
 we have goats and a lot of people apply that to the chupacabra which 100% doesn't exist,

403
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,420
 by the way. I give a lot of credit to like aliens and big fun stuff like that. Chupacabra

404
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,460
 does not exist. This episode is going on too long, so I gotta wrap this up. I'll talk about

405
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:31,420
 that in some other episode. I think I've talked about it before but why cows? Like I understand

406
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,920
 why don't I abduct humans because we're so dope. Do aliens abduct ants which are like

407
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,800
 the second best thing on this planet? Do aliens abduct ants and steady ants? Why cows? That's

408
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,760
 an interesting question. I never ever thought about that before. Yeah, goats, sure they

409
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,640
 are killed and again it's not the chupacabra. Something might be doing that. So goats and

410
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:00,800
 cows but why not pigs or oxen? Horses? I know there's, again whenever we see a horse mutilation

411
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,540
 it's almost all, this is weird. I gotta wrap this episode up. Horse mutilations are almost

412
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:11,000
 always tied to sexual perversion. There's like a weird pervert thing like that play

413
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,660
 equus but in real life where you go around and you stab horses and masturbate. I'm not

414
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:22,280
 annoying but I've come across a lot of, I'm not gonna say that right? Just weird. I don't

415
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:29,060
 know why, why cows? Hey everyone this is Jason from the future. Before this episode ends

416
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,800
 with me just saying why cows over and over again. I actually did look it up while I was

417
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:40,400
 editing. Apparently I didn't know this. The term cattle, the term cattle doesn't just

418
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,800
 mean cows. It's basically any domesticated animal. And so when people say cattle mutilation

419
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,840
 I always just figured that was cows. There it goes. I wanna always say I've been researching

420
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,400
 this stuff for 30 years. I never looked up the definition of cattle. So there are pig

421
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:03,400
 mutilations and sheep mutilations. Horses other than the Disgusting Sex Act that I was talking

422
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:11,980
 about. There have been at least one reported unexplained horse mutilation. So there's your

423
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:19,060
 update. More disgusting stuff going on. Horse again I think it's mostly gross dudes. But

424
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:25,780
 maybe there's some gross aliens out there. So I wanted to go ahead and clarify that for

425
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:32,320
 you. We always hear stories about grey aliens abducting people for experiments. But then

426
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,280
 we also hear stories from people talking about a galactic brotherhood of these grays coming

427
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,760
 down and telling us to stop polluting the environment or to disarm our nuclear missiles.

428
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,840
 And while those may be good things in theory, they're actually probably really good things.

429
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,920
 You gotta question the motivation of the people asking you to do that. Sure, nuclear bombs

430
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,580
 aren't great, but they maybe are only line of defense against aliens. So the next time

431
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,460
 someone tries telling you some hippy story about these grey aliens just trying to help

432
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,620
 us raise our consciousness, I want you to remember this story. Where they were harvesting

433
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:18,620
 human body parts. For what goal? Who knows. But it couldn't have been good. It's always

434
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:25,160
 suspicious when the person telling you to lay down your arms also has a crate of human

435
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:32,800
 arms in their house. That's never happened before. But if it did happen, if it did happen,

436
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,760
 you would be super suspicious. I'm very very suspicious of the grey alien galactic brotherhood

437
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,480
 if they're picking up body parts in the middle of a Cambodian jungle. Who knows what the

438
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,700
 aliens were doing in that jungle in Cambodia, but I can almost guarantee it was nothing

439
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:54,300
 good. And we can all rest easy knowing that the aliens took heavy casualties during that

440
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:02,380
 conflict. Let that be a lesson to these grey body harvesting aliens. When the day comes,

441
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:11,780
 we will fight back. You want me to lay down these arms? Come and get them. Also, why cows?
