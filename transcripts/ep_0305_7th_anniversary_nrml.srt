1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Saudi Arabia and Iran are currently fighting the largest ground war in human history.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,720
 Are they truly fighting in the deserts of Baghdad over oil or culture? Or are they fighting for

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:22,720
 alien artifacts buried underneath the hot unforgiving sand? And then we travel to the still smoldering

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,120
 crater formerly known as Boise, Idaho. A miniature nuclear bomb was detonated. We know that for sure.

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,520
 The question is, was the North Koreans behind it or was it an inside job perpetrated by President

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,400
 Jeb Bush? And then I'm going to tell you guys a secret. A secret I've been holding in since I

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,480
 started the show. But it will all be revealed today on the seventh anniversary special of the Dead

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:57,600
 Rabbit podcast. Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of the Dead Rabbit podcast. I'm

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
 your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great life. I hope you guys are having a great life too.

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,400
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today. A lot of world events that are going on right now. It really

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,200
 seems like things are falling apart. But I gotta get the big story out of the way first. And yes,

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,680
 the nuking of Idaho is a big story. I get that. And the war in the Middle East is rough for the

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,880
 people over there. But I'm sure I have a few listeners in Iraq. We are actually, we top, hey

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,480
 Jamie, can you pull those stats up? Yeah, if you're watching this on video, if you're watching on

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,440
 the DeadRabbit.com actual live feed, you can see our stats here. We are now as of today. Took

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,840
 us seven years to get here. But we are now the number one podcast in the world. We've really

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,400
 blown it out. Daily podcasts are really hard to get a lot of good ratings on. But look at those

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,040
 stats. If you can see them, if you can't see them on the video, it's 9.99 a month. You can subscribe

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
 to the video feed. But you kind of get the gist of it, right? Number one podcast in the world.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,440
 Now, I started this podcast back on October 1, 2012. And it seemed to come out of the blue. I

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,680
 know a lot of people were like, whoa, what gave even inspiration to start this podcast? It just

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
 kind of came out of the right time. You just seemed to know what was going to happen. I was

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,560
 covering conspiracies that weren't even conspiracies yet. And you guys have always wondered how I got

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,800
 this scoop, how I knew what was coming. Well, you know what? It's time to tell the truth. On the

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,000
 seventh anniversary of the Dead Rabbit podcast, I have decided to tell you the truth. This isn't

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,880
 my first go round. So I am from before the reset. And this was a conspiracy theory that hasn't popped

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,680
 up in this timeline. This is going to get a little complicated, but I'm from, for lack of a better

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,120
 word, another timeline. You see, I previously started this show in 2018. And I maybe had like

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,480
 305, 306 episodes under my belt. And there was a conspiracy theory that was going around since

30
00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:01,040
 June of 2019 that on October 1, 2019, time would reset back to October 1, 2012. And it was utter

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,040
 nonsense. It was such a ridiculous conspiracy theory. I really didn't cover it at the time. I

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,160
 just thought this is stupid. Now, I did get a YouTube comment from a user. It's funny that I

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,160
 even remember this stuff, because it's really been seven years for me, but I got a YouTube comment

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:22,560
 from a user named Furnest. Furnest? Not like Furnest, like burning, but like fern, like a plant,

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
 fern goalie. Anyways, thank you for the retroactive. I don't even know if he listens to this

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,800
 version. Of course he listens to the show. It's huge. Hey, Jamie, can you see if Furnest still

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,520
 listens to the show? Okay, cool. Thank you. See if you can look that up. So anyways, I saw this

38
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,760
 conspiracy theory. I was following it on a 4chan. But I was following it on 4chan and it kind of

39
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,000
 bled over in other parts of the internet. And the reason why I didn't cover it was it talked a lot

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
 about, like, how much Bible quotes out of context, which is kind of my least favorite thing to research,

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,040
 because it'll be like, read Ecclesiastes 19, and it'll be like, the plum fell off the tree. And

42
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,480
 they're like, this means that time is a plum or something like that. It's always nonsense whenever

43
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,440
 they involve Bible verses out of context. And I didn't cover it for another reason. Also,

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,160
 I didn't think it was true. And you look at me now. No one podcast got all this stuff. But

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,120
 there was a key point to this conspiracy theory. It was that only some people would remember the

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,320
 original timeline. And a lot of the most popular conspiracy theories involve some sort of power

47
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,360
 fantasy. A lot of it sometimes is just as basic as the person who believes in the conspiracy theory

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,000
 has some hidden knowledge. With gangstalking, the power comes from you are so important,

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,240
 the government wants to find out about you. With 9/11, I think, is we know the truth. Again,

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,920
 it kind of goes back to that thing. But some conspiracy theories actually have it built into

51
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,760
 them that you are special. So when people, when leading up to October 1st, this was really gaining

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,800
 traction because one, a lot of people are not happy with their current lives. I was fine with

53
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,240
 my current life. I really was. Things were going great for me. But the only thing I'd ever really

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,320
 want to change is, I started the podcast earlier, and lo and behold, the conspiracy was true.

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,480
 Time actually reset. And I know this is blowing your guys' mind, because I'm a skeptic about a lot

56
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,520
 of stuff. And I've held this story in for seven years. I wanted to wait until it came back. This

57
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,800
 is based on some sort of Jewish holiday thing. Apparently, there's a thing called the Shemetah,

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,120
 which is a period of seven years. And for whatever reason, the period from 2012 to 2019 had a glitch

59
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
 in it or something like that. There's a couple of Bible verses about prunes that explain it better

60
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,480
 than I could, but there was a special date called Yom Tera, which is another Jewish day holiday,

61
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,680
 something like that. I guess I've had seven years to research it, and I haven't really looked into

62
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,120
 it, but it was September 30th, October 1st, caused the switch. And again, I totally didn't buy into

63
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,560
 it at all. But it happened. And I mocked people openly on this thing. Well, I didn't openly do it.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
 I would just read comments and go, "This is stupid. This is stupid conspiracy theory." And then, bam,

65
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,320
 seven years. I traveled back in time seven years. I wake up in my bed on October 1st. I'm one of

66
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,840
 the few lucky ones that was able to retain my memory. I got up out of my bed, hooked my microphone up,

67
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,480
 recorded the first episode of the Dead Rabbit podcast. A couple other things have changed for

68
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,960
 me. A couple of things have changed for a lot of people, actually. Jamie, hey, Jamie, you know that

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,120
 guy? You know Joe Rogan? You know that guy? No, no. He was that guy who did a bunch of DMT and got

70
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,240
 Sharon a headlock. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember him? You used to work for that dude in my timeline.

71
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,800
 You worked for him. He had a podcast. He had a podcast. I think he's doing like five to 10

72
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,960
 right now in Folsom, but he used to work for him. Also, you guys know that I've had this long-lived

73
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,200
 love affair with Britney Spears. In my timeline, that didn't happen. I was picking up women at bars.

74
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,160
 And here I am with my beautiful wife, Britney, and can't have my beautiful wife,

75
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,280
 Britney, without my son, Mungo, Mungo Jr. Come in here. Come in here, Mungo Jr.

76
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,520
 Yes, Daddy. What do you want? Mungo. Is that how someone named Mungo would talk?

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:08,400
 Daddy, what want? That's much better, Mungo Jr. That's much, much better. I can't

78
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,120
 understand you unless you speak Mungo. You understand that. So imagine a timeline where

79
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,920
 I don't have those things. That was the timeline I came from. Now, some of you guys probably do

80
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,720
 remember the timeline switch. And if you do, you've probably been waiting for me to make this

81
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,920
 announcement this whole time. I guess you probably didn't know that I remember this timeline switch,

82
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,240
 but time actually did reset. The biggest conspiracy that ever affected me was actually true.

83
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:42,160
 October 1st, 2019, in my original timeline, I switched back seven years to present to you this,

84
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:52,320
 the seventh anniversary sp- Oh no, time. Something's happening with time. Oh no. I think I'm getting

85
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:59,840
 warped back to my original time zone. No. Britney, no. Where are you going? You're turning the dust.

86
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,760
 No. Jamie, Jamie, look out. Don't work for him. He'll probably get you in a chokehold at some

87
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:16,400
 point. No, no. Mungo Jr., come here. Mungo Jr., come here. Daddy, will you tell me at least once

88
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,320
 you love me? Mungo. Mungo. You know I can't understand you unless you talk Mungo.

89
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,920
 Me not know if you truly love.

90
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:40,880
 I guess we'll never know what Mungo Jr. was trying to say in his final moments.

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,120
 Let's go ahead and take the rabbit robot to Japan. Now, yesterday's episode in the original

92
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,480
 timeline, I talked about as a white Mungo dust off of my pants, but anyway, so yesterday in 2019,

93
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,720
 October, September, whatever, the timeline's gonna be wacky for a while. I had this seductress

94
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,240
 special and it ran out of time for the story of the woman in the hollow boat. So we're gonna

95
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,040
 talk about that right now. So let's hop on in our dead rabbit robot. We're actually gonna row over

96
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,080
 there and you see I'm a little swollen as I'm rowing and you're like, "Do you miss Mungo?"

97
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,800
 And I'm like, "Nah, he's kind of a nerd." Like, "Do you miss Britney?" Oh, immensely I miss her.

98
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,240
 "What do you miss most about the old timeline?" you ask. Put the orange away. Turn my back to you.

99
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,960
 And I look calmly out in the ocean for a long time. You're just staring at the back of my head

100
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:38,320
 and deep in thought. And you go, "Jason, do you have an answer?" And I turn around and go,

101
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,120
 "What? Sorry, I forgot what we were talking about." And then I start rowing again and you'll never

102
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,920
 be entirely for sure if I'm being honest that I don't remember what you were talking about

103
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:57,200
 or if there was something that I truly miss from my old life. Splash. Splash. Water cresting over

104
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,960
 the boat. Now things are a little awkward and we're just quiet as we row from Oregon to Japan.

105
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,520
 And you're like, "This is not a comfortable boat ride. No sing and see shanties." Just me rowing,

106
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,120
 looking out of the ocean, looking past you, looking through you. You're thinking this,

107
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,200
 this guy creepy. This podcast has become creepy. But anyways, now we're nearing Japan.

108
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:31,680
 The year is 1803. The specific date is February 22nd. And we're in Hitachi, Japan. And there's a

109
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,520
 bunch of fishermen just chilling on the beach, right? Smoking little cigarettes. I'm assuming,

110
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,720
 do they have tobacco over there? Did all that stuff come from South America? What were the

111
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,600
 Japanese smoking that whole time? I guess by 1803 they had tobacco. Bunch of Japanese fishermen

112
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,960
 sitting on the beach smoking cigarettes. And they see a boat in the distance. Not ours. Not

113
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,480
 the dead rubber over there. We're invisible. They see this boat floating. It's fairly big. I mean,

114
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,640
 I'm not a boat guy, but this sounds big. It's 10 feet high, 17 feet wide. And it basically is

115
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,200
 like a big old circle with a diamond bottom and a top. They compared it to a rice cooker

116
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,400
 or an incense burner. But anyways, is the fisherman fighting over, "No, no, no, that looks like a rice

117
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,080
 cooker. Nah, you idiot. That looks like an incense cooker." And they're starting to fight. They're

118
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,960
 starting to wrestle. The boat crashes onto shore. And they walk up to it and they notice that the

119
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,960
 bottom of the boat is covered in brass plates. And they're like, "That makes sense. We'll protect it

120
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,560
 from crashing on the rocks," which is what it just did. Very, very well-designed ship. They see

121
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,120
 some strange writing on the side of it all over it. And they're like, "Oh, that's weird. I don't

122
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,760
 read." It's not Japanese. Therefore, it's strange, which is pretty much what they said. And then

123
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,160
 they pop the top off. They're like, "I told you it was like a rice cooker," as they're turning it.

124
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:54,800
 Steam shoots out. And inside is a bunch of like... You remember the show, "I Dream a Genie," and it

125
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,320
 was like all plush inside of a bottle, like satin pillows and like drapes and stuff like that?

126
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,760
 To my eight listeners who are over the age of 40, how come they haven't turned that into a movie?

127
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,080
 "I Dream a Genie." They should turn that into a movie starring Dude, the Rock as the Major in the

128
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,920
 military, and then Kevin Hart as the Genie. Tell me you would not want to see a two-inch tall Kevin

129
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,840
 Hart. Now, he doesn't have to wear like the bikini bottom thing, the, you know, like the sexy

130
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:32,080
 genie outfit. Pretty funny though. If he did, he... Every show should... They should do the

131
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,480
 Flintstones with... "Join the Rock Johnson as Fred," Kevin Hart as Barney Rubble. They should just

132
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,240
 reboot all of those movies with them in it. Call me Hollywood. That's me. I just put Kevin Hart

133
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,120
 and Rock... I don't watch them at any... I've never seen them in a movie together, but they just look

134
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,560
 hilarious when they stand next to each other. And two-inch Kevin Hart wouldn't even need special

135
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,640
 effects for that. So let's go ahead and get back to the story here. Weird language, diamond-shaped

136
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,760
 boat, bunch of plush stuff in here, and they find a bunch of water, some food, and a beautiful maiden.

137
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,920
 4.9 feet tall. Man, they were really into the measurements in this story. If I ever ran into

138
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,480
 an alien, I'll be like, "Yeah, it's maybe three, four feet tall. I wouldn't be able to specifically say

139
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,440
 it was 4.9 feet tall." But she's a beautiful maiden, so you're going to pay attention to the details.

140
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,960
 18 to 20 years old, based on how she looks. You're starting... Okay, so that should be your first

141
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,000
 clue of where the story is going. 18 or 20 years old, she hops out of the boat. They help her out

142
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,160
 of the boat. Most likely she's not a rabbit. She's like, "Moy!" jumps out. She has red hair with white

143
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,560
 extensions in it, and extremely beautiful clothes of an unknown origin, unknown material. They know

144
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
 where the clothes came from, a seamstress, but they don't know where the material is. Now,

145
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,480
 she is speaking a language they can't understand. So they're just kind of talking on the beach,

146
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,080
 checking this check out. And she's talking, and they're just like, "Mhmm. Yeah, whatever you say,

147
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,800
 honey." And she's holding this box. This box... What is it about the measurements, bro? The box is

148
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,520
 like 24 inches wide or long, and then fairly deep. I don't know, maybe 24 inches too. It doesn't matter.

149
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,440
 They didn't tell me that, or I didn't write it down. But anyway, she's holding this box. And the dudes

150
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,160
 are like, "Can we see it?" Now, they can't understand each other, but whenever they go to reach for the

151
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,040
 box, she like shyly coily like, "Mhmm. Nah, uh, boys. Can't touch my box." That came out bad. But

152
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,800
 anyways, the fishermen take her to the local city. She goes to the city. She stays there for a while,

153
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,280
 and people are admiring her. She's extremely beautiful. And she has pale skin. I guess I should

154
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,560
 have said that too. Because she looked different than everyone else in Japan. And she's there with

155
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,040
 her box, and people keep asking to see what's in the box. What's in the box? And she's like,

156
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,000
 "Mhmm. And so, eventually they go, "You know what we should do? Let's go talk to the wisest man in

157
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,840
 town. Let's go talk to this old dude. He will know what we should do with this woman." Nobody knew

158
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,640
 where she came from, what was in the box. They didn't know. So they go to, this is my favorite part

159
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,280
 of the story. Supposedly, true story, by the way, it's been reported throughout Japanese history.

160
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,080
 We'll get to that in a second, though. But anyways, they go to this Japanese dude, this old Japanese

161
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,880
 man. They're climbing up the stairs to his mountain fortress. It's like cold winter day. There's

162
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,840
 snow everywhere. I don't know. I made those details up. They just go visit the old man. And he's

163
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,040
 sitting there, and he's smoking his pipe. And this is a quote from one of these stories. I love this.

164
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,680
 Now, I'm going to read you this quote, but this old man is guessing. I just want to let you know.

165
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,160
 He has as much information as everyone else in the village. They go and they ask him, "What should

166
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,800
 we do about that hot redhead over there?" And he looks over there and he goes, this is his quote.

167
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:59,120
 "This woman could be a princess of a foreign realm who married at her homeland. But when she had an

168
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,640
 affair with the town's men after marriage, it caused the scandal. The crowd's like, "Oh, no."

169
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:15,040
 And the lever was killed for punishment. The princess was banned from home. Again, total guessing.

170
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,520
 Totally guessing all this stuff. "For she enjoyed lots of sympathy,

171
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,320
 so she escaped the death penalty." I'm glad he's turned into Yoda all of a sudden.

172
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 Instead, she might have been exposed in that Utsuro Boon, which I should have told you. That's the

173
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,160
 name of the story. Utsuro Boon. It means hollow boat. "To leave her to destiny." If this should be

174
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,720
 correct, totally guessing, by the way. He's looking around. He's like, "Don't take me seriously." But

175
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,200
 if this should be correct, the quadratic box, which what, is a square? Just say it's a box, bro.

176
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:54,400
 The quadratic box may contain, wait for it. So he doesn't know if any of this stuff is true

177
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,600
 at all. But he's just wove this story. This dude must be stoned out of his mind. Sees a redhead

178
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,560
 with a box and he goes, "Bro, what if," and tells the story. And then he goes, "The quadratic box

179
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,040
 may contain the head of the deceased woman's lover." This is an interesting part. That was

180
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,080
 interesting too, but I find this part fascinating. "In the past, a very similar object with a woman

181
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,440
 was washed ashore on a close by beach. During this incident, a small board with a pinned head was found.

182
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,280
 The content of the box could therefore be the same, which would certainly explain why she

183
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,800
 protects it so much, or it could just be none of your business what's in the box. It would cost

184
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,280
 lots of money and time to investigate the woman and her boat." There we go. He's now been out of

185
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,560
 his Scrooge McDuck. "It would cost lots of money and time to investigate the woman and her boat." So

186
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,640
 I'll just make stuff up. I don't want to spend my money. "Since it seems to be tradition to expose

187
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,880
 those boats at sea." I love this part. This part. Again, great. This whole, this old man

188
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,960
 is incredibly entertaining. So he just wove this tale, no proof whatsoever. I think it's interesting

189
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,960
 he says this has happened before and we found a head, but that story is never really elaborated on.

190
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,520
 So he might have just been making that up too. He might have been telling people this and everyone's

191
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,840
 like, "What are you talking about?" He's like, "Uh, this happened before, remember?" And they're

192
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,520
 like, "No, it didn't." And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, just yeah, it happened before. Here,

193
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,280
 smoke a little bit of my pipe." And they're like, "Oh yeah, dude, it happened before." So it would

194
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,960
 cost lots of money and time to investigate the woman and her boat. "Since it seems to be the

195
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:46,000
 tradition to expose those boats at sea, we should bring the woman back to the Otsuro Boon

196
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,280
 and let her drift away." Sits back, takes a couple hits of his pipe. Townspeople are like,

197
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,840
 "Are you saying that we should put her back in the..." He's like, "Yeah, that's exactly what I'm

198
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,480
 saying. It's going to cost too much money and time to figure out who she is." Just put her back

199
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,080
 in the boat. So they drag this woman back to the beach, throw her in the boat, and kick it out into

200
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:23,040
 the ocean. The end. What? That story is hilarious because if he's right and it is a tradition of

201
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,600
 where she comes from, that you cast your criminals who can't be executed into a boat, basically give

202
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,480
 them a death sentence at sea, cast the boat out, and then that's what their people do. We should

203
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,920
 do that as well. There's a very high chance that there's a head in a box. We should honor the traditions

204
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,280
 of her people by doing this. Plus, it costs a lot of money to figure out if I'm wrong. But if he's

205
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:53,200
 wrong and this woman was like an escaped or she this was some sort of weirdo life raft or she was

206
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,680
 just joyriding and got lost, they put her in a boat and kicked it back out of the ocean and she

207
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,480
 died. And even if he is right, the only thing she did wrong was Sadoos, that's why it was part of

208
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,960
 yesterday's episode, was Sadoos a young man and he got his head chopped off. She got put in a boat.

209
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
 So why is that just in any way, shape, or form? Oh yeah, her people do it. Just kick her off in

210
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
 the boat. Now this was reported in three different, depending on the terminology, some people, some

211
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,080
 websites call these newspapers, some people call these like journals or books. This was reported

212
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,480
 in three different journals or newspapers. One of them is called the stories of the garden of

213
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,200
 rabbits, which makes me think it's like fables and stuff like that. So not much credibility. The

214
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,960
 second one is an interesting one because it sounds a little more non-fictional. Diaries and stories

215
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,280
 of castaways. So that actually sounds, it could be fictional, but it could actually,

216
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,440
 this is considered, there's been some pushback recently about the story not being true.

217
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,000
 For the longest time this was considered a historical event. The last one I really, really hope

218
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,960
 is a newspaper. I would read this newspaper every single day. I would enjoy reading the news more

219
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,680
 than anything. There is a, I'm gonna call it a newspaper because I really hope it's a newspaper.

220
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:13,280
 It's called a peach powder. That would be adorable. I'm like, oh, it's 17 killed during bombing raid.

221
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,480
 Oh, peach powder. The pages, the pages are all like peach colored. That would be adorable. I could

222
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,600
 read the worst news in a newspaper called peach powder. But anyways, it's probably actually like

223
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,000
 teen bop for 1800s Japanese girls. They're like, oh, I can't wait to see who's the newest, the heart

224
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,080
 throb. It's like a wood carving of this dude named Akira Hashumi. He's just like a dude.

225
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,000
 He's holding this ugly wood carving. Anyways, anyways, it's just a pinup poster. You're like

226
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,360
 having to carve it yourself. Like, oh, you're so handsome. Anyways, so that's the story of its hero,

227
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,800
 Boone. Means hollow boat. Now it's funny because she, let's go back a bit. They say she's 18 to

228
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,760
 20 years old. I find that detail fascinating because right there, that should kind of start shooting

229
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,840
 down some of the weirder conspiracy theories. If this story is true, some people say she most

230
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,920
 likely was from Russia, which is fairly close to Japan. People have said she could have been a

231
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,560
 Russian princess. Some people have used the term American princess, which they don't exist. Oh,

232
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,840
 Britney Spears. But I mean, for the most part, they're not real. But Russian princess, she may have been

233
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,280
 royalty. It may have been an escape attempt may have been a castaway. Again, if their story is true,

234
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,040
 people have tried coming up with things about that. The people who are pushing back on this are

235
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,160
 saying there's several cities or provinces named in these stories that don't exist and never existed.

236
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,400
 So they don't think it's true at all. They think it's a fable. But other people have said, well,

237
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,080
 okay, maybe that particular place didn't exist. But there's enough other historical information

238
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,000
 that it did exist. So there's a lot of debate. But the weirdest stuff is space aliens. You'll see

239
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,080
 websites on this. And I have one of them on my show notes that this is one of the first encounters

240
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,000
 of space aliens, like meeting humans, which is utterly ridiculous. Like that was actually how

241
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,960
 I found out about the story. Because I was like, oh, space aliens landed on Japan in the 1800s. I

242
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,320
 got to read this. We're in the store. And like there's nothing here that insinuates aliens whatsoever.

243
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,400
 When's the last time you heard an alien short? Yes, 4.9 feet tall short. Fine. That's fine. That's

244
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,920
 alien unless you're happened to be that height. And then it's totally normal. But you know what I

245
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,920
 mean? Like you do describe aliens as like the short. But when's the last time someone says

246
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,480
 yeah, you know, the gray hopped out of his spaceship, he had that laser rifle slung around his

247
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:36,320
 shoulder. He looked to be about 18 or 20 years old. Like this is obviously a human woman. But the

248
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,560
 fact that she showed up in a bizarre looking boat, people go, oh, there must be UFO. If it was a UFO,

249
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,840
 one, it wouldn't just slowly bob through the water until it crashed into a bunch of rocks in front of

250
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,200
 a Japanese sailors. The weird markings, I mentioned this earlier too, the weird markings people go,

251
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,160
 weird markings. Sounds alien to me. Yes, alien to the country of Japan. That was actually,

252
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,480
 that's another interesting theory. There was a, because Japan had recently cut off contact to

253
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,440
 the Western world around this point, there was a theory that she was a spy, which she would be a

254
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,280
 really bad spy if she couldn't speak Japanese. But there was an idea that she was a spy. There's

255
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,000
 also other versions of the story where there's one version of the story where she doesn't get

256
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,760
 kicked back into the ocean. She stays and she marries somebody, but the other two where she

257
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,440
 gets kicked into the ocean, that ending's funnier. Anyways, so if it was UFO, it's not going to just

258
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,760
 smash against a bunch of rocks. It's not going to be made out of wood with brass bottom to it.

259
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,760
 That's kind of ridiculous. And I'm not a huge fan of the movie ET, but I'm pretty sure the ending of

260
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,840
 that, he didn't get back on his ship and then they just pushed it into the water and it floats away.

261
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,760
 If it was a UFO, as they were pushing it back, first off, she would have just been able to like

262
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,720
 use alien powers to not get put back in the boat, but they kick it back into the ocean and then

263
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,120
 it would bob around a bit and then fly away. So obviously not a UFO for multiple reasons that I

264
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,840
 pointed out. The fact that she has a box no one can look into, that's part of the mystery, the fact

265
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,320
 that no one can understand her. The fact that there's weird writing on the boat and the fact

266
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,000
 the boat is oddly shaped is what UFOologists hang their hat on. And all of those things are easily

267
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,760
 explainable. The boat was weird shaped because it came from a weird country, the like Russia.

268
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,480
 The language was weird because it wasn't Japanese. The woman had a, the woman didn't

269
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,960
 understand him because she didn't speak Japanese. And what was in the box is a mystery.

270
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,280
 Don't know if it was a head or not. You think if it was a head, she would have just tossed it out of

271
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,600
 the, out of the boat at some point. I mean, I don't care how much you love somebody. You're not going

272
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,280
 to carry their head around in a box unless you're like super crazy. But I guess being in a boat

273
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,800
 by yourself going across the sea might make you crazy. But why would you carry around the head

274
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,200
 of your executed lover? Because at that point it's all just skull and gooey meat and stuff like that.

275
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,880
 Disgusting. That's not romantic. So, but, but what was in the box? We don't know. Maybe if she

276
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,640
 opened up the box, there was a smaller box. He opened up that box. There was a smaller box. He

277
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,200
 opened up that box. Smaller box. Maybe it was just boxes all the way down. I don't know. Maybe if he,

278
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,280
 oh, maybe it was Pandora's box. Maybe it was the patent for Pandora, the streaming service.

279
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,000
 She was a time traveler from the time reset. We don't know. That is interesting enough. You don't

280
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,880
 need to throw aliens into everything. Oh, alien UFO. Crap. It's just a woman in a boat. It's a

281
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,520
 woman in a weird boat. It's a hot chick who crashes in Japan, who meets an old man and gets thrown

282
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,120
 back in the boat. That story's fascinating enough. You don't need E.T. showing up to make that story

283
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,000
 any more interesting. What's in the box? I, if I met a woman and she had a quadratic box,

284
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,680
 and I kept asking her what's in the box, and she would never show it to me, I would just assume

285
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,720
 that what was in the box was some embarrassing feminine hygiene products, or she was one of

286
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,320
 those weird cryptids that you hear about when you're kids, or one of those old legends about

287
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,160
 like the girl with the ribbon around her neck. She had the pretty bow around her neck, and she

288
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,400
 goes, don't ever take it off me. Don't ever take it off me. And one day her boyfriend like pulled

289
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,320
 the ribbon and her head rolled off. That story scared me as a child. I would assume it was

290
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,920
 something like that. I would assume like, if I ever met a woman in real life, I'm being totally

291
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,000
 honest, if I met a woman in real life, she said, never look in that box. I'm not going to assume

292
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,680
 that in the box is like hygiene products really, or that it's like love letters from her like the

293
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,480
 guy she's cheating on me with. I'm going to assume if I open that box, her head will fall off.

294
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,040
 So to be honest, I'm a pretty easy guy to keep secrets from. Just tell me. Don't go through

295
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,200
 my cell phone. Don't look at who I'm texting. My head might fall off. I'm like, okay, honey.
