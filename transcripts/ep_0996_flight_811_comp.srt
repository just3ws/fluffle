1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 When an elderly stroke victim is taken to the hospital, her family hopes that she will

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,920
 recover until it was supper time.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,720
 And then we fly the friendly skies with United Airlines Flight 811.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:24,000
 It was supposed to be a leisurely flight from Honolulu to Sydney, Australia.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 We fly the plane to the detour into the world of the paranormal, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm here with Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hope you aren't boarding a flight anytime soon.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Even though I'm sure a lot of you are, you're going to be traveling to visit your relatives.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 This is actually not a good episode before some of you are going to see your elderly relatives.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 You're like, "Please don't go to the hospital, mama."

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 That was dark and then people are going to be flying planes.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 This is a horrible time.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Horrible time to do this episode, but someone who knows how to turn a horrible time into lots of fun.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for...

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Kara Hanna.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Woohoo! Yeah, come on in Kara Hanna. Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Kara Hanna bought me a book off my Amazon wish list.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 It's called The Unidentified, Mythical Monsters Alien Encounters

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 in our obsession with the unexplained by Colin Dickey.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Thank you very much for this, this is really cool.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I haven't had a chance to read it yet.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 My friend Sabine's been reading it.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Basically the thesis of the book, at least what she's gotten so far, is that the world we live in

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 has been stripped of wonder.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We have answers to everything. We have answers to everything.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I have the push of a button.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And that is the reason why people believe so much in things that may not exist, like the world of the paranormal.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And he kind of goes through it like that. It's fascinating.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 This is a really fascinating theory, right? We are in the age of conspiracy theories.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Conspiracy theories was relegated to the weirdo at the trailer park.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 When I was a kid, in the 70s and 80s, they were the lone gunmen, they were the goofs of the world.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Nowadays conspiracy theorists have their own media platforms.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So, super interesting. I can't wait to read the book, Kara. Thank you so much for sending it over.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And that's why you're going to be our captain, our pilot today.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 If you guys can't support the show financially, if you guys can't buy me books, it's totally fine.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 It really is. I want you to believe me when I say this.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 You don't have to give me money to support the show. Just please spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 That is also how you can help the show grow.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Kara, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. Drive us all the way down to Brazil.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Sunny, sunny Brazil. It's going to be 11 degrees here tomorrow.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Gee, I wish I was really driving down to Brazil.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 We're headed down to Brazil. Not actually after this story.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I think I'm going to steer clear of the country for a while.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I guess I can't take this story and extrapolate it to all the people in Brazil.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But, I mean, this is insane. There's a lot of bad ways to die.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Let's take a look at this one. It's September 2012. It was quite a couple years back.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 What, 10 years? 10 years ago?

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 We're at BeramonÃ§a. That is a district in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And Kara pulls us up to this hospital. It's the Santa Casa de Missi Coridia,

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 which is the Holy House of Mercy.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 So we walk into the hospital and we're there to meet Ilda Vitor Maciel.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So we walk into her room and there's this old lady. She's 88 years old and she's laying in her hospital bed

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and she's like, "Uhhh..." We're like, "Oh, that's sad. Old people making noises like that.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 This doesn't look good." And then one of her family members goes,

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 "What are you doing in my grandma's room? Get out of here. Get out of here."

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But then once we explain who we are, we're doctors, right? That's why we're here. We're doctors.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 He's like, "Oh, okay." He goes, "Listen, Ilda, she had a stroke.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 She had a stroke the other day and she's lost all feeling on the left side of her body.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 But she seems to be doing better. Like, she's in the hospital, she's getting taken care of.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 She is 88 years old, but I'm sure she has a couple of years left.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 It's possible. I'm like, "Anything's possible, bro. Anything's possible."

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 There's meat showers in Kentucky every once in a while. Yeah, she might have a couple of years left.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 She had a stroke. She's doing better. Family's checking up on her.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 She's in the Holy House of Mercy Hospital and take care of her.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 But on September 27th, 2012, Ilda's daughter is in the room with her mom,

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 just, you know, keeping her comfortable, doing what she can do to help mom recover.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And a nurse walks in. This nurse has only been identified by the name Anna.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Anna walks in and it's supper time.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 It's time to eat. But apparently, I mean, she had the stroke.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 She's still recovering from it. They're not like feeding her food.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 They're not like, "It's chicken nuggets time." She's like, "Ah."

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 They have to inject it into her feeding tube. So they had some soup that they're going to inject into her feeding tube

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 so she can get some calories she can keep getting stronger.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 What this nurse does, though, is she has a syringe full of soup.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And I don't think it probably wasn't like Minestrone or anything that was chunky,

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 because it has to come out of a, like, a needle point.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 You're like starving to death. You're like, "Listen, man, just give me some broth."

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I know you keep trying to give me spaghetti. It was just not going to work.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And the nurse was like, "I want to keep trying. Let me get a bigger needle."

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 You're like, "No, no, no, not a bigger needle. Just give me broth."

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I read several news reports on this. None of them specified the type of soup I am curious as to what it was.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 But the nurse, as the daughter sitting there with her mom, the nurse has this syringe full of soup,

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 and she's supposed to put it into Ilda's feeding tube.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Well, what happens is the daughter sitting there with her mom, the nurse, has already left.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 The nurse has given her the soup, and Ilda starts to squirm.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 She's not, like, fully conversing, but she's squirming around like she's uncomfortable,

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 and she has this weird look on her face, and she begins to stick her tongue out.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 She totally alarms the daughter. She goes, "I had not seen her this sick since she originally had the stroke."

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Like, she was on this road to recovery, and now all of a sudden she's like, winging out in bed,

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 and she begins hitting herself. And she runs out and she gets the nurse.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 She's like, "Dude, something's wrong with my mom. Something's wrong with her mom."

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 She's sticking her tongue out and all this stuff. And the nurse comes in.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Sure enough, she's still squirming around. She's in pain.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 What happened was that the nurse, she had the syringe full of soup.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 She went to go put it in the feeding tube. She accidentally inserted it into Ilda's IV.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So the soup went straight into her bloodstream.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Within 12 hours, Ilda was dead. She passed away.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Doctors found out really quickly. All of a sudden you imagine the nurse was all, "Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs!"

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Good thing it wasn't SpaghettiOs. Why am I so fixated on what it was, this poor old woman?

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 The doctors realized that, yeah, you injected straight chicken broth into this woman's arm.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And her cause of death was pulmonary embolism, which is the veins in your lungs are blocked.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 They're blocked by something. She died 12 hours later.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And so the family's like, "So basically you're saying that you killed her.

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 You're saying that you killed her. You injected the soup into her veins and then she died 12 hours later,

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 because she had this embolism." And the doctors go, "We... this is 100% her. The doctors. The hospital goes,

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 'Let's kind of meet in the middle here.'" Yes, we did inject soup into your mother's veins.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 That part is correct. If we could get out of admitting to that, we would. Unfortunately, we can't.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 We did inject soup into your mother's veins. However, that's not what killed her.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 The family's like, "Oh, then what killed her?" And they go, "It was something blocking the veins in her lungs."

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And they're like, "Could it have been the soup? Do you think it's even possible that the fact that she injected broth into my mother's veins

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 could have been what killed her 12 hours later?" And the doctors are like, "No, it was completely non-soup related."

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 "Trust me, lady. I tasted her lungs myself. There was no chicken broth in them."

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 The hospital refused to take any blame for the fact that they killed this old lady. They totally killed her.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 The family eventually sued. And this is when it became new. So this happened back in September 27, 2012.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 What's interesting is they began the lawsuit almost immediately. It was like once they...

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 You know, you figured there might be a little bit of time in between, but once hospitals started seeing way enough of them to do this,

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 yeah, sure, we injected soup into your mom. They sued. And that's when it became a big story.

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Like, I think at first it was just kind of floating around, like, local. I don't even know if it was reported in local news.

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But once the lawsuit came out and all of these people were being named, that's when it started hitting the news.

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Now, what's funny is when I first came across this, I go, "This is totally fake. This is not true."

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Not that it couldn't happen. Not that you have hospital staff that is not well-trained or they're thinking about...

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 They're thinking about what they're going to eat for dinner. They're like, "Oh, this is making me hungry for soup."

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And they are distracted and they do it. Accidents happen.

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But I read this and I go, "This isn't real. This totally isn't real."

128
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I started digging around for it. And it's funny because this is going to kind of parallel what we're talking about in the second story.

129
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 I could have easily just covered, "Hey, this old woman got soup in her veins and then called it a day."

130
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 I spent a good 20, 30 minutes reading other articles about this because I go as...

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 I mean, listen, sympathies to the family despite all the laughing. I feel really bad for them.

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I'd be... I honestly would be pretty pissed off if someone, if my grandma died and then someone started laughing, is there a telling the story?

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But it depends on how funny her death was.

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But I go, "This isn't real. This is just some sort of fake news thing that's falling around."

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Because all the sources I'm finding on it are like Morning Zoo Radio News websites, quote, unquote, news websites like K-Rock 101 out of Philadelphia.

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 They're always running these zany news stories. The Huffington Post covered it.

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So that should tell you something. The Huffington Post either has great journalism or garbage journalism.

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 There's nothing in between. I'm reading all this stuff. I'm looking through all this stuff.

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I go, "This isn't real." And they all kept pointing back to a website called Hispanic...

140
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 HispanicallySpeakingNews.com. They kept pointing back to that.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I went on that. Now it's a gambling website. It redirects to a gambling/world cup slot machines website.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It's spam, right? It's junk. The junk site.

143
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So I was like, "Okay, yeah, I can't find this." Well, eventually I did find a news report.

144
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Like a straight up, "Here's reporters in the city interviewing people at the hospital interviewing what I can only assume are family members."

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I couldn't. I didn't speak the language.

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 But it was a legit... They were like showing screenshots of court documents in the case.

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And even though I don't speak Portuguese, they did say "soupa" a lot, which I'm only imagining is the word for "soup."

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So it does appear to be true. It does appear to be true. This poor old lady got soup injected into her.

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And again, even though I was able to verify that this does seem to be true, at least there was a nightly news report on it,

150
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I couldn't find whether or not they won the lawsuit. Because again, it was just like this crazy event that happened.

151
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Everyone talked... Not everyone. One of the New York Times wasn't running a piece on it.

152
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Fox News didn't interrupt the president's speech to talk about it.

153
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 You have just all of these Zany websites, Zany news websites pop up, talk about them, and wait.

154
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I can only assume that they won the court case. I can only assume any judge and any jury would be like,

155
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 "You injected her with soup?" Yes or no. And they're like, "Well, that's a complicated question. Technically we did, but it didn't kill her."

156
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I'm not asking that. Did you inject her with soup? And they're like, "Yeah, yeah."

157
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I'm pretty sure they won the lawsuit. It seems like a horrible way to go, too.

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Like having soup injected in your veins. I wonder if, when that happened, if the temperature of the soup would affect the pain level.

159
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I would imagine not. I don't know how many nerve endings you actually have in your veins.

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But if somebody injected hot soup, actually, I don't know anything about it. That would be way worse.

161
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It's all boiling hot verses. "Oh, here's soup that's been sitting out for a couple hours."

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You're like, "I'm sure either one will do. Here, I'll get a vein ready for you."

163
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I'm sure hot soup would burn your veins. It's weird to think like if you don't have nerve endings, you wouldn't feel the pain.

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So if you put it like your brain doesn't have nerve endings. I saw the animal.

165
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 I think it was the animal where the guy was eating his brain while he was still alive. Apparently the brain, based on a Hollywood movie,

166
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 the brain doesn't have any nerve endings. So you can beat up a brain and they'll just be sitting there.

167
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 They'll be like, "I don't feel anything." But what's weird is as you were punching their brain, as you were punching their brain,

168
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 they're losing the ability to speak. They wouldn't necessarily feel their brain, but you would feel the pressure of your body.

169
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Like you'd feel the shockwaves as I'm like punching your brain. So you'd feel something, but it wouldn't be pain.

170
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It would just be extreme discomfort and losing all of your memories.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So, yeah, I just think the human body is odd and it is not a receptacle for soup. I've learned that as well.

172
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Kara, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonarcopter we are leaving behind Brazil.

173
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 We hope that family got a lot of money. We hope at the very least the nurse got fired. But we also hope that the family got a lot of money.

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Kara, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonarcopter we are leaving behind Brazil. Fly us all the way out to Honolulu.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I'm trying to eat soup the whole time. I'm all, "I have these syringes in soup." I'm all, "Just sucking them."

176
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I'm like, "Man, this is a really effective way to eat soup." I'm just sucking on them. So fly that carbonarcopter nice and even.

177
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I don't want to pierce my lip.

178
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's February 24th, 1989. It's a little bit after 1 a.m. It's like 1.30 in the morning, something around there.

179
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 United Airlines Flight 811. It's a Boeing 747. Those are those big jets that are almost like double-decker.

180
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Where like the pilots have to climb up like a little ladder to get into the cockpit.

181
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 The guys are like, "Oh, I have cramps in my arm today. Can you fly? Can you fly? I'm just going to be at the bottom of this ladder."

182
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 They're like, "No. You got to get up here. You've got to use your cramped arms to fly this plane."

183
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 They're like, "Oh, I knew I should eat some bananas before I came to work."

184
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 They're leaving. It's one of those big giant jumbo jets. This is a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney.

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It has a layover in Honolulu, and that's where the plane has just departed from now.

186
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 17 minutes ago, it took off saying goodbye to the Hawaii Islands.

187
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And then it got the pilots up in the cockpit. They're flying the plane. Now there's a thunderstorm rolling in.

188
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 They've let people know, "Hey, listen, keep your seatbelts on. There's going to be some turbulence. We're going to try to fly away or underneath the plane."

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Or underneath the storm. Probably not underneath. It's all raining on them. They're like, "Ah, I know you can't fly through them.

190
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 You probably couldn't fly above it. But you know, they're letting people know, "No, there's going to be some turbulence. Keep your seatbelts on."

191
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 We're going to try to figure out what to do around this big storm rolling in.

192
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And pilots are flying the plane. And then all of a sudden, they hear a "boom."

193
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 But way louder. Way louder. Imagine that I wasn't in a closet and not trying to disturb my neighbors.

194
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Imagine the loudest noise. Imagine the noise. It's so loud you can hear it while you're flying a plane.

195
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 That's what they heard. They heard this huge thump, and the plane immediately shakes.

196
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Two pilots are looking at each other.

197
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And their immediate suspicion is a bomb has just gone off in the plane.

198
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And their fears are pretty much realized when they look, and they're starting to see that engines 3 and 4 are damaged.

199
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 They're flying this plane. The sky is dark. A thunderstorm is rolling in. And they've sustained massive damage.

200
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 They have no idea what the extent of the damage is. They know something's going on.

201
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They grab the intercom and the copepilot tries to call the stewardesses. The line's dead.

202
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 They can't get a hold of the stewardesses. They can't get a hold of the crew in the cabin of the plane.

203
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And they're like, "Okay, there has to be a bomb went off, and there must be a bunch of people dead down there."

204
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 So the pilot's flying, and he tells the copilot, he goes, "Hey, listen, I'm busy flying. Go check on that."

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 We've got to figure out what happened. I'll stay here with the safety of the cockpit.

206
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 You go and find out what in the world is going on down there. So the copilot climbs down the ladder,

207
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 and he almost immediately sees what's going on.

208
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 He's walking down this ladder, and he looks like, and I think he's looking out a window, and he sees just pieces of the plane has peeled off of the side.

209
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 He's like, "That's not good. Those planes are supposed to be inside out.

210
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 I'm going to keep crawling down this ladder and see if I can get a better look at what's going on."

211
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And he climbs down the ladder, and he takes a look, and he sees a massive hole in the side of the plane.

212
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 So first he was just like, "Oh, maybe they did a bad paint job." And it's like peeling off.

213
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Now he's able to see this huge hole. He just climbs back up the ladder. He doesn't even go any further.

214
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Doesn't check on anyone in the plane. He climbs back up the ladder and tells the pilot, "Yeah, a bomb went off."

215
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It's very clear that there is an explosion down there. We better land this plane.

216
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 But that's not what happened. That's not what happened.

217
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 What really happened, and the reason why they thought it was a bomb was, one, is that it looked like a bomb had gone off, but two.

218
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 This was two months after the Lockerbie bombing, which was a very famous, very tragic event where terrorists blew up a passenger jet,

219
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 and 270 people were just obliterated in the sky. It still considered the worst terror attack in the United Kingdom history.

220
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And there are worst aviation disaster ever. This is two months after that, so immediately they're like, "It must have been a bomb.

221
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 We must have been attacked by terrorists. Let's land this plane."

222
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 What really happened is far more mundane and actually a thousand times more terrifying.

223
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Let's switch perspectives. We're now sitting in the cabin of the plane.

224
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It's like 1.30 in the morning. You just left Honolulu. You're tired. You're super tired.

225
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 I'm sure you were having fun in Honolulu. You're like juggling fire. You're like, "You can't do that in the airport, bro."

226
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 You're like, "Oh man." You're back on the plane. You're headed to Sydney, and everyone's just kind of sitting there in their chairs.

227
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 The pilot comes over to the intercom and says, "Hey, everyone. Keep your seatbelts on. We're going to be hitting some pretty heavy turbulence.

228
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 We're going to try to get around this thunderstorm."

229
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 When all of a sudden one of the cargo doors near the front of the plane, one of the cargo doors on the front of the plane just ripped off.

230
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Everyone's just sitting on this plane and the cargo door rips off and it rips off with such force that it tears a massive hole on the right side of the plane.

231
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I mean, this hole had to have been, I don't know, 15, 20 feet tall, maybe by another 15 feet wide.

232
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It's just this entire chunk of the plane disappears in an instant.

233
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 This is in the passenger cabin.

234
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 One guy's account, he was there with his family.

235
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 They're sitting there. When the cargo door rips off, it tears this huge hole in the plane.

236
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 The first few rows, you know, this part was coming, the first few rows of passengers, they just slid out of the plane.

237
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Like, the explosion was so great, actually, implosion, was so massive that nine people sitting in their chairs seatbelts on, their chairs were ripped out of the plane and they tumbled into the night sky.

238
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 They were gone.

239
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 One woman, she goes, she just didn't seem real. It didn't seem real. I was sitting there and everything immediately went pitch black.

240
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Like, once you heard this noise, you heard this horrendous tearing of metal and then everything's pitch black and there's white, there's these tiny white pieces.

241
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 All of a sudden, thousands of them, they're filling the cabin.

242
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 She's just these little white things, which she goes, I'm guessing now, like looking back, it was probably insulation that was being pulled out and whipped around, but at the time, it was like a dream.

243
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 She's just sitting there. It's pitch black now, these things flying all around her and what she remembers is as she's sitting in this plane, her attention is drawn to the hole and she can't make sense of what's going on.

244
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Her attention is drawn to the hole in the plane and she looks out this hole and what she sees is the reflection of the moon in the dark ocean below.

245
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 At that point, the pilot calls over the loudspeaker and at this point, he doesn't know if anyone's alive back there, but he calls over the loudspeaker and he says, we're going to try to get back to Honolulu.

246
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And the woman who was sitting there, who was looking out and watching the moon in the black ocean below her, she said, I can tell by the sound of the voice and I can tell by the way he said it, he wasn't sure we were going to make it back.

247
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It wasn't like we're going back, we're going to try to get back to Honolulu.

248
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 So you're sitting there in this pitch black plane with this gaping hole in the side of it.

249
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And the pilots are trying to bring the plane down to the point where people can actually breathe, start to breathe again.

250
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 They're trying to bring the plane down very safely because when they saw the explosion, they had all of these other safety mechanisms on their plane that weren't working.

251
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 They're like, we're going to have to get rid of a bunch of our emergency strategies to land this plane. We just have to land this plane.

252
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Like our checklist isn't going to work. The plane was that badly damaged and it was just like a mechanical failure.

253
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Nine people get sucked out of the plane. They just disappear. They tumble out into the darkness.

254
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 What's amazing, these stories of survival that science and physics shouldn't allow.

255
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Fascinating. The father, the guy who was there with his family, he's getting the life vest for his kid, for his wife.

256
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 His wife was sitting there. They were all in this row. The woman his wife was sharing an armrest with, she's gone. She got sucked out.

257
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Imagine you're sitting in a plane and the person next to you is dead and you're just sitting there.

258
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 The white knuckling that must have gone on. But this dude, he's getting these life vests and they're assuming the crash position.

259
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Lean forward, kind of tuck your head in so when baggage is flying around, stuff like that, you don't get your neck crushed.

260
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 His daughter puts her head in the crash position. She looks down and there's a bloodied woman underneath the seat in front of her, holding on to the legs of the chair.

261
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And the family's looking at her and she is going to get sucked out of the hole.

262
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Like, she's heavily injured. She's holding on, but she's headed towards that hole. They said they could actually watch your body slowly start to get pulled.

263
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So the dad reaches down and he grabs her and he's holding on to this woman and he's bracing himself.

264
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And he is keeping a human from being sucked out of an airplane. The decompression is still...he shouldn't have been able to do it.

265
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 He shouldn't have been able to do it. She shouldn't have been able to hold on hard enough so that she doesn't get sucked out of an airplane.

266
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 That's not how physics works. And when they asked him, because there's been tons of interviews about this stuff, they asked, "How did you do that?"

267
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 "How are you able to hold someone in the plane?" His quote, "I don't know." Nobody does.

268
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Like, it shouldn't have been possible. He shouldn't have been able to keep her from getting sucked out, but somehow...it happened.

269
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 A Boeing 747 normally lands at about 170 miles an hour. This one was going 220. This one was going 50 miles an hour faster than they should.

270
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And the pilot, they landed this plane. They didn't even overshoot the runway. They said it was everyone off that plane as soon as possible.

271
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 It was like a record time to jumping out of a plane once it's landed.

272
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 He had a lot of minor injuries, but other than the nine people who were immediately blown out, there's no other fatalities.

273
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 There were rescue teams sent, because obviously they knew where this happened. They were able to retrieve parts of the plane.

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 They have to do all that stuff, like the cargo door that broke off. They have to get all this stuff so they can analyze what happened.

275
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 But they sent sea and air rescue teams to go find these people, and they weren't able to find any survivors, which I think they kind of knew going in.

276
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 But there's always hope. What they did find, though, as they were repairing the plane, inside engine number three, they found tiny bits of human remains.

277
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Engine number three and four, they were both damaged during the explosion. The debris was hitting them.

278
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And investigators believe that one or more of these people, when they were blown out of the plane, they immediately were then sucked into the engine.

279
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Chopped up.

280
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 It's a fascinating story. I never heard anything about this. It's an air disaster where you had a bunch of survivors and a bunch of witnesses, and you're seeing what it was like through their eyes.

281
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And what's interesting, there was -- doesn't really seem to be -- there was much panic at first, because it happened so quickly.

282
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Even the father, he goes, all of a sudden the cabin was just filled with what seemed to be a thousand moths floating all around me.

283
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 It was the insulation that the other woman had noticed. But it was so surreal.

284
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Didn't make sense.

285
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 The way I found out about this story, though, wasn't just by looking up airplane crashes on Wikipedia, which I've been known to do.

286
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 There was a post on the export a couple days ago talking about the ghosts of Flight 811.

287
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I was like, "Oh, this is cool." And the way that I work is I'll read something, then I go, "How true is this?"

288
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I do this with pretty much everything we do. Find the most random ghost stories and I'll go, "Oh, I want to see if there's any truth to this.

289
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I want to see if this place is actually haunted, or if the history is correct or anything like that."

290
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Flight 811, the story that I basically described to you, is what he put in this post.

291
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And then he said, "What happened after that was no engineering crew wanted to go near this plane.

292
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 No one wanted to work on it. They figured it was cursed."

293
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 So what happened was a repair crew from the Vatican, there's an airline repair crew that the Vatican trains,

294
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 and a bishop came out to bless the plane.

295
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 They came out and repaired it, blessed it, and then the bishop himself had dozens of roses inserted into the inner walls of the engine.

296
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It was like a protection.

297
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And also, you know, remembrance to the dead.

298
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 The plane was put back into service, flew normally for years and years and years, and then eventually an engineer at United Airlines was working on the plane.

299
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 He's like, "This is so dumb. I don't want to work on the Rose plane again. I have to go in there. It's always smelling like roses."

300
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 So he decides to remove the roses from the engine compartment.

301
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 He's like, "Roses, Schmoses, Bishop, Bishop, I don't believe in any of this stuff. I'm going to take these roses home, give them my sweetheart."

302
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 So look, I love you so much. I brought you all these dead roses.

303
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He takes the roses out of the engine compartment and it's like, "I'm taking these home guys. I'm getting rid of these. This is dumb."

304
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 And he throws them in his car and then he leaves.

305
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 He's like, "I'm quitting too, by the way. My entire career here was just to get these roses. You suck, United Airlines."

306
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 He throws the roses in his car and he leaves work.

307
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Then is involved in a fatal car crash.

308
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 [crashing sound]

309
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Nothing. I can't believe I told that whole airline story and didn't do any special effects.

310
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 It didn't even dawn on me, but I do the car crash.

311
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Real imaginative, Jason. That segment would have been ten minutes longer.

312
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Anyways, car crash, guy dies, and when the ambulance crew goes to help him, his dead body is covered in roses.

313
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Like, through the impact of the car crash, they fall all over him.

314
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 So his dead body's in the roses.

315
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And then after that, the very next flight of this plane, they changed the number of the plane.

316
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 It was no longer...what was the original number?

317
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It's original registration number, 94713U.

318
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 They did end up changing the number at some point.

319
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 They changed the registration number, is the term for it.

320
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 After the roses were removed, the very next flight, the plane was up in the air and it hit turbulence.

321
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 It hit really, really bad turbulence.

322
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And all the people seated in the rose, really the nine seats that got sucked out of the plane,

323
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 everyone who was seated in one of those seats, the turbulence was so bad, they all bounced up at the same time

324
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 and snapped their necks on the roof.

325
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Like, the turbulence was that bad, the plane dropped, they went "Wooahhh!"

326
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 *cough*

327
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 from the necks.

328
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 After that, the plane was scrapped.

329
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 The plane was straight up considered cursed.

330
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And...they scrapped it.

331
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 The post ends with them saying, "The whole story is hardly ever published outside of the blogs of United Airline Workers."

332
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 And the fact that it was the same plane never gets mentioned in news reports.

333
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 So that was really my starting point.

334
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 I started looking up Flight 811, found that terrifying story.

335
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 But it's interesting because reading it out loud, I realized how stupid that ghost story was.

336
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And when I first read it, I was like, "Wow! I wonder if this is true?"

337
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 You know, I do the reading in my head, so I don't realize how foolish some of the stuff is.

338
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 I don't know...well, let's put it this way.

339
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 I couldn't find whether or not there is a crew of Vatican technicians.

340
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 You're like Jason, that should have been your first red flag.

341
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 I don't know if there's a group of Vatican technicians that travel the world blessing planes.

342
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I wouldn't be surprised if there was.

343
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 But the rest of the story we know isn't true.

344
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 There's actually a pretty good history of...we know exactly what happened to this plane afterwards.

345
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 It did fly. They did repair it.

346
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 They flew it a lot. It started having issues.

347
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 I mean, again, the plane did kill nine people.

348
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 But it started having wear and tear on it.

349
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Eventually, they sold it to a new...

350
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 There was actually a great write-up in this website called airscapemag.com, which traced what happened to this plane,

351
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 like from it being built to it was eventually scrapped in the early 2000s.

352
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 It was sold to an airline company called Air Dabia.

353
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 It was an airline for the Islamic Republic of Gambia that was started by...

354
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 They basically started by this guy and people go, "Where'd you get your money?"

355
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And he goes, "A little bit here, a little bit there, you know, imports, exports."

356
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And they're like, "You're an arms dealer. You're an arms dealer and we know you're subliming these African nations with a bunch of weapons."

357
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 He's like, "What? Who? Me?" He did get arrested for trying to smuggle in two Huey attack helicopters.

358
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 It was started by this from a legend arms dealer.

359
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And it basically was run into the ground.

360
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 They would load up 800 people onto a plane with 400 seats and the staff.

361
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 The people working on the plane, they were constantly quitting.

362
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 They'd go, "This isn't safe, this isn't safe."

363
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Air Dabia eventually shut down and the plane ended up in New York at Plattsburgh International Airport, where they scrapped it for parts.

364
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 It's an interesting story. The ghost story is what sent me off on it.

365
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 So there's no one got their neck snapped.

366
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 I started... Well, people do get their neck snapped on airplanes.

367
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 I did find a couple of stories like that where there is turbulence and somebody breaks their neck.

368
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 That does happen.

369
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But not nine people in one flight.

370
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 It was really interesting. He goes, "They only talk about this on United Airlines worker blogs."

371
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Who has access to those, right? That's a pretty clever way.

372
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 I don't know if this guy made up the story or he had heard the story, but the ghost part of it is not true.

373
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 We do know what happened to this plane after the fact.

374
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And the truth is actually more interesting than the fiction.

375
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 But I want to end it like this.

376
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 I want to end it like this.

377
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 As I was thinking about this story as I was prepping my notes,

378
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 we've covered Haunted Aircraft before and they've also been debunked.

379
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Like the very famous one about the plane that crashed in the Everglades and then

380
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 they took the microwave out of the wreckage and put it in another, or it was an oven.

381
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 They took it out of the air. The airplane did crash in the Everglades

382
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 and a bunch of people got eaten by crocodiles in the wreckage.

383
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And then they salvaged the plane and then pieced it out to this other plane

384
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 and they said, "You can see a ghost in the oven or there would be like a ghost

385
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 constantly giving you tips on how to keep up the jet."

386
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 All of that stuff has been debunked. That was an early episode of Dead Ravirity.

387
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 I was actually disappointed.

388
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 That was one of my favorite ghost stories and the fact that it was pretty easily debunked.

389
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 I was like, "Aww, I'll put that episode in the show notes."

390
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 We have stole... Really what I'm getting at is plane crashes happen, people die.

391
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And they do recycle the parts. Like this one was scrapped

392
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 and maybe some of the parts went on other planes.

393
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Maybe this stuff was turned into other pieces of metal.

394
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 But you didn't have these people die. You have people die in plane crashes.

395
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 You have people die in cars.

396
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 But very rarely... This is so interesting to me.

397
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Very rarely do we have accounts of haunted cars and haunted planes.

398
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 We have sightings of ghosts of planes at museums.

399
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 But... I mean, most plane crashes, there's nothing to recover.

400
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 So you could argue that.

401
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 But this plane we did have this tragic event happen. There were no ghost sightings on the plane.

402
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 There are a lot of cars where people die in the car accident where their car is salvageable.

403
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Or you can definitely take the parts out of it and put it in other cars.

404
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 But we ve... I can't think of a time outside of like a Phantom Hitchhiker type of story.

405
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Or that story we covered about the haunted Hello Kitty doll that was at an auto wreckage yard.

406
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 When the story went there was a young woman who got the Hello Kitty doll for her birthday.

407
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And she was driving around and she was killed.

408
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And someone stole the... her car was just taken to the wrecker.

409
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 The Hello Kitty doll was still in the back seat. Some guy steals the Hello Kitty doll.

410
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 That was an interesting story. They took it home. They apparently were haunted by it.

411
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 And there's video footage of someone breaking in or just reaching in and pulling the Hello Kitty doll out.

412
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 And a couple hours later you see him dropping it back off through the surveillance footage.

413
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 We don't have many accounts. None that I can really think of.

414
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 There might be one or two of... that I just don't pop them ahead.

415
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Of moving vehicles that are haunted.

416
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Boats though.

417
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 There's a lot of accounts of ghosts on boats.

418
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 But not ghosts on airplanes and cars. And I wonder, you know, we talk about the science of the paranormal.

419
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 I... and I kind of think I've made jokes about this in the past.

420
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 I wonder if a car and a plane go too fast for a ghost to manifest in.

421
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Like, is there an answer to it?

422
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Is there a logical answer to why we don't have...

423
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 I think we don't have a lot of haunted planes because I think the planes explode on impact.

424
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 I think most planes, when they do become inoperable.

425
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 When they crash. I think the only reason they put so much work into getting this guy back in the air.

426
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Because it was a Boeing 747. It was like a top of the line plane.

427
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 So they're like, okay, I mean, we'll die but let's get it working.

428
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 They weren't going to scrap it right away. It wasn't some puddle jumper that, you know, someone got sucked out of.

429
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 I wonder if there's a reason ghosts can't materialize at a certain speed.

430
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Which would make sense.

431
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Here's a question. It does water freeze slower if you're riding a motorcycle?

432
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 If you have a serious question, if you have a glass of water and it's below freezing outside

433
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 and you're zooming down the road, the road's all icy, you're like, I'm doing science for Jason.

434
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 You're having all these accidents. You're the ghost now.

435
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Let's say there's a bucket of water safely strapped to the back of the motorcycle.

436
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 It's below freezing outside. You're riding your motorcycle.

437
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 You're no helmet, no helmet because you're a daredevil. You're a real man.

438
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 You're driving your motorcycle down the road. I give the worst advice.

439
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 You're driving the motorcycle down the road. Would the water freeze quicker than if I just took a bucket of water?

440
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 I see you coming. I throw it on the road. You're like, Jason, I thought we were friends.

441
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 I'm like, science has no friends.

442
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Basically, I wonder. I mean, I do have the internet in front of me.

443
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I didn't plan to go off on this segment. I didn't plan to kill you at the end of the episode.

444
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 I'll look it up later, but I am curious, does water freeze quicker if it's still as opposed to it moving?

445
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 I wonder if that would be the same thing with a ghost.

446
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 A ghost can manifest on a boat because it's moving fairly slowly.

447
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 But it could manifest in a 747 because as it's trying to, it's like three miles away.

448
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 It's like, yes, I've manifested legs. Ah! Falling into the ocean.

449
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 It's an interesting question. The world of paranormal is full of these types of questions.

450
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 And even though this story turned out not to be real, it really did make me think, why wasn't it real?

451
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Why didn't those people get their necks snapped? Ah, they should have all been paralyzed.

452
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 You know, it's like in the world of paranormal, it's definitely possible, but in the broader world of what we look at,

453
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 where the paranormal does not sit outside of science, it walks hand in hand with it.

454
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 We do have to ask these questions. Can a ghost not manifest at a certain speed?

455
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. I don't think anyone who claims to know the answer to that is probably making something up.

456
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 But I would say based on the evidence, or the lack of evidence, I would say there might be a complication there.

457
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 It might be that planes and cars go too fast.

458
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 We do have a story of the Phantom Hitchhiker. She's on the side of the road. And that's what's so interesting.

459
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 We have stories of haunted roads, haunted bridges, but where the ghost is in the car all the time.

460
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 It's a normal car, but the ghost is in the car. Not just getting in and you take her back to the house and she's like, she's been dead for 30 years.

461
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Me too. I'm a ghost too. Boo. He comes after you.

462
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 He's like, give me a ride to the casino, young man. And then to the liquor store, you're like, oh, you have to show for this ghost around everywhere.

463
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 It's fascinating. I love the world of paranormal. I absolutely love it. And this is one of those things.

464
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 I found this story on X and while I was trying to research that, I came across this absolutely terrifying plane accident.

465
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 And as I was talking about this story with Sabine and when I mentioned the people getting sucked into the engine, she goes, well, I mean, would you rather go out quickly?

466
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 I thought, you know what, actually, no, I would rather tumble through the night sky.

467
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Like I would rather, like this is my last moments on Earth.

468
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 I see later suckers as they're getting sucked into the engine. I'm like, you losers. And I'm just like tumbling through the night sky over Honolulu.

469
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Watching the reflection of the moon grow closer and closer. Like there's something almost poetic about that death.

470
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 My choice, I wouldn't be blown out of an airplane at all.

471
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 But I, you know, I probably would prefer I'm all go on to see dancing with Sebastian.

472
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 I'm all kissing the little mermaid. You're like, okay, now you clearly have lost all oxygen to your brain. You're dying. You're disillusioning this.

473
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 I'm like, no, no, this is all true. I'm playing flounder like a little flute.

474
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 I'm feeding the chunks of the people who went through the jet engine. I'm feeding them to some shark. I'm like, here you go, buddy.

475
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Oxygen deprivation or not. Still a fascinating story.

476
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 Opens up a ton of questions about can ghost manifest at a high rate of speed.

477
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 I love doing this show because I never would have thought about that. I never would have even considered that.

478
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Had I not been doing this show, so I guys, I really do appreciate all the support and thanks for listening.

479
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 Hey, this shows we're coming up to episode 1000.

480
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 I mean, that's I say that's amazing, but that's not just this isn't just mine. Right? This is ours.

481
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 Like, it wouldn't be anything if people weren't interacting with it, listening to it and loving it.

482
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 So what an awesome journey. It's been so far and we're just getting started.
