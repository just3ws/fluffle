1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 You can search the anals of film history, but you will never find a copy of this movie.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,800
 Then we travel to Columbia to take a bus ride with a bunch of other people in 1976.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,900
 Little do we know who are about to become under assault.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,300
 And then we take a look at a time when a police officer walked up to a man.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,500
 He looked disturbed. He looked on edge.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,800
 And the police officer asked, "Have you taken anything?"

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,400
 The man looks up and says, "Lives."

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,100
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:39,800
 [Music]

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,100
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,500
 You can obviously tell I sound a lot better.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
 I feel a lot better.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,600
 I think I actually am slightly allergic to alcohol.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
 Apparently that's a thing.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,700
 Because I got sick.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,700
 I didn't go to bed till like four in the morning and I slept for maybe two hours.

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,000
 It was awful. I had my tummy hurt.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,300
 My little baby tummy.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,900
 My mama came over to burp me.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,900
 That didn't help.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,200
 My little tummy hurt.

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,900
 It didn't help that I ate a ton of food either.

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,900
 So I mean, it was my fault that I got sick.

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,400
 But just thinking about alcohol.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,100
 So I think I might actually be allergic to alcohol.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,200
 Or I combined red wine, hard cider and steel reserve.

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
 The most whinoe of all beers.

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
 But steel reserve is pretty good.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,500
 I only drink three times a year.

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,400
 That was the one.

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,100
 I'm not going to drink two more times before December 31st.

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,600
 But I am going to welcome one of our legacy Patreons right now.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 Natty the Nat.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,500
 Natty the Nat.

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,400
 Little bug flying around.

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,500
 Lands on my shoulder.

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,600
 Shake a little hand there.

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,200
 Little probiscous or whatever it is.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
 I hope that's what I'm shaking.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,700
 Natty, you are going to be our captain.

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,100
 You're going to be our pilot this episode.

44
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,600
 If you can't support the Patreon, totally understand.

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,100
 Just help spread the word about the show.

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,500
 Really, really helps out a lot.

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,400
 So Natty the Nat.

48
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,900
 Let's go ahead and hop in that Jason Delappi.

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,700
 We're going to drive off to a place many people never thought existed.

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,200
 No, it's not a Safe Street corner in New York City.

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,700
 This is a film set.

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,500
 We walk in.

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,100
 You're like, Jason, film sets exist.

54
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,900
 Why did you do that dramatic pause?

55
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,100
 We walk into this film set.

56
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,700
 And you very quickly realize, one, this episode is not appropriate for kids.

57
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,000
 Two, I mispronounced "anals" on purpose.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,700
 And three, this is a porn set.

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,200
 This is a live porn set and the director's like, "Action."

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,900
 We see this girl sitting there and you're like, "Jason, seriously?"

61
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,700
 I'm like, "No, no, no.

62
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,700
 This is going to get weird."

63
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,900
 They're not going to fall in quicksand weird.

64
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,500
 But just wait.

65
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,300
 So there's this girl.

66
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,500
 She's wearing a pink ball gown dress.

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,100
 She's sitting on a bed.

68
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,800
 And in walks, Mario from Mario Brothers.

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,700
 And you're like, "What?"

70
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,300
 And I'm like, "Hold on.

71
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,600
 Hold on.

72
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,300
 He gets weirder."

73
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,200
 So Mario walks in.

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,900
 He goes, "Hey, it's a me.

75
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,700
 Horneo."

76
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,300
 That's his name in this for, I guess that's kind of a good pun.

77
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,800
 His full name is Squeegee Horneo.

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,100
 I don't know where they got the Squeegee.

79
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,600
 You would think that Squeegee would be Luigi.

80
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,300
 No, Luigi's name is Horneo Horneo.

81
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,400
 So they're not really close to the source material here, guys.

82
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,100
 And they walk in and they start banging.

83
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,900
 You assumed Princess Peach.

84
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,300
 This is Princess Perlina.

85
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,700
 I don't think you really need a sex name with Princess.

86
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,800
 That is a sex name.

87
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,600
 That is a porn name.

88
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
 Anyway, so they're banging this chick.

89
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 And then you hear, "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

90
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,800
 And in walks, King Pupa?

91
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
 No, this one's actually kind of clever.

92
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,300
 It's King Pupa.

93
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,900
 So I mean, they're close, right?

94
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,700
 And King Pupa walks in and he's like, "No, it's my turn to banger."

95
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
 They all start having sex with this chick.

96
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,100
 And this kind of just goes on and on and on until eventually the movie ends.

97
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,900
 Now, this was a real porn movie.

98
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,400
 It was called Super Horneo Brothers and it was filmed in 1993.

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,800
 But what's funny, other than that whole setup, is it wasn't lost media.

100
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,400
 People didn't even think it existed.

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,600
 Like with lost media, they'll go, "Well, I know there was that show on Nickelodeon called, like, Crybaby Lane."

102
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,300
 And I remember seeing commercials for it, but I've never found it since.

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,100
 And people start scouring the internet and they find the guy who directed it and all that stuff.

104
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,400
 No one even knew this movie existed until screen, like, really, really late in the game.

105
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,700
 Someone was posting screenshots of Ron Jeremy dressed up as Mario.

106
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,400
 And they're like, "What? What movie is this from?"

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,100
 And no one could ever figure it out.

108
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,000
 People are like, "Was this like a costume party or something like that?"

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 No, what happened was they shot this movie called Super Horneo Brothers.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,600
 It was filmed in 1993, so that would have been around the time of the Super Mario Brothers movie.

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
 And they even had a sequel.

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,700
 So the setup is, if it needs a plot, King Pupa wants to get into our world.

113
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,000
 And in the movie, he had to get a crystal, I think.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
 Dennis Hopper was trying to steal this crystal bolt.

115
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,900
 He was like, "Can I smoke it? Can I crush it? Can I snort it?"

116
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
 "It'll just take you to another world."

117
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,800
 You can blow up the World Trade Center, though, and he's like, "I'll do that. That was weird."

118
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,400
 I mean, as a kid, you're just like, "Whoa, I remember really liking that movie as a kid."

119
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,700
 Because I was an idiot, right? All children are idiots.

120
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,400
 And let me diverge real quick here.

121
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,200
 I did this once on accident. I watched Super Mario Brothers, the movie.

122
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,400
 And then probably about six hours later, I watched Tron Legacy.

123
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,900
 It's the exact same film.

124
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,200
 The exact same film.

125
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,100
 They even, like, the guy gets stuck into the computer, obviously.

126
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,900
 But even plot points, like he outruns in both movies.

127
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,100
 They get away from the bad guys because they go to the outlands.

128
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,000
 But they have all these same plot points.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And in the whole movie is about the guy trying to get into the real world,

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
 and they're fighting over this MacGuffin to do it.

131
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,400
 It's the same movie. Tron Legacy is much better, even though it's the same plot.

132
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,100
 But Super Hornier Brothers.

133
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,700
 This is what I was supposed to talk about. It's not a movie podcast.

134
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,900
 Super Hornier Brothers.

135
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,300
 So in the movie, Dennis Hopper wants to crush up this giant crystal and snort it.

136
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,200
 And then he'll go into our world and he'll blow up the World Trade Center.

137
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,800
 That actually happened in the movie.

138
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
 And in real life, unfortunately.

139
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,200
 He doesn't need a crystal.

140
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,300
 He doesn't need a data disk from Flynn.

141
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,100
 He needs a bathtub full of semen.

142
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
 So that's where we're going with this, right?

143
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,600
 That's where we're going with this.

144
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,500
 There's a bathtub full of semen and he's either going to use it to power some sort of machine,

145
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,800
 or I would assume he would jump into it because it's a point set, right?

146
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
 You're not going to have a bathtub full of semen unless he gets on someone.

147
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,900
 But he falls into it and melts.

148
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,500
 And that's the end of the first movie.

149
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,900
 There's two of these.

150
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,200
 Then there's Super Hornier Brothers 2.

151
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,700
 Everyone comes to the real world.

152
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,600
 So King Pupa was actually like successful.

153
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
 He like re-digitizes.

154
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,400
 He re-spermitizes in our world.

155
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,700
 And he wants to have kids.

156
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,000
 So how do you find kids?

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
 How do you find love in New York City?

158
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
 Go find Prostitute.

159
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
 And that's pretty much that plot point.

160
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,300
 And then a PC computer blows up.

161
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,500
 A big old CRT monitor blows up.

162
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,400
 And he gets sucked into limbo.

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,000
 Originally-- So really it's two movies that are missing.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,100
 Originally it was one long movie.

165
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,800
 And it's funny because this is how the porn industry works.

166
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
 This is so funny.

167
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,100
 I was reading this quote.

168
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,800
 I got a lot of this information.

169
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,300
 Kotaku did a really good article on this.

170
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,600
 The Long Hard Search for the Infamous Mario porn.

171
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
 And in this article, here's this quote.

172
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,600
 The director, Buck Adams, was asked by Midnight Video to trim the 37-page script.

173
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,100
 That's all they had. That's all you need.

174
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,800
 Buck Adams was asked by Midnight Video to trim the 37-page script.

175
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
 Split the film into two.

176
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,900
 So that's where there's two of them.

177
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,200
 They took 37 pages.

178
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
 So each movie is now what?

179
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,900
 Only 18 pages long.

180
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,700
 Split the film in two.

181
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,900
 And he had a shooting schedule.

182
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,300
 And the studio's like, "No way.

183
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,400
 You expect us to shell out that much money for a three-day shoot?"

184
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,200
 And he's like, "Come on, man.

185
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
 This is my magnum opus.

186
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
 This is going to be my Dunkirk."

187
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,300
 And they go, "We don't know what that is.

188
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,100
 This is back in 1993."

189
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,600
 As far as they know, he's talking about rescuing a bunch of British people from the beach.

190
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,400
 But he just kind of shakes his head and they go, "No.

191
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
 Three days for a porn movie.

192
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,100
 For two porn movies at this point, that's impossible.

193
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,700
 We will let you shoot these two movies now if you shoot them in two days."

194
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,200
 So he shot two porn movies in two days.

195
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
 Got it. He's feverishly up all night.

196
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,100
 He's writing scripts.

197
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,000
 He's writing. He's like, "Oh, yeah.

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
 This scene's really good."

199
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
 Then he has to take like a 15-minute break.

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,900
 He's smoking a cigarette.

201
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,600
 He starts writing again.

202
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,100
 He's like, "Oh, yeah.

203
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,800
 This scene's really good."

204
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
 Takes a 15-minute break.

205
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
 Goes on and on and on.

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,900
 He writes the movie.

207
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,800
 I don't know if he wrote the movie.

208
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
 I don't know if there was actually a script.

209
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,300
 Obviously, there's 37 pages of just moaning noises.

210
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,100
 The movie is envisioned.

211
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
 The movie is directed.

212
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,400
 The movie is cast.

213
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,300
 The movie is made.

214
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,100
 And Nintendo bought the rights to it right off the bat.

215
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,500
 And it's sealed in a Nintendo vault, if not outright destroyed at this point.

216
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,800
 And it will never come out now with Ron Jeremy facing all of the sexual assault charges.

217
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,400
 Like, there was a time when people thought it may come out.

218
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,900
 But Nintendo is very, very particular about their film license.

219
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,400
 Because Super Mario Bros., not even the porn, that movie was so bad,

220
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,800
 they're like, "We're never doing another movie.

221
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,100
 That's why there's no Zelda movie or Metroid movie or anything like that."

222
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,100
 The movie was so bad, they will not do any other movies.

223
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,200
 And so when this came out, you know, the porn industry is like,

224
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,900
 "Oh, we can kind of get away with stuff."

225
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,800
 Nintendo was like, "Nope, they bought it."

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 But there was always a possibility that at some point it may get released or may get leaked.

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,800
 But right now, this story by Kotaku is quite a few years old.

228
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,400
 Right now, there's really no interest in digging it up.

229
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,300
 In full.

230
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,400
 The reason why we know the plot details that we do

231
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,700
 is because for a limited time, you could have bought it at your adult store.

232
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,400
 But people would buy porn, watch it a couple times,

233
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
 and then junk it, make room for other things on your shelf.

234
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 Or when you moved from VHS to DVD, you got rid of all that stuff.

235
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
 People would go, "Oh, I remember seeing that."

236
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,100
 Someone, I think, has a edited copy of the second one.

237
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,200
 Like, they have part of the second one, and they've been able to piece stuff together

238
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
 through like interviews with cast members.

239
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,300
 Ron Jeremy was like, "Oh, yeah, here, I'll talk to you about that."

240
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,700
 The cops are getting ready to break in his door.

241
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
 He's like, "Let me hurry up and tell you. Let me hurry up and tell you."

242
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
 Isn't that awful?

243
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,300
 That's so awful. I mean, it's like, he's up to like 40 charges or something like that.

244
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,600
 40 sexual assault charges.

245
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,400
 But anyway, so there's really no interest now in really discovering the movie

246
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,800
 because in the end, there's just this big old pervert running around,

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,900
 getting paid to be a pervert on the movie set.

248
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,900
 But it is a lost film, and it's one of the rare ones that people didn't even know existed.

249
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,300
 No one was looking for it until a picture of a big old gross dude appeared online just as Mario.

250
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
 Natty the Nat, let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Robo.

251
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,900
 We're going to leave behind this disgusting ICU.

252
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,500
 Not Natty the Nat. Natty the Nat's fine.

253
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,400
 You, listener, listen to the show right now.

254
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
 I see you inching closer to that bathtub.

255
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
 Don't, don't.

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,900
 And you're like, "Come on, I want a souvenir for just this one story."

257
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,400
 "All those stories you've been on, this is the one I want a souvenir from."

258
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,600
 You have a ladle. I'm like, "Don't, don't, dude."

259
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,500
 Me and Natty turn around. We're going to the rowboat.

260
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 You're all, "Hehehehe, you brought a Ziploc bag specifically for this episode."

261
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,300
 We are now in the Dead Rabbit Rowboat.

262
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,400
 It oddly smells like oleander trees.

263
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,700
 I can't really figure out why.

264
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
 We are, this is a disgusting episode.

265
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,200
 We are headed out.

266
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
 We are rowing out to Columbia.

267
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,300
 The year is 1976.

268
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,800
 It's summertime and it's a nice sunny day in Santander, Columbia.

269
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,100
 There's a bus, an old rickety bus.

270
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,600
 [Rickety Buzzing]

271
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
 Smells like a bunch of dirt bikes.

272
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,300
 There's actually four dirt bikes tied to this bus and there's people riding them.

273
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,500
 There's this old rickety bus that's going up this really isolated road.

274
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,400
 It's like lots of twists and turns, it's all wooded and stuff like that.

275
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
 It's another place you want to hang out.

276
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,400
 But you got to go through it.

277
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,300
 You want to get to the other side of this mountain, right?

278
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,300
 So, "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

279
00:11:48,300 --> 00:12:05,700
 So you're driving this bus and it's full of people.

280
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,100
 And as the bus is starting to make this turn, someone looks out the side and they go, "What

281
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,900
 in the world is that?"

282
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,500
 And they see a little tiny dude in the bushes.

283
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 Just looking at him.

284
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 He has a grin.

285
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,900
 [Rickety Buzzing]

286
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
 Like what?

287
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
 That's weird.

288
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,640
 I even heard him laugh over the sound of those dirt bikes.

289
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,340
 And other people are now crowding that side of the bus and they look and they see 20 dwarves

290
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,700
 hiding in the bushes.

291
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,500
 [Rickety Buzzing]

292
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 Laughing everywhere and they're like, "Oh, that's really good sound effects."

293
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,400
 While they're taking in the idea of 20 dwarves in the middle of nowhere on the side of the

294
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,380
 road hiding in the bushes while they're still trying to process that, some of them run out

295
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
 of the bushes.

296
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
 [Rickety Buzzing]

297
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,940
 A couple of them run out of the bushes, they go to the back of the bus and people are like,

298
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
 "Oh, that's not good."

299
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,860
 And all of a sudden the bus starts to slow down.

300
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,340
 [Rickety Buzzing]

301
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,580
 They look out the back window and the dwarves are actually so strong there's a couple of

302
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
 them.

303
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,740
 They're holding on to the back of the bus and they're stopping it.

304
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,220
 You already had a hard time getting up this mountain pass anyways, but you know, you got

305
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,540
 a couple dwarves holding on to it.

306
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
 You're not going nowhere.

307
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,480
 Then, after the bus has been completely stopped, the remaining dwarves rush out of the bushes.

308
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,200
 They put their little hands on the side of the bus and they start going, "Ugh, ugh, ugh,

309
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,840
 ugh, ugh."

310
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,080
 They start rocking the bus back and forth.

311
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,360
 Everyone on the bus is kind of stuck at this point because your choices are this.

312
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,280
 First off, don't have a heart attack because you're seeing something that shouldn't happen.

313
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
 It's super paranormal.

314
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,620
 One, other than not having a heart attack, one, stay on the bus.

315
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,620
 They're going to flip it over and then you're kind of boned, right?

316
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,740
 Or get off the bus and they'll flip it over and you won't get flipped over in the bus.

317
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,560
 However, you are now standing on a mountain pass surrounded by 20 dwarves.

318
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,620
 So everyone just stays on the bus because that's the smarter thing.

319
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,660
 You can tank a rolling bus better than you can tank 40 little punches on you.

320
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,200
 And they actually just tip the bus, they do tip the bus, these guys, successfully tip

321
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,480
 the bus over and it falls into a ditch.

322
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,640
 And as people are like, "Ugh," and they like fall around in the bus, they can't see anything

323
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
 now.

324
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,880
 They hear these dudes busting up a laughter.

325
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 They're having a ball.

326
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,220
 They thought this was like the funniest thing they've done in this millennia.

327
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,480
 They're laughing so hard.

328
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,760
 And people are now kind of scrambling up and they can see out the window again and they

329
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,620
 say, they were all laughing, they're all giggling and then as if something called them, they

330
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,500
 go, they all immediately turned and walked back into the forest.

331
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,380
 At this point, people are getting out of the bus, they're trying to figure out how to get

332
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,100
 it back because they're in the middle of nowhere.

333
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,020
 They have to take care of it themselves.

334
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,540
 And people are kind of looking in the woods, probably not going off too far.

335
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,380
 They're probably looking and they see like 30 dwarves in there, 30 more with spears and

336
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,020
 some guys like, "Oh, I don't see them.

337
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,100
 I don't see them anymore."

338
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,300
 But they said they never found them again.

339
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,720
 It's funny because it's a story that has a ton of witnesses.

340
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
 We don't have the exact day.

341
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,000
 We don't have a lot of the stuff.

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,640
 I got this from thinkaboutadocs.com.

343
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,840
 We don't have a lot of the information that I really like to make it a specific story

344
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,480
 to make it super believable.

345
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,320
 Think about it, docs.com got it from Salvador Friesteo and he wrote a book called Lost Contactados,

346
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,000
 which means the contacted alien paranormal stuff, things like that, or the contactors

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 maybe.

348
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,040
 It's interesting because there's a ton of witnesses to see it.

349
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,340
 There's physical damage down to the bus, but we also always have those stories of ghastly

350
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,460
 hands that take control of your steering wheel in Britain.

351
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,260
 That's a real famous ghost story, or ghosts that cause car accidents.

352
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,020
 People sometimes use them to describe bizarre accidents in a certain area.

353
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,700
 It's probably not true.

354
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,060
 The hairy hands of Britain, I did an episode on a long time ago, a car's driving on the

355
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,380
 street.

356
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,860
 These hands appear and they grab your wheel and they start shaking it.

357
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,560
 That road is actually a concave.

358
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,640
 It doesn't look like it, but it's actually a really perilous piece of road.

359
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,120
 It's possible that the car is going off and then people are bumping their heads or just

360
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,600
 making it up, telling their insurance company, "Oh no, no, no, I swear to God, I was a good

361
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 driver."

362
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,840
 The hairy hands showed up and then insurance agents are like, "Oh, not the hairy hands again."

363
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
 It could be something like that.

364
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,160
 It could be something they're using to explain it away, but it's also possible.

365
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,400
 You've got to look at it on the inverse.

366
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,540
 When we see these car crashes, these accidents, these stretches of road that people say, "This

367
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,340
 is the most dangerous stretch of road in India.

368
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,980
 This is the most dangerous stretch of road in America."

369
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
 What have you?

370
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,500
 People go high fatalities, road rage, stuff like that.

371
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,340
 Why can't we add in, because we already believe in the paranormal, that these things are interfering

372
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,620
 with our daily lives like that?

373
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,820
 You have to wonder the next time you hear a news report.

374
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,020
 In God willing, we never hear another one of these again, but every so often you'll hear

375
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,400
 a news report about a train derailing or a bus plummeting off a cliff.

376
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,040
 Could be a technical error.

377
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,380
 Could be operator error.

378
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,560
 But it could be something that the world of the paranormal does on purpose.

379
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,460
 And they may do it simply to get a good laugh.

380
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,580
 The idea of them injuring us amuses them.

381
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,820
 It's a terrifying story.

382
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,700
 It's funny because it's a bunch of dwarves, right?

383
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,720
 It was a bunch of like dragon men and everyone died on the bus and wouldn't be as funny.

384
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,860
 I'd still cover it, but I wouldn't be cracking so many jokes.

385
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,320
 But it's just an interesting thing.

386
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,580
 These guys had fun from it.

387
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,260
 And you actually make sure you think, "Do ghosts do demons?"

388
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,900
 There's always this world dominating plot with demons or trying to steal our souls to

389
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,620
 get ready for the final judgment day of the Great War.

390
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,620
 Ghosts are trying to live out vengeance or reconnect to the loved one or something like

391
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
 that.

392
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,320
 What if they're just doing it for the laughs?

393
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,040
 It's really boring being dead.

394
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,860
 There's been a 2 billion year old demon.

395
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,300
 You want something to do.

396
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,020
 So you just want to make people laugh.

397
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,020
 You don't want to make people laugh.

398
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,580
 You want to make yourself laugh.

399
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,220
 So you do it by ruining people's lives.

400
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,540
 Maybe dwarves are like them.

401
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
 Who knows?

402
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,580
 Maybe gray aliens are like that.

403
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
 Maybe gray aliens.

404
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,780
 They seem not to have a sense of humor.

405
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,180
 They're so stoic.

406
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,620
 Maybe that is the highlight of their existence, abducting cows and cutting out their buttholes.

407
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,380
 But that's actually a good segue.

408
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,740
 We're not going to talk about buttholes.

409
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,040
 We're not going to talk about how demons interact with humans.

410
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,760
 It's actually a good segue.

411
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
 Natty the Knot.

412
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,040
 Let's go ahead and put you in the cockpit of the Carpentercopter.

413
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,480
 So Natty the Knot, let's go ahead.

414
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,720
 We're actually going to help these guys out because a lot of times we're jerks of people

415
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
 in stories.

416
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,360
 Let's put a winch around that bus.

417
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,680
 We're going to use the Carpentercopter to get that bus back on the road.

418
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
 And then floor it.

419
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
 Floor it.

420
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,080
 We're flying through the air that people in the bus are like, "Ahh!"

421
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
 We're doing this whole thing.

422
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,640
 We carry the bus through the air for a couple hours until...

423
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
 Now we're having fun.

424
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,440
 Now we're having fun abducting people.

425
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,740
 Eventually we drop it off nearby where they were supposed to go.

426
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,780
 They're like, "Dude, it's like 500 kilometers away."

427
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
 I was like, "Yeah."

428
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,700
 He said, "We'll give them some gas."

429
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,740
 And then we bid them farewell.

430
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,580
 We are headed off to England.

431
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,540
 Specifically Millum, Coombria, England.

432
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,900
 So I think if I know my English geography, I don't.

433
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,300
 But Millum would be the city or the shire, the village or something like that.

434
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,660
 Coombria would be the district or the state.

435
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,040
 I'm sure you would try to do this.

436
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
 England is the country though.

437
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
 I know that.

438
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,720
 So I think Millum is like the village.

439
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,560
 So in Millum, it's June 8, 2013.

440
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,640
 Natty landed that Carbnercopter and we're going to be walking around here.

441
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
 I actually planned on doing this story a week ago.

442
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,120
 And I said, I did the episode "Sampson Forever" instead.

443
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,080
 And I said in that episode I had something really depressing planned.

444
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,160
 I didn't want to do it that night because we were paying respects to the Samson the

445
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
 Dog.

446
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,860
 I was actually going to do this episode yesterday, but I was so sick.

447
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,740
 I didn't really want to delve into such a dark story.

448
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,720
 So this story is kind of depressing.

449
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,140
 It's pretty dark.

450
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,700
 And if you're not into that, I'm probably not the best Friday episode either because

451
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,900
 people get you ready for a fun weekend.

452
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
 This story won't.

453
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
 This story is kind of depressing.

454
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,020
 So if you don't want anything depressing, we can part ways now for the rest of us.

455
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,180
 Let's go on this journey together.

456
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,180
 John Jenkins.

457
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,540
 He's 25 years old.

458
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,360
 He's June 8th, 2013, and he's hiding under a bench.

459
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,860
 He's shivering.

460
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,440
 And a cop walks up to him.

461
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,240
 The police have actually been looking for this guy.

462
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,880
 The cop walks up to him.

463
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,160
 He puts a flashlight in his face, and he begins questioning this young man, and he can tell

464
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,600
 he's out of sorts, and he goes, "Have you taken anything?"

465
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,760
 And the young man responds, "Lives."

466
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,680
 48 hours earlier, it's June 6th, 2013.

467
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,300
 And he had spent months afraid that he was going to commit violence, specifically that

468
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,540
 he was going to kill his mom and his sister.

469
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:49,300
 He began to have these ideas, these intrusive thoughts, but intrusive thoughts and full-blown

470
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,380
 psychosis is actually a huge gulf.

471
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,620
 Everyone can have intrusive thoughts, but he seemed to be suffering from a full-blown

472
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,620
 psychosis.

473
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,900
 He believed, he truly believed, there was a demon inside of him.

474
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,740
 A thing we see with people who have serious mental issues is that they self-medicate.

475
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,000
 They self-medicate, right?

476
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,460
 And they go, "Well, if I smoke a bunch of weed, it makes the demon not talk so much.

477
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,120
 It gives the demon a Jamaican accent."

478
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
 That's kind of cool.

479
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,280
 You shouldn't self-medicate.

480
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,680
 He tries self-medicating, and then he even takes that too far because he thinks his demon's

481
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,480
 inside of him, and he goes, "Oh, you know what I'm doing?

482
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,940
 I'm going to take a bunch of LSD.

483
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
 That's not going to help.

484
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
 That's not going to help at all."

485
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,700
 Imagine that must be the most terrifying experience at all.

486
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,300
 You're demonically possessed, and you're high on acid, but he takes a bunch of LSD.

487
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,060
 He gets drunk, then he goes, "Okay, I'm halfway there.

488
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,980
 I've done all this stuff, but since I'm already halfway here, why don't I just kill myself?

489
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,180
 Because I'm so afraid I'm going to kill my mother and my sister."

490
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,540
 So in this same time period, he's drunk, he's on LSD, he begins swallowing paint pills,

491
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,860
 goes to drown himself, and while he's drowning, starts to slit his wrists.

492
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,580
 So someone was watching this whole progression.

493
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,340
 It might have been his friends even, but eventually the police come out, they nab him, and it was

494
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,940
 a suicide attempt, obvious suicide attempt, and he's telling people, "I feel like there's

495
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,100
 a demon inside of me.

496
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,140
 I feel like there's a demon inside of me."

497
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,500
 He's taken to Furnace General Hospital, and they interview him, they talk to him.

498
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,100
 He had just tried killing himself earlier that day.

499
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,420
 Talking about being possessed by a demon, he's afraid he's going to hurt somebody, or multiple

500
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
 people really.

501
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,900
 So if he deemed him a low risk, you can just imagine some bureaucrat was barely paying

502
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,580
 attention to what this kid was saying.

503
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,900
 "No, no, no, no, low risk, here you go.

504
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,500
 Here's a prescription for more acid."

505
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 "What?

506
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,940
 I didn't even know you could prescribe this."

507
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

508
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
 "Leave, you're gone.

509
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,140
 You're good, you're good.

510
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,380
 Go deal with your crippling mental issues somewhere else.

511
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
 You're low risk."

512
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,940
 June 7th, the next day, he's hanging out with his friends.

513
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,940
 He's drinking with them.

514
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,620
 Again, this guy's fairly young, but you think someone would go, "Hey, dude, you want to

515
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
 hang out?

516
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,820
 I know you tried killing yourself yesterday, and you think you're a demon and all that

517
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,180
 stuff, but I want to be a support system for you.

518
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,220
 I don't believe that you're actually possessed.

519
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,500
 Want to be a support system for you.

520
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 You want to hang out?"

521
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 "Yeah, sure.

522
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
 Let's go and drink.

523
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
 Let's go get drunk."

524
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 You'd be like, "What?

525
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,300
 That was one of the methods I used to kill myself yesterday."

526
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,780
 But of course, he's trying to self-medicate, so John Jenkins is out drinking with his friends.

527
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,140
 And at this point, they're hanging around, they're drinking, and he begins to confess

528
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
 to them.

529
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
 "I'm the devil.

530
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
 I'm the devil.

531
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,780
 I have this evil inside of me.

532
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:36,060
 I fear I'm going to kill my mother and my sister, and I don't know what to do."

533
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,460
 Now on the one hand, that seems very try hard, right?

534
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,100
 We've all met people like that, like, "Oh, you know, I'm the most sinister man you've

535
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
 ever met.

536
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,300
 If I didn't know you and you met me in a back alley, you better watch out."

537
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,540
 And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, okay, okay, Jeremy."

538
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,100
 But we've all known that guy, right?

539
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,220
 But this guy just tried killing himself the day before.

540
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,180
 So when he's talking about being the devil and he's afraid he's going to hurt somebody,

541
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,980
 he's crossed that line between playing with his switchblade while the rest of you guys

542
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:19,900
 are playing Magic the Gathering.

543
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 They really don't seem to do anything about this.

544
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,100
 He just tried killing it.

545
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
 And I could be wrong.

546
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,860
 Like in the articles I read, I think the friends were concerned for him, but we don't see him

547
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,500
 being readmitted to the hospital.

548
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,060
 We definitely don't see the police being recalled.

549
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,140
 So I'm sure they had emotional issues.

550
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
 Like I'm sure they weren't.

551
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,660
 I'm sure it kind of harshed their buzz overall.

552
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,620
 But as far as I can tell, the police weren't informed.

553
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:51,200
 That same night, that same night, June 7th, his sister, Katie, she's a 20-year-old woman.

554
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,220
 She begins telling her friend something similar.

555
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,460
 She says, "I'm kind of worried about my brother.

556
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,100
 He doesn't look like John anymore."

557
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,460
 The friend's like, "What are you talking about?"

558
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,140
 She's like, "I can't describe it, but he doesn't look like him.

559
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,060
 He doesn't seem like him."

560
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,380
 When I look into his eyes, I don't see John.

561
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,500
 I don't see him.

562
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,620
 June 8th, the next day, John comes down its morning.

563
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,700
 He comes downstairs.

564
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
 His mom's there.

565
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
 She's 54 years old.

566
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,940
 It was just the mom, the sister, Katie, and then John.

567
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,180
 John walks downstairs to do something in the kitchen.

568
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,820
 And an argument begins between him and his mom.

569
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,820
 And Katie's in the kitchen as well, and so is their dog.

570
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,300
 This argument's going on, and John is getting upset.

571
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,940
 He felt like his mother was overbearing.

572
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,380
 This argument's going on, and he walks upstairs to his bedroom.

573
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,100
 And the mom just turns around and continues doing what she's doing in the kitchen.

574
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,020
 Katie is continuing to eat her meal.

575
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,340
 And the dog is just doing dog things on this early morning.

576
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,220
 Within minutes, he walks upstairs.

577
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,380
 He comes down with an ax and kills the mom.

578
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,540
 In the kitchen, cuts her open with this ax.

579
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,940
 And while he's murdering his mom, his sister is screaming out loud.

580
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,020
 Obviously, she's in complete shock.

581
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,860
 It happens in a heartbeat.

582
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,460
 The sister's sitting there eating, and the next thing she knows, her mother is split

583
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,220
 open by her brother, wielding this ax.

584
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,220
 She's screaming.

585
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
 She's freaking out.

586
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,220
 She doesn't know what to do.

587
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,580
 John said, "I killed her just to stop her from screaming."

588
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,740
 And after killing the mom and killing the sister for the crime of being shocked and watching

589
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,740
 her mother murdered right in front of her, he then chops up the dog.

590
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,660
 He ended up running out of the house.

591
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,740
 People were alerted to the screams.

592
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,820
 The police were called out there.

593
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,580
 They find him, and he gave his line, which admittedly seems like something-- I don't want to make

594
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,860
 it tripe, but that seems like something that you would see in a movie.

595
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,900
 It's an interesting line that he still had to wear with all to basically quip as a cop

596
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,820
 was finding a man who just murdered his mother, his sister, and his dog.

597
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,700
 I'm not giving him extra credit for that, right?

598
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,500
 I'm not saying it's cool or anything.

599
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,700
 I just find it weird.

600
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,580
 Now, he was obviously found guilty for all this stuff.

601
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,860
 This isn't an ongoing case.

602
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,500
 He's doing life in prison.

603
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,740
 It's an interesting story because there could obviously be an insanity case here where he

604
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,380
 was complaining for months about a decline in mental faculties.

605
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,980
 Even the friend-- I'm sure all of his friends could testify.

606
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,420
 Even Katie's friend could say, "Yeah, the night before, she could tell something was

607
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
 different."

608
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,860
 Of course, I'm going to go back to the paranormal angle because that's what we talk about on

609
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,540
 a paranormal podcast, even though we do also talk about true crime.

610
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,100
 I think really he had mental illness, and I think that's the case.

611
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:49,180
 But I do find it interesting that the sister was saying that he looked different.

612
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,780
 It wasn't just that his eyes looked different.

613
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,220
 You could tell-- you could probably say somebody is going through some mental struggles, and

614
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,620
 it shows in their eyes.

615
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,860
 They have the 1,000-yard stair, shell shock, or something like that.

616
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
 He looked different overall.

617
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,620
 He had a physical different appearance.

618
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,340
 The way he seemed to her is what she said.

619
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,020
 He seems different.

620
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,660
 So that can include everything from the way he walked, the way he sat, the way he interacted

621
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660
 with other people.

622
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,340
 Now, obviously, those could all be complicated by mental illness as well.

623
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:23,300
 But it would be terrifying to think that this man for months was fighting a demon for control

624
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:29,540
 of his body, and over time the demon was slowly wearing him down.

625
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,820
 But it wasn't until he actually tried killing himself, when he was at that level of despair,

626
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,660
 that he was reaching out for any life raft, even if the life raft was his own death, when

627
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,660
 the demon fully took control.

628
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,740
 Because it was only 48 hours later that he did this.

629
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,940
 And based on the articles I read, in the original part he was saying, "I think I'm

630
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
 possessed by a demon.

631
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,820
 I'm afraid I'm going to murder my mother and my sister."

632
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:58,540
 The day after he attempts suicide, he tells his friends, "I am the devil."

633
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
 The fighting has stopped.

634
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,020
 He went from saying, "I think I have a demon inside of me," to proclaiming, "I am the

635
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,820
 devil."

636
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,300
 And then the day after that he ends up committing a demonic act.

637
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,580
 And I think an even more disturbing angle we could look at on this was, "We have a young

638
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,780
 man who's been fighting this paranormal invasion off for months.

639
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
 He can't take it anymore.

640
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,900
 He attempts to kill himself.

641
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,100
 This thing takes control of his body."

642
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,620
 When he's taken down to this hospital, he's taken in front of somebody checking symptoms

643
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,220
 off of a piece of paper, a bureaucrat through and through.

644
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,060
 This bureaucrat, allegedly, this is-- I'm making this ending up.

645
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,140
 So you can't sue me.

646
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,140
 This is fake.

647
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,520
 But just from a horror short story version.

648
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,580
 You have this young man, John, come into this ward.

649
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
 You have this bureaucrat.

650
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,580
 He's been working there for years, just always checking off boxes, deeming people low risk,

651
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
 high risk, what have you.

652
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,980
 And this person also lost the battle a long time ago.

653
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,020
 So sometimes they see a client come in.

654
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,980
 They seem insane to their neighbors.

655
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,540
 They're always preaching-- always preaching on the street corner.

656
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:16,360
 Question about God's salvation, this person looks at this old minister and says, "High

657
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 risk.

658
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
 Definitely crazy.

659
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,200
 Who knows what this zealot will do?"

660
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,400
 Sees a mom dealing with postpartum depression.

661
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,200
 She's talking about dark thoughts.

662
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,040
 And the bureaucrat looks up at her and goes, "Low risk.

663
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
 Send her home."

664
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,960
 And this person weighs life in the balance with the check of a pin.

665
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,580
 And this person lost their battle with a demon a long time ago, fully infested, and in the

666
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,520
 perfect position to continue to cause chaos?

667
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,580
 Because this person would see client after client come into their office and could look

668
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:03,080
 at them and know if this person was also in the grasp of a demonic force.

669
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,760
 So when this person saw John walk in that day, just looked up at him, looked up at the

670
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,640
 scratches on his arms where he tried cutting himself, looked at the glaze looking his eyes

671
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,360
 as the drugs were continuing to wear off of him.

672
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,680
 It's only a slight look.

673
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,840
 The counselor knows exactly what the answer is as John's walking into the room because

674
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:29,320
 the counselor recognizes something in John, something familiar, something like family.

675
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:36,600
 And as John sits down, the counselor is already writing down, "Low risk.

676
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
 Release back into society."

677
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,640
 It is just one more chaotic element unleashed into the world that's already having a hard

678
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,440
 time fighting back evil.

679
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,680
 But that's the counselor's job.

680
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,480
 That's why they're there.

681
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,520
 They get paid good money, great benefits, and they get to make sure the foot soldiers are

682
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:23,360
 where they need to be to sow demonic destruction.

683
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:51,760
 That's the counselor.

684
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,760
 Thank you.

685
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:08,760
