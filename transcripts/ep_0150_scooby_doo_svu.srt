00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 Did a factory in South Carolina accidentally discover a force field?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,600
 And then we take a look at the strange connection between ghosts and pedophiles today on Dead

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:22,960
 Rabbit Radio. Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I hope you

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,800
 all survived the eclipse. I hope that Lunar Eclipse didn't awaken some sort of dark ancient god or

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,120
 the Trifids didn't show up or any of that. I'm pre-recorded this episode so I don't know. We

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,160
 could all be dead. But probably not. You're probably listening to this episode in the comfort of your

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,960
 own car workplace bed. A lot of people listen to this podcast when they fall asleep. I always

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
 think it's so funny and they always go, "No, you know, I'm not trying to install a shoe, but

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,240
 listen to your podcast as I'm falling asleep." And I'm like, "I don't take it as an insult."

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,320
 I have a smooth, I have a nice sounding voice, I guess. Sounds weird to me. It's not how I

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,440
 think I sound, but when I listen to it, I'm like, "Ugh, it's a little annoying." But anyway, so,

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,120
 because I'm just so used to hearing a different voice. But it's interesting because when I listen

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,200
 to a podcast, it sounds like I'm listening to someone else's podcast. So that's kind of cool.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
 Okay, so we're going to go ahead and move on to the first story. Now, the first story, it's really

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,680
 short, but it's quite fascinating. It was discovered on accident and I'm honestly kind of surprised I

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,800
 haven't tried replicating it again. Who knows? They may, they may be doing that. The year is 1980.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:39,040
 The state, South Carolina, the city, I didn't write down in my notes. So somewhere in South

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:49,440
 Carolina, there was a 3M factory. 3M is the makers of the post-it note and the 3M actually

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,840
 means something. It originally was like a letter, a name that had 3Ms in it. Here's a quick note,

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,680
 though, unrelated. It's a little, I guess it's related because it's sticky. Scotch tape. You know

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,080
 Scotch tape? That is a racist, that is a racist slur. The reason why they came up with the name

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,000
 Scotch. Oh, I think 3M makes Scotch tape, actually, so it is related. Scotch tape is a racist slur.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,880
 When you look, that's just not me being like, you know, sensitive to it. I'm not Scottish,

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,200
 it doesn't matter. You know at the beginning of each piece of Scotch tape roll, there's the little

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,480
 plaid tartar on the beginning? This is why it is called Scotch tape. This is so bizarre,

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,440
 because there used to be this old, timey stereotype that Scottish people were super stingy. And so

28
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,760
 Scotch tape was as sticky as a Scotsman to his money. That's why it's called Scotch tape. That is

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,520
 so racist. It's quite hilarious. I remember once I was at work and there was this old guy,

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,160
 he had to be like, I don't know, 70 or 80 years old. And this was only a couple years ago.

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,080
 And he's like, "Hey, you want to hear a joke?" Now he always told like the worst jokes. He's

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
 actually passed away now, but he was a nice guy. He always told really bad jokes. He's like, "Hey,

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,120
 you want to hear a joke?" And I was like, "Yeah, sure. I'm humoring him." And he goes, "Well..."

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,960
 And I don't remember the exact joke, I just remember the punchline, but he's like this

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,360
 Scottish guy goes, it's like World War II and the Scottish guy goes to a repair shop with a condom

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,680
 and says, "My condom busted. My condom blew up. Can you repair it?" And the guy's like, "Yeah,

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,080
 I think I can repair it." So he repairs it. And the next night, the Scottish guy shows back up the

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,200
 repair shop and is like, "I mate. I need you. I need you to repair me condom again." And the guy's

39
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,720
 like, "Okay." And he repairs it again. Now, it's quite disgusting to think that this repairman is,

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,080
 I mean, I hope he wore some protective gear as he's like touching this used exploded condom.

41
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,120
 The next night, the Scottish guy shows back up again to the repair shop and goes, "Can you repair

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,040
 this condom?" The repair owner goes, "Well, you know, I can repair the condom. Sure. But like,

43
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,680
 how do you keep breaking these?" And he's like, "Ah, it's not just me. It's me and my 20 Scottish

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:11,600
 friends are using it." And he told that joke. And I thought, "How old are you? Like, I have not,

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,400
 I've known that there, I know that there's a stereotype of Scottish people being stingy because

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,000
 of Scotch tape. I have never once in my life ever had anyone come up to me and be like,

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,240
 man, that guy's as sticky as a Scotchman. Like, I've never heard that stereotype spoken to me.

48
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,280
 But he told, and it's funny because he told me the joke assuming that I knew that Scottish people

49
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,520
 are super stingy. Like, if he told that joke to anyone else, they'd be like,

50
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,040
 okay, like they'd then be waiting for the punchline because it's not a well-known stereotype. I just

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,480
 happened to know that because I read about Scotch tape. And I laughed at the absurdity of it. And

52
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,080
 I also laughed because I was thinking, how old are you really? Like, you sound like you might be

53
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,160
 pre-Civil War old if you're telling a joke about how stingy Scottish people are. Anyways, that all

54
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,840
 being aside, and you'll never be able to look at Scotch tape again after hearing this. Every time

55
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,080
 you see that little, little plaid at the beginning of Scotch tape, you're going to be like, that is

56
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,480
 hella racist. That's super, super racist. Anyways, 3M, they're in this factory in South Carolina

57
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,040
 in an unnamed city. They have these huge giant rolls of something called polypropylene. Polypropylene.

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,680
 These giant spools, it's 50,000 feet of polypropylene, forget it, in these spools, and each spool is 20

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,920
 feet wide. So it's these massive things that are just spinning all day long. People are like,

60
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,880
 ah, I'm getting a headache. But the problem is, is they generate a massive amount of static

61
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,520
 electricity as they're, and so people have to walk around with, if you get stung by this static

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
 electricity, it's like 20 volts. I mean, it's bad enough when someone walks in behind you and

63
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,640
 just tacks you with their finger when they're shuffling on the car. I haven't done that in years

64
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,000
 now that I think about it. When's the last time you shocked someone on purpose? I think as you

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,240
 get older, there's less carpet in the world. I think it's one of nature's horrible tricks. There's

66
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,040
 not enough stuff to shock people with. But if you got shocked by these, it was quite the jolt.

67
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,480
 But you'd have to have people walk around with meters and stuff like that to make sure it's not

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,520
 putting out too much static electricity. Well, one day back in 1980, this guy was walking around

69
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,080
 with his meter and it was these two spools were generating a massive amount of static electricity,

70
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,720
 more than normal. And he began, he's with his meter and he begins to walk in between the spools.

71
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,040
 And they're fairly well placed out. He's not going to get caught into it and get all squeezed

72
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,960
 together like a tube of toothpaste. He was walking between it and the guy says, this from this news

73
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,760
 article, he goes, all of a sudden, like I'm walking in between these two spools. And I started

74
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,840
 to feel like I was walking in water, like not like puddles, but like way steep in water. I started

75
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,440
 feel like my motion was slowing down as I was moving between these two spools. And he goes,

76
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,960
 what was weird about it was the deeper I got into between these two spools,

77
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:09,040
 the more resistance I was feeling on my body. And he goes, then I saw a fly fly into where I was at

78
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:18,240
 and it started like flying super slow. Little fly wings. And he's watching this fly. I don't know

79
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,480
 if it was flying in slow motion, but it definitely maybe was just getting pushed back, but the fly

80
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,080
 was trying to fly past him and it was also being repelled. And at that point, the guy says, I think

81
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,760
 based on the force I was feeling that even a bird, if it flew into this area would be pushed against.

82
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,720
 At this point, he made, he could have done one or two things. He could continue to walk through

83
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,800
 this area to see what would happen or walk backwards. Now he did the smart thing. He walked

84
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,600
 backwards. I think a lot of people would just keep on walking and who knows, would you've just

85
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,720
 gotten completely frozen in place because now you got this stuff, whatever this force was around your

86
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,200
 body, you can't move back or forth. And so he told everyone, it's like, dude, you can't walk

87
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,120
 between there right now. There's something going on. And other workers started trying it and they're

88
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,560
 like, oh, they'd be like, oh my God, this is so crazy. The boss who oversaw the factory was like,

89
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,040
 guys quit messing around at work. And they're like, there's some sort of field down there you

90
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,360
 can't walk through. Boss totally didn't believe it because he walked right through it. And they

91
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,640
 figured out it only happens early in the morning, whether it's the humidity or something that's

92
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,800
 going on with the temperature. As the day went on, and maybe as the machines were warming up or

93
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,760
 whatever, it dissipated. So they told the boss, they're like, come in early tomorrow. It was just

94
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,360
 a trick to get the boss to come in early tomorrow and they tore the paper all over his car and they're

95
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,880
 like, haha. But no, they're like, come in early tomorrow and try it out. So he showed up early

96
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,840
 and the boss went to walk through it like he had before. Couldn't. He was actively being repelled.

97
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,400
 At that point, the boss was like, because he's a boss and not a scientist, he goes, okay, call the

98
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,120
 engineers out, we got to fix this. The engineers came out, fixed the machine so it wasn't putting

99
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,720
 out so much static electricity. Never have the problem again. It's interesting though to think

100
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,640
 that this was discovered accidentally. It could most likely be replicated again without having to

101
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,200
 have these giant spools of polypropylene. But I mean, even if you did need these giant spools,

102
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,080
 that would be a good security measure. One, it'd be super loud. Well, I guess it'd only be a good

103
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,920
 security measure between the hours of 530 and seven. But if you could replicate that in a way

104
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,440
 that would last longer, you would have by all definitions, a force field. You would have something

105
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,560
 that people could not walk through or at the very least walking through it would considerably

106
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,720
 slow you down. I mean, think about it, instead of like a police barricade, instead of police tape

107
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
 at a crime scene, you know, like this mother sobbing over her son, you just hear this.

108
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:54,000
 Going on and by Sanders trying to get close and they're like getting stuck,

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,280
 flies are getting stuck. And actually you could use that too. The killer's trying to get away,

110
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,720
 just throw a bunch of rolls down the street, they're rolling down opposite streets.

111
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
 He's like running towards the intersection, they both meet at the intersection,

112
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:14,320
 he gets stuck. His accomplishing crime is a fly, it's a little bandit mask on. Interesting stuff.

113
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,080
 It always makes you wonder what other weird scientific discoveries are out there that just

114
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,960
 haven't accidentally been discovered. I think purple dye was discovered on accident. I think

115
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,560
 someone knocked something over and it turned purple. They knocked a chemical over and it turned

116
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
 purple and at that time purple was super rare. It was very, very expensive, that's why there's

117
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,440
 almost no flags with purple in them. And purple was considered a sign of royalty because it was

118
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,000
 a super rare dye. Then one day some chemist was dicking around and he knocked over a violin

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,160
 and it landed on some cloth and it turned purple. No joke, he quit being a chemist and began

120
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,840
 manufacturing purple clothing and became a millionaire. Or like a, I guess you'd still

121
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,600
 be a millionaire if it was all in fronks, it's just a million fronks instead of real money.

122
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760
 Okay, our next story. I actually found, because I was looking for something else.

123
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,320
 Now I'm sure it's out there, but I don't know how much I want to find it. So I'm just going to

124
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,280
 assume that it exists and just kind of call it a day, because I don't really want to type it into

125
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,520
 Google over and over again. And I even didn't want to type this one into Google over and over again.

126
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,760
 I was thinking it, I was thinking the other day, I go, I wonder if there is a fetish,

127
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,120
 this is going to sound super bizarre, but this is kind of the world that we live in.

128
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,480
 I wonder if there is some sick gross fetish of child molesters who summon the ghost of,

129
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:36,400
 this is so bad. I wonder if there is a fetish for child molesters who summon the ghosts of kids

130
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:45,120
 to molest them. Now that would have, one, probably, but two, I don't think you can do that. I don't

131
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,400
 think you can summon the ghost of anybody. I don't think you can choose who you summon the ghost of.

132
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,560
 I don't think any part of it would work. That doesn't keep people from being weird and try.

133
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,840
 But again, I didn't want to like find a bunch of gross fan art or

134
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,280
 stories and stuff like that. I was just, I was like, I wonder if there's been like somebody

135
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,360
 arrested for trying to do that or, you know, someone stopped at a Walmart for buying a Ouija

136
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,320
 board and a My Little Pony toy at the same time. Like that has to exist. But again, I'm not,

137
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,040
 I'm so curious. I'm banging down the door to find out. I'm just going to assume there's at least

138
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,240
 a few sickos. I have a theory. If you can think of the fetish, there's at least 10 people in the

139
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,640
 world who believe in it. No matter how bizarre it is, people getting off, sticking beeswax

140
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,320
 up their butthole, there's a group of people who are into that. People who love the sound of paper

141
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
 bags being ripped next to a volcano, there's someone into that. Like no matter what fetish you can

142
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,120
 think of, there's going to be a group of people that are into that. But I did go home and type in

143
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,000
 ghost child molesters. And I thought what I was going to find was some weirdo saying, oh yeah,

144
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,520
 I've summoned the ghost of Shirley Temple, but she died as an old woman. So I had to use my

145
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,720
 imagination or whatever. Like, thought I was going to find at least one freak. Instead, I found

146
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,920
 that there is a bizarre connection between pedophiles and ghosts. And it's not as surprising

147
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,280
 as you would think. Like at first I was like, what? And as I was finding all these articles,

148
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,160
 I was like, yeah, it kind of makes sense. Now, you know, pedophiles are gross on many counts.

149
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,280
 Obviously, they're having sex with children. They are just being attracted to children,

150
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,480
 but they have, they're having this attraction to children and having sex with children.

151
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,520
 That's all very physically gross. And then you have the mental grotesqueness, where it's the

152
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:39,600
 manipulation. It is the overwhelming fear and tyranny that an adult brings into a child's life

153
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,280
 when they're engaged in this. And it's always, it's just a, it's a sex fetish. Like I give more

154
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:57,920
 credit to a man who kills people, like a, like a guy robbing a train. Like yes, you're killing people

155
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,240
 for money. And that's, you know, I'm not saying that that's a great career path, but he's getting

156
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,520
 the money for a, for a particular reason. Like he's having this shoot out, he's running up alongside

157
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,800
 a train, or just even nowadays robbing a bank with an AK-47, like you're committing a crime

158
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,920
 for material gain and that material, that money can be used to access other parts of your life

159
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,080
 or to pay off debts or to get your drugs or whatever. But for your crime, that you were

160
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,560
 child molestation, the crime you are committing is 100% based on your own, like sexual gratification.

161
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,800
 It's, I mean, I guess you could probably say, well, what if the guy's just robbing a bank to pay for

162
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,760
 prostitutes? Like yes, I'm sure there's some gray area with my bank robberies analogy. But I, one of

163
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,000
 the things that makes me more disgusted towards pedophiles is they're ruining the life for a

164
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,360
 short period of pleasure. They're ruining someone's entire life for a short period of pleasure. So

165
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,440
 it's super, it's, that's incredibly disgusting to me, that thought. These guys go the extra, and

166
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:08,400
 girls in this story, go the extra mile. They use children's fear to get them. Now, this is, we're

167
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,960
 just going to basically touch on these. That's not a pun. We're basically going to just go through

168
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,240
 these here because they're just, it's the, they're so bizarre. I did a previous episode about this

169
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
 as well, and I thought it was a one-off thing where a guy was trying to get a girl to sleep with them

170
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,920
 and was leaving notes. She was terrified of a ghost. He was leaving notes under her door saying,

171
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,320
 "I'm a ghost. Sleep with your neighbor or I will haunt you forever." And she was so petrified

172
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,160
 of ghosts, she ended up sleeping with them. He's in prison for the rest of his life. We're going

173
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,360
 around the world with this one too. This isn't, this isn't a localized thing. First, we're going to

174
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,320
 India where a prestigious, maybe not, maybe it's just a regular girl's school, but it sounded

175
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,160
 prestigious, where there was an old girl's school. And the woman in charge, the headmistress,

176
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,440
 thought this was super funny. She would dress up as a ghost and she would just walk along the

177
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,880
 hallways at night. And people saw her and went, "Oh my god, there's a ghost. There's a ghost."

178
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,840
 Then she started coming into like the dorm area and she would walk, as the girls were sleeping,

179
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,320
 she would dress up as a ghost, walk around the sleeping girls and just kind of like look at them.

180
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,640
 And the girls would hear her, but they wouldn't want to wake up because they knew something

181
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,320
 weird was happening. They would kind of catch glimpses of their headmistress pretending to be

182
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,000
 a ghost and they're like, "That's weird." Sometimes the headmistress would then, in real time, like

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,320
 during the day, would begin talking to nothing, whispering to something in the middle of nowhere,

184
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,320
 and pretending like, "Oh, you don't see her? That's the ghost of the school." And she's

185
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,400
 created, it's this escalation. She's creating this arena of fear. She's creating just like this

186
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,200
 heightened tension in the place. So she's basically dressing up as a ghost. The girls are seeing this

187
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,040
 ghost. They're kind of figuring out who it is, though. And then she's telling these kids these

188
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,280
 ghost stories to get them more and more scared about where they're at because they're stuck there.

189
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,040
 It's in all girls' schools. Not like they go home for the weekend. They're trapped. And then

190
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,160
 eventually it escalated to the headmistress dressing up as a ghost, touching the girls while

191
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
 they slept. And again, the girls were "sleeping." They were still awake and they knew what was

192
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,240
 going on. They just didn't want to wake up because it was super creepy. The person in charge of all

193
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,520
 of your safety and learning is dressed up as a ghost walking around touching you. Of course,

194
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,600
 the police came in and they investigated the ghost stuff. They're like, "Well, that is weird

195
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,640
 that she's dressed up as a ghost." But as far as the allegations of the... And I think two of...

196
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,480
 I think the headmistress and someone else was suspended for dressing up as ghost.

197
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,960
 But for the sexual assault stuff, the police are like, "Eh, like it's bizarre. I think...

198
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,880
 I don't know if they have more of a problem with people pretending to be ghosts than India than

199
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,520
 the sexual molestation stuff. But yeah, just weird. Why would that be your main concern?

200
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,520
 You're suspended. You put a sheet on your head. Yeah, the molestations. We'll deal with that later.

201
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,040
 Now we're going to jump real quickly to Eureka, California. Let's hop in the

202
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,120
 Carbidecopter. We need some lightness for this episode. Flying high above all the pedophiles.

203
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,680
 They're chasing the helicopter. Open up with the machine gun.

204
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 Bolts are going right through them. We can't stop them. They're ghosts.

205
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:18,080
 Taking off. They're like slowly hovering off the ground trying to reach us.

206
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,560
 A fly is getting stuck with them. Anyway, so we fly. Now we're going to Eureka, California.

207
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,520
 They were going to meet a man named Carpathian, the storyteller. This is actually still being

208
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,560
 litigated. So these are all alleged incidents. And this one kind of falls into it, but he is a

209
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,760
 man who dressed up as a ghost and told scary stories to kids. He's under investigation right now.

210
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,520
 Actually, he was arrested for raping a child. This is a fun episode. He was arrested for raping a

211
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,640
 child. He was also a county clerk for the court system there. And so all the judges are like,

212
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,640
 I know this guy. Like, I have to recuse myself from dealing with this because I've known this guy

213
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,360
 for 20 years. All allegations with that trial is currently going on. But again, another ghost

214
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,200
 possible alleged child molestation thing. Hop back on the Carpentercopter.

215
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,560
 We're going to South Bend, Indiana. This one I actually debated whether or not to even put in

216
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,080
 this because it's so bizarre. This woman finds a video tape. Well, not just a woman, a wife.

217
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,720
 Finds a video tape in her husband's possessions and puts it in. Now, I would think she probably had

218
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,040
 some suspicions before that. I've never been married. But I don't know if I would necessarily

219
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,240
 be suspicious of a blank cassette that my wife had sitting around. Okay, never mind, I would be.

220
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,960
 I'd be totally totally. I would think as does she know Samara? Is this the real ring video?

221
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,680
 It's a video of her being in a much dudes. I'm like, I still have I can still live. I'm not

222
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,880
 going to die in seven days. Woohoo. This is my heart breaks. She finds this video tape. She puts

223
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,480
 it in the VCR. He is dressed up as the imagine. Okay. Imagine this is you. You find the video

224
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,360
 tape of a loved one. You put it in a VCR. First, you have to go to the Goodwill and find a VCR.

225
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:09,040
 You put it in the VCR and you see your loved one dressed up as a ghost and proclaiming yourself

226
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:16,080
 to be I am monster ghost, which I've seriously, dude, that's the best name you could come up with.

227
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,160
 We had Carpathian the storyteller in Eureka and you're just monster ghost. I am monster ghost.

228
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:31,280
 And then you see a kid walk into frame and the ghost, the ghost makes the kids poop his pants

229
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,120
 and then some other stuff happens. The wife divorces them. Like that's as much as detail as I

230
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,680
 want to get into. It's actually as much detail as I have, but even that's too much. This is so

231
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,200
 disgusting. The wife took the tape out, went to the police, rightfully so, divorced him. He's in

232
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,320
 prison for the rest of his life. Now we're going to Hanover, Pennsylvania. Don't worry. You're like,

233
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,920
 "Hey, we just went to India and then he said was all over the world. We're ending with a biggie

234
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,120
 here." Unfortunately, that's not a selling point when we're talking about this subject.

235
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,840
 Hanover, Pennsylvania. There's a man named Evan Smith. Again, I believe this is allegedly, he

236
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,840
 might actually been convicted at this time. I think this is interesting because he's 42 and

237
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,200
 now it's my age. And I always think when I read stories about people kind of doing like really

238
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,560
 bizarre stuff like blowing people's heads off or stuff like this, I'm thinking this guy is as old

239
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,360
 as I am. His brain should be as developed as mine is and I'm smart enough not to do anything like

240
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,800
 this. But this guy apparently isn't. So anyways, there was two preteens in this house. He was a

241
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,360
 family friend. He was again telling them that there was a ghost in the house. He was going to get him.

242
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,440
 He would write stuff on the mirrors, you know, like when he would go and fog up the bathroom

243
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,160
 with the shower, allegedly. Write on the mirror, "Die virgins." Which is kind of a grammatically

244
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,720
 weird shouldn't it have been die comma virgins? Because if it just says die virgins, I would think

245
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,480
 it meant that I should die a virgin. But if it was die comma virgins, then it would be like die

246
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,920
 virgins. Should have put a question mark on there. But anyway, so he would use that. He'd show that

247
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,320
 to the girls and he'd run out of the bathroom all sweaty because he'd been in a hot shower. He's

248
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,960
 like, "Hey girls, girls, look at this." He used those sort of mental tricks for three years.

249
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,160
 Well, let's see those young girls. Horrible, horrible thing. I'm pretty sure that guy got convicted.

250
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,560
 But now we're going to Bolivia. Now this one I had heard about when it happened and I kind of had a

251
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,760
 circle back around in my research because I was like, "I do remember something like this."

252
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:42,640
 There was a Mennonite compound. Not compound, but Mennonite, uh, I'll just call it a compound,

253
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,360
 down in Bolivia. Mennonite is kind of like the, not Irish, the Mennonite are kind of like the Amish

254
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,600
 where they kind of eschew all technology. You just want to go back to a simpler way of life.

255
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:59,280
 And the town was being plagued, or the compound, it's a town. It was being plagued by demonic attacks.

256
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,040
 Girls who were waking up in the middle of all ages, really, were waking up in the middle of the night

257
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,360
 covered in semen. I mean, there's no other way I can say it. And sometimes they'd wake up and

258
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,640
 they'd have like bits of rope wrapped around their ankles and their hands. Sometimes they would have

259
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,120
 weird dreams about being out in the field and when they woke up they had grass stains on their knees.

260
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,240
 I'm trying not to laugh when I say that, but that sounds like a setup of a bad joke. And they could

261
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,760
 have figured out. And these girls were complaining of like soreness and areas. But because of the

262
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,920
 religious nature of the community, it wasn't something that they were really speaking about.

263
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,120
 They would talk about it with their friends or with their mothers, but if you weren't a virgin,

264
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,040
 you had less of a chance of getting married because they, you know, it was that thing,

265
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,080
 like you're not pure anymore in the eyes of God. But the idea was even if we did tell people,

266
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,440
 there must be some sort of supernatural force because I go to bed and then I wake up and I have

267
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,640
 these injuries or I have this liquid on me. And what could possibly do that? It can't be one of

268
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,040
 our neighbors doing that because they're, "Just climb through the window and I don't wake up and my

269
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,840
 family doesn't wake up." Now, the elders of the town started to get suspicious. This, and I should

270
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,840
 have said this too. This happened like four years ago. This isn't like old-timey Mennonite Church.

271
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,240
 This happened like in 2014, 2015. It was very, very recent. I guess I should have started off with that.

272
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,800
 The elders of the church started to get suspicious. Now, they were getting suspicious because they

273
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,880
 were hearing mumblings from people in the town saying this stuff was happening. But that was

274
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,080
 kind of on the back burner. They were suspicious about one thing in particular. They started to

275
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,760
 notice a guy was getting up awfully early. They're like, "Why is that guy getting up so early?"

276
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,480
 That's weird. Like, we have a pretty regimented schedule. Why is this particular guy waking

277
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,160
 up so early? That is what lit off their little like, "Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo," it says, siren.

278
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,920
 Made them go, "Why is this guy waking up so early?" So they follow him one night. They see him fiddling

279
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,920
 with this machine. It's this big pump machine that has a giant hose attached to it.

280
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:21,760
 And it's used to anesthetize cows. What they figured out was that him and like seven other dudes

281
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,240
 in this town, Mennonite men, would drag this machine out of the farm area, put it through the

282
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,720
 window of a house of their victim, and pump in this knockout gas and put the entire family to

283
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,400
 sleep for the night. And then they would climb in there, rape the girl that they wanted to,

284
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,520
 climb back down, put their ladder away, and everyone would wake up and they'd be like,

285
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,920
 "Man, I had a great night's sleep. I wonder what happened?" I slept like a cow last night.

286
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,640
 This had been going on for so long. Over a hundred girls were raped in this fashion.

287
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,320
 They were being just gassed out, completely knocked out, and they think like the girl who had the

288
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,040
 dream that she was in the field, she was kind of in and out of it. And that's why she would be like,

289
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,400
 "Why am I in this field? I had this dream I was in this field." But she was actually there.

290
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,800
 They would knock them out and it just went on for a long, long time. They guys have all been

291
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:19,520
 convicted at this point. But they had the perfect cover because of the religious fervor in the area,

292
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,320
 because they live their religion and they believe in this battle between good and evil and these

293
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,840
 demons. The reason why it went on so long was when they woke up and they had these wounds,

294
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:37,040
 their mind leapt to, "I'm being attacked by a demon. No human would be so evil to do this to me.

295
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,120
 No one in my town would be so evil to do this to me. It must be a supernatural force."

296
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,080
 And it wasn't. It was the evil in your own town. Super bizarre. And I think that's why these

297
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,280
 work. I think kids are in and you could go, "Jason, I've never been so scared of a ghost that I'd

298
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:02,080
 let it molest me." But we're dealing with kids here who are barely grappling with the concept of

299
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,600
 what death is. They don't understand the way the world works or anything about death or anything

300
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,880
 like that. They don't get it. And now you've got real life ghosts walking around them

301
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,200
 and making these weird demands. It would be effective for a kid, but it just doubles that

302
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:27,520
 mental torture. It's absolutely disgusting. Well, I stopped researching this. I could honestly have,

303
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,520
 I believe I could have kept finding stuff like this. As I was looking around, I found a paranormal

304
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,600
 investigator who was arrested for being a teenage kid and they had to shut down the whole paranormal

305
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,400
 group. I think it's out there. I think it's a problem that exists because it's very easy to

306
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,440
 scare people into getting what you wanted. Saying there's a ghost coming and writing diverge,

307
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,640
 that's not a pun either, and write divergence on a mirror for a preteen is no different really

308
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,280
 than saying, "I will beat you up if you don't give me your shoes." They're both completely based on

309
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,280
 fear. It's just, it's weird. When I came up with this topic, I was thinking there has to be some

310
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,120
 weirdo out there who's like, "Yeah, I used my Ouija board and I met Michael Jackson as a 10-year-old

311
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,800
 or something like that. Just like some totally random weirdo. That's what I was looking for."

312
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:25,440
 Instead, I found real-life incidents of just creepy people doing creepy stuff and I would have

313
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,720
 rather found the weirdo with the Ouija board than Monster Ghost or the Indian Headmistress

314
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:42,000
 or any of that. It's just awful, man. What a world. I never, I wouldn't have thought,

315
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,400
 I, but you never know what you're gonna find when you, I guess, when you type Ghost Chalm Lester

316
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,320
 into Google, but man, what, ugh. I got no other way to end this episode other than just go and

317
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:03,840
