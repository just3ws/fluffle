00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 The forces of Satan are attacking a church in the grossest way possible,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,800
 and they would take a look at the bizarre story of the camera heads.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,080
 Was there once a creepypasta floating around the internet about a man who smashed another

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:21,280
 man's head open and a VHS cassette came out? And more bizarrely, is that story true? Today on Dead

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,920
 Rabbit Radio. Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I really do.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,640
 First off, we have to give a shout out to our newest Patreon, Jack Hayes. Everyone, give it up

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,000
 for Jack Hayes, or as I like to call him, Jack Hayes. I feel like then I'm yelling at a character

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,720
 in a 1970 sitcom, Jack Hayes. But I've earned the right to call him that, so if any of his friends

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,760
 are listening right now, do not call him that. Jack Hayes! And I will stop as well. But thank you so

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,760
 much, Jack Hayes. It's hard to go back to normal. Jack Hayes, thank you so much for supporting the

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,360
 show. If you can't support the show, help get the word out about the show. That really, really

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,680
 helps out a lot as well. It just really helps build the show over time. Really, really appreciate all

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
 the help, all the support I've been getting from all of you. Also, we've been doing the Dead Rabbit

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,800
 Movie Club. Friday night, 7 p.m. We're going to livestream on YouTube. A discussion of the movies

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,520
 we're watching this week. All of these movies are available on shutter.com. I'm not sponsored by

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,520
 them. Just right now, they're doing a free 30-day promo. If you use the promo code SHUTIN, S-H-U-T-I-N.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
 Again, I'm not sponsored. Just trying to share the service with you. We can all watch these movies

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,040
 together for free. Yesterday's movie was the movie Housewife. Did any of you guys watch that? It was

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,960
 pretty interesting, wasn't it? Really, really enjoyed that one. The way I would describe it is,

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,000
 if the mouth of Madness or Hellraiser was shot on the budget of a Hallmark, a movie of the week.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,800
 You could definitely tell they were restricted by the budget, but they had a very interesting story,

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,160
 very interesting visuals for what they could do. If you gave them an extra 10 million dollars,

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,560
 the movie could have looked like Mandy. That Nicholas Cage movie we watched last week. I thought

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,360
 it was actually a better movie than Mandy. I thought it had a better narrative. I thought it was a

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,880
 more cohesive film. Very, very interesting movie, Housewife. This next movie, I have not seen it.

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,640
 I know the director. I've seen a ton of the director's work. The director's name, because I

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,080
 watch a lot of terrible cinema. I find a great enjoyment in that. The director's name is David

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,160
 DeCoto. He's the one who shot D.B. Cooper versus Bigfoot. He is known for the 1313 franchise.

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,240
 In the past 15 years, he makes a lot of movies that he says are for young women. Horror movies

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,560
 shouldn't just be for men, which I agree. I don't think horror movies are just for men. It makes

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,520
 horror movies for young women. It really is just a bunch of dudes running around with their shirts

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 off instead of a bunch of girls running around with their shirts off. It's not my cup of tea,

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,720
 but he'll make like 10 movies within a month and they're all shot in the same location.

35
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,120
 They're hilariously bad, which I really, really enjoy. He's also, though, made some really good

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,240
 movies, leeches. Very interesting horror movie. Very interesting horror movie he made. Final

37
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,520
 stab. It was his scream ripoff. Very interesting horror movie. He has a lot of talent, but he

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,520
 just kind of churns out stuff very, very quickly. Hires a bunch of guys to walk around his apartment

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,120
 with no shirts on, films them, and then Bigfoot shows up and kills them one by one.

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 This movie comes way earlier in his filmography. Again, I've never seen it,

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
 but he started off making really low-budget horror movies. This is a classic. I've never seen it,

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,600
 and I'm actually surprised I've never seen it. I'm going to watch it tonight. Sorority Babes,

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,440
 I'm shocked, too, that I haven't seen it just based on this title. Sorority Babes in the Slimeball

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,080
 Bullorama. No idea really what it's about. I can imagine it's a bunch of chicks running around

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,720
 a bowling alley, probably a monster or a serial killer, but we're going to watch it tonight for

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
 the Dead Rav Movie Club. If you want to watch it, you can watch it on Shutter.com. I'm sure you

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,880
 can also find it in other places, but Shutter.com has that free promo code, SHUTIN, for 30 days free.

48
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,320
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode of them. Jack Hayes. I'm turning to you. I'm looking

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,720
 you in the eyes, and I pull out the keys to the carpenter copter. Drop them in your hand. I go,

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,360
 "You take us to Botswana." You know, like, that was kind of official, and I'm like, "It was." I'm in

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
 an official mood today. We're actually going to dress up because we're going to church, so let's put

52
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,200
 on our Sunday best, but on a little suit and tie. If you're not a suit and tie, you put on that little

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,680
 like dress thing. What do they call it? They're just called dresses, but isn't there a particular

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,920
 like Sunday dress, or is that just a term? Like, when they say wear your Sunday dress, does that

55
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,640
 mean is that a generic term for your clothing, or is that like everyone has, everyone's supposed

56
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,600
 to have an actual dress they wear. It doesn't matter. Anyways, we're on the helicopter. We're

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,000
 flying out to the seedy ward. Prepare for a ton of mispronunciation, guys. We're headed out to the

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,800
 seedy ward in Maan Botswana. We're flying down. We're flying low. We land in the seedy ward. This

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,320
 story just happened back in March, so just a couple weeks ago this happened. Hop out. Got our

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,760
 nice little suits on and stuff like that. You're looking particularly good. I really like that

61
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,040
 outfit on you. You look great. Have you lost weight? You look great. Anyways, we're walking

62
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,240
 through the city, and there we see a little church, a little church, but something weird

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,640
 is going on. Everyone's outside. Now, I guess it's not weird. I mean, people aren't trapped in the

64
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,000
 church. You go to church, they're like, you're here forever. No. Like, you're allowed to leave the church.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,040
 Some of the churches, some of the churches that's communicate you if you leave, but

66
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:53,040
 there we're going to meet the prophet Gomolemo WG Motswetla. We're like prophet Motswetla.

67
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,600
 We see you're holding the service outside, and he's like, yes, yes, I still need to continue

68
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,240
 my ministry, but we are under assault. We're under assault from the dark lord. We're like,

69
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,840
 can we help? We're actually paranormal investigators, monster hunters, some may call us. Can we help?

70
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,240
 And he goes, yes. Yes, you guys look like you actually could help. So he tells the congregation

71
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,480
 to stay there and he leads us into the empty church. We notice a foul smell. Oh, what is that?

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,520
 It smells terrible. We're walking through the church. We're getting up to the lead couch

73
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,040
 pew thingy. Just sitting there, right? That's what pews normally do. They sit there and you

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,920
 sit on them. They don't dance around until you tame them, sitting there. So we get closer. It

75
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:51,040
 smells worse. And then he shows us and on the, we're all wrong, on that pew in the front there

76
00:06:51,040 --> 00:07:00,800
 is a big yellow pile of poop. I'm actually shocked how many poop stories we've ended up covering on

77
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,600
 this show. I'm starting to wonder if there is some sort of supernatural connection between feces

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,120
 and supernatural because it seems to be coming up a lot. And what's weird is it seems to be coming

79
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,320
 up a lot laterally. And you go, Jason, that's just you picking stories about poop. All of a sudden,

80
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,520
 like for the past two months, every time there's a poop episode. What prophet Matz-Wetla says

81
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,600
 is that one day they came into the church and there was a big stinky pile of poop sitting on

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,960
 there and you're thinking, okay, so something broke in and pooped. Well, he goes, no, no, no, no,

83
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,880
 because they've actually been looking into this. Here's some quotes. Here's some amazing quotes

84
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,080
 about this from the prophet Matz-Wetla. "It is basically an arrow." So like the way it's, it's

85
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,600
 not just like a pile of poop, it's like pile of poop. It is pile of poop, but it kind of has a point

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,480
 to it. So it almost looks like an arrow, like a weapon. Here's the quote. "Stop touching it."

87
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,440
 Let me read this quote. Quit trying to touch it. "It is basically an arrow, a specimen of witchcraft,

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,160
 a sign of looming war. We are fighting a spiritual battle." And then we have this quote involving

89
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,320
 the investigation. I love this as well, because you know, they all kind of gather around and they're

90
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,920
 poking it with toothpicks and stuff like that. Quote. "Initially, we thought it could be cat's poo,

91
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:28,000
 but it was way too big to have come from such an animal." Again, the marks on the couch showed

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,840
 that something heavier, probably a dog sat there. The only probability is that it could have entered

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,560
 through a broken window, but it doesn't make sense that a dog would go through the trouble to get into

94
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:46,880
 the church. The window is high and small. So the idea, the skeptics version of this is that, yes,

95
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,960
 first off, why do you have broken windows in your church, dude? Like fix your, fix your broken windows.

96
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,720
 You can do that, right? But I don't know why I'm window-shaming you. You apparently they have a

97
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,280
 broken window in the church and a dog would have had to climb up, come through the window, take a

98
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,560
 dump, and then climb back out. So they're saying even if it was a dog, it would still be out of

99
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,280
 character for an animal like that. They believe that this poop may not even be for many animal at

100
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,040
 all, but from some sort of demonic entity sitting down and pooping. And this isn't the first time

101
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,920
 it's happened. This isn't the first time this has happened at all. In 2018, there was another building

102
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,440
 that belonged to this church in that same area that there was a chew mark through the door.

103
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,680
 Something had chewed its way through the door, snuck in and took a dump and then snuck back out.

104
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,520
 And after this happened at one of the church elders' homes, there was hyena poop

105
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:51,120
 sitting on its couch in his house. So something, something is pooping all over the place. Now,

106
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,760
 there's really two reasonable answers to this, right? One is there's a pervert. And I'm not going

107
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,200
 to point fingers, but first of you, can you, you know, like there's Occam's razor. Once you eliminate

108
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,160
 all of the possibilities, whatever remaining, no matter how ludicrous is the likely answer,

109
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:17,520
 there's also whoever smelt it, dealt it. So I would say that the church elder who found the

110
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,880
 quote hyena droppings at his house, that was evidence that he left. I think they should

111
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,160
 look more in it. Allegedly, don't sue me, a nameless church elder. This is a true story. There's

112
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,760
 photographs if you want to see a picture of yellow poop on a pew. I think the church elders chewed

113
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,960
 his way through the door. Crawled in pooped, snuck out back in 2018. That didn't scare him enough.

114
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,400
 So then he pooped, he went to the church pooped, and then he was walking back. He's like, oh,

115
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,080
 I still got to go. I still got to go. And he runs home. Couldn't make it to the bathroom on time,

116
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,960
 pooped on his couch and then goes, Oh, it happened here too. It happened here too.

117
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,120
 And also I'm part hyena. And he attacks them all. That's the twist ending. Fate to black.

118
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,240
 Are you afraid of the dark? The music starts playing. Credits start rolling. But that's the most

119
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,120
 likely possibility. The other possibilities, there's actually a demon breaking into this church

120
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,080
 pooping or a demon possessing animals to break into the church and poop. Both are troubling,

121
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,000
 right? Like what would you rather do? What would you rather do? You walk home and you walk into your

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,760
 house. There's a dog pooping in your, you don't have a dog. Okay. Because if you have a dog,

123
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,400
 this means nothing. You walk into your house. You walk to a location where you know a dog

124
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,480
 doesn't exist. You walk into a bank. Okay. You walk into your local bank and you watch a dog walk in,

125
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
 poop on the ground and leave. That's weird, right? But that's not supernatural. If you were just,

126
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,120
 we're just at the bank and then just, you heard something go totally like just normal bank noises.

127
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,520
 There's like the cute teller chatting it up with her cute coworkers. There's like the security guard

128
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,840
 trying to stay awake. He's tipping his gun up. He's using his gun to tip his hat up like Andy

129
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:06,640
 Griffith. And then you hear an, and then Jack is like, why did I subscribe? Why did I get mentioned

130
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,120
 on this episode when he's emulating a demon going poop? Imagine you're sitting in a bank and all of

131
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,000
 a sudden you hear like a moaning noise and then you just see yellow poop appear out of nowhere

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,480
 and land on the ground. That would be super terrifying, right? That would be the worst.

133
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,760
 That would be worse. So I originally, I was going to say what would be worse,

134
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,760
 seeing a dog possessed by a demon taking a dump or seeing a demon taking a dump. And I think I

135
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,440
 answered my own question. Seeing poop materialize out of thin air would be terrifying. You would

136
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,960
 never want to go to the bathroom again. You wouldn't even want to think about going to the bathroom

137
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,520
 again. I still think it's a person though, because what would be the benefit of that? Like,

138
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,160
 that one had stopped me from praying. I guess if I was like at a church and he was pooping on me

139
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
 while I was praying, I'd be pretty perturbed. But I've all looked at my church and like demons

140
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,200
 were pooping everywhere. I'd just be like, that means I'm doing something right. Demons don't mess

141
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,960
 with bad ministers, right? Because they're like, oh, that guy already sucks. I'm not going to ruin

142
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,760
 that dude's day. But if you're on the right message and Satan's like more poop, I keep 14 legions up

143
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,160
 to Botswana right now. I need, but sir, our poop reserves are running low. Then get more poop.

144
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,480
 Everyone's like, uh, gotta stop this minister. We're going to bury him in a tsunami of diarrhea.

145
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,200
 I want peanuts as far as I can see. Yes, master. I mean, then you know you're doing something right.

146
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,520
 The bank analogy is worse because you're just trying to cash the check. You're not trying

147
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,400
 to praise God. You're not getting interrupted there. But I personally would be proud if Satan

148
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,680
 was trying to poop all over my service, because that means that I'm a good minister. So hats off to

149
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,080
 you, prophet Matswetla. Hats off to you. You are doing, you literally are doing the Lord's work.

150
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:54,720
 And Satan can't poo nothing about it. You like it? Nothing? Like, nut in? Can't let me try that again.

151
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:06,560
 And Satan can't poo nut in about it. SHIT. So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

152
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,600
 How's that for a segue? So Jack Hayes, let's fire up that carbonic

153
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,960
 compter one more time. We're leaving Africa. We're headed back to the United States.

154
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:20,080
 We're going to land in a forest. And this is where the details get sketchy. Yes, right before the

155
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,080
 story starts, even the location we have to have some wiggle room with. Because what we're going to

156
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:34,160
 be talking about is a story requested by Vertigo22. Now, Vertigo22, YouTube listener, very, very

157
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,640
 appreciative, listens to the show, enjoyed. He is an interesting figure, because he's a pivotal

158
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,440
 figure in this story as well. We'll get to him in a second. But he requested this story once on

159
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,600
 YouTube a couple months, maybe about a month or two back. And then he requested it again during

160
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,080
 our live stream. And I started looking into it and he actually pops up while we're talking about

161
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,760
 the story. So it's just kind of an interesting thing. We got a lot of stuff to talk about.

162
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,680
 But first, and thank you, Vertigo22 for recommending the story as well. So here we go. Really,

163
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,560
 this story has two functions. Apparently, back in 2008, 2009, there was a creepypasta

164
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,560
 floating around the internet. Now, creepypasta, for those of you who don't know, is basically a

165
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,080
 short story, a fable. It's basically, it comes from the term copy and paste, where you just someone

166
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,160
 writes a story online and then you copy and paste it and post it somewhere else. Copy, paste, copy,

167
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,680
 pastas, what that became. And then those stories that were scary were considered creepypasta. So

168
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,080
 it's a short, it's a campfire story. It's a story that's passed around a lot. So what a creepypasta

169
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:45,280
 is. Slender Man, Jeff the Killer, Russian Sleep Experiment. These are all creepypastas.

170
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:54,800
 The rake, skin walkers, stuff like that. So there was supposedly a story back in 2008, 2009,

171
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,640
 known as the camera heads. We only have fragments of the story and people who read it,

172
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,440
 it's weird. Let's get into, let's get into what the story actually says and then we'll get into the

173
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,680
 myth behind the story. There's a lot of layers to this. A man one day was out walking.

174
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:22,080
 That's his feet walking over dried leaves, little twigs. Snap, snap, snap. Birds.

175
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:32,240
 He's like, oh, it's beautiful sound. And then he comes across like books scattered in all directions.

176
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,280
 What is this? That appears to be some sort of collection of pages with some

177
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,440
 binding on both. Is this one of those books I've heard about? And he picks it up. He's like,

178
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,160
 it is. I've heard about these in other books. He sees a bunch of books everywhere. There's a

179
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,520
 backpack in the middle of the pile of books. What? That's weird. A backpack and books in the same

180
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,440
 location. What is this? The twilight zone? He's walking over to the backpack and he sees in the

181
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:08,400
 backpack a cassette tape and a broken camera. Interesting books and backpacks in the same

182
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,320
 location. A videocassette and a camera that can hold said videocassette in the same location.

183
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:21,360
 The plot thickens. These are all weird items. What is going on here? And then he finds a note

184
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:30,640
 also in the backpack that says, "I killed a camera head." He puts the tape in when he gets home

185
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,880
 because this story takes place in a time when some people still had VCRs.

186
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:45,120
 And it appears to be found footage, first person views of someone walking around. Nothing too

187
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,040
 sinister, right? But he begins this, this nameless hero begins to try to figure out like who took

188
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,200
 this video footage? What is a camera head? What does this backpack have to do with anything?

189
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,720
 And as he's trying to solve this, the camera heads begin to hunt him as well.

190
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,480
 So that's the story. That's the creepypasta. Well, to be fair, that's the only thing people remember

191
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:17,040
 because see this creepypasta existed pre-2008-2009. It was going around. It got to the point that we

192
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,080
 see traces, we see little fragments on the internet. It got to the point where people were tired of

193
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,160
 hearing about the camera heads on the 4chan board, the paranormal board X. People were comparing it

194
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,800
 to the 2012 prophecy, to Nibiru, to Slender Man. They're like, "Enough. We're tired of hearing about

195
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:42,400
 camera heads." So it was completely a well-known conspiracy theory. It really wasn't a conspiracy

196
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,040
 theory. A lot of people said it was a game. It was an ARG. So people would post stories about

197
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,240
 camera heads and then there'd be photos and maybe even videos that documented this whole thing.

198
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,000
 And it all disappeared. All trace of it disappeared. There used to be a Wikipedia type site, a Wiki

199
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,800
 4X called Xenopedia. And it documented all of this stuff. It had all of these creepypastas,

200
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,440
 but of course they got trolled into oblivion, which happens. That's why we can't have nice things.

201
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,160
 It got trolled into oblivion, there's a bunch of infighting, and everything gets wiped.

202
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:24,240
 Everything gets wiped from the server. So whatever the creepypasta was, it's only in people's memories

203
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,560
 now. So a lot of people have been trying to figure out, "Is this real? What did it entail?"

204
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,160
 Things like that. What is most likely, is the person who invented the creepypasta camera heads,

205
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:43,040
 has either passed away, has no idea that people are still looking for this, or does and doesn't care.

206
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,560
 Those are kind of the three likelihoods. It could have been a marketing gimmick for a real product

207
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,440
 that never got released, so they just stopped doing it. It could be a whole host of things.

208
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,000
 But no one has come forward to say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was the one who started that back in 2008."

209
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 So, but you just have these little whispers around. And then some people go on and try to figure out

210
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,880
 where the camera heads came from, what inspired these things. So most of this research I got from

211
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,360
 two people, actually. They did a lot of research on who inspired the camera heads. One of them was a

212
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,880
 Reddit user named Hope1820. The other one was Vertigo22, the guy who recommended the story in the

213
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,360
 first place. Vertigo22 has a website called Limitless Possibilities. It's a ton of really

214
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,440
 interesting articles about conspiracy theories and paranormal stuff and 40 and stuff. He goes

215
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,400
 through the conspiracy theory iceberg. I'd recommend giving his website a check. I did get a bunch

216
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,280
 of my information from that. And both the Reddit user and Vertigo22 go into who they think inspired

217
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,240
 the story of the camera heads. Whether it was a Hellraiser character from Hellraiser 3 Hell on

218
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,520
 Earth, named literally Camera Head, to a villain that was cut out of the game Manhunt. They had

219
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,800
 cameras on their heads and business suits. There was actually a real group in Seattle called the

220
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,520
 Camera Heads. It was a performance art group that predated the story. They were doing this in 2008.

221
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,760
 They were wearing business suits with red ties, big cameras on their heads. A lot of times camera

222
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,440
 heads are compared physically to Slender Man, who wears a business suit, red tie. And those are all

223
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,200
 interesting things where who could have inspired this stuff. But I think there's a more interesting

224
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,120
 point here. Whether or not the creepypasta does exist. I don't think there's a mystery to whether

225
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,960
 or not the creepypasta existed. I'm not interested in whether or not the creepypasta existed,

226
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,880
 because it is. That has existed. We just don't have it anymore. And that happens all the time.

227
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,880
 People are going to write books that they do a first printing. I think about musicians. I have a

228
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,640
 collection of music made by a failed artist who released one album and then never released or

229
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,360
 recorded another song again. And then their CD Baby account went dead and that's the only album.

230
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,280
 They only printed a thousand albums and that's it. If you don't have one of those thousand albums,

231
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,080
 you'll never hear the music. It predates digital and stuff like that. That's incredibly common for

232
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,200
 stuff to get wiped out. It seems weird nowadays because everything's so archived. But for older

233
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,240
 people, it's quite normal. You have a magazine and then the magazine stops publishing and then

234
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,360
 you'd be like, "Hey, I remember that article." There's no way to get that article at all. We look at

235
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,400
 lost films and stuff like that. So that would be the equivalent of this basically lost media is

236
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,160
 what this is. The story of the camera heads is interesting, but that's not the main reason why

237
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,160
 I covered this. The story of the camera heads is this. ARG or not, here's the story of the camera

238
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,120
 heads. It's people with cameras in their heads or foreheads. Not in your forehead, but your whole

239
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,200
 head is a camera. That's ridiculous, right? Your whole head's a camera. That's impossible. A human

240
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:57,120
 with a video camera installed in their head is actually the most believable cryptid I think

241
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,160
 we might have covered on this show. I'm not talking about... I think it's more believable than Bigfoot.

242
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:10,400
 Absolutely. It's more believable than Bigfoot. Bigfoot was believable in 1864 when half of America

243
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,080
 wasn't explored and you never knew what was going to be around the other corner. Now every day that

244
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,480
 passes and we don't find Bigfoot, Bigfoot becomes a little harder to believe. He may be real. He may

245
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,720
 be real, but the idea of being... You don't need to enable. You can live without both eyes, but you

246
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,800
 could definitely live without one. So the idea of somebody having part of their face removed

247
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,440
 and having a mechanism put in there to record is incredibly believable. Whether or not it's supposed

248
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,600
 to look like a human eye or you're like that Hellraiser villain, you have a little camera

249
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,360
 coming out of your eyeball. Are you ready for your close-up? It's an actual line from that movie.

250
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,760
 That's believable. I'm not saying it would be comfortable. I'm not saying I would volunteer

251
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,480
 to do it, but you could easily remove someone's eyeball and put a camera in there. You could

252
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,800
 turn someone into a camera head using today's technology. You don't need anything special

253
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,960
 about it. Now you would have to have the cassette tape stuff outside of the head. I'm not saying that

254
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,000
 you also don't need part of your job, but you actually don't. But you could have... And now

255
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,360
 a day, in 2008, smart cars, like little digital smart thingies were just kind of coming in vogue.

256
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,760
 You still would have been thinking about using like a DV cassette, a little cassette at the very

257
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,400
 least, but nowadays you could put a camera in someone's eye and it uploads to the cloud. It wouldn't

258
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,480
 be hard to build a camera head. And I think that's the more interesting part about it. If anything,

259
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,360
 this creepypasta is way ahead of the curve. I think it's possible. I think it's more possible

260
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,400
 than Slenderman, who's a supernatural entity, or the rake. And it's funny if Bigfoot... If the

261
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,960
 story's a Bigfoot started today, he would be considered the equivalent of Slenderman or the rake.

262
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,760
 He would be considered creepypasta. It's because he has such a storied past that he's up there with

263
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,800
 these other major cryptids, like giant sea serpents and stuff like that.

264
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:17,680
 And he's not a demon. But the camera head can exist. It's not a winged demon. It's not a ghost.

265
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,400
 It relies on nothing supernatural. All it relies on is two things. Somebody's need to know what's

266
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,760
 going on at all times and the technology to do it. The idea of carving out somebody's eyeball

267
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,440
 and putting in a camera. And let's say, let's remove the videocassette from it, because again,

268
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,200
 then you have this bulky thing. And then you have it either uploading to the cloud,

269
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,320
 or you have a chip that you can pull out and upload as well. You got backup, right? You got to

270
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,160
 have redundant systems. If you're building a camera into someone's head, you don't want them to just,

271
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,360
 you know, like go through a tunnel and you obviously lose signal. The big question would be why? What

272
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,480
 would be the advantage of poking a hole in somebody's head and then putting a big old camera in there?

273
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,000
 And then you start to look at stuff like disguising it with the eyeball. And that's kind of what

274
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,080
 Vertigo 22 was saying. A police state where some people have the ability to record people

275
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,520
 through their recording eyeball. Both of them would basically be considered camera heads. Their

276
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:27,120
 head is a camera in a sense. So it's possible that this ARG, this game people were playing back then,

277
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,720
 was real. Because the technology definitely exists for that. And it's possible that what people saw

278
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,360
 these clues and this guy's descent into madness and these cries for help to the point that other

279
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,320
 people got tired of hearing about it, were real. It's possible that the reason why the person who

280
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,560
 originally started this story, even though people are still looking for any proof of this camera head,

281
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:03,520
 creepypasta, is no longer responding, is because he can't. And it's possible that the real reason

282
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:11,520
 that the files got perched from Xenopedia wasn't because of infighting or trolling from outside.

283
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,840
 While those two things were definitely going on, someone went in and deleted the only story that

284
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,200
 really mattered. Any clues to the existence of the camera heads. The fact is we don't know either

285
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:33,360
 away. There's such scant proof that this was a game or that this was a real story that seemed like a

286
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,280
 game to people who are already overly skeptical because they got dragged into the game of Marble

287
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,720
 Hornets. Because they got dragged into the prophecy of 2012. They're already overly skeptical. That

288
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,120
 when someone says "I found a note that says I killed a camera head," he just got filed with all

289
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:58,640
 the other nonsense that was going on at the time. Camera heads are possible. Not only are camera

290
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,840
 heads possible, camera heads are likely. Because we do have a group that wants to know what you do

291
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,880
 at all times. It's called the government. It's called any corporation that wants to market a

292
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,960
 product to you. So the question isn't "are camera heads real?" because they definitely could be,

293
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:24,320
 right? The question is what event led to a torn backpack, a broken camera, and a note in the

294
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,840
 middle of the forest? So the next time you're out and about and you see a stranger staring at you

295
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:43,520
 a little bit too long, walk a little faster. You may be being observed. It doesn't mean you're

296
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,400
 doing anything wrong. But you don't want to stay there too long. Because for all you know,

297
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:59,280
 you will be swept up into a mystery world of intrigue and danger as these things

298
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,560
 track your every move. And in your last moments you may find yourself writing out a note

299
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:15,440
 to leave among your belongings a clue to what has happened. That you too killed a camera head.

300
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,640
 And you don't have much time left. They know where you're at. They're always watching.
