1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 When a young man wants to get something to eat, all of a sudden the police state steps on his neck.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 What a shame.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we travel to Mexico to take a look at the story of a young boy who was working at a construction site.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 It's a 11 year old kid working at a construction site.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 And he accidentally makes a big mess of things.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 After he is quickly and severely punished, he runs to the safety of a shack on the edge of the construction site.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And there he comes face to face with something that defies explanation.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend. We got a ton of stuff to cover.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So let's go ahead and get started right away.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of my original listeners.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 One of the original 14 people who were listening to this podcast back in 2018.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And a close personal friend of mine.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Veronica.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Wooo yeah, come on in Veronica. Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Veronica's moving away. Veronica's moving away last week.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 We've had a great friendship over the past six years.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And she was one of the original listeners of Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 A longtime supporter of the show, a longtime supporter of me, and she's moving away.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 She's moving away so I wanted to go ahead and put her in the pilot seat this time.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I'll still talk to her, you know, we'll still chat and stuff like that.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 But it definitely sucks when one of your friends moves away, but she is on to much bigger and much better things.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 She's going to have such an adventure into where she's going.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 So Veronica, thank you so much for being such a great friend and for all the years of our friendship going forward.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Also, let's take a look at this fan art from Paul Iana.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Paul, thank you so much for this. This is like a military Air Force type badge for Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I love it very much. I love getting all of the fan art you guys send me.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's fantastic. So for fan art Friday, Paul, really, really appreciate it.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 We do have a lot of stuff to cover. So Veronica, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Jason Jalopy.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed all the way out to Joaquin, Texas.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 [Jazzy music]

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 On Monday's episode, you're like Jason, please don't bring that back up, please.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I promise I'm going to shut the podcast off.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 On Monday's episode, we covered a guy who killed a cat in an Arby's restaurant.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And then left.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 It's kind of the polite thing to do, right? You don't stick around. You've outlasted. You're welcome.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 He was an ex-employee of this Arby's restaurant.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 He got fired for setting fires throughout the restaurant.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Multiple fires over the period of time. They must have really needed an employee.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 They didn't fire him the first time he set a fire.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 He then went back a couple of months later and eviscerated a cat in the bathroom of an Arby's.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And I remember saying in that episode, I go like, at what point did this guy decide to do that?

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Did he always like chopping up cats? Or was it a one-off thing? I don't know.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 We never came to a conclusion. Who knew that you couldn't solve the secrets of the human mind over the course of a half-hour podcast?

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And that's where this story leads us as well.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But this one has an interesting spin on it. This really has an interesting spin on it,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 because Fault, this guy for whatever disgusting things you want, this guy is a monster.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 He's kind of polite. He's kind of polite. Just a little bit.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 In Joaquin, Texas, this is back in October 2018, a young 23-year-old man named Alexander Nathan Barter

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 posted a request on the Deep Web, on some hidden site somewhere out in the Deep Web or Dark Web, whatever they're calling it nowadays.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And he asked in the most polite way, because I'm telling you right now, I feel like I'm kind of disguised as a defense lawyer, even though he's already been sentenced.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 There's a lot of criminals out there who would not do this. He asked for permission.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 He asked for permission. It's very polite of you, Alexander.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Muggers don't do that. Muggers don't wait to see a guy walking around. He has pocket-throttle of money. He has money in each hand.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And he just bought a coffee and he can't carry it. He's like, "Oh man, I wish someone would mug me."

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 There's a guy who pulls down his ski mask. He goes, "Now it's my time to shine."

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Most criminals, by definition, are predators. Well, he posted on the Dark Web,

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 "I'd like to try necrophilia and cannibalism and see how it feels to take a life. If you'd be willing to let me kill you, or in the U.S., preferably in the south, and can travel by car."

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 This guy must be so poor. He wants to murder people, but he can't afford gas money. If you live in the south of the United States and can travel by car, contact me.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And I imagine there was some guy in Pittsburgh being like, "Oh, finally. I found my soulmate. I've always wanted to be killed and eaten."

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And then he reads the rest of the sentence. He's like, "Aww, a little teardrop. A little teardrop of pure barbecue sauce. I was born to be eaten."

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 So he posts this online, and the feds see it. The feds see it. Listen, man, there are law enforcement agents on every corner of the Internet.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I'm surprised people still do this. I know criminals keep changing the game. They'll move to Telegram.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I think now the big thing is a lot of them are on kick, on this messaging app, kick.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But what'll happen is then the feds swarm that, and then someone discovers another way to communicate or invent one.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And the criminals go to that, and then the feds jump on that one, and just like this chase. This guy's way behind the times.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 This Alexander dude, he's living in the 2010s, man. Posting this on the dark web, the feds find him.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So they begin chatting him up. And they're like, "I am from the south, and I'm so yummy."

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Whenever mosquitoes bite me, they always sit there and they rub their little tummy. "I'm so yummy, you should eat me."

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And he's getting these responses. One of the things that a fed actually said, they weren't talking about how yummy they were.

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 The head of the FBI is like, "Get out of the way. Get out of the way. I'm the yummiest of all of us." I'll talk to him.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 One of these federal agents says, "This is weird, too." Because that's what he's saying. I'd like to try necrophilia and--

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Okay, that's weird, right? His statement's weird. He wants to try necrophilia and cannibalism.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 But then, like, he wants it to be a willing participant.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 What happens is an undercover federal agent contacts him and says, "Well, I got a treat for you. I don't want to be eaten, but my 13-year-old daughter--"

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Maybe she does. I'm not gonna ask her. I'm not gonna ask her, but tell you what. Why don't we meet up at this hotel?

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 You can kill and eat my 13-year-old daughter. And Alexander says yes. He says yes to eating this kid.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 So, remember when I said he was polite in the beginning? You're not polite now, because she wasn't in on it.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Apparently, they came up with this whole backstory where it's like, "You bring your daughter out to walking Texas.

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 We will tell her we're going on a hiking trip together, but instead you'll take her to this hotel. We'll all kill her and eat her."

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 So anyways, and then, you know, 'cause this is what the police do, they say, "We want you to bring these four items.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 We want you to bring, like, a knife, some hot mustard packets from McDonald's, a camera. Like, they'll give them specific things to bring,

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 so that way when they arrest this guy, they could show intent."

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 If he just showed up, he could say, "Well, no, I didn't actually want to eat the person. I just wanted to see who would be so sick to offer their 13-year-old daughter for someone else to eat."

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 If he showed up with a bib and some hand wipes, he's obviously going to eat somebody, right?

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So they did that, and what happened was Alexander, he gets ready for this, this is on October 19th, he steps outside of his house,

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 and there's a bunch of cops outside and they arrest him.

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And he's found guilty of this. He's found guilty of all these crimes. He gets 40 years in prison, so this guy's 23 years old.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 If you don't know, if you don't know how to do that, he cannot get out of prison until he's 63.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 That's insane. Again, what he was planning on doing was insane, and I'm not saying that that's not a just sentence,

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 but I just can't imagine being 23 years old and making a mistake that impactful.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I shouldn't say mistake. This guy didn't want to eat a human body.

95
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's not just, it's not like, "Oh, it's all we made a mistake. It's a criminal act."

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 What if that was interesting? I don't know if this is a common police tactic.

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I don't hunt cannibals professionally, but the police officer said my daughter's 13 years old.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So because of that, and I guess they said bring a camera, he got hit with like attempted child pornography manufacturing or something like that.

99
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And which is it super interesting, because he never, as far as we can tell, the information that's been released in the media,

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 he never specified he wanted it to be a kid. He was looking for like a willing victim, and the police said,

101
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 "Oh no, my 13 year old daughter's going to be there. Bring a camera."

102
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And they threw on another like, "That's a huge charge. That charge alone is like 5, 10 years."

103
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So yeah, just weird. I guess that's a crime fighting technique, right?

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You make it so gross to the jury after they get done vomiting, they go guilty.

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 That guy's obviously a sicko. Now I'm not defending him, right?

106
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I've actually done several versions of this story. The first 20 minutes was me editing out to make sure it's clear.

107
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I'm not defending the guy. I just find it super weird on that legal level.

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I'm just fascinated by the whole story. And again, like, how did Alexander even get to this point in his life,

109
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 where when he's 23 years old, he decides to throw it all away. All of it.

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 For this weird fantasy. And what's so interesting to me, like, did his brain break? Was he always mentally sick?

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Did he start watching some really, really horrible stuff online? And he goes,

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 "Oh, this is good. It's sending endorphins to his brain. He's constantly looking for the next big thrill."

113
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Like, how did he get to this point? And what I find so fascinating about this, for all he knows, humans taste super gross.

114
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Like, he put it all on the line. Imagine if McDonald's came out with a new hamburger tomorrow, called the Forbidden Burger.

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And the only way that you could get the Forbidden Burger is to dip your hands into hot grease to pull it out yourself.

116
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 But it's supposedly the best tasting burger on the planet. And if you want, you could have sex with it before you eat it. Would you eat it?

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Now, I'm assuming if you would, I'm assuming if you would, you would not admit it. You're not going to go on my YouTube channel and be like, "I'd order too."

118
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 But that's the equivalent of this. You don't even know if it is the best burger ever made. But he wanted to eat a person, and now he's in prison for 40 years.

119
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Which, I mean, for the most part, is the rest of his life, right? He'll get out when he's 63 and he'll be completely flabbergasted.

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Like, "Oh man, I worked up such an appetite in prison." You start walking down the street and you go to a retirement home.

121
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 "Nom nom nom nom nom." You can't get away from you if they're too old. Weird, totally weird story. Was he always this crazy or what? Who knows?

122
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Veronica! Veronica's like, "I didn't even want to be in this show. I didn't even want to be in this episode. I'm moving away, you freak."

123
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Veronica, you can't leave yet. Veronica, let's go ahead and attach the keys to the carpenter copter. We're headed all the way out to Mexico.

124
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 *mimics car noises*

125
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I found this story posted online fairly recently, maybe in the past two weeks, by someone who goes by the name BUSHITOBROWN.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Really, really interesting story, and it's one that just makes us ask, "Huh?"

127
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 We're headed back to the late 1970s, and we're going to a state in Mexico known as Guerrero, and this region is a particularly rugged region of Mexico.

128
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Apparently, like, I was trying to look at the map and read a little bit about this region. I think it's also where Alcapulco, maybe, the tourist resort,

129
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 but a lot of it is rugged mountainous terrain and it's primary populated by the indigenous people of Mexico.

130
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And back in the 1970s, we have a young boy, he grew up in this region, he never really left this area.

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 He's between the ages of 9 and 11, he's just a young boy, and we don't have a name for him, we're going to call him Billy.

132
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So Billy was working at a construction site, I hope he was closer to 11 than 9, but he was working at a construction site with his father,

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 and they are currently putting up the walls of a large ranch.

134
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And Billy goes out to the shed on the edge of the construction site and he's mixing cement, and then he has to load it up on a wheelbarrow and roll it.

135
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 What's the verb for using a wheelbarrow? Push.

136
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 He had to use a wheelbarrow to get the cement from one end of the construction site over to where his father and all the other workers were,

137
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 and as he's getting close to them, he's like, "Look, I'm a big boy, I'm 9 years old, I can carry 50 pounds of cement in a wheelbarrow."

138
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Well, apparently he shouldn't have been bragging, he should have been paying attention to where he was going,

139
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 because right when he gets up to where the workers are, he spills it.

140
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Which I imagine cleaning up cement is quite difficult.

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You're like, "Hurry up boys, otherwise we're just going to have this giant lump in the middle of this ranch."

142
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Well, the jokes end because his dad is a real piece of work, right?

143
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Billy's dad is just a piece of trash.

144
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And when this little boy, who has no business at a construction site to begin with,

145
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 makes a little boy mistake, his dad hits him.

146
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 His dad straight up punches Billy and starts screaming at him, calling him a worthless piece of garbage.

147
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Get out of here. Get out of here before you mess something else up.

148
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So little Billy runs away, because what else are you going to do, right?

149
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 You can't take on your pops. I mean, you wish you could.

150
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Right, but he's just not strong enough.

151
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Well, Billy runs away and he runs back to that little shed he was previously at,

152
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 that's sitting on the far end of the construction site.

153
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 He runs and he shuts the door and he is sobbing.

154
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 He's sobbing because he's in pain, he's sobbing because he's afraid and all this.

155
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 They're just horrible situations.

156
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And in this little shed, the shed is basically like a 12 by 12 shed.

157
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 It's a fairly small shed.

158
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And there's like a bench in there where you can kind of sit down and then you basically just look at the wall across from you.

159
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It's full of nails and cement and all these other supplies and stuff like that.

160
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And Billy's in the shed and he's crying.

161
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And he's bored, right? You're crying, but that doesn't mean that's super exciting.

162
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 He's looking down on the ground and he sees a car magazine.

163
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 He picks it up, he starts going through it, his teardrops are ruining the page.

164
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 He's like, "Oh, I really wanted to cut that out and put it in my dream journal."

165
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 "Now it's ruined. Just like the cement. Why did I remember the cement?"

166
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He's looking through this car magazine and all of a sudden something is off.

167
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He feels something is different.

168
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It's not like an electrical discharge. There's no noise.

169
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 There's no overwhelming sense of fear. Just something's not right.

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Billy turns to his right. Something draws his attention.

171
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He looks to his right. Now his back, he's sitting on that bench.

172
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So his back is to one of the walls of this shed.

173
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And when it looks to his right, on the wall, right next to him,

174
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 maybe six inches from his shoulder, he sees a giant purple hole.

175
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 He's kind of staring at it. Now he had just been in the shed earlier this day, getting the cement.

176
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And then he ran in the shed when he was crying. He didn't see anything like this.

177
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 He sees this purple hole on the side of the wall.

178
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 He said, the way he described it to his stepson, Bushido Brown,

179
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 he goes, "Imagine if someone took a three-foot in diameter purple piece of construction paper

180
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 and just placed it on the wall. It was just this hole, but it almost was just a solid purple color.

181
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 It was flat. It was flat against the wall. And then outlining the purple hole was this tube

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 that ran all around the circumference of the purple portal.

183
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 He said it was this dull yellow tubing that had I thought about it at the time, I probably could have grabbed it.

184
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Like it actually came out of the wall. He goes, "The purple hole was flat against the wall.

185
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 There was nothing to grab onto, but as I think about this, because he thinks about it from time to time,

186
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 he goes, "I feel like I could have actually touched the yellow tubing."

187
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 But he sees this and this isn't supposed to be right.

188
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 He's been in here multiple times. He's never seen this before.

189
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 So he readjusts his body because he wants to look into this.

190
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Because right now he's kind of seen it from a profile.

191
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And he's kind of turning his body, he's kind of craning his neck to look and see what this is.

192
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And as he is craning his neck over to get a better view, he sees a human come out.

193
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Now, not all the way. It's just a man's head and shoulders kind of pop out of this hole,

194
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 as if you were looking out of a window, just kind of leaning out.

195
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It startles him and he's looking at this guy who's leaning out of this hole, but the guy doesn't notice Billy.

196
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 This guy who's leaning out of the hole, he's looking at the opposing side.

197
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,060
 you

198
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,120
 you

199
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,180
 you

200
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,240
