00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
 Soybean trickery, a giant monster lurking in the forest, and is time running out for reality itself today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:19,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,120
 I hope you're having a great day. I'm having a great day. Great temperature. It took a long nap.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,840
 It's really nice out. I needed that nap because I finished recording the Bell Ray Surge episode,

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:37,120
 The Prince of Bell Ray, probably around 11, which is normal, 11 o'clock at night, but the episode was 49

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,000
 minutes long before I edited it up. Now usually what you hear is what was recorded. I don't do

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,760
 many edits. Sometimes I'll take out "uhs" or certain words, you know, "mmm," but it's normally how

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,960
 you hear it is how it was recorded, and I kind of did that on purpose. So if I have a 20 minute

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,680
 podcast, it takes me maybe 20 minutes to edit it, listening to it back. Just keep it casual. Just

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,680
 keep it casual. Last night's episode, though, 49 minutes long was way too long for the information

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,160
 presented, and I found myself repeating stuff, and I went on like a five minute rant about the

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,280
 Illuminati, and I was like, "ugh." So I, and to really, to get down 19 minutes, I had to take out

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,480
 like two minute segments at a time. So I ended up going to bed like at one in the morning,

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,200
 and I work at six in the morning. So I came home and got a good nap in. Today we actually have a,

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
 we're going to have a really cool episode, I think. There's some interesting stories going on. One of

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,120
 them I was thinking about a lot today, and I kind of changed direction on it, so I think that's

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,800
 fairly interesting. There may be, you may notice there's a bit of a change in my voice, a little bit

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,480
 of discomfort might be the right word. So what I've started doing, I drink a lot of soda, a lot of

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,680
 diet soda, and I was like, "you know what I'm going to try to do? I'm going to try to switch to coffee.

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,120
 Just drink in as much coffee as I did soda, just because it's cheaper, really, in bulk. But I like

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,920
 to drink a cold drink at summertime, so I've been buying coffee, brew it up, pour it into an empty

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,200
 diet Pepsi bottle, throw it in the fridge, and I'll make six bottles at a time or three bottles,

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,560
 you know, whatever. And I just keep using the same coffee, and I just like put more coffee in it,

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
 and da-da-da-da-da. So I make about six bottles at a time. I've been doing this for maybe about three

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:32,240
 or four days. How often do you think I horribly scald myself while pouring the hot coffee into

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,920
 the bottle? If you know me, if you know me in real life, you know the answer to that. It's about one

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,040
 out of six. So for the past three days, and not one out of six days, one out of six bottles,

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,760
 and I'm refilling them every day, for the past three days I have horribly scalded my left hand

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,880
 three times. Normally I don't record a podcast right after I burn my thumb so badly it changes

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,800
 color, and then just water being put on it burns as much as the original pain. I have a funnel,

31
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:13,600
 I'm not an idiot, but you know, obviously I need to work on my funnel game if I have a one in six

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,640
 chance of horribly scalding myself. And today it was so bad I actually dropped everything I was

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,600
 holding because it kind of covered my whole hand, so I lost even lost some coffee out of that,

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,320
 out of that bottle. So that kind of sucks. Now I only have four and a half bottles in there,

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,800
 five and a half bottles, something like that. I have a bottle out here for me. It's really good

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,000
 though. I'm thinking about learning how to cold brew coffee just so I don't burn myself horribly,

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,560
 but I need to buy some cheesecloth for that. So first conspiracy today is going to be one of our

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,880
 other food-based conspiracies. This one's interesting because it's happening right now. There's actually

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,560
 a court case going on about it. And you know, we look at these conspiracies and they're like, oh,

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,840
 you know, this evil group is trying to use cannibalism to control these politicians who will

41
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,880
 then pass these laws that will bring about the New World Order. Those are fun, sexy conspiracies

42
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,680
 because they get the blood boiling and they get the brain working. But the conspiracies that really

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:18,320
 like affect people are just fairly mundane and kind of cruel at the same time. So what the issue is

44
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:27,200
 is black farmers, specifically black farmers in the southwest and Louisiana, that area.

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,680
 Recently, well, last year, everyone buys Stein beans. Stein soybeans. It's a great product.

46
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,400
 They're not a sponsor of the show, trust me. They're not definitely going to want to be after

47
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,920
 this story. But anyways, the Stein beans are very well known. They're a great product. You

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,600
 plant them, they grow, they just produce great crops and they've always had their reputation of it.

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,400
 Generally, you drop $100,000 on just the soybean seeds or they just soy beans. Maybe the bean is

50
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
 the seed anyways. And then you buy another $100,000 worth of chemicals from them to help everything

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,880
 grow. Generally, you'll get 60 to 100 bushels out of a bag of these seeds. So in this area,

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,800
 you had white farmers buying these Stein seeds, planting them and going, "Oh, great crop. I got

53
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,000
 80, 90 bushels. I almost got the max. This is amazing. Hey, Craig, how are you doing?" And Craig,

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,480
 who's a black farmer, he's been in farming all of his life. His dad was a farmer, his grandpa was a

55
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,280
 farmer. He bought his Stein seeds, he bought his chemicals, he planted them, five bushels.

56
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,560
 Maybe 10, high end 10. He's like, "I don't know what's going on, Tom. I'm doing the exact same

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,800
 stuff you are. Our farmers are right next to each other. The rain falls on our crops the same way.

58
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,240
 I've been in it my whole life. You've been in it your whole life." Why isn't this working? Tom doesn't

59
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,840
 know. They start talking and what happens is they meet other farmers, black farmers, who are like,

60
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,000
 "Oh man, I'm having such a hard time with my crops. My soybeans aren't growing." And Craig's like,

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,920
 "Let me guess. You bought Stein seeds." And they're like, "Yeah. How'd you know?"

62
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,360
 They take these seeds down to Mississippi State University. They pop them on the table. "Hey,

63
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,160
 check these out. We think there's something wrong with them. They're not growing for us."

64
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,360
 And the researchers at Mississippi State University look at them and go, "Yeah,

65
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,080
 there is something wrong with them. They're fake. What do you mean they're fake? They're dormant.

66
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,200
 They would never grow under any circumstances whatsoever." They bought the seeds from Stein,

67
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,280
 who they've always bought the seeds from. And when you buy them from Stein, and I'm assuming other

68
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,400
 seed manufacturers, it's in a huge bag and it's sealed with a label on it to show that these

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,600
 things have been certified Stein seeds coming right off to the factory. Because obviously,

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,800
 fraud's been a problem in any industry. But when they opened these bags up and broke that certified

71
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,720
 seal and planted these, the seeds were fake. The question, there's multiple questions here. One,

72
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,080
 who, what was the end game here? Some people think it's just human greed. Sell someone a bunch of

73
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,400
 fake seeds for $100,000. You know, you pay $10,000 for the seeds. If that $500, they're useless.

74
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,840
 A dollar for the seeds. You can sell them for $100,000. The other one, the other conspiracy

75
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,680
 theory that is being put forward is that this is a concentrated effort, or concerted effort,

76
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,480
 I think it's the word, concentrated. This is a concerted effort to run black farms out of business.

77
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,960
 The lawyer, and this will all be in the article. There's a nice audio clip from the lawyer.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,560
 And he was saying that, you know, these farmers have lost a million dollars. Like,

79
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,840
 you invest $100,000 plus the chemicals. But the bushel, you make the money from the soybeans.

80
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,360
 Everyone, every food company wants to buy soybeans. It's in everything. They've lost all of that.

81
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,640
 And he's like, the point, the reason why this was done, the reason why black farmers were targeted,

82
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,960
 was to run black farmers out of business so white farmers could buy their land.

83
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,120
 You know, and that's always the funny thing with conspiracy theories,

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,920
 is that you come to a point where the facts, the absolute facts run out. And then that's the

85
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,520
 extrapolation. The absolute facts is that this group of farmers who were black were sold fake seeds,

86
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,560
 and their crops failed. That's 100% the truth. And they were in certified seed Steinbecks.

87
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,560
 The why, we know the who, what, when, where. Wait, who, what, when, where. Yeah, we know the who,

88
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:48,240
 what, when, where, and how. But we don't know the why. And so that's where we go start to go off into,

89
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:56,240
 you know, more conspiracy theory land. Now, Stein seed company has said, this is not true.

90
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,440
 What they are accusing of us is not true. They're not saying it was an independent

91
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,080
 distributor that they're investigating. They're not saying that, oh, that must have been a training

92
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,400
 batch. They're saying it's flat out not true that these farmers are absolutely lying about the

93
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,960
 whole thing. And again, when we talk about conspiracy theories, when you're, when you're,

94
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,480
 the person that conspiracy theory is against is a group we don't normally trust. Which group is

95
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,840
 more trustworthy to you, a group of small business owners, or a mega corporation. Now, to a person

96
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,480
 who works for mega corporation, top level, they may go, oh, the small business owners. But generally,

97
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,760
 the general population will go, oh, the small business owners are probably really did get

98
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,480
 ripped off because everyone's been ripped off. Once you throw race into that, it kind of throws

99
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
 the scales up a bit. Because now if I go, who do you trust more black people or white people,

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,400
 people go, I don't like that. And but obviously that plays a part in people's perceptions of

101
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,080
 these conspiracies. There may be people go, I don't trust black people. So the corporation's

102
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,280
 telling me the truth. But I don't think that's likely. I think people will generally say,

103
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,680
 yeah, it makes sense that a corporation would try ripping someone off. Racial component aside,

104
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,680
 they may go, I bet you those guys are ripped off. I don't know if they are ripped off,

105
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,680
 so white people could buy their land that's stretching it. Really what happens is it's

106
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,520
 going to come down to the court case. And I hope when they file the court case,

107
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,880
 that they don't include that part, because that is not very well linked for me. If I was a juror

108
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,840
 and they presented me with all the evidence, and the defense goes, well, what's the motive,

109
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,360
 why'd they do it? And the lawyer goes, human greed, human greed. Maybe it wasn't just targeted at

110
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,840
 black people. Maybe they randomly got them. Maybe a bunch of white farmers got them too,

111
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,960
 but don't know about it and haven't complained. And as a jurorist, I would go, that makes sense,

112
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:00,480
 because corporations are really, really greedy. If they say this was a huge concerted effort to

113
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:08,240
 eliminate the black farmer, as true as that might be, as true as that might be, as a juror, I'm

114
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,280
 going to go, I believe everything else. But I mean, that's now, once you start to get into motive,

115
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,000
 you kind of start losing me. That could honestly be why they did it. But I think a huge factor

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,960
 of it is human greed. Maybe it's both. Maybe it's both. I don't know. I would be interested to see

117
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,080
 if it was only black farmers that got these seeds, then I would say, yeah, it probably was an effort

118
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:42,000
 to destroy these farms. I imagine, the only way I can imagine that is, you don't order this stuff

119
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 out of a catalog. As far as I know, you have to go to a warehouse or a convention where you

120
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,160
 place your orders for seeds. And you have a line of a bunch of people, and there's two white farmers

121
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,800
 and a black farmer behind them. The white farmer goes, I'll take 10 bags, and the guy puts the bags

122
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,560
 on the table, and the white farmer comes up and goes, I'd take 10 bags and puts the white farmers

123
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,240
 white bags up on the table. The black guy comes up and the guy turns and pulls out of a different

124
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,760
 pile of stuff and goes, here you go. Or even if you're in like a warehouse and you get an order

125
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,680
 online, they're like, hey, buddy, which one do we pull the stuff out? The white pile or the black

126
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,480
 pile? Well, the name's Tyrese, so pull out of the black pile. I don't see that. I think someone

127
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,280
 just cut labels off, dumped fake seeds in there, and sold the real seeds on the black market.

128
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,720
 Either way, it's horrible. And either way, it is a conspiracy. One is a criminal conspiracy,

129
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,720
 and the other one is a, like, what we would consider an actual conspiracy theory. But I

130
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,160
 thought it was an interesting story, and it's something that I'm definitely going to try to

131
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,400
 keep involved in, not involved, but on top of, because I think it's a, I love the stories that

132
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,720
 are kind of happening right now, and especially the ones that involve law enforcement or any sort of

133
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,400
 record keeping, because that way you can actually prove them. The second story we're going to talk

134
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,800
 about, we're going to see if I can get to the big dog story. The big dog story is supposed to do on

135
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,080
 you know what, we'll talk about the big dog story now because it's super short. I came across this

136
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,400
 video on the Daily Star. Now, if you know about the Daily Star, it is probably one step above the

137
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,560
 onion. It writes the most ridiculous articles. It's the internet equivalent of the weekly

138
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,600
 world news, and that's saying a lot because there's a lot of fake news out there. This is like,

139
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,560
 takes the cake as far as fake stuff. So normally if I see that a link takes me to the Daily Star,

140
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,680
 I just ignore it unless I want to laugh, but this one has a video included. It could be fake,

141
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,680
 could be, but I don't know, and it's interesting to watch anyways. It's a video of a man, you see

142
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,480
 a dog in the middle of the woods, and then she's like a black dog laying on the ground,

143
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,400
 and the dog's barking at this black dog, and they're in the middle of the woods, and here the

144
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,960
 guy going like, get away, get away, like trying to get his dog to get away from it, and then you're

145
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,000
 watching this and you're like, what's going on? The black dog then gets up on its hind legs,

146
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,440
 and it looks like a dire wolf. It looks like, what are those things called, the wargs from

147
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,920
 the two towers? It is one of the biggest animals that I've seen outside of CGI, and the dog immediately

148
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,240
 reacts to it. I mean, it's huge. Now obviously you could watch it and go, ah, it's forced perspective,

149
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,200
 or it was CGI. I don't think so. Cryptids is one of the things, I'll all say, ah, the bell racers,

150
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,000
 I don't think happen, and there may be individual sightings of bigfoots, or UFOs, or fairies,

151
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,920
 or whatever that all just be like, yeah, I don't believe that, but I do think that cryptids are

152
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,920
 probably one of the more likely phenomenon. I think it's more likely that there is an undiscovered

153
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,640
 race of creatures, or even just one remaining creature left in the wilderness, than a lot of other

154
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,760
 paranormal ideas. Stuff like, I'm, you know, talking to the dead, seances and stuff like that,

155
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
 I'm usually like, eh, but you know, again, people who are like, yeah, I was in the middle of the

156
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,000
 woods and I saw this thing and it was like eight feet tall and it was a giant lizard, I got, fair

157
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,360
 enough, you know, I wasn't there, but generally those type of things, I could see that happening.

158
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,840
 So go ahead and, I'm gonna put that video on the links, it's just real crazy how this dog just,

159
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,600
 and I don't think it's a werewolf, a couple people were saying it was this side or the other thing,

160
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,680
 could just be a super massive wolf, but it's definitely scary. And then don't click on any

161
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,480
 other links on that website because they will, it's just trash, it's a trash website. Unless

162
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,200
 they want to sponsor me, and in that case just email me at deadrabbitradio.com, I will edit this

163
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,440
 episode and take that whole segment out. So our last story we're gonna do today is interesting for

164
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,680
 me because it's on the conspiracy list, it's on the iceberg conspiracy list. It was just three

165
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,120
 little letters. I looked it up, I found the information rather quickly and I thought it had a

166
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,760
 beautiful image. Thought I wanted to talk about it, just it's very short and had kind of this

167
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,520
 beautiful imagery tied to it. And I've been thinking about it because I kind of try to chart out what

168
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,600
 I'm gonna do for the week on this show. Past two days I was like, okay Thursday episode's about

169
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
 this and I've been thinking about it. I'm like, that's kind of just a nice visual, but I don't know

170
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:24,320
 how much I can really say about it. And then today something clicked. I thought, what if it's true?

171
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,040
 What if out of all the stuff I talk about, what if this one's true?

172
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:39,600
 So what it is, it's called the Bank of Souls. It's also known as, and forgive me if my pronunciation

173
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 is wrong, you know how normally I'm really on top of this stuff. But it's the guff. The guff

174
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:53,440
 specifically is the Bank of Souls, but there's a few levels going on here. So what we first have is a

175
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:05,840
 amazingly, mind-bogglingly huge tree that spreads through the universe across dimensions. It's

176
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:17,360
 everywhere. It's nowhere. It doesn't exist. It exists. And on that tree is the fruit of the most

177
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:30,560
 precious resource ever that is and ever will be. And it's a soul. And what happens is when that soul

178
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:42,160
 gets ripe, it falls from the tree. And it falls into the guff, which is a massive treasury of souls.

179
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,880
 This exists in what's known as Seventh Heaven, not the television show. That would be even weirder,

180
00:17:50,880 --> 00:18:00,880
 but it's not. So in the guff, these souls fall. And when a child is conceived on earth, the angel

181
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:09,280
 Gabriel reaches in, pulls out a soul, and brings it to earth. And the whole time this process is

182
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:17,200
 going on, this life before life, the tree is populated with blue jays that sing songs in joy

183
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:26,400
 of the life that is being created. It's a beautiful image. It's one of those things that I, when we

184
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,920
 look at ancient religion, the one thing I tell people, you know, people talk about the creation

185
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,040
 story or creation myth, however you want to look at it, the book of Genesis, I always say, how

186
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,720
 else, how do you explain evolution to a caveman? How do you explain the creation of a soul to a

187
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,320
 caveman? You would say, look at that tree and see how that bears fruit. That is also where we come

188
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,240
 from. Yet the tree is, is much more majestic. I do think it's interesting too that the human

189
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,320
 imagination is limitless. And whenever we talk about these metaphysical things, they take forms

190
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,880
 of objects that we know of, because even though our imagination is limitless, there's restrictions

191
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:17,120
 on it. It's this weird oxymoron. You can have these amazing characters in ancient religions and

192
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,560
 mythology, and they're like this creature who, who has existed before the universe was created

193
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,320
 has three heads, one of a lion, one of a crab, and one of a seahorse. And you're like, wait, those

194
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,840
 things didn't even exist before the universe was created. It's weird. There's this weird combination,

195
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,320
 because you can't just say, you know, "Sarabus was this creature that I can't even describe to you."

196
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,920
 I have to go, I was a, I was a dog with three heads, you know, call it a day.

197
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,600
 "Who's Zeus? Who's this great god?" I don't know, dude. He was a white dude with some lightning bolts.

198
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,480
 So it's weird, because these should be creatures that are indescribable. The tree of life should be

199
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,040
 something that actually can't be described, but we have to tell another human about it,

200
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:08,320
 so we have to make it a form that we know of. It's interesting to me. The limits of, maybe not

201
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,680
 a imagination, but maybe the limits of communication, because we may be able to picture something

202
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:21,360
 completely something that we can never describe. I've always, in one of my stories, I had a color

203
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,720
 and it was called amber blue, and it was a cross between blue and gold, and I can picture it,

204
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,160
 and I think everyone has their own idea of what amber blue would look like, but to me,

205
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,960
 it's like a blue honey, because it's not necessarily gold, it's like a thick yellow,

206
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,200
 and when you look at it, you see both the blue and the honey at the exact same time.

207
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,360
 One doesn't overpower the other, but when, if I asked someone to draw that for me, and they,

208
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,120
 I don't think they would be able to really give me the color that I wanted, the color that I

209
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,480
 picture, I'd be like, "No, you need a little more honey." "Wait, no, no, a little less, a little less,

210
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,120
 okay, now a little more blue," because the way that I'm communicating it to you, I don't know if it's,

211
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,080
 if you can picture it the same way I picture it, but anyways, anyways, I'm getting off topic.

212
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,640
 The point is, so I read the story about the guff, the bank of souls where all human souls are kept,

213
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,720
 and I thought, you know, that's a pretty story. It's on the conspiracy list, so I'm going to

214
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,480
 cover it, but it's really of no consequence, and then today I thought, "Wait a second,

215
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,320
 what if it's true? What if it's on that conspiracy list,

216
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,920
 because maybe someone wanted people to look into Jewish mythology,

217
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,240
 or maybe someone's like, "Hey, I'm going to put this on here," because no one will guess that this

218
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:48,480
 one's true. There's different, and when I say it's true, the key factor to the bank of souls,

219
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,640
 the treasury of souls, is that there is a finite amount of souls. There's only so many souls to

220
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:03,840
 go around. Eventually, the tree, like all trees, will stop producing fruit, and when that, all the

221
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,080
 souls have fallen, and then Angel Gabriel, each time a child is conceived, is going to keep taking

222
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,520
 another one out of there, another one out of there, eventually he's going to be like, "Uh-oh,

223
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:19,680
 I only got maybe a million left," he's pulling them out, "1.2 million people are born in India

224
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,920
 every month." That's a side fact that I thought was amazing. I think it's like 5 million people a

225
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,400
 month are born worldwide. I'm not trashing on India, I just think the fact that you could have one

226
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,640
 country that produces 1.2 million people in a month is amazing. Anyway, so Angel Gabriel's reaching

227
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:45,440
 and he's pulling out these souls, and when it runs out, that's it. Time ends. The Messiah comes back,

228
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,880
 the war is on, and then everyone is in their perspective realities for the rest of time.

229
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,600
 It's over. Reality, as we know it, is completely wiped off the map. So I mean, obviously to believe

230
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,760
 that theory, you have to believe a couple things. You have to believe, one, the human soul exists,

231
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,800
 two, that there's a finite factor, and three, that you believe there's some sort of afterlife,

232
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,360
 and there's an apocalyptic armageddon thing coming up. But I think it's an interesting conspiracy

233
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,640
 theory because there's really only kind of three variations, three kind of thought processes on it.

234
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,880
 And there's, I mean, not necessarily three, but three main ones. One, you're an atheist and you

235
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
 just don't believe that human souls exist, or maybe you're not an atheist, but you just don't

236
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,200
 believe human souls exist. That's one form of theory. Two, you have an Eastern form of mind

237
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,640
 where souls exist. Everything has a soul, and its souls are constantly being recycled over and over

238
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,840
 again, and every so often you'll achieve perfection and you'll be removed from the game board. But

239
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,720
 there's, for the, for, you know, argument's sake, it's, it's, there's an infinite amount of souls

240
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,360
 because everything's living every single possible life. And the third one, that there is a finite

241
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:03,600
 amount of souls. And the third one is the Western side where each person has one soul, and when you

242
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:11,040
 die, your soul is removed from this reality to never return. That's it. You're done. You're not

243
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,120
 coming back. Now, of course, ancient, in ancient Judaism and in ancient Christianity, there are,

244
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,960
 there is talk of reincarnation, like the Gnostic, the Gnostics in the, you know, beginning of

245
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,920
 Christianity. I'm not for sure how Muslim looks, Islam looks at reincarnation, but so you have

246
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,480
 those, those three sets. So if you believe in the third one, if you believe that every person has

247
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,040
 one soul, and once you die, it goes to another reality, then the question comes down, do you

248
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,880
 believe that there's a fixed amount of souls in the universe or not? And if there's a fixed amount

249
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,520
 of souls in the universe, we're on a countdown. If there's an unlimited amount of souls, and it

250
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,760
 doesn't matter. Personally, I don't know what I believe as far as how many souls there are.

251
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,600
 I think reincarnation would actually be awesome because I like Earth. But if I died and went to

252
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,440
 heaven or went to another dimension or ascended, I'd be fine with that too, but I'd much rather

253
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,800
 just be like a squirrel for a while, and then like a duck, and then a shark or something like that.

254
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,640
 I definitely believe that there's souls, and I definitely believe there's life after death.

255
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,200
 If you're an atheist, that's totally fine. I get it. The evidence, for the most part, is on your

256
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,400
 side. I'm not knocking that at all. And it's funny, as skeptical as I am about a lot of stuff.

257
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,440
 People go, "Dude, I'm surprised you're even remotely religious, let alone believe in souls and

258
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,680
 stuff like that. You talk trash about all this other stuff." And I'm like, "Yeah, I'm a skeptic

259
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,800
 about a lot of stuff, but I'm not a skeptic about everything." You can, with all of my other beliefs,

260
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:47,200
 if you showed me proof that there were no bigfoot people, big feet, there were no cryptids,

261
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,240
 or there were no aliens living underwater, any of my other theories. And you're like, "Nope,

262
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
 the world is just plain and boring. There's nothing special about it." And you could prove to me 100%

263
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,080
 that was true. I'd be like, "Well, I guess that's true." But if you said, "Look, here's some measuring

264
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,480
 device showing that nothing happens after you die." You gave me all that information, I would still go,

265
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,640
 "I'm going to keep believing that there's something after death." And I'm honest about that. That's

266
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,200
 just the way that I look at things. But imagine, back to the guff, I think that's interesting to

267
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,640
 think that every time a child conceives, this soul is being taken out and put into this thing.

268
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,440
 I'm not saying it is true. It really is just a religious belief, an ancient religious belief.

269
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,040
 I'm not saying it is true, but if it is true, that's the ultimate countdown clock.

270
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,560
 Because even if you don't believe in some sort of messiah coming back or some sort of armageddon

271
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,160
 happening, you just believe that there's a difference, there's a human soul in us. And it's

272
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,760
 finite. What happens when it runs out? Does the universe just shut down? Is it almost like you're

273
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,760
 putting coins in a game and that's your last man when that last soul is taken out? Interesting.

274
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,880
 So that one is on the conspiracy list as well. There's actually a lot of information about it,

275
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,800
 because it is something that people have studied in the past. So if you're curious about that,

276
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,760
 definitely check it out. I found it fascinating and I always liked that old mythological imagery.

277
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:19,040
 And that idea of that there's something else out there that we're descending from. I just kind

278
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,480
 of a beautiful imagery overall. The consequence of it is not so pretty. The fact that everyone just

279
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,600
 disappears and dies when this box runs out of stuff. But sometimes we get the good with the bad.

280
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,080
 Well, that's going to be tonight's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I hope you had a great time

281
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,720
 listening to it. My chicken just got done cooking, so if you're here at beep, that's what that was.

282
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,400
 It wasn't my fire alarm. But it might not have been picked up on this mic.

287
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,040
 time. Feedback is always appreciated. Logo art for the website was done by Ash Black and he did an

288
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,960
 amazing job with it. We're going to go ahead and end this. It's only like eight o'clock. I don't have

289
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,760
 to be the one in the morning editing this. But I did record a little bit longer than I should have

290
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,280
 again. But we're going to chop it up and get it out to you. And we'll be back tomorrow for the

291
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:35,520
 ultimate, the ultimate food conspiracy. It took me a week to find the story I will bring to you

292
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,480
 tomorrow and I was saving it for the last episode of the week. And it's a weird one. I'll see you

293
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:50,320
 guys tomorrow. Have a great day.
