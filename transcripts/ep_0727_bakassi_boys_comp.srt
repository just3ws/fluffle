1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hold on to your Berenstein Bear books, we just found another piece of proof

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 that reality may constantly be shifting.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we traveled to Nigeria to take a look at a sorcerer

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 who slowly turned a Christian church into his own personal compound.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And how do you take down a sorcerer?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 You have to hire a group of magic-wielding vigilantes today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun doing whatever you guys are doing.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy, two of our legacy patreons

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, giving up for Cole and Danielle.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Everyone give a round of applause, they're dancing to the little dance for us.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Dance monkey dance, dance monkey, they're having a good time as they're crying at our insults.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Cole and Danielle, you guys are going to be our captains, our pilots this episode.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 If you guys can't swear to the Patreon, I totally understand.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Just help spread the word about the show, really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Really appreciate it.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And I want to give a shout out, I have to give credit where credit is due.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Yesterday's, you're like Jason, please don't talk about yesterday's episode.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We're done, we've moved past that.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Yesterday's episode, I did not come up with a title for that episode.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I have to give credit to where credit is due.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 That title is perfect.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So I did an episode, every Sunday morning I do a live episode for the Patreons on the Patreon Discord.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 If you didn't know that, it's a really cool thing, you guys want to check it out.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I record it live, and you guys can kind of see the process and all the editing that goes behind it.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And the failed jokes, if you've ever wondered what jokes were so bad, don't make it on the show,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 join us on Sunday morning, because there's a lot of them.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And that morning we had Rudy Jazz and Caspian Montague listening in on the Discord.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And I did the whole episode and it ran about 52 minutes long, I haven't edited it yet.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Probably end up around 40 minutes, so you get 12 extra, you're like Jason, I don't want any extra from yesterday's episode.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Quit bringing it up.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 But if you did want 12 extra minutes and cuts and everything like that, failed jokes, pathways are not going down.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I think it's really cool behind the scenes things.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Anyways, Caspian Montague, after I finished the episode, he just made a joke and he said, "Castreat Punk 2077."

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And when he said that, if he could have seen my face, normally I have some video going on, I didn't that day,

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 but I immediately kind of pursed my lips.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I was like, "Damn it, that's such a good title."

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 That is so, that is perfect and I had to ask him for permission.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I wish I was smart and funny enough to come up with it.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So thank you Caspian for coming up with that title, and if you are a Patreon supporter, join us on Sunday mornings.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And if you want to be a Patreon supporter, that is a really cool thing as well that we give to the Patreon guys.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 So, Colin, Daniel, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 We are headed out to Australia.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 [Demonic sound]

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 The reason why we're headed out to Australia is we're going to make contact with the group Making Contact.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 It's a team of people who investigate close encounters of the fifth kind.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And what that is, is basically where you meditate and then aliens show up, or UFOs show up,

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 and it shows the close connection between human spirituality and the aliens.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 On February 2017, Making Contact Group, they're from Canada.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 They're headed out to Australia, and one of the team members, Lissette Rodriguez, has to write a check for her rent.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So she fills it out, rips it off, and hands it to the landlord.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And the check was given to the landlord on March 1st.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 The landlord takes the check to the bank, deposits it.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And just because she's in another country, you want to be sure, I mean, this is your apartment.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 You don't want to come home and they're like, "Oh, sorry, rented out to a bunch of raccoons."

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 You want to make sure that your rent's paid.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 She checks online, and it shows that the check was processed,

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and she can actually see a photocopy or a scanned image of the check the front and the back.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 She goes, "Awesome, my check went through, the bank took it.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Don't have to worry about raccoons this month, but next month."

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Eventually, the team comes back, and Lissette Rodriguez comes back home, and she's going through her checkbook,

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and that check is still in her book.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 The check she wrote to the landlord, completely filled out, is still attached in her checkbook.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So she takes the check, and she's looking at it, and she matches it up to the scanned check in the bank system.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It's exactly the same check, same handwriting, same check number, everything's the same.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 The only differences are, after the landlord got the check, he wrote the apartment number on the check itself.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And it's like apartment two or three, I'm not trying to dox this lady, but she did scan her check and put it online.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Like apartment two or three or whatever like that.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And the back of the check had a stamp from the bank showing the date it was deposited.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And the check in her possession has neither of those things.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 There's actually a link. Robert Freeman knew this story sounded completely ridiculous.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But he has backed it up with some really interesting stuff.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 There's a YouTube video that will be in the show notes, and then he has a GIF that's also in the show notes,

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 and it shows the two checks back to back.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 It shows the check that Lissette has that she turned in, but is somehow still in her checkbook,

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 and then it will flip and show the scanned version as well. It's the same check.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Now obviously this could be fake. This would be super easy to fake.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 I take a photo of the check and then hand it to the landlord to get its process and then take a photo to scan.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 It could be fake. But it would be a weird thing to fake. Generally fakes go big.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That's one thing I've learned. Most people don't fake little things.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 If you're gonna fake a story, it doesn't normally end with them going, "I don't know what it was.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 It just heard something in the bushes and it scared me. It sounded like something I never heard before."

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Usually it ends with, "And that's when I realized that I was the true monster."

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Usually the lie gets big. They can't help but finish the story or wrap it up,

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 or then the skin walker showed up, "Oh, come on, dude. It was unsettling. You had me."

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And then you just have to wrap it up with a bow. Lies tend to get big. Not all the time.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Not all the time. But it could be a lie. But if it isn't, this is an interesting...

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 This is kind of what Rob Freeman was thinking was. It's a perfect example of a glitch in the matrix.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Where she pulled the check out, gave it to them, and then it was processed like a normal check.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And she saw this process as a normal check. But when she came back, the check was still attached in her checkbook.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Perfect example of a glitch in the matrix. And it's one that has physical proof.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 If we accept this story as true, it has physical proof.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It's not something that's based on a possible poor memory, like, "Luke, I am your father."

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Or, "No, I am your father." Like, a lot of people think that's a Mandela effect.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 The line was, "Always know I am your father." The Bernstein-Bear thing will always trip me up.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Will always trip me up. Because I remember it was Bernstein...

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 S-T-E-I-N. 100%. I've never wavered in that belief. Mandela, when he was in prison, I had no idea.

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And I follow world politics, and I was like, "I don't know."

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I mean, maybe. I don't know. That one, it's so funny with the Mandela effect.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I honestly think it's named that as a cover-up.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Because if you go, "What's the Mandela effect?" And they go, "Well, Nelson Mandela was his leader in South Africa."

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 He got arrested, and then people thought he died in the 90s, but it turns out he was still alive.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And I still don't know when he died. I don't really know anything about Nelson Mandela.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Right? If you say... If it was called... Instead of calling it the Mandela effect, because you have to explain so much stuff about it.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 What if it was called the Bernstein-Bear effect? People would go, "What?"

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And you would spell it, B-E-R-E-N, S-T-E-I-N, Bernstein-Bears.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And then you would go, "Oh, remember that?" "Oh, yeah, I remember those books."

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And then you would say, "Go find a book right now." That's not how it's spelled.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 It would blow people... That would convince people. Talking about Luke, "I am your father," or a magic mirror on the wall, mirror mirror on the wall.

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Those are easy things to forget, because you hear the parody more often than you hear the original source.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But Bernstein-Bears, that is what it was called.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Bernstein-Bears, I grew up on those books. I have those books. I remember I used to love the spooky old tree one, and I used to, like, pretend I was hiding in the tree myself.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Those books were a huge part, and I know what those books were called.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 So I think the fact that it's called the Mandela effect is to cover up the one true glitch out of all of those, and that's the Bernstein-Bears.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Not Fruit Loops, not Captain Crunch.

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Anyways, back to this. We have physical proof of a glitch.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It's easily faked physical proof, and we can't forget that.

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But it's still proof, if you believe in this story.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And I don't really, I mean, I believe in the paranormal, I believe in stuff like this, so I don't have anything on its face to not believe these people.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 They haven't shown that their credibility is shot or anything like that.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 It's interesting because it makes you think it's so mundane, like how many other small glitches happen constantly that we don't pick up on, that we just don't see.

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 One check was written, two checks exist, and how that happened, we just don't know what could have caused it.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And again, a lot of times the lie will have an explanation.

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 In real life, sometimes the answer is, "I don't know. I don't know what happened."

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 That's what makes the story feel more real.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Cole and Danielle are walking in slow motion in their flight suits. They know what time it is.

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's time to get on board the Carbenter Copter. Let's go ahead and toss them the keys.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 They're both in the cockpit. It's a quantum cockpit. They can both fly at the same time.

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 We're leaving behind Australia. We are headed on out to Nigeria.

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 People often ask me, "Where do you see the future of the show?"

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 The show grows. Where do you see it growing to? Is it just always going to be you in a closet recording? That will always be a component of it.

136
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 There will always be just me. I don't ever think about taking on a co-host or anything like that.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 But you know what I would love to add to the show is travel, locations.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I would love to do like a week of episodes in El Salvador, where we're still like one of the top science podcasts in the entire nation.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I'd love to go to Nigeria. We've covered so many stories in Nigeria. I would pack all my stuff up and spend a week or two in Nigeria still putting out episodes.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 But talking to the people, I want to meet these people. You're like, "Jason, you know how many penises? You know how many penis disappearing stories you've covered in Africa?"

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 "Yeah, I'm willing to take that risk." I think it would be dope. I want to start getting boots on the ground.

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I would even go to like Milwaukee and try to find Huntsheville.

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Speaking of boots on the ground, they chopped my legs off. I would love to see the show grow like that.

144
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Still putting out daily episodes, but just recording it in hotels and then going out and talking to the people. That would be great.

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Because this story is one of the... I was like, "Come on, man. Why couldn't this be real?"

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 When I read this story, I was super engrossed in it and I thought, "This is what we all wanted to be real as children and as adults too, but definitely as kids."

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 "This is the world we wanted." I mean, there's a lot of people tying this story, but you'll get what I mean.

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And I want to give a shout out to Randy88Moss who brought this story to my attention. This is a really, really fascinating story. Thank you so much.

149
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 We're going back to the mid-1990s and we're in Onitsha. That's in the Anambra state, Nigeria.

150
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 You're like, "Jason, if you're going to visit places, you better learn how to renounce them."

151
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And in Onitsha, there is a young man named Eddie Nagu. He's 29 years old and he's walking through the town and everyone's like, "Eddie! Eddie, dude, you're totally dope."

152
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And he's like, "Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that." And they're like, "Eddie, thanks for getting rid of those boils on my baby's back."

153
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And he goes, "Try saying that three times fast." And he's walking through town. Everyone loves this dude.

154
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Because he is a prophet of God. Who wouldn't want to have a prophet of God in your neighborhood?

155
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 He has super senses. He can hear things, smell things, see things that other humans can't.

156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 But that's not that. That's really not that impressive. If you can't fight crime with it, what's the point?

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 He also has an ability, though. This would work, to heal the sick. Boils on a baby's back? Gone.

158
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 That whole leprosy thing? You don't need that anymore. He's healing everyone in this town, so he's super popular.

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And he builds the Anioma Healing Center. So now he has this church. He has this facility where people can come and get healed.

160
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Eddie will lay his hands on them, and they will walk away clean. They will walk away pure. They will walk away restored.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 But this healing center slowly starts to become a compound.

162
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Eddie starts to see himself less as a prophet of God, and as God himself.

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He becomes a very, very famous figure in town. People love him. He's taking care of them.

164
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But other religious leaders in Onitsha and around Anambra State begins to suspect something about Eddie.

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He's a fake Christian. He's using all the trappings of Christianity because he knows that's what the populace believes in.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You can't walk into a town where they have crosses everywhere and go, "How would you guys like some pentagrams?"

167
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 They're going to immediately... They're probably going to murder you over in Nigeria if you do that.

168
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But they go, "He's not actually Christian." When you listen to the stuff he talks about, he's not actually Christian.

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And even more so, some people, even though they're being healed by Eddie, they walk away and they feel better.

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Their limp is gone. Their eyesight's restored. But they tell their friends and their family, "That wasn't Christian magic."

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 He had these relics that I've never seen before. He's practicing the dark arts in there. And I don't know if the cure is worth it.

172
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 By the year 2000, Eddie has achieved Godhood. He calls himself the deity who attends church.

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And his powers are well-known in the state. He also, though, becomes linked to a bunch of crimes.

174
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 First off, his compound, his healing center, starts to be frequented by criminals.

175
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And people who need to get an illness cured have to pass through this den of thieves to meet Eddie.

176
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Eddie then gets connected to kidnappings. His rituals become darker. And people say that he uses human skulls now.

177
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And there are even rumors in town that these human skulls aren't dug up somewhere.

178
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 That Eddie and his crew of criminals are now performing human sacrifices to achieve even greater powers.

179
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 People of the town become very scared of Eddie, but he is the church. And they need his healing power.

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So they have no choice but to continue to worship him.

181
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 But because all these rumors have spread around the state, Eddie has made very, very powerful enemies.

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And the most vicious of all of his enemies are now ready to go after him. They are called the Bacassi Boys.

183
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Now this story is fully documented in multiple newspapers. This is not an urban legend that was going around the state of Nigeria.

184
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 This was high levels of government in Nigeria realized that Eddie was a problem.

185
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 They had, this is one of those weird stories that we're talking about, magic, we're talking about dark arts, and there's articles like in the Associated Foreign Press about this.

186
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's one of those stories where you have the paranormal and real world government agencies having to deal with this.

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 The Bacassi Boys. It's a group of vigilantes that rose up out of the lawlessness that controlled Nigeria.

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 The Bacassi Boys are basically a vigilante army. They swept through cities, restoring law and order when no one else would.

189
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 The police were too corrupt. The people in the cities did not trust the police. You could just pay them enough and you could do what you wanted.

190
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The Bacassi Boys, they fought for justice. But since the Bacassi Boys are fighting utter anarchy in Nigeria, you can't just use machetes and shotguns.

191
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Now they did use those, those were their weapons of choice. They also used magic.

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 They were perfect hunters. They never failed to catch one of their targets. If someone went on the run and the Bacassi Boys would always catch them.

193
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 They would use whatever sorceress tricks that they knew to take you down. And once they got you, they had these silver-coated machetes that they would simply place on your chest.

194
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 If the machete turned blood red, that means you had committed a vicious heinous crime sometime in your life and you were butchered on the spot.

195
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 No judge, no trial. Just the magic machete that let the world know of your sins.

196
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 They also had necklaces imbued with the powers that once it was put on you, you could not tell a lie. They were compelled to tell the truth by these items.

197
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 But the Bacassi Boys also had one trick of their sleeve that no one could defeat. Not the standard criminal, not the corrupt police, not even the government's army could stop the Bacassi Boys.

198
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Because they had something known as Odesshi, which translates to "It does not leak." The Bacassi Boys were bulletproof.

199
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 The criminal underworld feared the Bacassi Boys. The corrupt police were terrified of the Bacassi Boys.

200
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 But the people welcomed these men into their cities. Finally, the streets are safe to walk again.

201
00:18:45,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Their influence was so great that in 1998, the governor of the Enambra state, Governor Chinwoke Mubajinju, takes power and immediately passes a law called the Enambra Vigilante Services.

202
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 What that did was it made the Bacassi Boys a branch of the government. This magic-wielding army of Vigilantes now had official status.

203
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Their job? Do whatever it takes to regain order in this state. And they did.

204
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Using magic and brute force, using fear intimidation and the love of the population, they ended the lawlessness of the cities.

205
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 But in the year 2000, they get word of a sorcerer known as Eddie, whose rumor to be committing these dark rituals and only getting stronger by the day.

206
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 The Bacassi Boys head out to confront Eddie. They have never ever failed to catch a target. When they get to his compound, he's gone.

207
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 They get word that he's staying in an apartment deeper in the city. They head out there, just miss him. They kick down the door, he's already gone.

208
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 They get some intel that he's in this other location. They head out there, machetes and shotguns ready to take down the sorcerer.

209
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Barely miss him. Matter of minutes, Eddie gets away. This obviously looked really bad for the Bacassi Boys. They've never failed to take their target.

210
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And Eddie gets away 13 times. The Bacassi Boys are right on his heels and right when they kick down the door, right when they go into the bar, right when they level their shotguns at the crowd in front of them, he's gone.

211
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 The Bacassi Boys have a meeting about this. They can't figure out how to stop this guy. He must be so powerful that none of their magic can stop him.

212
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 The Bacassi Boys leader, Nagruo, says, "Eddie is a very, very powerful sorcerer. He has gained so much control over the dark arts.

213
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 We'll never be able to catch him unless we remove those powers from him." Nagruo, using his own power, is able to strip away Eddie's magical abilities.

214
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 The 14th time the Bacassi Boys head out to find him, they catch him.

215
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 On November 4th, 2000, he's taken to their headquarters for interrogation. They beat him, they whip him, they cut him with machetes.

216
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And after this torture, he confesses to the murders of 93 people. So they need to make an example of him.

217
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 This once famous religious leader who misled so many people, who took over an entire town and subjected them to torment.

218
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 They bring him out to the Ochanja market. They wait till as many people are gathered around as possible.

219
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And they slice his stomach open with the machetes, cut his head off, and then burn the body.

220
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 This event is so huge in Nigeria, at least in the Anambra state, that you can buy-- I don't know if this is a cultural thing.

221
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 It didn't make any sense to me, but you can buy calendars depicting these events.

222
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 You know, over in America, like I have a Britney Spears calendar or swimsuit illustrated calendar up on my wall.

223
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And, you know, that's fine, right? There's no joke. There's photos of this.

224
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 They're calendar. I'm not saying you have to have this calendar over there. It's a choice, but they have calendars that shows cartoon drawings of the events I just told you.

225
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Again, this is not some made-up story. This story was documented over the course of months and years.

226
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 The compound was there. He existed. There's much news articles about the lead-up to this and all the rumors or the crimes.

227
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 There's a calendar that shows him walking around, like a drawing of Eddie walking downtown.

228
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And he's, like, greeting the people of town. And then, like, as you go, you're like, "Oh, kids, it's October."

229
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 It's time for him to get disemboweled. And there's a drawing of this guy on his knees with white organs popping out of his stomach.

230
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Where, you know, like, his intestines can be kind of like this weird clay-ish color.

231
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 They're just pouring out of this dude's stomach. And then they show, like, in December, when you're celebrating the birth of Christ.

232
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 There's, like, a picture of these body parts, because they chopped them up and threw them into these.

233
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 When they burn you, they put you in tires. They put you in, like, car tires, put gasoline on them, and then you just kind of melt.

234
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 It's just to completely destroy and devalue the human remains.

235
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 They have calendars of this. And, of course, there's a couple movies about the guy, because Nigeria is the second biggest movie producer in the world.

236
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 An interesting story, and you know what I mean, like, when don't we love to live in a world where you're not a victim, right?

237
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 You're on the sidelines. You're just reading about this in the newspaper.

238
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 But let's say you pick up The New York Times tomorrow. You're watching CNN.

239
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And it's like, "Famed Wizard Charles Winger once again continues to hold sway over the people of Baltimore.

240
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 His powers have controlled most of them for the past couple months. But don't worry, the U.S. is sending in their own wizard forces to overtake that."

241
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 You're like, "Chase, that sounds horrific. I wouldn't want to be under the thumb of a bunch of wizards and have to hope other wizards save me."

242
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Yeah, you would. Like, wouldn't this be dope?

243
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Wouldn't this be great to live in a society where magic was real?

244
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And like, maybe you could learn how to do it, but even if you couldn't, it would make the world so much more exciting.

245
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 If at any point you could walk outside in some wizards like holding up an amulet and you're like, "Ugh, I'll believe everything you say."

246
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Like, wouldn't that be dope? Okay, maybe not that example, but just knowing that magic existed.

247
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Like, we want paranormal to exist. I think most of us believe in the paranormal. Some of you don't, and that's fine.

248
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 You just like the show, but wouldn't it be great to live in a world where magic actually existed?

249
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Like, whether or not I would be probably pretty jealous of people who were shooting electricity at people.

250
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I'd be like, "Oh, man, I wish I could commit manslaughter."

251
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 "All I have is this shotgun."

252
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But yeah, it would be dope. Like, when you're a kid and you're watching visionaries and you're believing all this stuff,

253
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 you go, "Oh, man, maybe someday people will be doing karate fighting in the middle of the street,

254
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and they'll be shooting beams at each other, and then some guy flies down and goes, "Mmm-mm-mm."

255
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And then, like, bunks their heads together. Like, that would be awesome.

256
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And as a child, that could be. When you're a kid, you think, "Oh, that might be real."

257
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I would love that. I honestly would love a world where we knew magic existed and you saw proof of it all the time.

258
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And maybe you're a wizard or so. Maybe you're just a bystander, but it would be cool. It would be really cool.

259
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 But that all aside, let's wrap the story up like this, because this is where the conspiracy theory comes in to this story.

260
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Because every story that involves the government has a conspiracy theory to it.

261
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 In October 2002, the Enambra vigilante services got shut down.

262
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 The government of Enambra disbanded the Bacassi boys and basically said the group is now illegal.

263
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And once that happened, the cities that they protected became more lawless, more chaotic and violent than they were before the Bacassi boys were even created.

264
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Things got way worse.

265
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And so this is my conspiracy theory, and I'm sure I'm not alone on this.

266
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I'm sure there are a lot of people listening to this podcast and a lot of people in Nigeria who believe the same thing.

267
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 The reason why Eddie was able to disappear 13 times may have had something to do with his ability to control magic,

268
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 but it also probably had the ability to do with corrupt governmental forces who knew where the Bacassi boys were going.

269
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Because remember, they were part of the government at this point, and so he was being tipped off.

270
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Because people who get powerful like Eddie will always have connections in the local government, or even the national government.

271
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 You'll have corrupt officials who want what the criminals are selling, who want to have these drugs, these women, and so they do illegal things.

272
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 They take the bribes, and that is just part of their lifestyle.

273
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And Eddie is connected to them.

274
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And when Eddie is eliminated, that all dries up.

275
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And as the Bacassi boys continue to move through the state, shutting down these criminals, they're actually hurting the politicians.

276
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 If you got rid of every single drug dealer in the United States today, either they give up, they're arrested, or we just completely drive the drug supply.

277
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 There's three groups of people who will be hurt by that.

278
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 The drug dealers, the drug users, and government officials.

279
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So if the Bacassi boys were too effective, they were too good at protecting the citizens.

280
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 What happens to the Bacassi boys after that? We don't know.

281
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 What we do know is you basically had an army of young men who were trained magic users, who had no hesitation to kill, and were bulletproof.

282
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 How many of those men do you think went on to become a carpenter, raise a family, and live a peaceful life?

283
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And how many of those young men do you think said, "I'm hungry. I have no job training. No one's going to hire me."

284
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And they turn to a life of crime.

285
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I'm not saying they all did that, but even if 10% of them did that, you now have a whole new generation of criminals, gangster warlords really, who not only have battle-hardened experience, but black magic to back them up.

286
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And then you have the same politicians that disbanded their group in the first place, reaching out to them, offering them jobs.

287
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 The pay is good, the work is exciting, and that appeals to these young men.

288
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 The same politicians who destroyed the Bacassi boys now use them as their own personal conduit into the criminal underworld.

289
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 A gangster with nothing to lose is dangerous.

290
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 A gangster with nothing to lose, who has the backing of local government officials, is impossible to stop.

291
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 But a gangster with nothing to lose, who has the backing of local government officials, and has reality-shifting powers at their disposal.

292
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 What else would we call that person?

293
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 But a god.

294
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
