00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,520
 city devastated by the coronavirus, a city full of the lost, a city full of the dead,

3
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:49,840
 a city named your hometown, and then we travel to New York City, where a world famous trial

4
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:58,720
 is currently being held. And amidst all of the documentation, all the legal wrangling,

5
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,920
 all of the evidence is the word I was looking for. In the middle of all that comes a disgusting detail

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,160
 that no one expected. Nobody except one man, Hans Wormhat, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:25,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

8
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,520
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of

9
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
 stuff to cover man. I just spent 18 minutes talking about the coronavirus and was like,

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
 "Ah, this is boring." So I'm gonna try to cut it down. It might still be 18 minutes long,

11
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,120
 but we're gonna make it exciting this time. We're gonna put some sound effects in there,

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,960
 and we'll have some visuals that only I will see. This is a podcast, so whoa dude, look at that to

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:56,240
 wasteland. Let's hop on board the Carpenter copter. We're gonna fly to Wuhan, China. Wuhan! Wuhan!

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,600
 Helicopter lands. Okay, we're all getting on our... I had my hazmat suit on already. You're like, "Hey Jason,

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
 what's this story about? Oh, I've been asleep for the past couple weeks. You're getting off the

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,880
 helicopter. Everyone else is snickering at you. At your impending demise. Why are you guys all

17
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,720
 wearing those hazmat suits?" You're just walking around. We're like, "Hey dude, here. Bat soup?"

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,520
 You're like, "Yo, I've always wanted to try this. I'm a huge fan of Batman."

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,440
 And anyways, as you start to wither in front of us, this is actually perfect because now that you

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,160
 have the coronavirus, which is what we'll be talking about, now we can get access into all

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,160
 these hospitals that we're gonna be also looking into. So you're like, "Uh, Jason, you're kind of a

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,320
 jerk for me." And we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. I'm getting you in a chokehold

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,600
 to speed up the process." We rush you into a hospital. "Hey doctors, get out of the way. Get out of the

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,240
 way. No, we want you. You doctor. Come here. Come here." So I'm Jason Garbender, host of Dead

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,000
 Rabbit Radio. These are all my fans and this dude poking you with a stick, this dude was eating some

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,440
 bat soup and the doctor's like, "That's not good." We all rush you into the ER. Actually, the whole

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
 hospital at this point is the ER because even though I'm not gonna go over specifics, I should

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,240
 go over some of the general stuff, the city of Wuhan in China, it's in the middle of the country,

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,280
 is completely quarantined at this point. Now, I know a friend of mine has a friend in Wuhan and

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,880
 it's not good over there, as you would expect a quarantine of 11 million people. Nothing can get

31
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,240
 in or out. The military brings in supplies all the time, but can the military really supply 11

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,680
 million people? They're gonna have to start airdropping stuff in, but anyways, they quarantine the

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,880
 city because the coronavirus, they don't really know what it is. They're still trying to figure out

34
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,040
 how it's spread. What they believe now is spread through drop, water droplets,

35
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
 sneezing, coughing. If you're a dog and you're shaking your body and water's going everywhere,

36
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,760
 it's probably not good. Beethoven movies are banned over there now. Everyone's like, "No."

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,800
 And then poop, poop as well. So it's in the liquid of your poop, which is fine by me because my poop

38
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,600
 is rock hard now. It's super dry. I don't know what's going on. It's like trying to push a link

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,720
 and log through a hot dog bun. It's definitely doing some damage down there, but so I don't have to,

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,440
 you don't have to worry about it. If you touch my poop, you're not gonna get it. And so the doctors

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
 like that, you really should go to this other ward and find out why your poop's so hard. It's like,

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,320
 "No, I don't. I'm waddling through the hospital now." So that's kind of the basics of the coronavirus.

43
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,680
 Now, obviously with something like this, I should say this too, as of the recording of this, 18 to

44
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,840
 20,000 people have become infected. Three to 400 people have died, and the majority, like 99% of

45
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:50,080
 that or 95% of that is in China. Tragic? Yes. Basic illness, similar to the flu? Yes. It could get

46
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,200
 bad. It could get, it looks like it's kind of tapering off, and you could say, "Well, it's tapering

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,040
 off because they've isolated these cities. What's going on in these cities?" This is where we get

48
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
 into all the conspiracy theories, because you knew this was coming, right? You knew there were

49
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,000
 going to be conspiracy theories popping up about this. So there is video footage coming out of Wuhan,

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,480
 okay? So we're here, and we're going to be walking around. We see a guy holding a video camera over

51
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,080
 a ledge, and we're like, "Oh, dude, let's go see what he's doing." And at the bottom of like this,

52
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,280
 this is a video that's floating around at like the, on the first floor of some hospital, there's

53
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
 a bunch of people who are sick with this coronavirus, but they're not just coughing, they're not just like,

54
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,320
 "I'll look at all mucusy and stuff." They don't all just, they're not all green, like the Musenex man

55
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,320
 just covered in goo. They're twitching. Their arms and legs are flailing wildly as nurses walk around.

56
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,840
 Creepy, right? There's footage of a man walking around in a hospital. That's not unique. There's

57
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,480
 a lot of men walking around in hospitals, but this one, there's a man walking around with a camcorder

58
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,400
 in a hospital in Wuhan, China, and there's a bunch of doctors going, "This guy's dead. We couldn't save

59
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,280
 him. This virus is killing all these people." Oh no, look at this guy. He's dead right here,

60
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,240
 in front of a secretly recorded camera. This guy's dead. Why am I talking so loud? But he's dead.

61
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:22,400
 And then that same guy videotapes a truck full of body bags. There, and then there's some photos

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,520
 that Sheen Anagans. Sheen Anagans is actually a Patreon supporter, so if you appreciate the show,

63
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,200
 you can support the Patreon. If you can't afford the Patreon, just help get the word out about the

64
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,840
 show. Yes, we're going to plug that during the story of hospitals and death. Sheen Anagans sent

65
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,680
 me some tweets over the vacation and said, "Hey, I'm a little concerned about this whole coronavirus

66
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
 thing, and I'm wondering if you're going to do a story on paraphrasing, obviously, but I wonder

67
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
 if you're going to do anything on it." Now, these tweets, one of them was from a Twitter account

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,240
 called Trends in China, and it was like, "Hey, look at the city. The government of Wuhan is building

69
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
 a hospital for a thousand people, so they're trying to build a pop-up hospital real quick.

70
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,120
 That's one of the reasons why the death toll seems to be so high in China. It's overwhelming

71
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,720
 their medical services. Not that the disease is particularly deadly, but it's overwhelming

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,280
 their medical services, so they're going to build this hospital." And then another Twitter user goes,

73
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,160
 "Yeah, right. They're building a hospital? I don't think so. Here's a photo of a trench full of

74
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,960
 garbage bags. You see, they're not building a hospital. Building a makeshift morgue."

75
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,720
 Now, I responded to Sheen Anagans. I know I think I've told you guys this before. I used to work

76
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 in a crematory. Those aren't body bags. It was a trench full of garbage bags. We can't tell if

77
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,640
 they're six feet or two feet. There's no scale to them to trench of garbage bags. You go, Jason,

78
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,840
 why would a construction company throw all their garbage in a trench? I would respond,

79
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,320
 "Any construction company in China would." And I'd also argue that any construction company that

80
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,280
 could get away with it would. They're not going to haul it out to the dumpster. Just bury it.

81
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,760
 Now, I don't think it's a--if it was a trench, first off, it's a--it's maybe a foot or two deep,

82
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,560
 this trench. But I--when I was looking at the photos and I'm like, "Those aren't body bags.

83
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,760
 That's not how you build a mass grave. I know how they're dealing with the bodies in China right

84
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,120
 now and that's not how they're doing it." This is something--this is a piece of advice I want to

85
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,040
 give all you guys. When? This is tricky, too. This is tricky, but this will help you guys a lot from

86
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,240
 getting fooled, hoodwinked, however you want to put it, or scared, rarely would probably be a better

87
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,000
 word. When you see someone post something, if this person posted the absolute opposite thing,

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,960
 what I believe them. See, you had trends in China saying, "Here's photos of a ditch bean duck." Now,

89
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,280
 somebody, the other Twitter user, went by the name "Dirty Monkey." So, "Dirty Monkey, a random person,

90
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,760
 found another photo of a trench full of garbage bags and said, 'No, it's body bags.'" And because we

91
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,400
 are conspiracy theorists and because we researched this stuff, we can be prone to believe the most

92
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,920
 outlandish theory. So, when we see someone, whether or not they have any clout or investigative skill

93
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,400
 or access to information--because you don't have to be a journalist to get information out or to be

94
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,520
 knowledgeable on something--but who is "Dirty Monkey"? Who in the world is "Dirty Monkey"? I'm going to

95
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,400
 assume one, they're not a Chinese national, just because the name isn't in Chinese, that could be

96
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,120
 racist, but I'm assuming they're not a Chinese national. I'm going to assume that they found the

97
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,360
 photos third hand, which means they didn't take the photographs because they seem to be taken at

98
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,200
 the same time that the photographs of the other construction going on by--that were referenced

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,480
 in the Trends of China article. So, based on that, I could say, he probably didn't take the photos,

100
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
 he probably didn't publish the photos, he found the photos after they had been taken and published

101
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,960
 by somebody else, and said, "This looks suspicious," and posted out there and then other people see it

102
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,160
 and go, "Oh my god, it's a trench full of bodies." If "Dirty Monkey" had responded to that Trends

103
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,040
 in China article and said, "Yeah, good job, China. They're really on top of this. Would you, as a

104
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,560
 conspiracy theorist, go, 'I trust Dirty Monkey'?" We want the--we don't want the human devastation, but

105
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:28,240
 we already feel like there's stuff hidden from us, so when a Dirty Monkey man shows up and says,

106
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,880
 "I got a little bit of that sweet, sweet, like conspiratorial news, conspiracy theorists have

107
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,440
 a tendency--" and ghost hunters and Bigfoot people, all the--all--everyone on this journey,

108
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,000
 have a tendency to ignore our better judgment. If someone named Dirty Monkey--the guy jumps out

109
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
 round corner, whereas the shirt says, "Dirty Monkey"--has a burger and said, "I made this for you.

110
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,440
 You wouldn't eat it." But if that guy jumped out around a corner with a Manila envelope and says,

111
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,720
 "I have the documents that prove that the Wuhan virus is killing millions and hands it to you,"

112
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,880
 you may go, "Urgh, that's believable," because you already have a tendency to believe that.

113
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:12,160
 The videotape of the people twitching, we don't have any source of where the videotape come from.

114
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:20,240
 It's undated. It's creepy. But was it in Thailand in 1999? Was it in Wuhan yesterday? We don't know.

115
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,080
 The video of the guy walking around the hospital is the newest video I saw on the doctors being

116
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,200
 like, "Oh, no, this guy's dead in the body bags." That video, the guy was arrested and then he was

117
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,080
 let go, because, you know, China loves to do that, too. China loves arresting people for exposing

118
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,600
 their deepest, darkest secrets. And then letting him go, we all know that, like, political dissidents

119
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,800
 just don't disappear in the Chinese legal system. They let him go so he could give another quote to

120
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,280
 the news article, being like, "Oh, no, what will happen to me next?" When in China, there is no

121
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,040
 next. You just kind of disappear. Also, how many cops are chasing people down in Wuhan at this point?

122
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,480
 The city is... The reality is the city is under quarantine. That's real. But apparently this

123
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
 guy took this video. And then what was the... Oh, I already explained the garbage-back things.

124
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,880
 And there's a lot of videos of people walking up street and falling down on their face, which would

125
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,040
 be hilarious with some Benny Hill music to it, but for right now, it's just people going, "Oh,

126
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,440
 and they're saying, look at this guy dying." Almost every single video that you are seeing about that

127
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,640
 came from the same source, The Daily Star. Now, The Daily Star is a website that I've talked a lot

128
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:36,160
 about on this show over the course of 381 episodes. Daily Star is one of the most fanciful websites

129
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,800
 out there. And there are so many times where I'm like, "Giant Pyramid floating over

130
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,640
 the Great Lakes," and click on it, and it's Daily Star. It's like, "Oh, my God." They make stuff up

131
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,640
 wholesale, and you're like, "So, Jason, did they stage a bunch of people twitching on the ground?"

132
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,320
 No. I don't know when the date of that video was, but I will say this. It's really easy to get a video

133
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,560
 of a bunch of people who don't speak your language, stand them around, talking about stuff, and then

134
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,240
 put subtitles on it. And you could say, "Maybe no one else is covering this because Daily Star is the

135
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,080
 only one with the balls big enough to expose the Wuhan virus." That's true. Maybe CNN and MSNBC

136
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,600
 and Fox News and all them don't want to cover this, and Daily Star and The Guardian and The Independent

137
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,560
 and no other media outlet in the entire planet will cover this, except for the one that we know

138
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,040
 constantly fakes their news. You're right. You're right. This may be the one time they're actually

139
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,040
 right, but boy, he cried wolf. So I discount all that stuff. People are dying. People do get sick,

140
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
 but when the government, and you're like, "Jason, if it wasn't that bad, why would the government

141
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,880
 are trying to lock this stuff down?" So, but let's get back into the conspiracy theory stuff.

142
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,000
 Let's get back because there's another huge conspiracy theory about this that may be true.

143
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,960
 Wouldn't surprise me if it was. So, but we have to also dig through the fake stuff.

144
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,600
 In the city of Wuhan, there is a laboratory. So now we're leaving behind the hospital. We're

145
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,760
 leaving you, the dear listener, at the hospital. No, you're better now. You've, you, because people

146
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
 recover from this. People are like, "You get up. You're like, 'Oh, man, I'm kind of stiff, kind of

147
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,600
 hungry. You guys got any bats I can eat?'" Because I guess that joke doesn't make sense if you don't

148
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,960
 know. They believe it came from bats. They believe it came from people eating bats soup. But you're

149
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,280
 like, "Oh, man, I'm so hungry. Are you looking at us? You're seeing us? We look like Batman."

150
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,120
 We're like, "No, no, you're not going to eat us. Maybe we'll pick up some like bat-flavored

151
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,960
 gummies on the way home." But let's go. Let's go. So we're pushing you in a wheelchair. We are headed

152
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:47,360
 to the Wuhan Institute of Viralology. And we get there, and it's in the city of Wuhan. And now

153
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:55,920
 they had actually been working on a way to figure out why bats don't get so affected by the diseases

154
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,800
 they carry. Why is it that a bat can have Ebola, but it doesn't poop blood out of its butthole all

155
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,360
 day long? Now, a couple months ago, last year, the Wuhan Institute of Viralogy was putting out like a

156
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,480
 now hiring thing, saying, "We're looking for people who specialize in bat-related diseases. How is it?

157
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,280
 We want to figure out how bats have such great immune systems, because maybe that'll help us.

158
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,960
 Plus, in the little asterisks, plus we want to fly around." And they were trying to figure this stuff

159
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,000
 out. Now, people go, "Hmm." And there's a whole thing going around about the Wuhan Institute of

160
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,200
 Viralogy. Their logo is similar to the logo of the Umbrella Corporation, which is the villains of

161
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,120
 the Resident Evil series. There is a company in China that has a logo similar to the Resident Evil

162
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,400
 logo. It is not the Wuhan Institute of Viralogy. And again, do I think it's possible that this virus

163
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,280
 came from the laboratory? Yeah, sure, it's possible. It's absolutely possible. Absolutely possible.

164
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,000
 And that it escaped on accident. It wouldn't make much sense as a bio weapon, because it doesn't

165
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,720
 seem to actually have that high of a kill rate. So we're back in the city center. We're getting

166
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,040
 ready to board the carbon helicopter to leave behind the city of Wuhan. And you go, "Well, Jason,

167
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,440
 okay, so do you think it's a biological weapon?" And I go, "It's pa- I don't know if it's a biological

168
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,240
 weapon. It doesn't seem to have that high of a kill rate." But it's definitely possible that

169
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,080
 they were working on something and it got out. That's possible. That type of stuff has happened,

170
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,960
 or at least been considered to have happened. People think that Lyme disease was a biological

171
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,520
 weapon that got out of a laboratory. That's an old, old conspiracy theory. But it's possible you

172
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,360
 create something. The fact that you can have the disease and not show any symptoms and still pass

173
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,200
 it along to people seems oddly specific, because that's what they were trying to investigate,

174
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,440
 why bats could carry a disease and deliver it, but not show symptoms of it. So that's a little

175
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,480
 interesting. That's a bit of an interesting side note. So it's possible that it's, you know,

176
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,280
 China's very, very packed in. People were eating bats. The bats could have had the disease and

177
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,880
 they got the disease and now it's jumped from human to human because it's mutated slightly.

178
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,120
 It's possible that the facility was working on it and it got out. Let's go ahead, because I'm

179
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,520
 not going to split this up into two episodes. I know this is running long, but there is no way.

180
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,040
 I've teased you guys too long about this next story. And I do have to say this. On yesterday's

181
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:27,360
 episode, I said, "I have no idea why this guy's name is now Hans Warmhat." And I feel stupid,

182
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,000
 because someone on YouTube pointed it out to me. Corey Dennis. Corey Dennis said, "Uh, his name is

183
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,120
 Hans Warmhat." Or he didn't say that. He said, "The name Hans Warmhat is from, it's always

184
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,200
 Sunday in Philadelphia." And I was like, "Ah, you're right. You're right." But like I said,

185
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,440
 the fool. Does that walk over to turn on the light because it suddenly got dark? The corona infected

186
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,440
 cloud is now passing over my hometown. It's here. It's too late for me.

187
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,040
 It's too late for me, but I'll finish this podcast anyways. Hans Warmhat. So originally,

188
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,880
 he went, his channel was called Conspiracies by Hans. Now it's Hans Warmhat. And now my

189
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,880
 videos always start off with a little introduction and then the most notable thing. Hey, everyone,

190
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,600
 welcome back to another episode. Other videos go, "Hey, everyone, thanks for jumping in." Like

191
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,200
 another podcaster or whatever PewDiePie. It's PewDiePie. All that stuff. Hans Warmhat has this.

192
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,840
 Hans Warmhat. That might be the best sound bite. It lets you know what you're in for. It lets you

193
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,840
 know that you're in for the most dead panned, insane information ever. I've never had anyone just

194
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,680
 walk up to me and say, "Hans Warmhat." That's so bizarre. And I love it. Hans Warmhat. I love it so

195
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,880
 much. So let's dig into a little bit of Hans Warmhat here. Now, Hans Warmhat talked about on the

196
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,880
 show before. He's notable for two conspiracy theories. He has a ton of them. We're actually,

197
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,600
 I've been digging back into them. We got some really interesting Hans stuff coming up. Did you know?

198
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,680
 Did you know that Nickelodeon, the channel Nickelodeon, is satanic? Did you know that?

199
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,440
 And here's why. This is, I can't believe I didn't figure this out. So he stated in an earlier video,

200
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,000
 we touched on this before, that the color orange is satanic. That's why NASA loves the color.

201
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,640
 NASA famously loves the color orange, right? What color is all the Nickelodeon stuff? Yep,

202
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,480
 orange. But that's not it, man. There's lots of that are orange, dude. Vescovals and oranges,

203
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:32,000
 and tangerines, and sherbet ice cream. Lots of satanic stuff. So why specifically is Nickelodeon

204
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 satanic? Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon. Nick, you hearing it? You hearing it yet? Nickelodeon. Now, I'm

205
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:53,840
 gonna, you Nick. You Nick. So a man whose testicles have been removed. You Nickelodeon. You Nickelodeon.

206
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,640
 You seeing it plays in, he has a whole video on that, by the way. Just him saying those two words

207
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,400
 over and over again. His two most famous and bizarre conspiracy theories, one, monkeys don't exist.

208
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,280
 Someone actually asked him, what animals do exist? And he said, the list is too exhaustive

209
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,120
 of animals that don't exist. It'd be easier for me to name animals that do exist. He didn't do

210
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,200
 that either. But platypuses are CGI. Sloths are fake, because they're different colors.

211
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,920
 Monkeys aren't real. Like every monkey you've ever seen is either a man in a suit, a kid in a suit,

212
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,880
 a puppet. And his other big conspiracy theory, other than that animals are just figments of our

213
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,920
 imagination, is that all men are, except for a few exceptions, all men are women and all women

214
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:42,640
 are men. So he's a man, and he's a man because his arms are long. Men have long arms and women

215
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,360
 have short arms. Men are always fit. If you're overweight, like I am, you're a woman. And you're

216
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,720
 like, Jason, you're not a woman. You're not a woman. I go, I know I'm not. And you are whatever

217
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,120
 you are. But Hans and many people believe this conspiracy theory, by the way, that at birth,

218
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,560
 someone looked at a little baby Jason and said, "It's a beautiful baby girl, but we're going to

219
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:13,120
 pretend it's a boy." And everyone's like, "Wah." So the whole medical community's in on it, and NASA.

220
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,760
 So anyways, he believes that all men are women, and all women are men, and it's this huge fraud

221
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,600
 that's put on by the scientific community, and NASA, and the St. Worshippers, and Clarissa explains

222
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:33,120
 it all, but she's not explaining it to us. She's part of the secret. So, foolish. I made fun of it

223
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,280
 on my episode, "Monkeys Don't Exist," where I talked about Hans. I think it's a hilarious

224
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,160
 conspiracy theory. It was something that only someone who exists in a small town could ever

225
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,920
 believe, that him and the other people in the town are the true genders, and then everyone else

226
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:56,000
 outside of those places are mixed up hermaphrodites, at best, at worst, totes of the satanic elite.

227
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,960
 So imagine my shock. Imagine I'm reading the news the other day. Now, before I go into this,

228
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,040
 because this is all true, but before I go into this, I want to be very, very clear,

229
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,360
 to me, this does not back up his claims in any way, shape, or form. But to him, I can't wait for his

230
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,560
 next video. If he doesn't put a video out about this, shame on you, Hans Wormhat. Shame on you,

231
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:29,200
 because this would be the equivalent of NASA accidentally printing a picture of a flat earth.

232
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,920
 I mean, this is big news for people who believe in this transvestigation, because mostly it's

233
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:40,160
 centered on Hollywood. Vin Diesel is a woman, and they're all women. I mean, it gets really tiring

234
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,040
 after a while. Every video about this is just like, "Hey, look at these men." Nope, they're women.

235
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,200
 That's every single video in this transvestigation series. But this happened. Harvey Weinstein's.

236
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
 Harvey Weinstein is currently, I gotta take my glasses off for this, because I'm going to keep

237
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,040
 rubbing my forehead while I'm talking about this. Harvey Weinstein is currently on trial for rape.

238
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,720
 All these women are coming forward saying he did this to me, he did that to me.

239
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,800
 And his defense is saying, "Well, you did get a movie role, so, you know, tough luck." That's

240
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,840
 kind of how this trial's going. And it's all pretty much standard stuff. Harvey Weinstein's

241
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,480
 sitting there one day. Now, there's a lot of things that can suck about going to trial. One,

242
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,080
 is that you can lose and something really bad can happen to you. Two, people can describe what your

243
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,400
 genitals look like, and it's part of the public record, and you have two choices. You can either

244
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,720
 defend it and say, "That's not true," and then show them to people consensually. That'd be a

245
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
 totally different trial. Either way, he's like, "That's not true," pulls his pants down. Or you can

246
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,760
 just go, "Yeah, that is true," and run with it, right? So this woman, Jessica Mann, she was

247
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,600
 testifying against Harvey Weinstein. She said that he had raped her. The prosecutor's asking

248
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,320
 her questions, and she makes the bombshell revelation, which if any other, if Kobe Bryant

249
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 hadn't recently died of the coronavirus, wasn't creeping across the globe. This might have been

250
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,880
 the biggest news story ever. Apparently, Harvey Weinstein has no balls. His testicles are completely

251
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,480
 gone. There's nothing down there. So you go, "Jason, a lot of people don't have balls." Well,

252
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,640
 half the population doesn't have balls, but there are men who don't have testicles, right?

253
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,000
 Yeah, yeah. You get blown off in war. They get chopped off. Some guy has a fetish, you know.

254
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,240
 Guy who's trying to play a game of marbles didn't have any, but he had two. He always keeps with

255
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,200
 him and cut his sack open, he's playing marbles. So that's definitely possible. But here's this

256
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,160
 quote, this woman leaves this quote. Jessica Mann, here's the quote, "The first time I saw him naked,"

257
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,640
 this is a reference to Harvey Weinstein, "the first time I saw him naked, I thought he was deformed

258
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:56,720
 or intersex." So right there, she's basically saying he didn't have, he didn't appear to have

259
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,040
 any testicles, and I was barely aware that he had a penis at all. I thought actually when I looked at

260
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:09,120
 him, he could have been a hermaphrodite. So right there already you're on trial for sexual assault,

261
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,000
 and you're thinking, "Oh, this is just the beginning of a very, very bad sentence." Now,

262
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,120
 someone could say, "Yeah, he was lame, and he had a really tiny dick," and you're like, "Oh, man,

263
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,320
 and again, what are you going to do?" You're going to be like, "No, I don't," and then pull your pants

264
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,560
 down and everyone's like, "Yeah, it's kind of small," or you just roll with it. But she's saying,

265
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,880
 "I thought he was deformed. It didn't look like there was anything down there." But then it gets

266
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,920
 worse. The rest of this quote, "The first time I saw him naked, I thought he was deformed or

267
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:47,760
 intersex." I didn't know, this is insulting, I didn't know if he was a burn victim, but it wouldn't

268
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,320
 make sense. So now you're being compared to looking like someone who's had 30 degree burns.

269
00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:00,000
 She continues the quote with, "He does not have testicles, and it appears like he has a vagina.

270
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,600
 He does have a penis." And apparently, when she was making these comments, Harvey Weinstein just

271
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,120
 put his head in his hands and just kind of sat there. Because again, how are you going to defend

272
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,360
 that? And the fact, a reporter asked him later and says, "Hey, how accurate was that description?"

273
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,320
 He's like, "It was perfect." And again, kind of, "He might not have testicles. He may look like a

274
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,120
 burn victim that's all busted up down there and everything like that." Which, fine. I mean, listen,

275
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,760
 if you got it flaunted, I mean, like maybe you're into that thing and your dick's all gross and stuff

276
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,120
 like that. Now, I would hope not, but I'm sure there's someone out there who's into that. The thing

277
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,880
 is, is that there's a difference between not having testicles and having a gross penis. And

278
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,600
 another thing, and people, you being a man and people thinking that you have a vagina and you

279
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,120
 don't want them to think that. Like, if you were trans, like, that's okay. But if you're not,

280
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:01,200
 and people are like, "Oh, that's a vagina." Like, that would be embarrassing, right? But this isn't

281
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:11,840
 just about being embarrassing. This is 100% what Hans and company have been talking about. Again,

282
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,720
 I'm not saying I believe in this conspiracy theory. I think it's absolutely insane. But

283
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,320
 this is, I'm actually surprised the videos haven't already started on this. I did type in Harvey

284
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,160
 Weinstein Transvestigation. And did you know, did you know that according to these lunatics,

285
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:34,240
 every accuser of Harvey Weinstein is actually a man, Rose McGowan, Asia Argento, Jessica Mann,

286
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,000
 it's in her name, she's also a man. These are all men. Harvey Weinstein has only been targeting men

287
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,720
 throughout this whole ordeal. #men2 maybe is what it should be called. But it's not,

288
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,800
 Transvestigation is trying to enlighten us. But the fact of the matter is the only video as of

289
00:27:52,800 --> 00:28:00,720
 right now about this is, you know, I just realized something. Hmm, if Hans and company does not

290
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:10,080
 cover this Harvey Weinstein story, the fact that a major Hollywood mogul has been outed as not

291
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:18,960
 at least not appearing to be fully male, not having testicles, having what appears to be a burned

292
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,800
 up vagina and a penis, if they don't cover this story, is it possible that Hans Wormhat and his

293
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 ilk are actually controlled opposition? Hmm, is it possible that they show us ridiculous photos of

294
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:42,880
 absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous women and say, "That's a man. That's a man." But when actually

295
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:50,400
 given, state-recorded, legally documented proof in the court record of a woman saying,

296
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:58,320
 "This man has a vagina that looks like Freddy Krueger goes down on it." That wasn't actually the

297
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,280
 quote, but a burned up vagina was more like the quote. If they don't cover this, does that mean

298
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,760
 that they're all controlled opposition? Does that mean that they're part of the cover-up as well?

299
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:18,880
 Is it possible that Dead Rabbit Radio is on the forefront of exposing the burned vagina agenda

300
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:28,960
 of the elite satanic Hollywood? Hopefully not. Hopefully this is not what Dead Rabbit Radio is

301
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,720
 remembered for. No, not that. Not gonna be that. I totally don't believe that all men are women

302
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,240
 and all women are men. But when I read this article, I basically stopped following the Harvey Weinstein

303
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:50,640
 trial and I thought, "Damn you, Hans Wormhat. Damn you. If you take a win for this, if you don't,

304
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,280
 you're part of the conspiracy. And if you do, I really think I need to have him on the show.

305
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,720
 I really think I need to interview this guy. Maybe we can team up. I'm not a huge fan of

306
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:08,320
 Weinstein. He's not a huge fan of facts and science. This might be the beginning of a beautiful

307
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:22,880
 relationship. I can feel his strong manly arms wrapped around me. We're standing on a cliff

308
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:31,040
 overlooking Hollywood, the city below us. He's holding me. I'm all bundled up. I'm all nestled

309
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 against his shoulder blade and he's petting my hair. He goes, "You see out there my young beautiful

310
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:47,440
 girlfriend, Jay Cena. Jay Cena, you see all that town is full of beautiful dudes, but they think

311
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,320
 they're women. And we will show them the..." He's not a very eloquent speaker, by the way.

312
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,120
 "Hans Wormhat." He looks out and he points and he goes, "You see those city lights, Jay Cena.

313
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,640
 Now that you've accepted your true role as a woman, this is getting really creepy. This

314
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,200
 is getting really creepy. But you see that out there, the beautiful brunette bride. That's the

315
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,920
 city of sin. They all believe that they're the correct sex, but they're not. And Harvey Weinstein

316
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,880
 has given us core documents. He pulls the core documents out of his pocket, waves them in his

317
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,720
 hand, provided to us ironically by a person named Jessica Mann. Part of the conspiracy as well,

318
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,840
 I guess. And then he pulls out of his pocket a vial of coronavirus and he's like, "This, this is your

319
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:42,720
 whatever." He's not a well spoken person. Throws the jar into the city of LA. We hear it break,

320
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,600
 even though we're miles up. I guess that's not... The mountains aren't that high up. We hear it

321
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,560
 break and then we start seeing people coughing in the city of LA. And I look at him and I'm like,

322
00:31:52,560 --> 00:32:02,320
 "Oh Hans, you big, you big, you big strong man with your tiny little thin arms. Hold me." And he goes,

323
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:11,280
 "Did you know I will never let you go?" He's holding me tight. And then he turns to the camera and goes,

324
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,160
 "DeadRapRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address." I'm like, "Oh, our email address? We're

325
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,520
 finally... DeadRapRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address. You can also hit us up at
