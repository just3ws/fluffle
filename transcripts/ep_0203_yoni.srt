1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A mysterious disappearance may lead us down a path of the paranormal.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 And then we take a look at an email I got.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,440
 No, not a story request, not really.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,200
 Someone sent me an email about a product of theirs, assuming I would probably have a glowing

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,080
 review for it.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,960
 But their mistake led me down a very, very bizarre path.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,880
 It makes me question a lot of things about society today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,680
 [Music]

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
 You know what?

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
 I have this new drink here.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
 It's called Koyos.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,880
 Oh, sorry, it actually has a presentation key on the can.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
 Koyos.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,440
 Titan of Intelligence.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,200
 It's apparently this drink that has like one carbonate, because I'm on that keto thing.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,040
 It also has Nutropix Electrolytes, coconut MCT oil, brain support.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,560
 This is a Paraguava flavor.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,080
 Now, obviously I'm not being sponsored by these guys.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,400
 So I'm going to try this though, because I've always been curious about Nutropix and stuff

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,200
 that I can drink on a keto diet.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
 Let's see what this tastes like.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
 I haven't had support.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 Let's do a little review.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,200
 Because you know, it's scientific if it's the show, right?

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:37,640
 Well, you know, I've never had Guava before, and I've only eaten one pear my entire life.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,440
 So for all I know, this tastes exactly like Paraguava, but it's okay.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
 That's my review.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,080
 Now let's go on with the show.

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,720
 It doesn't taste that good at all, actually.

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,520
 But let's see if it makes me smarter.

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
 Titan of Intelligence.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,360
 So our first story we're going to talk about.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
 You're driving down the road.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,720
 It's 1989.

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,160
 You're listening to Straight Up by Paula Abdul, number one hit song.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
 You're loving it.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,240
 Straight up now, tell me to you.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,640
 And you're driving down the road.

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,080
 Now in real life, your name would have been Carol Heights, but just for the sake of the

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,520
 story, you are Carol Heights.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,760
 I don't know if Carol was listening to Straight Up.

46
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
 She was.

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
 It was a great song.

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,280
 Driving down the road, it's 1989.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,240
 April 20th, 1989.

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
 It's a little bit after eight o'clock.

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,560
 You're driving through Montana, and there's a car in front of you.

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,560
 You're just lazily going down the road.

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,200
 Oh, oh, oh.

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,080
 And then you see the car in front of you.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,240
 Swerve to the side of the road very quickly.

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,800
 You don't have time to respond.

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,080
 Another car is coming right at you.

58
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,880
 Head on collision between the two cars.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 On a freeway, this wasn't like a back-country road.

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,360
 You stagger out of your car.

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,640
 Moving the door aside, you fall off into the dirt, off very dramatically.

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,880
 Carol just kind of stood out of the car.

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,200
 The car's not totaled, but anyways, in our version of the story, you escape from your

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
 burning car.

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,240
 You reach in to save your Paula Abdul tape.

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,600
 You pull it out of the last minute.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
 You get freeze.

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 It explodes.

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,440
 In real life, though, it was just a head-on collision.

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,400
 Was bad, but it wasn't life-threatening bad.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,680
 So you get out of your car, and in the other car, you see a young blonde woman sitting

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
 behind the wheel.

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,000
 She's also still alive, and you're like, "Phew."

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,440
 And you're like, "Okay, cool.

75
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
 I survived.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
 She survived.

77
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
 My cassette survived.

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
 Everything's fine."

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,960
 But the blonde woman starts to walk-- This is all true story, by the way.

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,680
 I'm not just making this up.

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
 The blonde woman walks up to you.

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
 Just wanted to put you in the story.

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
 Not saying a word.

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,240
 Just staring at you the whole time.

85
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
 Not even staring at you.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,760
 She's staring through you.

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,200
 And you're like, "Is everything okay?

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,700
 Are you-- Hey, listen.

89
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
 Are you okay?

90
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,480
 We just have this big-- First off, why were you driving on the wrong side of the road?

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
 Should be my first question.

92
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,120
 But are you okay?"

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,440
 And the woman who was in the other car, her name was Patricia Meehan.

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,960
 She's simply just staring through you.

95
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,880
 Now, at this point, the car that was in front of you that swerved out of the way, it was

96
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,000
 a man and his adult daughter.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 They get out of the car.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
 And they're like, "Hey, sorry.

99
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,120
 I mean, we saw her driving down the wrong side of the road.

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,400
 We swerved out of the way, and you didn't have time to react."

101
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
 You're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.

102
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,720
 We'll exchange insurance information later.

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,200
 What's up with this girl?"

104
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,200
 And at that point, Patricia walked over to the side of the road, climbed the fence.

105
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,880
 I don't know, imagine how high it was.

106
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,760
 I don't think it was like an eight-foot.

107
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,640
 I don't think she scurried up at like a caterpillar, but she climbed this.

108
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,920
 She scaled this fence, turned around, and then stared at you, the two other people, and the

109
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,240
 car accident, and just stood there.

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,320
 And the man who was in the other car that avoided the accident, he said, "She had this look

111
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,800
 on her face like she had just shown up in a car accident.

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
 It didn't happen to her that she was simply a spectator.

113
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
 She was rubber-necking.

114
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,400
 If you were walking down the street and you saw a car accident, you'd kind of have that

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
 look on your face like, "I wonder what happened there.

116
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,440
 I wonder what's going on."

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
 He said that's what she looked like, that she looked like she had nothing to do with

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
 it.

119
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
 She was just standing there.

120
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,480
 So at this point, the three people who aren't this crazy woman are really concerned, and

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,280
 they're just watching her on the other side of the fence, just staring at them and staring

122
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 at the accident.

123
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,040
 And then she just turns after a while and starts walking off into the darkness.

124
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,600
 Now at this point, again, it's about 815, 820.

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
 It's getting dark.

126
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,880
 So the daughter of the man who was in the other car, she goes to get help.

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,200
 And the father and the you, the you, stay there and discuss it and try to figure out

128
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
 what's going on.

129
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,480
 I'm totally fine, but what was up with that chick climbing that fence?

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,040
 She scurried up like she was Spider-Man.

131
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,120
 She stood there like she had never seen this car accident before, even though she was in

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,680
 it, just walked away.

133
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,760
 The police show up.

134
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,160
 The ambulance just show up.

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,800
 Everyone's fine, but the police immediately begin searching for this woman.

136
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,440
 They want to find out where she's at, not just because she's wandering around in the

137
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,560
 wilderness, but because she caused a head-on collision.

138
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
 I don't know what's going on.

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,360
 They find a trail of tennis shoe footprints, which they believe matched hers, because at

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,040
 this point they were able to run DMV, check them out and stuff.

141
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,920
 And they know they're looking for a woman named Patricia Meehan.

142
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,120
 They know, you know, like from her mom, like how much she weighs and her physical description

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
 and things like that.

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
 The accident started at 815 until 3 a.m.

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,440
 They were following this trail of footprints.

146
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,400
 And then eventually the footprints just kind of faded off into the wilderness.

147
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,000
 And they started to cut the cops, they're like, man, that was weird.

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,840
 That was a really long trail to follow, and then eventually there was just nothing.

149
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,280
 So they started to backtrack, and they came up with two possible scenarios.

150
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,000
 One, she hitchhiked to get away from the scene, but people were like, that was weird, because

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
 she was walking away from the freeway.

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,400
 The second one, which was, there was a hay truck about a half a mile away from the accident,

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,600
 and they're thinking, well, maybe she hid in that hay truck.

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:09,440
 And I'm thinking, what, again, like how many loony-tuned type escapades happen in real

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
 life?

156
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,640
 Like, do people really crawl into the back of hay trucks?

157
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,800
 Like it is a cartoon, and like hillbillies are just driving around and you're like peeking

158
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
 out the back and you're like, swatting chickens.

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,720
 Like, I guess people really do that if the cops are like, well, maybe that's what happened.

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,520
 Whether or not she went on a Tom Sawyer-esque adventure in the back of a hay truck with

161
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,280
 two hillbillies trying to find Uncle Pirate's gold, we don't know.

162
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,440
 What we do know is, between the time of 1989 when this happened and 1994, there were 5,000

163
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,200
 sightings of Patricia Mehan across the US, pretty much from Minnesota to Washington.

164
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
 People were seeing this woman.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,600
 Now you could say probably about half of those were mistaken.

166
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,680
 They just saw a blonde woman walking down the street and they were like, Patricia?

167
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,040
 But there were actually multiple times where people interacted with a woman who bore a striking

168
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,560
 resemblance to Patricia Mehan.

169
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,000
 This was a big case back then.

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,760
 Her family was putting out flyers.

171
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,220
 They hired like helicopter pilots to fly around looking for her.

172
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,840
 People were thinking she might have had amnesia from the car accident.

173
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,360
 The mom said she was suffering from depression.

174
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,960
 And the day after, like, the accident happened on a, she was supposed to be at a psychologist

175
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,360
 appointment on the 21st.

176
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,040
 So she was in treatment for some issues with depression.

177
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,960
 However, she lived in Bozeman, Montana.

178
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,640
 This accident happened in Circle, Montana, which was 400 miles away.

179
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,320
 And the police couldn't figure out why she was that far away.

180
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,520
 The parents couldn't explain why she was that far away.

181
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,400
 She simply was.

182
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,080
 You have a missing person case.

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,040
 A lot of times you will have sightings.

184
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,400
 Like there's been sightings of Madeline McCann here, Madeline McCann here.

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,880
 I don't think anything close to 5,000 sightings in a four year span.

186
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,520
 And I don't think anything close to where law enforcement has actually intervened to

187
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,880
 check as well.

188
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,280
 Or family members go, "No, no, no, no, no, that was her.

189
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,240
 That was a legit sighting of her."

190
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,840
 Let's go, let's put on our paranormal caps here.

191
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,480
 Let's put on our paranormal glasses, actually.

192
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,760
 And look at this story a little closer.

193
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
 You're driving a car.

194
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,640
 You get in a horrible car accident and you walk away from it.

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,200
 Sometimes that can be luck or fate or God, whatever.

196
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,080
 But there's always that idea of a thing called quantum immortality.

197
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,200
 But it's the fact that when you die, you don't actually lose consciousness.

198
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,280
 You shift into another reality where you didn't die.

199
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,880
 Now to the observer in the next universe, they would just see you barely get away with

200
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,120
 your life and go, "Whoa, that was close."

201
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,040
 And you wouldn't notice that you had died either.

202
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,840
 Because your consciousness can't comprehend something where you don't exist.

203
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,400
 But even nature has glitches.

204
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,080
 Everything has glitches.

205
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,440
 We have perfect reproduction systems, but every so often there are glitches in the reproductive

206
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,560
 systems and it can cause birth defects or stillbirths and things like that.

207
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,560
 But for the most part, across the species, reproduction is a natural thing that happens

208
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,160
 normally most of the time.

209
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,760
 But there are sometimes flaws.

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,800
 Extrapolating that, it's possible that the same thing could happen with death.

211
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,040
 Where the car accident, she technically died in, but she shifted to our reality where she

212
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,720
 didn't die in.

213
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,080
 But again, this is a little crazy.

214
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,480
 It's a little creepy.

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,200
 But not--this is my hypothesis.

216
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,040
 And I'm not trying to be, like, make light of this missing woman.

217
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,720
 I know the family's suffering from it and all that stuff.

218
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,520
 I just think it's an interesting story with a possible paranormal answer.

219
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,720
 And I don't know if this is true.

220
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
 I'm really--I just want to read this article.

221
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,960
 This is what kind of popped in my head.

222
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,360
 She gets in the car accident, she shifts to our reality where she's not dead.

223
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,640
 In her old reality, she had died at the point of the car accident.

224
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,760
 Now she's in a reality where she's not dead.

225
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,620
 But what happened as well was not only did she shift, but there was a glitch and multiple

226
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,080
 versions of her shifted into this reality.

227
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,120
 In the sense that when she got out of the car, that wasn't the person who got in the

228
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,400
 car getting in the car accident shifting to a reality where she didn't die in the car

229
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
 accident.

230
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,320
 That was a version of Patricia Mehan who never drove that day.

231
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,080
 And that's why she was looking at it like she had never seen it before.

232
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,440
 She gets out of a vehicle, but two seconds ago she was sitting on her couch at home waiting

233
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,780
 to go to a psychologist appointment the next morning.

234
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:43,220
 But then everything shifted so quickly that she jumps realities basically into one where

235
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,120
 she's not sitting on the couch, she's standing outside a car accident, and she's looking

236
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,920
 at it and she's like, "What am I doing here?

237
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,240
 Why is my car totaled?

238
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
 Where am I?

239
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
 Who are these people?"

240
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,900
 She climbs the fence, probably to get away from them, or that's just a weird detail I

241
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,000
 didn't factor into my hypothesis.

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,880
 And she walks away because she's completely disoriented.

243
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,380
 And all the sitings, all the multiple sitings of all these other Patricia Mehans would be

244
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,180
 people who were suffering from depression in their original reality that have all been

245
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,660
 shifted into a reality where they're just homeless transient women walking through the

246
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,760
 Midwest and the Northwest.

247
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
 Is any of that true?

248
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
 I don't know.

249
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,860
 I don't know.

250
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,100
 Could it possibly give any peace to the family of this missing girl?

251
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,160
 Absolutely not.

252
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,020
 It's actually borderline, it's borderline tasteless.

253
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,520
 But we live in a weird world.

254
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,280
 What you are doing one minute may become drastically different than what you're doing the next.

255
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,120
 Sometimes you can plan for that when you're driving down a dark road at night, you can

256
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,740
 be aware of a catastrophe that may happen.

257
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,120
 But if you're in a reality where you were just enjoying a beautiful sunset, and the

258
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,440
 next thing you know you wake up in a world covered in twisted metal and smoke, as you

259
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,400
 crawl out of your vehicle, where would you go for answers?

260
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,100
 Now after that grim ending, let's go ahead and move on to our next segment.

261
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,380
 Our next segment actually, I get junk emails.

262
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,940
 Everyone gets junk emails, but I get junk emails specifically to my Dead Rabbit radio

263
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,580
 at gmail.com account.

264
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,340
 And so they tend to be a little weirder, like I got invited to join the Illuminati.

265
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,100
 Actually that was a comment on YouTube, but I've gotten some weird stuff, book reviews

266
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,220
 and things like that.

267
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,180
 So I didn't check my email all throughout my break.

268
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,700
 And as my break was winding down, I thought I'd better see if anyone sent me stuff and

269
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,660
 I got this little nugget here.

270
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,640
 No pun intended.

271
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
 That's not a pun actually.

272
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,600
 Okay, so this was an email from Sharon J.

273
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,520
 Now some of you people are going to know what this term is right off the bat.

274
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,000
 I didn't, I had to research it, but if you know what it is, then you can start snickering

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 already.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Here's the email.

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Hello.

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,800
 I really visit your blog repeatedly and read all your posts, which are very interesting.

279
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,440
 So right there I knew that this was some sort of scam, because I don't have a blog.

280
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 Next sentence.

281
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,940
 Yawning eggs is one of our sites and we constantly work a lot to make it more interesting for

282
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
 our site visitors.

283
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,820
 It is all about yawning eggs and health benefits for women.

284
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,560
 We recently provide a free, complete infographics, whatever that means, about improved sensual

285
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,360
 and physical joy by yawning eggs.

286
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,660
 So at this point I'm thinking, okay, I don't know what yawning eggs are.

287
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,740
 It's obviously some sort of scam because this email is garbage.

288
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,480
 And I'm assuming at this point that it's some sort of like necklace, like in the shape of

289
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,360
 an egg, maybe a ring, maybe a edible product because it's eggs.

290
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
 Something egg shaped.

291
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,320
 I wonder if they picked up on it because of my eggless travel episode, but something egg-like.

292
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,640
 I had no idea that these things are incredibly popular and there is a, there is actually

293
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,480
 a very good chance that at some point in my life I have had a conversation with a woman

294
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,740
 while she was using a yawning egg.

295
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,820
 So what's a yawning egg?

296
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,780
 So what is a yawning egg?

297
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,500
 Well a yawning egg in the boat, this part's going to get non-safer work.

298
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,980
 So I assume that if you're listening to this at work and it's time to either shut it off

299
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,740
 and I'll see you tomorrow or put on headphones.

300
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,700
 So a yawning egg is a, it's an egg shaped object made of stone.

301
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,120
 So they have a made out of obsidian, jade and quartz and you shove it up your pussy basically.

302
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,560
 Like your vagina, I guess wouldn't be a better word for it, but it is, not a better word,

303
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,680
 it's the actual word, but it's an egg made of stone that you put inside of you if you're

304
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
 a woman.

305
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,520
 There are more, I went to this website, there are multiple things saying do not use rectally,

306
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,000
 do not put it up your butthole.

307
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,240
 So sorry guys.

308
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,860
 So the yawning egg is this rock, an egg shaped rock that you slide inside of you.

309
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,100
 So obviously my first question was why?

310
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
 Why would you do this?

311
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,380
 I'm thinking at first like it's to get off, it must be some sort of sex thing.

312
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,100
 You put it up there and then you just kind of walk around and it feels like you're constantly

313
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
 full.

314
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,300
 Let me also say this right now, I have, and I might have talked about this before, but

315
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:10,740
 my knowledge of the female reproductive system is as much as I need to have sex.

316
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,740
 That's it.

317
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,820
 I don't really know much else what's going on there.

318
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,680
 Whenever I look at pictures of like, you know, that everyone's seeing that famous drawing

319
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,600
 of like the fallopian tube and the uterus and it looks like a goat head, looks like a monster.

320
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,740
 The drawing, the drawing, not the uterus itself, I don't know what those look like, but anyway,

321
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,980
 so that thing, like that vase shape thing and all that, I don't know really how I get

322
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,260
 how like if you bang a chick and you come inside of her, it goes up into the, or the eggs come

323
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
 down.

324
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,540
 I was actually remembering once, I was talking to this, I was talking to Lana actually.

325
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,940
 We were talking about like reproductive systems and I was like, oh yeah, you know, like sperm's

326
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,620
 better than eggs because like you, the sperm, like the eggs just flowing around and the

327
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,700
 sperm goes in it and then like it grows and she's like, what?

328
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,740
 And this conversation was like six years ago.

329
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
 I wasn't 12.

330
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,580
 I was like, yeah, like the egg is like the little nest that the sperm goes into and it

331
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,860
 like grows.

332
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:11,620
 Like the egg is basically just the bed for the sperm and she's looking at me in disbelief

333
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,060
 and she goes, talking to you is like talking to a scientist from the 1800s.

334
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:22,100
 She goes, I, that's so far off basis of how the reproductive system works.

335
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,460
 She goes talking to you, it seems like you expect that if you looked at sperm through

336
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,900
 a microscope, you would see a little guy in the sperm with like a top hat and a cane.

337
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,580
 She goes, it's totally not how it works.

338
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,580
 Like the egg is not simply a bed.

339
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
 And I was like, I don't know.

340
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,340
 I really only know enough that I can physically have sex.

341
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,380
 Everything else after that I'm really not concerned about that all being said, where

342
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
 was it going with this?

343
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,380
 Oh, oh yeah.

344
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,260
 So I don't understand how the female body works inside.

345
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,860
 My thing is what is the, like you put a yawney egg up in there.

346
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
 It has to be sexual.

347
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,740
 It can't really be any other reason for it, right?

348
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,540
 Well it turns out that the yawney, and yawney actually apparently means vagina or one of

349
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,100
 the million words that means vagina.

350
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,740
 I know that sheath means vagina.

351
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
 I know that.

352
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,500
 But so you put it up there and you basically hold it with your muscles, your little vaginal

353
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,860
 muscles, your muscle walls in there and it helps you have better orgasms and makes you

354
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
 tighter.

355
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,580
 It increases lubrication for you.

356
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,060
 It increases lubrication at any age, according to this website.

357
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,020
 So you could be 108 and just still be like dripping wet.

358
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,900
 You have the right stone in you.

359
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,860
 Some moms, this was a quote, some moms use yawney eggs to assist in after birth recovery.

360
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,620
 Now again, don't know much about female reproductive organs, but I do know that women tend to shred

361
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,980
 open during birth.

362
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,940
 Big gash down there.

363
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,740
 I don't recommend putting eggs in there now to be fair.

364
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,380
 I don't think they're putting stones in right after the baby comes out.

365
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,140
 I don't think the baby comes out and the woman's like, "Okay, hand me my stone and

366
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
 hand it."

367
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,300
 And the doctor's like, "What are you putting in there?"

368
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
 "No, no!"

369
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,420
 And she's just sliding these rocks inside of her.

370
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,300
 But anyways, that's what it says on the website.

371
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 So that's real end.

372
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,740
 The reason why they're like, "Oh, but also because it's jade or quartz or obsidian."

373
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,340
 The obsidian ones are the really heavy ones too.

374
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,380
 They're like, "Don't buy an obsidian one right off the bat."

375
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,700
 And they're like, "I'm not going to buy one."

376
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,820
 Because their vaginal walls aren't strong enough that if you put in a rock that's too

377
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,460
 heavy for you, it just falls out.

378
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,180
 Rolling on the ground, people are like, "What was that?"

379
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,660
 And she's like, "Oh, sorry.

380
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,780
 I have to move to my media mate."

381
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,580
 But anyway, so they put that's what it is.

382
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,660
 And the fact that it's obsidian or quartz or jade also centers the energies, the chakras

383
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
 in your body.

384
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,540
 And according to this website, a lot of your emotional stress accumulates in your yani,

385
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,580
 in your vagina, and it basically can cause negative...

386
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,980
 Oddly Scientologists in this part, but these negative energies can attach to your body

387
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,540
 and specifically in your vagina walls.

388
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,060
 And so if you strengthen your vagina walls, you're actually releasing all this negative

389
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,660
 energy out of your body.

390
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,300
 So that's another reason why you should get this to spiritually cleanse yourself.

391
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,820
 One of the quotes I'm reading on this website, and I'm like, "This is just nonsense, but

392
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,220
 it's hilarious nonsense."

393
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,380
 One of the quotes was, "The yani egg isn't just an exquisite accessory that will add

394
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,980
 charm to your nightstand.

395
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,540
 I don't recommend leaving stuff out that you put inside your body on your nightstand.

396
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,220
 I especially don't recommend doing it after you've given birth because that means you

397
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,140
 have kids, which means that kids are going to go like, "Hey, let's go play with mommy's

398
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
 magic rock."

399
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,380
 It's a bad idea, especially because if they go out play with it in the mud, there's actually

400
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,060
 an advertisement for these things that involve the Easter Bunny and an Easter basket.

401
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,460
 They show like an Easter basket and they're like, "They have their eggs, get yours today,"

402
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,020
 and there's a little picture of a yani egg, and I'm thinking that is the grossest advertising

403
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,300
 possible because now I'm thinking of kids hiding chocolate-covered eggs in the grass,

404
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,260
 or not hiding them, finding them, and then mommy being like, "Oh, I have a special egg

405
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
 that only I can..."

406
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,140
 Like, why would you put that?

407
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
 Why would you combine that?

408
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,020
 But anyways, don't leave it out on...

409
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,940
 If you happen to have one of these, don't leave it out on your nightstand.

410
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,300
 Don't people like, "Oh, that's a really exquisite little rock.

411
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
 Where'd you get that jade rock?"

412
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,980
 And they're like picking it up playing with it.

413
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,300
 They're like, "Why is it so slippery?"

414
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,980
 "Woof, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop,

415
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,020

434
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop,

435
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 hard liquor, not rubbing alcohol though, it's very clear, do not use rubbing alcohol. So I almost imagine the housewife sitting at home

436
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 wiping the, the, he got off with a swab of vodka and being like, one shot for you, glook glook, one shot for me, one shot for you, glook glook.

437
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 And then, you're like, Jason, I didn't know you were such a misogynist. But I'm just saying, this is, guys don't have

438
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:46,500
 non-scented organic natural soap at home, for the most part, stereotype, sure. Oh, oh, and here's another little tip if you want to make it

439
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 super powerful. Again, this is when you should realize that you're, they're selling you a load of junk. It's a rock you put inside of you

440
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 that's supposed to strengthen your vaginal muscles, I can't even say that word anymore, and align your chakras and do all the stuff, make orgasms better,

441
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 but if you really want to charge it up, if you want it to work, the first day you get it, put it in a bowl full of sea salt, leave it out overnight facing the moon.

442
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,500
 I would love to go to a doctor and be like, hey, you know, I'm having some back problems. You're like, well, we do have this prescription.

443
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 I'll give you seven day prescription for this Vicodin, but what we recommend is taking the Vicodin, getting an oleander plant, putting the pill,

444
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 wrapping it in the flower leaves and leaving it to be taken away by the Eastern tide on the 15th. You'd be like, what are you talking about?

445
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 What type of nonsense is coming out of your mouth? If someone's selling you something that is like, yes, this will help you meditate fine, whatever, but they're trying to make this be a physical change in your body,

446
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 however, it's charged by the moon. Garbage, garbage. I gotta take another drink of my new tropics here. Yes, I'm talking trash about this.

447
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 I've been eyeing this Kiosk bottle the whole time, Kiosk bottle. How often should I wear the egg?

448
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 Start off a couple minutes, you know, just like any exercise, you don't want to go full blown, you don't want to blow your walls out right away,

449
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:13,500
 but they recommend two to three hours a day, every day, and they say eventually you'll be able to work yourself up, a lot of women, leave it inside them for 12 hours.

450
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 So here's the thing, these are fairly popular. They were sold on Gwyneth Paltrow's healthy nonsense website called Goop,

451
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 and they actually got involved in a lawsuit because they claimed all this medical stuff and stayed in California to suit them.

452
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 Goop settled out of court and offered refunds to all the people, but they still sell the eggs, they still sell them, they just don't claim that they give you all these medical benefits.

453
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 They just sell them and women still buy them. 12 hours is a long time to have a foreign object in you, but again, this is what I'm saying.

454
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 It's probably pretty likely that at some point you have, whether or not you're a man or a woman, have had a conversation with a woman standing there holding a stone inside of her.

455
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,500
 They've sold hundreds of thousands of these things. It's possible.

456
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,500
 You're like, "Hey, how's it going?" They're like, "Oh yeah, it's going really good. Work's going good." Stuff like that, and you're like...

457
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 You seem unbelievably tense right now. "Oh no, no, no, I'm doing fine. Just holding some stuff and dealing with some problems."

458
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 Oh, okay. I'll talk to you later. They do fall out. They actually say, "You got to be careful when you're going to the bathroom

459
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,500
 until you have the skill to keep it inside of you because when you sit down and go to the bathroom, it'll fall in the toilet."

460
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:36,500
 So they give you the great advice that as you're going to the bathroom to have your hand ready to catch the yawning egg before it hits the toilet water,

461
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 big logistical problem with that, you're pretty sure you're going to pee and poop on your hand.

462
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:49,500
 You might be able to keep the rock from going into the toilet bowl, but they didn't really think that went out.

463
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 They didn't really think that went out. I thought, though, the funniest one was about almost all the way down the list for

464
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 the frequently asked questions. They had this one. "The egg is stuck. What should I do?"

465
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 I can guarantee that is the most frequently asked question. I can guarantee that that should have been at the very top of the list.

466
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 The number one question people are asking is, "Oh my God, I can't get it out. I can't get it out. Please help me."

467
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,500
 They said, "Listen, there's no way that I can go up past your cervix, which again I would need a map to find it anyways,

468
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,500
 but you can't go all the way past up the cervix. But they can't get stuck up there and when we get stressed out,

469
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 not we as in me, but we as in the women who bought this thing or just women in general, their walls tend to contract,

470
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,500
 which traps the egg and it's up there." But they're like, "Listen, people have had them up there for 24 hours. It's no big deal.

471
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 Once you relax, it'll just roll on out of you like the Easter Bunny dropping one off."

472
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 Now that's not exactly what they said, but it was just relaxed.

473
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 But again, I guarantee you that is the first, really the first frequently asked question.

474
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 They also tell you, someone asks, a frequently asked question, is, "How do you insert it?"

475
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 And they're like, "Don't really use lube because you'll create your own lube anyways as you're using this.

476
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 I guess you can have like a surplus of it. You're jarring your own lube, putting it for a rainy day."

477
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:21,500
 But one of the techniques is they're like, "Relax your body. Give yourself a gentle breast massage using a silk scarf

478
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:28,500
 or a strip of fabric. Massage your nipples. Start working your way down your body.

479
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,500
 Massage your inner thighs. Begin to touch your yariani." So basically just masturbate.

480
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,500
 Like they could have just said, someone could have said, "So how do I enter this into me without lube?"

481
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 And they're like, "Just masturbate." Just masturbate, slide it in. You're good to go.

482
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 But on your panties, head off to work. That's really what they're telling you to do in so many words.

483
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 So that's the yarii egg. The conspiracy, I think, isn't so much that people are dumb enough to buy these things

484
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 or that people are greedy enough to sell products that can actually really hurt someone.

485
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 It really made me think that there is a secret society of women out there with eggs inside of them all the time.

486
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,500
 I mean, even if, let's say they sold a million of these and only half of the women use them on a regular basis,

487
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 there's still 500,000 women spread out across the world with a rock inside of them.

488
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 And honestly, talk about predictive programming. If there's anything that's going to get us ready for the reptilian overlords,

489
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,500
 it's going to be knowing that women around you have eggs in them and they can fall out at any given time.

490
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 And so they keep buying these eggs and then dropping them off. You're at their office space, there's just eggs,

491
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 wet eggs rolling around on the ground. You can't complain because then it'll seem like you're sexist,

492
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:54,500
 but you really can't complain because the yarii egg overlords are actually being directed by the reptilians.

493
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:02,500
 So the day that the shape-shifting reptilians actually are dropping real eggs on the ground, we won't know the difference.

494
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 Now, obviously, I don't think that the reptilians are in charge of the yarii eggs,

495
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 but I do find subcultures absolutely fascinating.

496
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:21,500
 And the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of women walking around with eggs they bought off the internet

497
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,500
 inside of them is flat out bizarre to me.

498
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 To me, that is more ridiculous than anything like Illuminati based, because it's real.

499
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 Because it's real, because people have receipts, companies can say how much of these they've shipped.

500
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,500
 They're all over the place. I feel like I've discovered real-life pot people.

501
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,500
 You don't know who has the egg inside of them.

502
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 Maybe they all do, except you.

503
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
