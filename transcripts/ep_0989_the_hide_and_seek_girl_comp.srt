1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Did you know that you could get arrested simply by putting the wrong words into a Google search engine?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Maybe that's not exactly true. Maybe I am kind of stretching it a bit, but it's a crazy story.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And then we traveled to Germany to meet a young family who has moved into an apartment building where they are the only tenants.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 As the children run from floor to floor hiding in abandoned apartments, they have no idea that a new player has entered the game.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having tons of fun.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Doing whatever you're doing. It's still a couple weeks away, but I should announce that now we will be doing a live stream special on Christmas Day.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 The day when everyone's busy doing something else. I don't know why I plan it this way.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 But you don't have anything to do for the holidays, or maybe if you do.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Come and join us. I will give you more details as the date comes clear.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 But someone who never needs more details given about them.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Someone who can be read like a perfect book from a mile away.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Everyone give it up for A. Sampson. 1, 2, 3.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 A. Sampson. Woohoo. Yeah. Come on in.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 To Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Shave his head. Shave his head so he loses all his strength.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 A. Sampson. Let's go ahead and toss you the oars to the rabbit robo.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Ro ro ro us all the way out to Denver, Colorado.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Oh splash. Oh splash. He's beating the drum.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 We're rowing to the beat. We're slaves to the rhythm.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Actually we're probably just slaves. He's making us row this boat across America.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It's August 5th, 2020.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 [Snapping]

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Martha. Martha. Call 911. The neighbor's house is on fire.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 [Snapping]

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Actually that's too many numbers for a 911.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 911, what's your emergency? The house is on fire.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Can't you see the flames? Can't you see the flames from the fire department?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Oh yeah. Woo woo woo. Fire engine pulls up.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 If you guys are home and you're chasing, you're doing a lot of sound effects.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Start of this story. This story is pretty grim.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I figured I can't make it as lighthearted as possible.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 There's a Dalmatian running around the house.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Firemen keep dropping pails of water. Charlie Chaplin shows up.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 That's pretty much the end of the jokes. Unfortunately, in Denver, Colorado,

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 on August 5th, 2020, there was an arson in this suburban neighborhood.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 There's eight people living in this house. Five people died in this fire.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Someone set the fire deliberately. Five people died.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 All members of the same family is absolutely horrific.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Five people died in this fire and the police, they have no idea who did this.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 They cannot figure out who would be so inhuman to set a house on fire, kill five people.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Apparently there is some surveillance video footage in the area.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 It's probably like a Ring Doorbell type camera. Maybe a traffic light cam somewhere.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 They were able to get video footage of three men wearing hoodies and full face masks.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's like a hockey mask or a purge type mask.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So they have no idea who these people were. They go, "Those three guys are probably the ones who committed this arson."

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But why would they do it? What is the motive?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Well, it turns out they did end up arresting three people for this crime.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 They were all teenagers. There's like two 16-year-olds and I think the other one was like 14 or 15.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 These kids set this house on fire, burned it down and killed five people.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And it was really interesting. At the time, the Denver police chief, Paul Payzen,

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 gave a comment about this to the media. He was talking about their investigation and he said, "This was as complex of an investigation as I am aware of in my entire career."

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 They did an amazing job. I cannot give away the details.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 This is very sensitive information because successful prosecution is critical in this case.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Now cops always say stuff like that, right? They're always saying, "You know, we can't reveal too much information, blah, blah, blah."

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But this statement in this case was 100% true because how they caught these guys is raising a lot of eyebrows across America.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I want to give a shout out to NBC News. This is the only place I really found any information on this.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 In the NBC News, there is a journalist named John Schupp.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 He wrote an article about what they did to catch these guys. And it's weird because on the one hand, yeah, they caught three teenagers who murdered five people, right?

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 An arson attack that killed this family. The way they did it was the police went to Google and said, "We want to know everyone who typed this address in to your search engine."

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 We want a list of everyone who searched for this address. And I think they gave them a time parameter. I think it was within 15 days before the attack.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And they got a judge to sign off on it. The judge sent it to Google and Google says, "Here you go."

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Here's a list of everyone who searched for that address before the attack.

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Now, it's super interesting because you're just fishing. You're just fishing for information.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Normally, you have a suspect, you have a name, or you have some sort of description, the type of car they have, and you can then go to the DMV and go,

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 "Give us the addresses of everyone who owns a white Subaru in the area."

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 You have some DNA, so they go, "Let's start running this DNA. Let's start running these fingerprints through these databases that we have."

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That local PD or the federal government has. This is one where they went to Google and says, "Tell us everyone who typed this address into your search engine."

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And Google did. Google saw the court order and said, "Yeah, sure. Here's a list of everyone who did it."

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Shockingly enough, this is just weird to begin with because we know three people were behind it.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 There were 61 people who searched for that address before the fire. Within 15 days before the fire, 61 different people typed in that address.

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 What were they looking at it for? Well, the police investigated as much as they could and they were able to narrow it down.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 They kept going, "Okay, so we think it was this group of people." They narrowed it down to about 12 or 6, and then they kept asking Google for more information.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What's the IP addresses? Where are these people at? Where do they live? Where did they search this from?

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And eventually, they found one of the three teenagers. They got his address from the fact that he typed in the address of the house two weeks prior to the house burning down.

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 So they went and they talked to him and they arrested him. They got all of his social media accounts and then they are able to get the other two guys as well.

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Now, the lawyer of the 17-year-old who got arrested for this, he was arguing in court. He goes, "This is violation of the Fourth Amendment.

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 You just can't walk around the neighborhood and walk into people's houses and hopefully find information on that employee that's against the law.

83
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 That's unreasonable search and seizure. You're searching their Google searches.

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 What's the difference between getting that and getting every phone call made 15 days before an event?

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 The judge in the murder case, it's still going on. The trial is still going on for these three teenagers.

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 The judge goes, "I'll allow it. I will allow this Google information. It's allowable in trial."

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 This is super weird and apparently this isn't the first time. They've used this about four or five other times recently.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And that might have been the first four or five times. John Shoup was kind of listing off the other times and I was reading some of those articles as well.

89
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 They used it for a sex trafficking case. They used it in a fraud case where they go, "The fraud case is what happened once this person was being defrauded."

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And the police are like, "We don't know how to track them down. Let's find out everyone who searched this victim's name within this time period before the crime."

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They were able to get the IP address of the person who put in that name.

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Now listen, I'm not pro arson. And what's terrifying about this too is so now that they've been arrested, the police figured out what the motive was.

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 They burned down the wrong house. Apparently one of their cell phones went missing and they thought it was these people who stole their cell phone.

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So they went to set fire to that person's house, but instead they burned this house down and killed five people.

95
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So they weren't even the intended target. It's not like that makes it any better, right? It's still a horrible tragedy.

96
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You're like, "Oh, but they killed the people who stole the phone." That's okay then.

97
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It was petty revenge and it was the wrong house to begin with. It's a super interesting story and I mean...

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 We all know there's zero privacy online. At least I hope you know that, right? There's zero privacy online.

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I don't care how many VPNs you got. I know a lot of people use VPNs and you're like, "Oh, I can watch shows in countries where those shows aren't allowed in my country."

100
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 That's all they're good for. If you really think that your VPN is protecting your identity, it's not.

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 There are a hundred different ways they're going to find you and I don't believe any piece of technology like a VPN would even be allowed on the marketplace if there isn't a backdoor.

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Just like whenever I read these articles about the police arresting people and they're like, "They didn't give us the password for the phone so we went to Apple and said, 'Unlock this phone,' and Apple said, 'No, we're not going to do it.'

103
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 That's all smoke and marriage. Those police have a hundred different ways into your devices. I don't believe for a second that they can actually add...

104
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 They have to ask Apple for access. I think that's all a charade. I really, really do.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So you know there's no privacy online. You know there's no privacy online. That's why no one wants to sponsor this show.

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I'm not going to get a Nord VPN sponsorship. There's no privacy online. At the same time, I know when I put it into Google, somebody has access to it, but the fact that the police are just basically doing this huge trawling.

107
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And remember there were 61 other people typing this address in. Who knows what reason? Innocently. They had nothing to do with any of that.

108
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But they were also getting trawled through and then so all of the stuff they did online had to be looked at. So the police could rule them out as a suspect.

109
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I don't want the government looking at my stuff. I mean, I know what they do, right? It's just, it's this weird thing. I know that they do. I know that they have access to all of that stuff.

110
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 But at the same time, like, so there's a thing called geofencing where the police have said, we see this all the time in true crime, in true crime articles.

111
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 What happens is generally someone gets caught for murder and they go, I wasn't in that area and the police can go. Well, that's funny because we have your cell phone pinging in this area and we can show that her cell phone was pinging in that area too.

112
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 But only your cell phone left that area. Like, we can track all that. That's when they actually have the suspect already. They can prove that he's lying.

113
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 They also do this thing called geofencing. I mean, there's a shooting in Baltimore and the police will say, we want the electronic device signature. We want the cell phone pings of everyone who was in that area before, during and after that shooting.

114
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 We want to know everyone who was there because we all have these tracking devices on us. That's been ruled illegal in Virginia. That's the only place where you can't do that. Every other state right now, you can do that. The cops can say, we want to know everyone who was in this area.

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I mean, again, I'm not pro arson. I'm glad that these guys got arrested. It's just the way that they do it. It's so interesting and it opens up a whole bunch of legal issues. It really, really does.

116
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Because at what point, I mean, at what point should we just be mailing, just printing out mailing in our searches to the cops? Just, I mean, just to skip a step, right?

117
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Because as long as a judge signs off on it, Google's going to comply. Now, Google will not say how many of these they get on a regular basis. Like, we know about four or five cases.

118
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 This could happen all the time. We are not privy to, like, Google's like, we're not even going to tell you how many times we get these calls in a week.

119
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 But I mean, from a law enforcement thing, it makes sense, right? They want to do it. They want to find out who's there.

120
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And I thought about this. I thought about this. There is a YouTube video. I'll put a link in the show notes. I've really thought about just having the last 10 minutes of the podcast be this video.

121
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It is, I mean, listen, the worst thing, think of the worst thing you could possibly put into a search engine, right?

122
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So Nicholas Cruz, that guy who shot up Stoneman Douglas High School down in Florida.

123
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 There is a YouTube video. It's about 10 minutes long, and it's a prosecutor reading off all of Nicholas Cruz's search requests. Everything he typed into Google.

124
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And it is so explicit. I would not sleep at night. I'll put it in the show notes. I'll put the link in the show notes. I'll let someone else sleep at night.

125
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I could not, I thought, dude, I should just take this audio and put it at the end of an episode, because it's so insane.

126
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 The stuff that this guy, it's not safe for work. I'll tell you that. Don't start blasting on the loudspeakers.

127
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It's some of the grossest stuff you could ever imagine. It is, I haven't been able to make it. I have not been able to make it the full 10 minutes.

128
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And this isn't a challenge either. I'm not going to be like, hey, you told me how long you lasted. They had all of us. I don't know what the timeline was. I don't really care.

129
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I don't care if it was across 10 years or one week. It is some of the most disgusting things you could ever think of.

130
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 My thing was, why didn't he arrest him when he typed in the first five things?

131
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 The stuff he was putting in was so illegal. These are things he was looking for. It wasn't that he was just making a shopping list.

132
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Well, he wasn't making a shopping list. He wanted this stuff. He was typing this into Google.

133
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But it's not like he was just writing it down in his dream journal, which, trust me, he would have been worrisome enough there.

134
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 If it's his internal thoughts, you can't arrest someone for pre-crime. It's so bizarre that you can't investigate someone for looking into what he looked into.

135
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And I'm glad the arsonist got arrested. I'm glad the sex traffickers got arrested and the person who got defrauded found justice.

136
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I'm glad for all that stuff, but it's just so interesting that they're literally, I mean, it is no different than walking into everyone's house in that area and saying, do you have any gasoline here?

137
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 That's really what they did, which would have been illegal. But since they used Google, they was legal. It's super interesting.

138
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And it will be happening way more. It will be happening way, way more. A. Sampson123.

139
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Quit going on to show notes. He's like, I don't think it's that. I doubt that YouTube video is going to be that bad, Jason.

140
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 No, don't, don't, don't. Hey, let me give you the keys to the carpenter copter. Take us away from Denver, Colorado. We are headed all the way out to Germany.

141
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 (imitates carpenters)

142
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 This is a really cool story. I got sent by one of you guys, a longtime Patreon supporter of the show BS is his name.

143
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Very, very fascinating and terrifying story coming out of a small town in Germany.

144
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And it's not his story. He said he was actually him and his coworker were driving around late one night. His coworker told him this story.

145
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 We're in northern Germany at an unnamed small harbour town, which I understand. He was one of Doc's coworker.

146
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 This story took place in the past though. I don't think this is... I know this guy still doesn't live in this apartment complex.

147
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Apparently in this German town, there's an apartment complex that had caught on fire. The firefighters came in, they stopped the fire, they saved the building, but nobody wanted to live there.

148
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Nobody wanted to live in an apartment building. They just got entorged and had a bunch of water damage everywhere.

149
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 But when BS's friend, we're going to go ahead and call him Billy, he's 16 years old. His family moved into this apartment complex.

150
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And it was Bill, his mom, his dad, and his little brother, we're going to call him Joey, who's only six.

151
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Bill's 16, Joey's 6 years old. They move into this apartment complex and they said, you know, it was actually kind of cool.

152
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 It was actually kind of cool. You had the whole complex to yourself and none of the apartment doors were locked.

153
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 So you really had the whole complex to yourself. Now, I don't know if they got their stuff out of there. I don't know if they were running around like, oh, this house has a Nintendo 64.

154
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Take it at home. I don't know. I don't think they were thieves, but you definitely had all of these rooms.

155
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And behind each door, a mystery, right? Around the corner of each hallway, an undiscovered path.

156
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And these kids, they made good use of this apartment complex. When their cousins would come over, they'd play hide and go seek.

157
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Can you imagine playing hide and go seek in an entire apartment complex? I don't know how big this was.

158
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 I don't know if it was like three stories or if it was one of those like multi-wrapper round units with 100 units, but still.

159
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 You would have to set some series parameters with that hide and go seek game.

160
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 You'd have to be like, okay, okay, Joey, today, please, only the fifth and sixth floor.

161
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I don't want to have to run up and down all these floors looking for you. There's under departments here.

162
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 You would have to set some parameters. But if you're playing hide and go seek in an apartment complex, it's going to be a pretty involved game.

163
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 But Billy said one thing when you were playing hide and go seek, if you didn't get found right away, right, you're the hider, not the seeker.

164
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You didn't get found for a while. You could start to feel the loneliness.

165
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 You're hiding in an apartment that no one's been in for months. You're just curled up in the corner all alone.

166
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 The longer you went without being found, the more a sense of true isolation would set in.

167
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Now, despite the fact that they had an entire apartment complex to play hide and go seek, everything wasn't great at this apartment complex

168
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 because that doesn't help the adults at all. I guess if they don't want to hang out with their kids, they're like, hey, shouldn't you go play hide and go seek?

169
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 He's like, I'm home by myself. Oh yeah, go find yourself. Consider it a spiritual journey.

170
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 The parents, I mean, they liked the apartment as well, but the problem was, was in their apartment, the ceiling was black.

171
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Not like painted black. It was like blackened, which they figured had obviously had something to do with the fire,

172
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 but probably more to do with water damage in the apartment above them and their apartment themselves.

173
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 So they go, you know, that's kind of gross. That's kind of gross. Having a black ceiling. Let's paint it.

174
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Let's get rid of it. Let's paint over it. So one day they did, they painted the ceiling to match the walls,

175
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 but over time, the ceiling would turn black again as if they had never painted it.

176
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And not only that, they could actually see that the ceiling would once again become damp.

177
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Billy's mom starts to find trash in the apartment.

178
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 She's like, what's that piece of garbage doing over there? Old banana peel, saran wrap,

179
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 just sitting behind the couch, like, what in the world? Now she does have two sons, right?

180
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And you could probably chalk it up to kids just being messy. So she throws the banana peel away, throws away the saran wrap.

181
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 But she starts to notice more and more just miscellaneous pieces of trash popping up around the apartment.

182
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 But she also, when she sees these, and she does apparently question the boys, they go, we have nothing to do with it.

183
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 What are you talking about? Billy said my mom would not only find trash strewn about the apartment,

184
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 it would be trash that she personally put in the garbage can. It was stuff that she knew should have been in the garbage can.

185
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Later she would find that same piece of trash somewhere else in the apartment.

186
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Now again, two boys could be them. Most likely them right kids love trash.

187
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 The family would be hanging out in the living room debating what color of paint they're going to do the ceiling next time.

188
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 They'd be sitting in the living room hanging out and they would hear coming from the apartment above them.

189
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 [MUMBLING]

190
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 That's the sound of somebody walking above them.

191
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 If you didn't know what that was, you're like, what? Someone's using a thightmaster up there?

192
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 They would hear what sounded like someone in the apartment above them.

193
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Now anyone who's ever lived in an apartment, we're familiar with those sounds. They pretty much grew up in apartments.

194
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 You're used to that. The problem was, is they were the only people in the entire complex,

195
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 but every so often they'd hear someone walking around upstairs.

196
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Then the family begins to suffer issues with their electronics.

197
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 One night Billy wakes up in the middle of the night to find his television on in his bedroom.

198
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 [MUMBLING]

199
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I don't know if it was on Spooky, Spooky Snow Channel. It could have been showing rug rats for all I know.

200
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 The point is, it's a television. It doesn't matter what it is, right? It doesn't matter what it is.

201
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 You're dead asleep, your television turns on, and it shouldn't be on.

202
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 It's terrifying. It doesn't matter if it's a rerun of Doug. It's still awful.

203
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 His television turned on in the middle of the night. We'll come up one night.

204
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 The other members of the household also started to experience things like that.

205
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Electronics would turn on when they shouldn't be on.

206
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 When no one turned them on, they would go, "Ding!" Turn on.

207
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Billy said, "Around this point, it stopped being fun. It stopped being fun to live there."

208
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Because the whole family is experiencing weird stuff right now.

209
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 What's interesting, because I read this a couple of times and looking over my notes,

210
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 it's interesting that Billy never mentions what his dad experienced.

211
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 We know the mom was finding the trash everywhere, and the two brothers,

212
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 well, I don't want to give it away, Joey has an experience coming up.

213
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I'm curious. There could be one or two things going on.

214
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Even though I said there's a dad in the house, there may not be a dad.

215
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I think there is, because at one point he mentions his parents.

216
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 What I'm getting at is I'm wondering if the dad was also experiencing stuff,

217
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 and he wasn't telling anybody. He wasn't telling anybody.

218
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Because he was just like, "My family's going to freak out if I told them this."

219
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Because this story took place years and years ago.

220
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Actually, I can play it at least 12 years ago. I know that for a fact.

221
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 But yeah, I'm wondering if the dad, because we have experience from the mom,

222
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 experience from both brothers, but the dad, there's no interesting, right?

223
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 The dad could just be like, "I'm not telling my family about that."

224
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 But whether or not the dad was experiencing anything, or whether or not the dad existed in the first place,

225
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 he was the ghost all along.

226
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 The fact is that it stopped being fun to live here.

227
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Now, there was no more running up and down the hallways, no more hiding in the apartments.

228
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Billy said, "We pretty much just locked the front door and watched movies."

229
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 That was our fun. Because the creep factor just kept getting worse and worse and worse.

230
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Well, one night Billy and Joey were home alone.

231
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And then all of a sudden, boom!

232
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Power goes out.

233
00:25:47,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Billy and Joey are home alone in an abandoned, burned-out apartment complex with no electricity.

234
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And it's terrifying, right? You'd obviously, you've already heard all of these weird noises.

235
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 The unpaintable ceiling, the unpaintable ceiling of doom.

236
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Like, Tronics have been turning themselves on and off.

237
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 You've had some weird things going on here. Now the power goes out, and it's terrifying.

238
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 But Billy's sitting there in the dark, and he goes, "Wait a second. Wait a second.

239
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I can't chalk this up to being paranormal. It is quite likely that all that has happened is a fuse has burned out."

240
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I mean, after all this place was engulfed in flames, the fuse box may have suffered some damage.

241
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 So I just need to walk down the hallway of this abandoned, burned-out apartment complex and change the fuse.

242
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Now in America we have our circuit breaker boxes, right? They just go, "Click." You walk and you flip them.

243
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Apparently, in the rest of the world, it's like dying light, where you have to find fuses and carry them from point A to point B and plug them in.

244
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I had to look this up because I was like, "What in the world is a fuse box?"

245
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 So Billy, apparently he has a fuse in the drawer or something like that.

246
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 He takes a fuse and he leaves his little brother in the apartment, because it really is Joe.

247
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 What's Joey's choices are? Walk through the darkness of this apartment, and who knows what is out there, or be comfortable on your couch.

248
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I mean, you're shrouded in darkness either way. Maybe they have flashlight, but...

249
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Joey stays behind and Billy takes the fuse and he walks through the fuse box.

250
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Easy peasy, right? He's going to get this electricity back on.

251
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 He says right when he's getting ready to put the fuse back in, he hears the most blood-curdling scream he's ever heard in his life.

252
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And he recognizes it as his little brother's voice.

253
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 He runs back through the hallway, bone-chilling scream coming from the apartment.

254
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He runs in the door and his little brother is curled up on the couch.

255
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And he is sobbing so heavily and screaming so loud.

256
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 His six-year-old brother is just hysterical.

257
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Billy's like, "What's wrong? What's wrong?" And he can't even catch a breath.

258
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Joey can't even take a moment to say what happened.

259
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 He's just curled up in a ball on the couch screaming and crying and sobbing.

260
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 To Billy, it looks like he's almost going into some sort of catatonic state.

261
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Like he's going into shock.

262
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He just can't control his breathing. He's just freaking out.

263
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And Billy just wants to know what's happening because if he doesn't know what's happening, how's he going to help?

264
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Joey, curled up on his couch, reaches an arm out and extends his finger and begins pointing.

265
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Into the darkness.

266
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And Joey finally in between sobs is able to get out one word.

267
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 "Girl!"

268
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And Billy turns and looks and sees where Joey is pointing at.

269
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 His arm shaking as he tries to keep it steady, but his heaving body won't allow it.

270
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 He's pointing out into the darkness of the living room.

271
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Joey was pointing at where he saw the girl.

272
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 A girl who appeared out of the darkness.

273
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 A girl who stood there in front of his little brother.

274
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 A girl who waited until Billy left the room before she appeared.

275
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 When the parents get home, Billy tells them, "Hey, I just... I don't know how your guys' evening went, but here's what happened while you were gone."

276
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And at that point, the family made a decision, "It's time to leave. We're out of here. This is just too much."

277
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 But the issue is, they had signed the housing contract, a lease, right?

278
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 You can't get out of a lease by claiming the place is haunted.

279
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 However, they were able to say, "This has nothing to do with the ghosts! It has nothing to do with anything spooky!"

280
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Our ceiling is black. Our ceiling is black. No matter how many times we've tried painting over it, the black stuff returns.

281
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And we don't think it's healthy for our kids to be in a living room full of whatever is causing that blackness on our ceiling.

282
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 So they were able to break their lease. They were actually able to get out of that housing contract and move earlier than they were supposed to.

283
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 They had signed up for more months.

284
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 All in all, from beginning to end, they only lived there for six months. They were the only tenants there, and their stay only lasted six months.

285
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And as they were wrapping up the whole process of moving out and signing all the paperwork,

286
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Billy's parents kind of discreetly began asking questions about the apartment complex before the fire and how it all may have started.

287
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 You should have asked in the beginning, right? They're like, "It was a mysterious fire!" Nobody knows!

288
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 They should have asked all that stuff upfront, but it was probably a great deal.

289
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 They began asking a little bit about the fire and what had happened, and they were told that a little girl had died in the fire.

290
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And to the family, that made a lot of sense. That explained a lot.

291
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I mean, obviously the ghost girl in the living room, but also, you know, other people walking around.

292
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 You could hear there's people walking around in their apartment. When you'd play hide-and-go-seek, you would feel just lonely.

293
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Missed, but not "ha-ha! I've gone away with hiding the best."

294
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 You felt trapped. You felt solitude. Involuntary solitude.

295
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 They're in an average game of hide-and-go-seek.

296
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It's interesting because we see this a lot in paranormal investigations.

297
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I've personally experienced it on both sides.

298
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Joey completely forgot that this ever happened. He had no idea. He had no memory of the night he was curled up in a ball on the couch going,

299
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 "Girl, girl, he doesn't remember any of that."

300
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And no one reminded him, no one reminded him until he turned 18.

301
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Sounds like a great gift. What do you give the person who has everything? Trauma.

302
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 On his 18th birthday, I actually don't know if it was on the birthday. They're like, "Oh, here's your present. It's like a photo album. It's a photo album of ghost girls."

303
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Billy said after he turned 18, and not specifically on his 18th birthday, a ghost girl blows out the candles and goes, "Boom."

304
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Everyone else disappears.

305
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 He goes, "We told him about it. We told him about..." Well, we asked him, "Hey, remember that time we were in that old abandoned apartment complex?"

306
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I think he probably remembered that. He probably remembered that, but he was told about the time he was curled up into the ball,

307
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 shouting, "Girl," in between moans. And Joey's like, "I don't remember any of that. I don't remember any of that."

308
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Billy's like, "Yeah, and you peed your pants too, you big baby Joe." I was like, "No, I didn't. He's all making up extra details."

309
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Well, no, I feel like I'm kind of cutting off the legs of the story. He didn't do that, but Joey didn't remember it.

310
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I've done ghost investigations with people. I've been out with Josh, my buddy Josh, and something crazy would happen.

311
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And then years later, I was like, "Hey, dude, remember when we were down at that park and that spooky thing happened? You peed your pants, Josh? Remember when you peed your pants?"

312
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 He's like, "No." He wouldn't remember the ghost. He wouldn't remember the ghost thing. I've done that with a couple people.

313
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 I had a buddy named Chris, too, who had this really weird experience with a shadow man.

314
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And then years later, he's like, "Dude, what are you talking about?" I go, "Dude, there were 15 witnesses, man. You don't remember that?"

315
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 But then it was so weird because I'd be like, "Maybe you just can't handle the truth. Maybe that movie's real."

316
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And you can't handle the truth, and your brain actually has a circuit breaker built into it. I do believe that.

317
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And something so outside the norm happens and you experience it in that moment, but as time goes by, you just forget it.

318
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 It's not forgotten. It's blocked out. You block it out because it's so terrifying.

319
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Imagine if a six-year-old had to come to grips with the fact that the dead still walk the earth in spirit form.

320
00:35:47,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And he's being confronted with a child possibly close to his age, her spirit, her soul, trapped in the darkness of a burned-out apartment.

321
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Like for a six-year-old to really kind of comprehend that, it's terrifying to us if we saw it.

322
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 But to a six-year-old, he's closer to the age range. He's having to grapple with all sorts of stuff all of a sudden as this girl's walking out of the darkness towards him.

323
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 So it's a terrifying story BS. Thank you so much for sharing it with me.

324
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And there's a lot of stuff we can talk about, but the main thing that I want to talk about here as we wrap this episode up, it's super interesting to me.

325
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 We have an apartment. There's almost like a scientific experiment because we can have a lot of controls going on here.

326
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 We have an apartment complex that burned down and a little girl died in it.

327
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And as far as we know, nobody lived in it until this family. They were the first family back in.

328
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And what we had was an escalation of power. We had an escalation of abilities.

329
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 So first it was just a feeling of loneliness when you were alone.

330
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 More than you would normally feel when you were alone, right?

331
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 An uneasy sense of isolation.

332
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Then physical matter begins to move around.

333
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 You know, the trash that is known to be thrown away appears in other places.

334
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 The electronic devices are going on and off at, let's be honest, creepy moments, right?

335
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Ghosts aren't idiots. They used to be alive. They know it's creepy and what's not creepy.

336
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Middle of the day your television set turns on. You're like, "What? Did I sit on the remote? Is there short?"

337
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Middle of the night when you're sleeping your television turns on, it's creepier.

338
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 And it's like everything is being set up. Oh, and the footprints upstairs, right? The sound of the walking.

339
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Those are all pretty normal ghostly activity. Actually the trash coming in and out of the trash can,

340
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 you know, something that was thrown away, appears back in the house.

341
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 That's a fairly high power level already, but to then appear, and not just appear in the darkness,

342
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 but to wait until Joey was alone.

343
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Like actually cause the power, wait till the two boys are home alone, cause the power outage.

344
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 So Billy would leave and then take a form, become an image of a girl standing in the darkness in front of the youngest member of the family.

345
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 It was an escalation. It wasn't a moment where she's already there and people go, "Yeah, so we're late at night.

346
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 I swear that I can hear the sound of a little girl crying in the apartment next to us."

347
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And then when you're playing "How to Go Seek," you would hear like a giggle and you'd see like a sunflower dress kind of whip by at the end of the hallway as you're catching glimpses of her.

348
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 They didn't get that. It was almost like this ghost had to feed off of them and was slowly ramping things up.

349
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And what's interesting is, I think she's gathered enough energy that the next family that came into that apartment complex, which I'd love to know if it was still there.

350
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 The next family that moved into that apartment complex would be facing a ghost who while she may pull those same type of stunts,

351
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 she may still want to feed off of that fear energy and that energy of discontent.

352
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 She's fully formed. She would come in more powerful than she was before she fed off this family.

353
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 I don't think this is a good spirit. This story, there's something about this girl that seemed menacing.

354
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 There's something about this specter that seemed dangerous.

355
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 And whatever happened in this apartment complex after this family moved out, the ghost was more powerful when they left than it was before they arrived.

356
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 So it would make me wonder if this building is still there. If they were renting out apartments after a fire, I can't imagine it was like on the verge of collapse.

357
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 They may have just fixed it, you know, gave it a new paint job, tore out the carpets, put a new one, did a full renovation.

358
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Now it's a fully stocked apartment complex with people living in every apartment.

359
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 But one of those apartments may have an extra tenant, the ghost of a girl who died in a fire or a demon pretending to be such a victim.

360
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 I do think this entity was feeding off the uncertainty and the fear and the confusion of this family.

361
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 And I do think that the darker elements in the world can do that. I think they can do that quite easily.

362
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 So the next time you're feeling a little down, you're depressed, you don't like your job, you're a fireman caught on fire, you're in a hotel room.

363
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Next time you're feeling a little down, the next time you're feeling a little...solid, there could be something nearby, some unseen spirit gaining power from your emotions.

364
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 The next time you're confused, you're doing a Sudoku puzzle and you're like, "What? Why am I doing a Sudoku puzzle?" And you throw it to the ground.

365
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 There could be a spirit behind you drinking in all that delicious lush, that emotional energy made of pain and misery.

366
00:41:47,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 You're like, "Sudoku's not that bad, Chase. It doesn't make demons appear just because you hate math. It doesn't mean that a demon's like, "Oh, yes. I'm going to go work for The New York Times as their Sudoku editor."

367
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 The next time you're feeling a little out of sorts, confused, lonely, depressed, don't do those things.

368
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 I don't know where I'm going with this. Don't do those things, because you may be feeding a demonic spirit nearby.

369
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 And you're like, "That's it. I'm going to bed. I've had such a depressing and confusing day. I don't even know where my bed's at."

370
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 And you lay down in bed, you're just like, "Man, what a horrible day." And I had a horrible yesterday and I'll probably have a horrible tomorrow and you're just slowly going to sleep.

371
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 You can't even fall asleep fast. You're so depressed, you're serotonin. It's like, "No, we're going to hang out here for a while. Melatonin, you stay. You stay down there. You stay down there."

372
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 You're slowly falling asleep. You could be feeding the spirit of a little girl standing at the foot of your bed.

373
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 She's like, "Finally! Finally! I finally have enough energy to fully manifest." And then she does that. So basically the moral of the story is don't be depressed, I guess.

374
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 I don't know. I was thinking, I was thinking it was going to be super creepy. And then I was like, "How can you not be depressed?"

375
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Well, don't. Because when you're depressed, you may be feeding a dark spirit. I guess if it did take the form of a little girl at the end of your bed, you could be like, "Do chores and stuff. Young lady, if you're under my roof, you're going to fall in my rules."

376
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 She's like, "Oh, just don't have her take out the trash because she's really bad at that job."
