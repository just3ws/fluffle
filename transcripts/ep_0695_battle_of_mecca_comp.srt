1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
 When a group of friends have a car accident in the middle of nowhere, it seems like the worst is yet to come.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,060
 Until a little old lady showed up.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,980
 And then we talk a lot about Doomsday Colts on this show.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,900
 Armed offshoots of major religions that believe the world is going to end soon.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,220
 These Colts often just fizzle out, are dismantled, or are gunned down.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,380
 But today we're gonna take a look at one of those Colts that actually succeeded.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,280
 In leaving their mark on the world. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:45,940
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,180
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,420
 I hope you guys are having a lot of fun doing whatever you're doing. We got a really cool episode for you.

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,400
 So first off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,980
 It's Mokushi! Everyone give it up to Mokushi!

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,480
 Yay!

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,580
 I think that's the first time I've ever shouted out "Yay" during one of these introductions.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,980
 So there you go Mokushi. Mokushi, you're gonna be our captain or pilot of this episode.

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,320
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. I totally understand.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,480
 Just help spread the word about the show.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,760
 There's flyers on the show notes if you want to print them out.

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,860
 Pass them around town. Tell your friends. Tell your family. Talk about it online.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,640
 We also have a merch store. I always forget to mention that. So that's another way to support the show.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,620
 Mokushi, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna take a little road trip.

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,720
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to Karelia, Russia.

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 *Pfft*

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
 *Pfft*

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,120
 Mokushi's driving this beat-up old junker that we still drive around after what? 696 episodes?

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,360
 Out to Karelia, Russia. Specifically, we're headed to the Vusko Lakes in

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,800
 Karelia, Russia. It's summer

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,360
 1993 and it's nighttime. The stars are in the sky. The moon is looking down on earth.

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,360
 It's jealous because got a bunch of cool people living on it and

30
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:13,020
 there's a car full of tourists driving through the Vusko Lakes area. This car of tourists,

31
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,240
 we don't have the names of these people, so we'll say Benny is driving the car.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,080
 I don't know how many people are in the car. I don't need to give them all names and backstories.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 Anyways, Benny is driving the car. We got Veronica and the passenger.

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,480
 I just said I wasn't gonna do this and I did anyways. Benny's driving the car.

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,880
 I'll introduce the rest of the people if needed.

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,520
 *Drumming*

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,800
 Driving through the Vusko Lakes area. It's a magical place. Every time you pronounce it, it comes out differently.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,280
 No one has figured out why that happens. And there's a car accident.

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
 *Eeeek*

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,200
 So someone's like, "Great driving, Benny!" and Benny goes, "Oh,

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
 Charlie, the guy sitting behind me, the guy sitting behind me, Charlie, you're always criticizing my driving."

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,040
 Literally backseat driving. But then Veronica, who was in the passenger seat, is holding her head and she's like,

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,160
 "Oh, I don't feel so good. I banged my head against this thing in front of the car."

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,520
 The tree she flies out of the car, she hits the tree. One of the people in the car is injured.

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
 *Uhhh*

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,760
 And they have a concussion. They have a concussion. So Benny, Charlie, and then the other people in the car,

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,800
 they have to take care of Veronica. This is 1993. This was back when cell phones were fairly rare.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,320
 And I'm pretty sure in the Soviet Union, they were non-existent. Well, this point, it was still Russia,

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,360
 but they still didn't have the top-line technology. Vanessa, they're in the middle of nowhere. Her name changed due to the concussion.

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,600
 Now she's Vanessa. The point is, is that- *Laughs*

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,000
 Let's back every- The point is that a group of tourists

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,800
 got in a car accident and one of them got a concussion. Let's- let's- let's cut it down to its finest details.

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,040
 They see a little hut nearby. They see this little

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,960
 building off on the side of the road, and they're like, "Dude, we have to like go there."

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,080
 Like, we don't have a cell phone. This car is all busted up. Maybe someone's living in the hut.

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,800
 Maybe they have a cell phone. Isn't that something that people who live in fat houses tend to have?

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,720
 They take her to the hut and there's this old lady, and she opens the door. Old woman's kind of

58
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,040
 motioning them in, so they bring Vanessa in and they lay her down on the table, or maybe a bed.

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,640
 They're probably something more comfortable. They're knocking over the old lady's soup. Y'all get out of the way, hungry lady.

60
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,680
 We have this person to take care of. They lay Vanessa down and the old lady walks up, and she doesn't say anything to anyone.

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,160
 She's just like

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,160
 tending to their wounds. Other people have like bumps and scrapes and things like that, and Vanessa could walk on her own.

63
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,160
 She just had a concussion. It's not that bad, but she just- *Laughs*

64
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,040
 She's a bit of a drama queen. They made her carrier everywhere.

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,120
 And the old ladies tending to all of their wounds and stuff like that, and they'd be like, "Ah, Dasvedanya, lady."

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,160
 And she'd be like, "Nah, nah, nah, nah." She wouldn't want to talk to them. She's just like cleaning out their wounds,

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,000
 putting like goo, putting like old lady stuff on them.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 You know, I- *Laughs*

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,480
 I said that, I meant like stuff that like a witch doctor would make, not like old women's secret something.

70
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,280
 Anyways, she's taking care of their wounds, and then all the tourists, Benny and Charlie and Vanessa, are like,

71
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,800
 "Oh, we're super sleeping." The other unnamed people, they get sleepy too, and they all fall asleep.

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,280
 And the old ladies just standing over them as they're like, "Uhhh..."

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,600
 The next morning,

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,120
 Benny wakes up. He's the first to wake up. He's like, "What? Huh? What?"

75
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,600
 The last thing I remember is walking to some old lady's house in the middle of nowhere, but

76
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
 he's looking around.

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,320
 He's out in the open.

78
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,200
 He's laying out in the open. The fresh Russian grasses against his back tickles him.

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,840
 And he looks up and he sees this beautiful blue sky. Might have been overcast that day. That wasn't in the notes either.

80
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,640
 But he looks up and he sees a beautiful blue sky.

81
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,320
 And he notices he's not in the thatched house anymore.

82
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,320
 And he goes, "Dudes, wake up, guys. Wake up. You won't believe what happened." And everyone wakes up.

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
 They're not in the house.

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,320
 They're now in this...

85
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,240
 They're now all in the ruins of a

86
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,280
 granite stone walled house that had collapsed.

87
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,400
 And they're like, "Whoa." And then their wounds healed rapidly.

88
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,960
 He looked at them. They're like, "Ahh!" The scabs are disappearing. They fall off.

89
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,960
 So that...

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,800
 That's the story.

91
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,960
 That's the story that's not like some

92
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,440
 goofy story that your brother told you because he couldn't come up with anything scary that night.

93
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,640
 That's actually from the book The Soviet UFO Files written by Paul Stonehill.

94
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,240
 I got it from thinkaboutitdocs.com. One of my favorite websites.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,000
 The reason why I wanted to share the story with you guys is because this is one of the stories where you think

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,920
 what is the phenomenon going on here? Assuming the story's true. Assuming the story's true.

97
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,320
 Could be completely made up. Paul Stonehill could be a really bad older brother and he's like, "Oh, this story will really scare those kids."

98
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,760
 So keep those kids from driving through Russia and getting car accidents.

99
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,560
 It's funny. We're in episode like 696. I have mentioned the Fae

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,720
 maybe once or twice. They are not my favorite form of paranormal activity.

101
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,880
 I don't like those stories. I don't really...

102
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,520
 Sometimes I've covered stories about dwarfs dressed up as ninjas. I actually really like that one.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,800
 But like fairies in general? I'm not a huge fan of them. Little people floating around wings and stuff like that.

104
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,480
 The whole like fairy circle. I did another one as a long time ago. It was the one that was the city in the Philippines.

105
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,120
 That if you went there and you ate a piece of cheese, typical Fae stuff.

106
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,640
 It was actually from the conspiracy theory iceberg. But if you eat their food, their trap there. I've never really liked Fae lore.

107
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,520
 Because it's all the same, right? The idea...

108
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,800
 Some of you guys are like, "Jace, I have no idea what you're talking about."

109
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,760
 Fae lore is Fae-ry. It's basically the British version of that. And all the stories are the same.

110
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,000
 They kind of collide with alien abductions where you're going about your own business.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,760
 And due to no fault of your own, you're taking to an alien realm. In this case, some sort of Fae realm.

112
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,160
 And you're...

113
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,720
 If you eat any of their food, you're stuck there forever. That detail is not in accounts with gray aliens. But a lot of people

114
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,280
 consider Fae encounters similar enough to alien encounters that they think one may be the other.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,520
 Some people say that old-timey Fae encounters are actually based on

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,440
 middle ages people getting abducted by gray aliens. And how would you

117
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
 describe that?

118
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,880
 You'd say I went to some Fae realm because you have no other sense of context for that.

119
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,720
 Some people say, and this is less popular, because that kind of makes sense. If you believe aliens have been around for tens of thousands of years,

120
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,120
 they would have to pop up throughout human history.

121
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:58,120
 Other people say that, no, gray aliens are actually Fae-ries. That will never catch on. I don't believe that will ever catch on.

122
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,160
 Because it's just not intriguing enough. And yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the Fae, but when you read this story,

123
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,040
 I don't think of it as

124
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,240
 Fae-ry. I don't think of it as any sort of Fae-ry activity. Although it does fall into those things since I don't really like Fae-ry stuff.

125
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,520
 I think this falls into

126
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,160
 portals, time slips.

127
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,680
 Because the fact that they saw the huts and they went in there at night, and then it's not like they

128
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,680
 were ever tempted to stay in this special realm when they woke up,

129
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,840
 they were still in the same general area.

130
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,000
 But the house that they saw the night before was actually

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,080
 gone for ages. It was just this structure that had been up. Or

132
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,800
 there's even the thing that this is where I was thinking of. I think of it more like this.

133
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 Like the television show Twin Peaks, a lot of it is based on

134
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,760
 you'll be walking through a normal part of the world. You'll go, you'll stand on a rock and you'll get electrocuted.

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,120
 You'll be walking through the forest and the next thing you know, you're in some other dimension.

136
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,400
 This one guy's walking down an alley and he ends up in the white lodge and there's this eight foot tall duty.

137
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,800
 He tells him to go get a green rubber glove. It'll turn him into a superhero. The show's bizarre. The show is bizarre.

138
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,320
 I love it. I just watched it again all the way through for like the third time.

139
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,760
 But I'm thinking that. I think that the car crashed. That happened. They were all busted up.

140
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,640
 And what was really there, what they really would have should have seen, if they had just continued on their journey, would have been

141
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,160
 a granite stone structure. It looked like an old building that had started to collapse.

142
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,320
 But because they got in this accident, they kind of moved to a different mental state when they looked at it, they saw the hut.

143
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,240
 And that hut and that old lady were not of this

144
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,880
 not only not of this timeline, but not of this earth. The fact that the old lady wasn't even talking.

145
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,800
 Makes me think that the old lady knew.

146
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,360
 You know that if she started talking to me, dead giveaway. She'd have like 15 tongues in her mouth and her eyes are rolling back.

147
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,000
 So it's an interesting story. That's the way I read it. That this was some sort of interdimensional

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,920
 being and she appears as this old lady because that's who takes care of you, right? If you had to imagine

149
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,160
 a caretaker. Yeah, you could be a flaming angel with 10 wings and he's like, "Let me clean your wounds."

150
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,560
 But it's most likely going to be a grandmother, a maternal figure.

151
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,840
 And that's how the universe portrayed this. Could be Faye. And if it was Faye, I apologize for wasting your time.

152
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,520
 Because I don't like covering the Faye. I actually know you guys enjoy the Faye. It's just not my cup of tea. But

153
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:43,000
 could be Faye, could be a time slip. She could have been an old lady in ancient Russia and one day she tells her neighbors, "Guys, you won't believe what happened."

154
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:50,280
 These people showed up in the oddest of clothing and I just treated them and then I gave them a bit of sleeping drugs and then I dragged them out of my house

155
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,360
 and I don't know what happened to them. They were gone the next day.

156
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,160
 Or it could be this interdimensional

157
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,600
 healer event. We don't know. It's in the UFO files. I don't think it really has anything to do with aliens.

158
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,920
 But who knows? I just think it's an interesting story and it's one of the stories that because it doesn't precisely fit the lore of any real one category,

159
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,240
 it's truly a puzzling story.

160
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,920
 Mokushi, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are saying goodbye to Karelia, Russia.

161
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,960
 We're there like, "We still need help working on our car. We're like, see you guys later. We're flying away from these people."

162
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
 They're still stranded out there to this day.

163
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,200
 Mokushi fly us on out to

164
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,760
 Saudi Arabia.

165
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:40,040
 I was shocked when I found out that this story happened. I've mentioned it recently on this show. There's a website called crazy facts

166
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,880
 that I go to every day and you just hit a button and gives a random fact.

167
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,680
 It gives you a little dopamine hit when you learn something new. Plus, I found a lot of cool stuff from there.

168
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,080
 I was shocked this story was real. This sounds like it should have already been like

169
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,640
 at least a couple movies.

170
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,960
 We're in Saudi Arabia

171
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,880
 specifically

172
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,200
 at the great mosque of Mecca.

173
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:08,040
 It is the home of the Kaaba. It is the direction that Muslims worldwide pray to.

174
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,200
 Once in their lifetime, a Muslim must make their pilgrimage to Mecca.

175
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,320
 This is

176
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,400
 it's hard to

177
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,480
 overstate its importance

178
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,560
 in world religious history, especially in the Muslim religion. On November 20th 1979,

179
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,760
 it's just a day like any other.

180
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,200
 The prayer services start at 5 a.m. There's 50,000 worshipers

181
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,160
 at the great mosque of Mecca.

182
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 As people are sitting here praying,

183
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,840
 they start to hear commotion to their left to their right.

184
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,760
 Often the distance in the crowd, they see people jumping up.

185
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,720
 They see movement in the crowd.

186
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,560
 The prayer has been interrupted as

187
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,200
 four to six hundred people are jumping up during the prayer.

188
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,440
 Men and women alike throwing off their robes

189
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,240
 and brandishing automatic weapons

190
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,440
 panic immediately sets in. You have a crowd of 50,000 people packed into this area

191
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,440
 and all of a sudden orders are being shouted. You're standing there and you see someone with a weapon

192
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,200
 at the great mosque of Mecca where violence is forbidden.

193
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,120
 He points it at a local police officer and shoots him dead.

194
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,520
 There were police officers at the great mosque of Mecca, but because violence was forbidden

195
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,440
 they only carried Billy, they only had these little billy clubs, right?

196
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,240
 They could kind of push people out. You're getting unruly. They could get you out of there.

197
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,120
 They weren't armed with weapons.

198
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,280
 And all of a sudden you had four to six hundred people.

199
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,160
 They were never able to figure out exactly how many people had infiltrated the great mosque of Mecca that day.

200
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,120
 Orders are being shouted. Everyone's freaking out. Two police officers end up getting shot.

201
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,640
 People are pulling out chains. They were fully prepared

202
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,920
 to take over the mosque. They begin to chain the exits shut.

203
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,320
 And you're stuck there. At the time the great mosque was being renovated. There was a worker up there

204
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,800
 and he sees all of the stuff that's going on. He's able to get to a phone, starts calling for help,

205
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,040
 letting people know what's going on. That is when the phone lines are cut.

206
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:33,080
 This group releases most of the 50,000 hostages because you really just can't keep control of that many people.

207
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,760
 But a couple hundred are kept behind.

208
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,120
 As thousands and thousands of hostages are running out of the area,

209
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,600
 this group is putting snipers and the minarets that surround the great mosque of Mecca.

210
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,120
 They now have complete control of the area. But who are they?

211
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,760
 They are followers of a man known as Muhammad Abdullah al-Qatani.

212
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:07,560
 He was believed by his followers to be the Ma'adi or the Redeemer. He's basically a figure in

213
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,360
 apocalyptic Muslim belief. He was a man who was going to come to earth before the final days,

214
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,560
 before Jesus comes back and begins to destroy the evil of the world. The Ma'adi would come and

215
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,320
 be the Redeemer before this process. Every religion is going to have people pop up and claim to be

216
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,760
 important figures. And there's a whole list of people over the centuries who have claimed to be the Ma'adi,

217
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,440
 who've claimed to be this figure in the end times.

218
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:45,240
 But the reason why Muhammad Abdullah al-Qatani was able to convince 400 to 600 people,

219
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,560
 because again they don't know for sure how many people moved into this area,

220
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:58,040
 of this was he was popping up in Saudi Arabia at a time of change, at a time of social change.

221
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:05,240
 And this seems to be the best time for any sort of hardliner to make their case.

222
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,800
 Saudi Arabia was becoming very westernized at this point.

223
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:16,360
 And for the people of Saudi Arabia, they go, "This is not right. This isn't right.

224
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,320
 There's, I'm opening up the newspaper. There's pictures of women in the newspaper.

225
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,840
 This is borderline pornographic." And the power step B in Saudi Arabia goes,

226
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,520
 "No, this is the way the world is going. Like, yeah, I know we have those old ways, but listen,

227
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,680
 this is progressive, right? I don't think that was the actual word they used, but

228
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,960
 it's okay. We're going to become a more open society. We're going to become more free.

229
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,040
 We're going to become more liberated." And then Sidwell, with followers of Muhammad

230
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,840
 Abdullah Akhtani, and his followers were growing every single day. When you have social change,

231
00:17:50,840 --> 00:18:00,200
 you will have detractors of that. This was this group's goals. They wanted to kick out all the

232
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,840
 western powers of Saudi Arabia. That was bin Laden's goal as well. That was one of his main things.

233
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,640
 To this day, there are a lot of people in Saudi Arabia who do not like the fact that there are

234
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,720
 westerners, that there is US military equipment right outside of the great mosque of Mecca. It is

235
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,280
 a sticking point for a lot of people in Saudi Arabia. So they wanted to kick out all the western

236
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,080
 powers. They wanted to kick out all non-Muslims. You have to be a Muslim to visit the great mosque

237
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,800
 of Mecca, but they wanted to get rid of all non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia altogether, and no

238
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,680
 television, because they saw that as a leading factor in the degradation of Saudi Arabia. Muhammad

239
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,160
 Abdul Akhtani had support where it counted. He didn't control the government. He didn't control the

240
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:49,560
 media, but he had a lot of allies in the National Guard. When his plan was being talked about in

241
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,160
 mosques, his plan was openly preached in the streets. People knew that there were elements

242
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,360
 out there who did not like the way Saudi Arabia was opening up. It was touching these people's

243
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,400
 hearts, and they began funneling weapons into the mosque. This was something that was planned for,

244
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,920
 and people would learn that because of how hard it was to remove these men and women from the

245
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:23,800
 great mosque of Mecca. After that phone call was made, thousands of people are running out of the

246
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:31,080
 great mosque. A hundred security officers are sentenced to retake it. They don't know really

247
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,360
 what's going on. They got a phone call saying that people with guns are taking over the mosque.

248
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,960
 They see thousands of people running out. They have no idea about the snipers and the minarets.

249
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,800
 They learn that very quickly. As these hundreds of security officers are running into the mosque,

250
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,200
 sniper fire is just taking them out. And the people in the mosque who are heavily armed begin

251
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,680
 shooting out of the mosque, and it is a bloodbath. These security officers have to pull back.

252
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:04,520
 Their losses are too heavy. So a meeting is called now. You get members of the Saudi Arabia army.

253
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,560
 You got members of the National Guard, which they don't know that members of the National Guard are

254
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,200
 in on this, not all of them, but some of them are. This meeting had the Saudi Arabian army

255
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,120
 officials, the National Guard, and there was a French special operations team in the area.

256
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:27,240
 They just happened to be there. And they begin talking about this and trying to figure out how to

257
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:34,920
 retake the mosque. Because you just can't have a bunch of people with weapons take over the holiest

258
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:43,880
 site in the Muslim world. They begin coming up with a plan. Step one, by that first night,

259
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:51,560
 the entire city of Mecca, there's a city that surrounds this mosque, the entire city is evacuated.

260
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:59,480
 It's a ghost town. Saudi Arabian army comes in National Guard, the French special ops team is

261
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,840
 there. They now don't have to worry about civilian casualties. They don't know what they're going

262
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,760
 to do, but they wanted to clear this out. They have no idea what's coming next or what this

263
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,920
 group's goals are. They haven't communicated this yet. Now it is religious law. You cannot commit

264
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,120
 violence in the grand mosque. Now, obviously, these people in here are not playing by that rule.

265
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,040
 They had no problem with slaughtering these soldiers. They had no problem killing these police

266
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,680
 officers. They have no problem holding these hostages. But according to the religious laws,

267
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:37,880
 you can't even uproot a plant in the great mosque. So the government reaches out to the Ullama,

268
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,520
 which are the interpreters of religious law. There's this long discussion of finally the

269
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,840
 religious leaders come forward and they say, in this instance, yes, you can use deadly force.

270
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,720
 So this is the plan now. Now that they've got their clearance, the Saudi forces are going to have a

271
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,160
 three pronged attack towards the great mosque. There's three main gates. It makes sense. They're

272
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:05,160
 just going to push through overwhelming might. They rush in, they're better equipped, they have

273
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:12,360
 numerical opposition. It doesn't matter. It is another bloodbath. These snipers are wiping them

274
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:19,080
 out. You can't get in with raw military might outside of bombing the area, which was nothing

275
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,200
 they had planned on doing. So now they've had two full assaults towards the mosque, completely repelled.

276
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,920
 So they pull back. I can't believe this story is not more widely known. Am I the only one who's

277
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:39,480
 never heard of this? I mean, I was alive during, I mean, I was three, but this is insane. Because

278
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,040
 what happens next is the government of Saudi Arabia says, listen, we've sent in two waves of forces

279
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:52,840
 to try to retake it. They're picking us off. We need this back. But let's just starve them out.

280
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,480
 We're just going to surround the place. We're going to lay siege to the great mosque of Mecca.

281
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:08,760
 Eventually they'll just give up. They won't have any food. For two weeks, the army surrounded the mosque.

282
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:19,960
 For two weeks, nothing changed. No one gave up. No one begged for food.

283
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,080
 No one came out hoping for forgiveness. The hostage takers were resolute.

284
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:36,120
 Remove all Western powers. Kick out all non-Muslims. Remove television. We need to return to the old ways.

285
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,840
 At this point, it's become incredibly embarrassing for the government of Saudi Arabia.

286
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:50,440
 You have the Saudi king Khaled. He's watching this whole thing and he's seen the holiest site

287
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,320
 has been taken over on his watch. He can't break the back of these hostage takers.

288
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:07,400
 What is he going to do? Two weeks is too long. He orders a final assault. We have to go in.

289
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:15,080
 Casualties be damned. The Saudi Arabian government calls the special forces, the French special forces,

290
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,120
 and say, we want, we know you guys, this is what you do for a living. This is what you literally do

291
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:27,080
 for a living. You break into places and take them over. We want you to join us on this raid. However,

292
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,840
 you can't enter the great mosque of Mecca unless you're a Muslim.

293
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,760
 So will you convert to Islam and fight alongside us?

294
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,560
 The French commanders go, yeah, let's do it. So they had this short ceremony.

295
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,280
 They converted to Islam. They geared up along with their Saudi Arabian army compatriots

296
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,480
 and they headed off towards Mecca. The grand mosque of Mecca apparently has tunnels underneath it,

297
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,320
 which would kind of be a no-brainer if you're going to infiltrate an area. It seems the reason why

298
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,520
 they weren't using these tunnels in the first place was because you couldn't, originally they were

299
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,840
 just trying to send a bunch of people in. They were trying to invade it like you were, like you

300
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,800
 would any fort. So you just send in a mass amount of people, you'd overwhelm them with numbers.

301
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,280
 Hopefully you could just overpower them and save hostages. When they start using these tunnels,

302
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:31,400
 they know that the combat is going to be very close quarters and extremely high casualties

303
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,680
 for even the hostages. Because when they're getting in these tunnels that take them

304
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:43,560
 underneath the mosque, the special forces and the Saudi Arabian army get into their positions.

305
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,720
 And the first thing they do, they begin to pump gas into the tunnels. They begin to pump knockout

306
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,600
 gas into the tunnels. So that way anyone who is posted in the tunnels, because most likely the

307
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,880
 hostage takers know about them, they're going to get knocked out. The special forces move through

308
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,560
 these smoked filled tunnels. They get underneath the mosque itself and they begin drilling holes

309
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:17,960
 through the floor and then throwing grenades up into the mosque. Grenade after grenade after

310
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,600
 grenade is popping up through these holes. Nobody knew what was going on in the mosque.

311
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:31,320
 And this is why this was not the best plan. You had insurgents and hostages who had been

312
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,520
 kept away from their loved ones for two weeks sitting there and a grenade would roll towards them.

313
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:45,000
 And explode. Grenades just being lobbed blindly into the mosque. The rebels start to try to regroup.

314
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,800
 They don't, they didn't expect this. You know that there's tunnels underground, but you don't

315
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,000
 expect grenades to come out of them. They try to regroup. At this point, they're trying to get out

316
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,080
 of the mosque. And as they're running through the courtyard, they are now being shot on site.

317
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,600
 During this chaos, snipers begin to panic. They begin missing their shots. They begin to try to

318
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:15,640
 retreat. They are also killed. Most die of the scene. Some are captured and a few escape into

319
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:25,000
 the empty city of Mecca. Still abandoned for days. Small gun battles erupted across the city.

320
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,600
 As military forces were tracking down these dudes, killing them on the spot.

321
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,680
 These numbers are debatable, but the generally accepted numbers. Some people say these are too

322
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:44,760
 small, but general accepted number is on all sides. Military, insurgent and civilian. 300 people

323
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,080
 were killed over the course of this event and a thousand people wounded.

324
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,240
 But there are people who believe the number is much higher because they don't even know how many

325
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,520
 people had come into the mosque. They said four to six hundred. They don't have an accurate count.

326
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,000
 68 of these insurgents who were captured were actually taken to different cities

327
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:15,800
 across the country and publicly beheaded. King Khaled wanted to make it known that this is what

328
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:23,480
 happens if you follow the path of extremism. He could have executed them all in a single location,

329
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,080
 but no, he wanted to make it known across the country. He had these 68 people taken to all

330
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,760
 these different cities and they were publicly beheaded. But how this story ends is actually the

331
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:44,840
 most fascinating part of the story because I'm telling you this story about women appearing in

332
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,360
 newspapers and Saudi Arabia becoming more westernized and more progressive and you're listening to it.

333
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,680
 Like I was reading it and I thought, but wait a second, that's not Saudi Arabia today.

334
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:05,160
 Saudi Arabia is, I just read in the news today, Saudi Arabia executed a kid. He took part in an

335
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,720
 Arab Spring protest when he was 17 years old and they arrested him when he was 23 and they cut

336
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,360
 his head off about two days ago. They said they found a photo on his phone that was obscene

337
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,160
 and he did the whole Arab Spring thing when he was 17, which was years ago.

338
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,400
 They chopped his head off yesterday and you're looking at this stuff and you're like, wait a

339
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,280
 second, Saudi Arabia, I mean, it's probably a fun place to visit, right? But I wouldn't say it's

340
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:41,240
 westernized. I wouldn't say that it has like these, I know WWE had a hard time wrestling over there.

341
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,880
 There's like no women wrestlers, but this whole kind of thing started because people were seeing

342
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,160
 that Saudi Arabia was becoming too westernized, too liberal. It's not those things at all. Those

343
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,240
 definitely those words I would not use to describe the government of Saudi Arabia.

344
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:04,920
 This event actually worked. King Khaled watched this happen. Had these people execute and go,

345
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,360
 this is what happens if you believe in extremism, but then he thought, I don't want that to happen again.

346
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:17,080
 Like if that's, I got these people on this side who are saying we need to be more equal and we need

347
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,480
 to be open and we need to be more tolerant. And then I have the people on this side who are willing

348
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,280
 to take over the great mosque of Mecca at gunpoint. These people are telling me, you know,

349
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,200
 I might win the peace prize and these people might overthrow me. You had members of his

350
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:42,520
 cabinet of his court saying, King Khaled, we brought this upon ourselves. This was divine

351
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:49,800
 retribution because we fell too far. We were publishing pictures of women in the newspaper

352
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:57,240
 like what's next? Like are we really becoming a decadent society like these guys were saying?

353
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,640
 So King Khaled actually looked at this and said, maybe they're right.

354
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:11,880
 Let me read you a quote from a book called Inside the Kingdom, Kings, Clerics, Modernist,

355
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,280
 Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia, written by Robert Lacey.

356
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:23,160
 "Those old men believed that the mosque disaster was God's punishment to us because we were

357
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,760
 publishing women's photographs in the newspapers," says a princess, one of Khaled's nieces.

358
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,400
 The worrying thing is that the king probably believed that as well.

359
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,880
 Khaled had come to agree with the sheiks. Foreign influences were the problem.

360
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,360
 The solution to religious upheaval was simple. More religion, unquote.

361
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,080
 One of the things that grew out of this ruling was the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and

362
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:02,200
 the Prevention of Vice, which was basically a religious policing force. They would drive around,

363
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,560
 they would famously make sure that women were wearing the proper dress code that

364
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,680
 there is gender segregation in public spaces. Most controversially, one of the things they

365
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:20,040
 did, this sounds insane, on March 11, 2002, there was a burning school in the city of Mecca.

366
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,440
 This elementary school is on fire, and these schoolgirls were trying to run out of the burning

367
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:31,240
 school. The religious police wouldn't let them. There has to be more, there has to be more to

368
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,840
 the story, but apparently they wouldn't let them because they weren't dressed in the headscarves

369
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,000
 and the black robes, and they didn't have a male guardian with them. They couldn't do this,

370
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,800
 so they weren't letting them escape from a burning school.

371
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:53,000
 That's insane. 15 girls died and 50 were injured in this fire. There's actually widespread outrage

372
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,720
 over this, and they're like, "Oh, they're just doing their jobs. They're not supposed to be outside

373
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,120
 with headscarves." The school is on fire, so these groups like this were empowered by the

374
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,840
 mosque seizure. There's a difference between saying, "Let's slow down social change," and another thing

375
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:10,120
 by not letting girls escape a burning school unless they go back to get their headscarf,

376
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,920
 which is probably on fire itself. So it went from a society that was becoming more open,

377
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,400
 which there were people inside the array who didn't like that, to becoming something that was

378
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:31,800
 almost a parody of conservative beliefs. That's just absurd. Fascinating story.

379
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:39,240
 I think there's a thing when we look at history, we always see it as a march in one direction,

380
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:46,600
 but it never ever is. Nick Buston Guston asked me, he's a Patreon supporter, if you don't know

381
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,320
 who that guy is. Nick Buston Guston asked me a question for my third anniversary special. I

382
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:59,080
 didn't get to cover it on the show, but what's a conspiracy theory that's unpopular that you believe?

383
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,440
 And I say this all the time, and people always argue with me on it,

384
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,240
 but I say this all the time. I go, "We are, maybe two weeks to a month,

385
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:18,120
 away from at best a crackdown at worst a genocide at any given time."

386
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:25,080
 I believe that at any moment in human history, something so bad can happen, a meteorite strike,

387
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:34,760
 a massive plague, huge economic downturn, and people will immediately look for someone to blame.

388
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,400
 And they will beg their leaders to do something about it.

389
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:45,480
 Now a lot of people don't agree with me on that. A lot of people have a little more

390
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,240
 hope in the human race, or faith in themselves that they would try to stop that. People were

391
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,800
 pulling their neighbors out of their house and beating them with clubs. But I do think we're

392
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,840
 that close. I'm an optimist too. That's why I'm giving it two weeks to a month. And I think stories

393
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:08,280
 like this go to show that. It's just crazy to think that this event changed the course of an

394
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:15,800
 entire nation. At the end of the day, people are fearful, and people hate how much they're afraid.

395
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,280
 I think this story just highlights how fragile the social contract is between people and their

396
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,400
 government, and people and their religion, any religion. This can happen with any religion out

397
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:36,680
 there. When people are afraid, people demand answers. They demand help. Even if that comes at the

398
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:45,400
 expense of other people's freedoms. We have seen it throughout human history. And if you think for

399
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:53,000
 a moment that we as a species are past that sort of primal fear, you really haven't been paying attention.

400
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,120
 And it could pop up again. It will pop up again. The question is, what will you do

401
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,360
 when they come for your neighbors?
