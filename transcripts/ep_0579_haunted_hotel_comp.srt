1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
 A maid in Singapore teaches us to never, ever eat food prepared by a maid.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,680
 And then we take a look at a haunted hotel where the ghost of a woman and her child continue

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,560
 to haunt it to this day.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,540
 But this isn't just any ghost story.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,340
 This ghost causes NBA teams to lose.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,340
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:33,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,420
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, a little old ton.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,920
 So let's go ahead and get started here by giving a shout out to our newest feature on

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,640
 supporter, James Magrum.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,300
 James everyone give a round of applause for James.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,300
 He's doing the snake.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,600
 Yesterday the guy did the worm.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
 This guy's doing the snake.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,560
 It's kind of the same thing, except I don't know, snake ear.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,560
 James you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,060
 If you have to work with a patreon, I totally understand.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,760
 Just help spread the word about the show.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,800
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,160
 We help James up off the ground.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 We dust him off.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,720
 We realize he's reptilian now.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,420
 We realize he's part of the conspiracy.

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,420
 But that's okay.

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,880
 We're still going to give him the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,380
 We're going to fly on out to Singapore.

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,300
 Durgible is flying over the Pacific Ocean, I believe.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,140
 We're headed out to Sengkeng in Singapore.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,540
 It's December 2018.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,020
 Durgible lands in Sengkeng.

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,820
 We're all walking around wearing clothes from 2018.

34
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,540
 Probably still own those clothes.

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,540
 We're probably currently wearing clothes.

36
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,660
 We wore in 2018.

37
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,160
 We see a house in Sengkeng.

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,500
 We see a family inside doing family stuff, playing with Parcheese or whatever.

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,300
 Then we see a maid walk in.

40
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,100
 She leaves the door open so we sneak in.

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,100
 We sneak in behind the maid.

42
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,100
 We're going to...

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,580
 And then when we're done sneaking, we're just standing in our living room.

44
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,580
 How'd you get in here?

45
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,580
 We're like shh.

46
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,020
 The family's like, "Okay, that's a little creepy."

47
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,020
 But that's nothing.

48
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,700
 A bunch of people appearing in your living room is far less bizarre than what's about

49
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,460
 to happen.

50
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,460
 Everything's alleged.

51
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,580
 We'll start off by saying that.

52
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,640
 Nare's Rowan Ola.

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,760
 She's a 43-year-old maid.

54
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,720
 But oddly enough, she's not this family's maid.

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,120
 So even though we snuck in after the maid, she doesn't even know this family.

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,000
 As far as we can tell, the police have not said that she knows this family and in any

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 way, shape, or form.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 She's just a random maid.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,360
 She's the Uber of Maids.

60
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
 But you don't have to call her.

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,880
 She just doesn't fit your house.

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
 Starts doing maid stuff.

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,440
 She prepares food for this family and...

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
 Mmm.

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
 My goodness.

66
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,480
 Bizarre maid that I didn't hire.

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,380
 Nom, nom, nom.

68
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,740
 This isn't suspicious at all.

69
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,460
 And this food is the bomb.

70
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,460
 And they're eating it.

71
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,500
 And she goes, "Yeah, you can almost say it's bloody good."

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,740
 If you were British, they were like, "Well, we're not British.

73
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
 We're in Singapore.

74
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
 So we're not going to say that."

75
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,620
 And she's like, "Yeah, but imagine you're in Britain.

76
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,500
 Wouldn't you say the food is bloody good?"

77
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 And they're like, "I guess.

78
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,540
 I mean, now that you're saying it, I do notice that this is a little pinker than normal, whatever

79
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,860
 this dish that I'm eating is."

80
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,860
 I'm super delicious.

81
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,540
 And she's like, "Yes, yes.

82
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,540
 You could say...

83
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,680
 They're like, "Quit making buns.

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,080
 Quit making buns."

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,880
 She's like, "Okay, but I'll just say this.

86
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,320
 If you continue to eat that, well, then..."

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,560
 She's trying to figure out how to grammatically make this correct.

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,200
 They're eating this, this bloody good food.

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,760
 And she goes, "You know, if you continue to eat that, I'll say that you're in trouble."

90
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
 And they're like, "What?

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,600
 That doesn't even make sense."

92
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,440
 But, but now they're starting to put two and two together.

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,600
 I don't think she made puns.

94
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,020
 I don't think the maids did there and made puns the whole time.

95
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,420
 She's not the riddler.

96
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,140
 But what happened in real life?

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,580
 She made this food for this family that she doesn't work for.

98
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,580
 Maybe it was their neighbor.

99
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,420
 Maybe it was her neighbor or something like that.

100
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,340
 She made this food and in the food she put in her own urine, which she kind of got from

101
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,340
 that joke, and then her own blood.

102
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
 But not...

103
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,740
 Listen, this might sound sexist, which is a horrible way to start a sentence that you're

104
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
 about to say next.

105
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,060
 This might sound sexist.

106
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,120
 I get that it's the same, but with a slight difference.

107
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,520
 She put blood in the food, but not just any blood.

108
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,000
 She put in menstrual blood.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
 Which I get it, blood's blood.

110
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,600
 But knowing there's like an egg in there, right?

111
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 There's...

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,400
 My knowledge of human biology is non-existent.

113
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,280
 But when a woman menstruates, there's a little egg, isn't there like a little microscopic

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 egg?

115
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,440
 Because it's like all of the...

116
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
 Basically, when you...

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,060
 The fact that it comes out from your vagina, that doesn't bug me.

118
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
 That's not...

119
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,820
 I mean, it could come out of there, it could come out of your foot, blood's blood.

120
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,700
 But I'm pretty sure there's an egg in it.

121
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,220
 There's also, I imagine, like fibers as well.

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,620
 Although I'll say this, if someone had...

123
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,460
 If I had to eat two bowls of something...

124
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,940
 This video's not getting monetized.

125
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,260
 If I had to eat two bowls of something and one of them contained arm blood, and one of

126
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,260
 them contained menstrual blood, and I had to choose one, I wouldn't...

127
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,020
 I would not choose the menstrual blood one.

128
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
 I don't know.

129
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
 Is that wrong?

130
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,400
 Is that my sexist?

131
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,700
 For not wanting to eat menstrual blood?

132
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,920
 Haven't mixed it with my food?

133
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,000
 So she's under arrest for this.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,420
 She's under arrest, and again, this is all alleged for putting urine and menstrual blood

135
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,700
 into their food.

136
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
 What's bizarre?

137
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,300
 I mean, that's bizarre in and of itself.

138
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,100
 That happened in 2018, and she's currently like under trial, in January of this year,

139
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
 in 2020.

140
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,380
 Another maid.

141
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,420
 In another part of Singapore.

142
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,940
 Did the exact same thing.

143
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,900
 However, she, her name's Diana, she put it in the family that she worked for, which makes

144
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
 more sense.

145
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,060
 She put in her menstrual blood again and her urine and spit.

146
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,820
 As if that was the missing ingredient.

147
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,060
 She's like, "Aha!

148
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,020
 Memento blood and urine, that's what that other maid did, and she got caught.

149
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,700
 However, I will spit in it as well.

150
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,420
 I will leave that telltale, slimy little loogie floating around."

151
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,140
 She did this in their water and rice, which would be soup.

152
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
 I don't know if these people ate it.

153
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,620
 I actually, let me scroll down on my notes.

154
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,620
 They ate it.

155
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,660
 That sentence was literally blocked at the bottom.

156
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,900
 They did eat their food.

157
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,420
 How did you not notice the rice and the water was pink?

158
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
 Who knows.

159
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,300
 But anyway, so apparently you have two people in Singapore, that makes it an epidemic.

160
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,220
 That makes it an epidemic at this point.

161
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,060
 Two different maids in Singapore are peeing and spitting, only one of them spit, and putting

162
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,540
 menstrual blood in your food.

163
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,660
 So now that's my new stereotype.

164
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,380
 Someone's like, "Hey, my maid prepared- I'm not going over to people's houses."

165
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,460
 And they're like these super mansions and they got maids.

166
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,060
 But if anyone ever says, "Oh, my maid prepared this," I'm immediately going to overturn the

167
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,180
 table and say, "How dare you?

168
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,940
 You want me to eat menstrual blood?"

169
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,980
 And I walk out.

170
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,220
 Everyone's super shocked, but I saved them from eating a little bit of their maid.

171
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,140
 Moral of the story, flip over tables in rich people's houses.

172
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,940
 James, let's go ahead and fire up that.

173
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,460
 We're going to rabbit dune buggy, because we're going to leave behind Singapore and

174
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:12,940
 we are headed out to do a little quick follow up story in the middle of the desert.

175
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,460
 Dune buggy's driving through the continent of all of wherever we were at Singapore.

176
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,940
 I actually think it's an island, right?

177
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
 But it doesn't matter.

178
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,860
 We eventually get to New Mexico.

179
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,140
 This is a story we have talked about so many times on this show, and I got to give a big

180
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,340
 shout out to Misty Van.

181
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,380
 I always mispronounce her last name.

182
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,860
 I pronounce her right once.

183
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,500
 Misty Van Appledorn.

184
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 No, Misty Van Appledorn.

185
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 I believe it is.

186
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 I'll find out.

187
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,220
 She always emails me when I get it wrong.

188
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,260
 She broke this story.

189
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,500
 This is something that I'd been looking at off and on over about a year and a half.

190
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,420
 She sent me a crucial piece of information, so Misty, you're a total rock star.

191
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,740
 You guys remember the Sunspot Solar Observatory story?

192
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,980
 We covered it back when it was happening.

193
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,460
 Quick overview, back on September 6, 2018, this observatory got shut down.

194
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
 There was Black Hawk helicopters.

195
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,020
 There were FBI agents there.

196
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,700
 Ton of conspiracy theories about it.

197
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,580
 People said that it saw asteroid that was about to destroy the planet.

198
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,600
 Remember when that happened, all life on the planet was destroyed.

199
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,860
 Some people said it spotted an alien spaceship that was about to show up and start taking

200
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
 over the planet.

201
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,380
 Remember when that happened, all the aliens that go over it?

202
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,100
 It's so funny because all these conspiracies, at the time, that week, people were like,

203
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,300
 "Oh my God, this is totally going to happen.

204
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,100
 All these observatories have been shut down around the world.

205
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
 They were scheduled maintenance.

206
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,180
 You had a bunch of observatories that were still there."

207
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,460
 You guys remember that panic, though?

208
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,820
 I always want to remind you guys of that.

209
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,340
 Because going forward, when we look at these new panic events, remember the stuff that didn't

210
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,580
 pan out, like Sunspot Solar Observatory?

211
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,500
 The world was supposed to end all this past that was going to happen.

212
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,260
 And then you had more reasonable things like Chinese infiltration of the facility.

213
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,580
 The story ended up being, and I remember being very, very suspicious of it at the time.

214
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,340
 I've talked about this over the past year and a half when this happened.

215
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:03,860
 Was that a janitor was caught downloading child sexual abuse material, child porn?

216
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,780
 And that's why the FBI was there.

217
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,460
 The observatory was shut down because of that investigation.

218
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,940
 And a lot of people kind of, "No, no, there's meteorite coming.

219
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,100
 We're going to be killed any day now."

220
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,740
 And obviously that didn't happen.

221
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,340
 And then the observatory opened back up.

222
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
 That was the story.

223
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,780
 And I've said this several times on the show.

224
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,220
 I was very suspicious of that story because it's a criminal case.

225
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,780
 How do we not know the name of the person who was arrested?

226
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
 I said that as recently.

227
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,140
 It might have been, it was a live stream.

228
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,620
 It wasn't the Thanksgiving one, but one before that, that I'll do Patreon exclusive live streams.

229
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,460
 But I might have even mentioned an episode recently as well where I'm saying, "How come

230
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,340
 we don't know the name of this guy?"

231
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,380
 If this is real, if that's the real story, how come we don't know the name of this guy?

232
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,980
 So Misty, the rock star, found his name.

233
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,860
 Joshua Lee Cope.

234
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,420
 32-year-old man.

235
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,300
 Court documents totally explaining it.

236
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,380
 I think this case is closed.

237
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,020
 I think this case is totally closed.

238
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,300
 The court documents have been filed.

239
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,740
 This guy, Joshua Lee Cope, he's being charged with one count of distribution and two counts

240
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,940
 of possession of child sexual abuse material of under the age of 13.

241
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,140
 He was actually indicted back on July 2nd, 2020.

242
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,740
 So it took a while for them to get everything put together.

243
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,220
 Oh, and I should say this, he's walking free right now.

244
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,780
 He's on bond.

245
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,780
 So if you live in the New Mexico area, this dude's probably jogging next to you.

246
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,300
 And he's not going to start trial until January 2021 at the earliest.

247
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,620
 So we have a name now.

248
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,700
 The reason why they shut it down was his laptop had gone missing.

249
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,580
 And obviously he was freaking out.

250
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,140
 He was taking his laptop to work.

251
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,140
 He was a janitor there and downloading the stuff from their internet.

252
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,620
 And then his laptop went missing and he started freaking out and he started telling the other

253
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,500
 employees that he thinks a serial killer is loose in the area and he's afraid someone's

254
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,820
 going to come in and start killing people at the facility.

255
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,660
 So they shut it down and then called the FBI.

256
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,780
 And what's really kind of concerning is one of the directors of the Sunspot Observatory

257
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,420
 apparently discovered this material on his laptop, but then had more pressing matters.

258
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
 Like you know, pointing a telescope at a son.

259
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,860
 There is an alien ship coming in.

260
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,700
 He's like, "Oh, the child stuff can wait."

261
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,180
 But no, he just, I don't know, had to go co-olate some star charts or something like that and

262
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
 didn't report it immediately.

263
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
 So there we go.

264
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,460
 I always said if we don't have a name of the person, someone's covering it up or maybe

265
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,180
 that was a false story.

266
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
 There we go.

267
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,100
 Misty was the total rock star for finding that.

268
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,900
 And in the show notes you can see all the documents, the court documents and everything

269
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,900
 like that.

270
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,500
 I also want to say this too, since we're on the subject of telescopes, James drive us

271
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,820
 now in that dead rabbit dune buggy down to Puerto Rico.

272
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,380
 I was actually talking to Kristen Davidson about this.

273
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,660
 Another listener of the show.

274
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,180
 Thank you very much, Kristen.

275
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,180
 Arcebo Telescope.

276
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
 This is another follow-up.

277
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,860
 I did a story earlier in the year.

278
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,900
 A cable broke loose and smashed the Arcebo Telescope.

279
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,020
 That telescope for us, for us paranormal alien nerds is important because that's where the

280
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,340
 telescope is built to do a bunch of science nerdy stuff that we don't care about, but it's

281
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,660
 also built to detect asteroids coming in.

282
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,900
 That's cool because stuff blows up.

283
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,140
 And it was used for SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

284
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,220
 It was used to broadcast the Arcebo message, which is one of the very famous messages we've

285
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
 sent out in space.

286
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,300
 The Voyager disks is one of them and then this one.

287
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,300
 Kind of showed a little map of our solar system and a bit of our DNA.

288
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,660
 It was like this digital beam, digital code and information that we shot out of the Arcebo

289
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
 Telescope.

290
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,100
 It's very, very popular in the paranormal alien community.

291
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,940
 It's also in the movie Contact.

292
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,100
 No one cares about that.

293
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,660
 It's also in the movie The Losers.

294
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,100
 You guys should watch The Losers, dude.

295
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,500
 That movie's dope.

296
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
 That movie's really, really good.

297
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,820
 It had Chris Evans and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and I think Zoe Saldana.

298
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,660
 And it was based on a DC comic book.

299
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
 It was really good.

300
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,420
 It's totally slept on.

301
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,980
 You want a good action movie, watch The Losers, but the Loser has nothing to do with the

302
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980
 Arcebo Telescope.

303
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,260
 A quick update to that.

304
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,380
 We did a story where a cable smashed open that thing and they didn't know how the cable

305
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
 snapped.

306
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,460
 I remember saying maybe aliens did it.

307
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
 They were just putting on our conspiracy caps.

308
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,700
 There was some sort of conspiracy saying maybe they were just smashing it so we didn't get

309
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
 any information.

310
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,660
 You know, it's funny because I'm poo pooing the sunspot thing and I'm like, "But this

311
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
 one!"

312
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
 But you know, we're just having fun putting on our conspiracy cap for that one.

313
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,460
 A cable smashed that dish and scientists were like, "We don't know if we can fix this,

314
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
 but I'm sure we can.

315
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,100
 You know, we don't have a lot of funding to begin with, but we'll figure something out."

316
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
 It's done.

317
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,820
 The Arcebo Telescope is completely destroyed at this point.

318
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,060
 Just a couple weeks ago, I guess, one of the main cables, as they were inspecting and they're

319
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,740
 like, "We could probably figure this out."

320
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,140
 One of the main cables snapped and completely smashed the telescope.

321
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,180
 And they can't even, they can't even get near it to see what they can do to fix it now.

322
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,140
 And again, though, with the main, they're like, "We didn't expect it."

323
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,700
 It was one of the big support systems for this.

324
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,560
 It shouldn't have broke.

325
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,240
 Still mysterious how the first one broke.

326
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,060
 This one's mysterious how this one broke.

327
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,500
 But it's done.

328
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,940
 At this point, they're saying there's no way they can fix it.

329
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
 It's the area that's already battered by hurricanes.

330
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,660
 It's surprising that it lasted as long as it did.

331
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,100
 And then we have these two mysterious cable snaps in a couple months.

332
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,620
 But that sucks because that is kind of a main state of, and it sucks, obviously, for science

333
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,660
 and all that stuff.

334
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,500
 But for us, it sucks because it is a kind of iconic symbol of extraterrestrial contact.

335
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,740
 So yeah, unfortunately, everyone pour a little liquor out for Arecibo Telescope.

336
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
 That is, as of now, finished.

337
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,580
 So that is our new segment.

338
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,300
 We have Telescope Tuesdays.

339
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,660
 It's a new thing we're doing every Tuesday.

340
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,180
 I'm going to provide you a new story about a telescope.

341
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,580
 James, let's toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

342
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,180
 We are leaving behind the sad little Arecibo telescope.

343
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,820
 Maybe someone will figure out a way to take care of it.

344
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,940
 We are headed out to Oklahoma City.

345
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:07,300
 James, I want you to land that carpenter copter right in front of the Skirvin Hilton Hotel.

346
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,380
 We're knocking over much of Valhalla's, crushing cars, and stuff like that.

347
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,380
 We all jump out.

348
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,300
 We laugh at the wreckage we've caused.

349
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,060
 And then we blame it on James and his little copter arresting him.

350
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
 We're like, thanks for supporting the page, Ian.

351
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,260
 He'll figure a way out.

352
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,660
 We walk into the Skirvin Hotel.

353
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,140
 Now I got most of my information for this story from an article written by John Branch

354
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,820
 for the New York Times called "Fright Nights in the NBA."

355
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,500
 Very, very good article.

356
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,820
 A lot of good research in this.

357
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
 So thank you very much, John.

358
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,540
 And right when I finished that, we see James is shaking off the cops and is now walking

359
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,780
 in the hotel behind us.

360
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,420
 The Skirvin Hotel was built in 1911.

361
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,540
 And then, you know, like all businesses has its ups and its downs, but eventually the

362
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,180
 Skirvin Hotel went out of operation.

363
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,420
 Just kind of sat there in the middle of Oklahoma City.

364
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,620
 It's a national landmark, so they couldn't really do anything with it.

365
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,300
 But you know, you kind of want to do something with it.

366
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,380
 You just don't want to leave a big old abandoned building in prime real estate.

367
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,780
 So the city gets together with these private partners and they go, "Let's revitalize this

368
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
 hotel.

369
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,580
 We'll restore it to its natural beauty and actually make it a working hotel again."

370
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,980
 So in 2007, they do that.

371
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,140
 They're able to revitalize that hotel and they knocked down all much of walls.

372
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,740
 Originally it had like 500 rooms.

373
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,980
 Now it has 225 rooms.

374
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,220
 It's a luxurious hotel with these giant rooms.

375
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,500
 And so of course, people who visit the town are going to want to go there.

376
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,140
 And it's a perfect spot, because it's so luxurious, that if you are a visiting NBA team and you're

377
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,100
 coming to play the Oklahoma City Thunder, you know, it'll put you up in the old Skirvin

378
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
 Hilton Hotel.

379
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,500
 It's beautiful.

380
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,140
 You got like royalty staying here.

381
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,940
 I guess I didn't look that up, but I'm sure at least one royal member stayed there.

382
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,580
 Very, very expensive hotel.

383
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,460
 NBA teams come there.

384
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,340
 They stay there and then the next day they're playing the Thunder and then they go home.

385
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,860
 And that just kind of is how it works.

386
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
 They go home.

387
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
 They go on to the next game.

388
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
 They're like, "Aw, man.

389
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,060
 That was the only game I got to play this year."

390
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,260
 And then they go and they sit in their mansion.

391
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,860
 No, they continue on with their career.

392
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,420
 But they come to Oklahoma City, stay in the Skirvin Hotel, play Oklahoma City Thunder,

393
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
 and then move on.

394
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,980
 In 2010, a story appeared that was a little unexpected.

395
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,420
 And it's one of those things where coaches are just like shaking their head.

396
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
 They're like, "Dude, no.

397
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,700
 Don't, don't quit saying that.

398
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,300
 Quit saying that in interviews."

399
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,660
 The Knicks are there to play the Oklahoma City Thunder and they lose.

400
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
 They lose the game.

401
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
 And the next day reporters are like, "Hey, why'd you lose that game?

402
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
 Why'd you lose that game?

403
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,900
 I had $20 on that game."

404
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,500
 And you had a couple Knicks players go, "We didn't sleep well the night before."

405
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,260
 Which sounds like just a normal excuse.

406
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,340
 But then they go, "We didn't sleep well because of the ghost."

407
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,220
 There's a ghost walking around the hotel and people are like, "What?"

408
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
 And they're like, "Yeah.

409
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,540
 That hotel is super haunted.

410
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,900
 I hate that hotel.

411
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,100
 I hated it before.

412
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,820
 This isn't the first time I've been in that hotel.

413
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,340
 There's a bunch of ghosts running around."

414
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,300
 The reporters are like, "What are you doing?

415
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,140
 You really blame me the loss of a game on a ghost?"

416
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,540
 You had ESPN analyst Bill Simmons go, "Oh, no.

417
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,540
 Skirvin Hotel?

418
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
 Yeah, no.

419
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,180
 I was there because I had to cover a game for the Oklahoma City Thunder.

420
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,180
 Super Haunted."

421
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
 What are you talking about?"

422
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
 He's like, "No, no, no.

423
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,580
 I woke up in the middle of the night.

424
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,580
 Lights off.

425
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,300
 Totally luxurious bed.

426
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
 Great sheets and stuff like that.

427
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,420
 Apparently this has become an ad for Skirvin Hilton.

428
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,740
 But I woke up in the middle of the night.

429
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,940
 I heard the sound of a baby crying.

430
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,980
 And not like a baby crying in the room next to me.

431
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
 A baby in my room.

432
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
 I don't have a baby.

433
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
 I don't know.

434
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,900
 Bill Simmons might have kids, but he didn't have a baby with him.

435
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,620
 If you're like, "Why are you talking about?"

436
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,860
 So looking into this, a ton of NBA players complain about this hotel.

437
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,500
 It's a known secret in the NBA that it's haunted.

438
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,860
 Now, coaches are like, it's utter nonsense.

439
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,060
 Some of the coaches will be like, "I don't know what you're talking about.

440
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,100
 It's their eyes shift from side to side."

441
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,700
 Other ones go, "Listen, NBA players, athletes in general are very superstitious.

442
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
 Very superstitious.

443
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,660
 They have these rituals before they do games."

444
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,580
 So it's not surprising that the players would believe in ghosts because they're superstitious.

445
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,220
 So the coaches are kind of blowing it off.

446
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,380
 They're like, "Guys, just focus on the game.

447
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,300
 Don't focus on Bloody Mary and the mayor."

448
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,420
 The players are like, "Bloody Mary's real."

449
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,940
 The coach is like, "Dang it, why did I even bring that up?"

450
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,580
 You had other reports in this hotel, so it's not just babies crying in your room.

451
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,780
 That seems to be a common theme.

452
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
 A lot of people are waking up to babies crying.

453
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,460
 But you had NBA players saying that they woke up to the sound of a slamming door.

454
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,860
 And when they jumped up out of bed, their bathroom door that they had left open was now

455
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
 shut.

456
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,100
 Spooky, but you know the wind, something like that.

457
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,060
 Some guys say that when they're walking around the hotel, they can hear a whisper of a voice

458
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,060
 in their ear, a woman's voice, propositioning them.

459
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,220
 "Hey, big boy, you want to dribble that ball down my court?"

460
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,220
 I don't know.

461
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
 I don't know.

462
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,940
 Obviously, I'm not a woman picking up a basketball star.

463
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,820
 I guess the obvious one was, "Hey, boy, how about you put that ball in my hoop?"

464
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,540
 But it's still that soup.

465
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,380
 That's like not sexy at all.

466
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,180
 Anyways, NBA, I don't know if she's actually making NBA puns.

467
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,340
 I don't know if she's actually making NBA puns while she's doing it.

468
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:14,100
 Oh, looks like you are a straightforward, I don't know about basketball to even make

469
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
 these jokes.

470
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,900
 Anyways, that could be imagination or wishful thinking.

471
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,940
 This woman, this ghost, will get into her legend, but I just want to creep you out even

472
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,140
 more.

473
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,180
 People say, it's always men who see this.

474
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,700
 Which is, again, a really odd thing.

475
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,860
 Yesterday we covered all the men drowning at that lake in Zimbabwe, or that river in

476
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
 Zimbabwe.

477
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,020
 This one, it's always men who are seeing this, experiencing this.

478
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,180
 They'll be taking a shower.

479
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,340
 I have a love-hate relationship with this one, because I've always said the scariest place

480
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,500
 a ghost can appear is in your bathroom, because it's super dangerous to be in your bathroom

481
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 anyways.

482
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,740
 But I'm thinking of me taking a shower and me turning around, and I have that old shower

483
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,340
 curtain, and on the other side of it I see a silhouette standing outside of it.

484
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,180
 That's what I think of when I think of a ghost in a shower.

485
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,900
 This one you're taking a shower and you turn around and there's a naked woman.

486
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,460
 There's a naked woman ghost behind you.

487
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,500
 So I gotta say, I gotta say, yes, ghosts in the shower are super terrifying, but if I

488
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,980
 was taking a shower and there was a silhouette outside of my shower curtain, immediately

489
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,260
 I'd be like, "Huh?"

490
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,700
 But then if the drapes, the curtain moves aside and the super sexy ghost gets in, I'm

491
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,300
 gonna be a little more relieved at that point.

492
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,700
 I'm gonna be like, "Oh."

493
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,580
 But probably not as still an undead wraith in your bathroom as just a hot one.

494
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,980
 That one's a little harder to chalk up to.

495
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
 The wind did it.

496
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,300
 Rusty pipes or something like that.

497
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,980
 World meta piece.

498
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,300
 Basketball player, formerly known as Ron Arntest.

499
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,460
 He actually wanted to sue the hotel because of this.

500
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,020
 Because he said he was sexually assaulted.

501
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,940
 I wasn't able to find details on it, but apparently he actually tried to sue them.

502
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,980
 He was so outraged by whatever this ghost woman did to him that he tried to sue the hotel.

503
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,180
 So that's interesting.

504
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:09,140
 What all this means really is, this is fascinating because we rarely see ghostly events have

505
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:15,820
 this sort of impact, Oklahoma City Thunder has the second most winningest records for

506
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
 home games.

507
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,300
 In the entire league.

508
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,220
 If you're playing Oklahoma City and you're playing against them in their city, you are

509
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,180
 most likely going to lose that game.

510
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:34,300
 So the fact that this place is haunted and that is where they are putting up the NBA

511
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,500
 teams from out of town, that's hilarious.

512
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,780
 Because it's actually probably helping them win.

513
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
 You don't get a good night's sleep.

514
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,180
 You do get a good night's sleep.

515
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,700
 The guy next to you, the guy in the room next to you, didn't get a good night's sleep.

516
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,300
 Doesn't want to take a shower.

517
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,060
 Super smelly the rest of the day.

518
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,340
 You got babies crying here and stuff in your ear.

519
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
 That is perfect.

520
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,940
 That's the funniest tactic.

521
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,300
 And I'm surprised that more people don't try.

522
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,340
 I'm surprised more teams aren't trying to find haunted locations and then like really

523
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,580
 trying to anger the ghosts.

524
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,100
 They're like, "Hey, Michael Jordan, go down there and summon a goat monster."

525
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,600
 What are you talking about?

526
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,980
 I don't even play for the NBA.

527
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
 They're like, "Yeah, that's why it's perfect.

528
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,580
 If you get killed by the goat monster, then you know, you're a legend."

529
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
 But he's like, "Wait, what?

530
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,460
 No, no, no, no, no, just go down and go down and stay bloody merry in the mirror three

531
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
 times."

532
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,460
 I'm not going to do that.

533
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,820
 But you would get someone else.

534
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,540
 You get some new guy who really wants to play basketball and be like, "We'll put you

535
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,180
 on the team."

536
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,420
 But first, you give him a summoning goat monsters for Dummies book.

537
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,500
 Go down to the basement of this hotel.

538
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,180
 So we have a real life effect on the sport of basketball.

539
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,700
 And it's funny if you're actually betting.

540
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,780
 I've been researching gambling addictions a lot recently.

541
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,340
 We'll talk about that in a future episode.

542
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,140
 But if you're betting on teams, you almost always want to bet for the Oklahoma City Thunder

543
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
 if they're playing.

544
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
 Don't gamble.

545
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,620
 If you advise, this is a sure bet from Dead or Ever Radio.

546
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,620
 Don't gamble.

547
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,420
 It appears that it can really mess you up.

548
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:07,300
 But if you are going to gamble, always bet on Oklahoma City after home games, because it's

549
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,980
 most likely the other team got spooked out.

550
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,860
 Now we have a bunch of stuff to cover.

551
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,660
 I don't have a lot of time to do it, but I want to go into the legend of this story.

552
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,060
 And that's again where Jon Branch did an amazing job at putting this all together.

553
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,580
 You have this woman ghost.

554
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
 She's whispering in ear.

555
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,500
 She wants to dribble your bowl.

556
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,780
 You have a baby crying in your room.

557
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,140
 Sometimes there's an image of a woman pushing a baby carriage through the hotel.

558
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,580
 Why are these two things so connected?

559
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
 This is the story.

560
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,580
 A long time ago, we're talking like pre-1930.

561
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,460
 The hotel was only about 10 stories high.

562
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,460
 Now it's 14.

563
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,380
 When it was 10 stories high, the 10th story was known as a "din of vice."

564
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,340
 You'd have gambling up there and things like that.

565
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,140
 And you had a young housekeeper named Effie.

566
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,380
 And she had an affair with the hotel's owner, the hotel's founder, W.B.

567
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
 Skirvin.

568
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,540
 Classic story.

569
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
 She gets pregnant.

570
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,940
 He wants to cover it up, so he says, "Go live on the 10th floor in this little hotel room.

571
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,660
 I'll provide for everything."

572
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,260
 But she's basically a prisoner.

573
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,620
 She's trapped up there.

574
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,420
 And even after she gives birth to her child, she's still not allowed to live.

575
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,420
 She's not allowed to leave.

576
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,900
 So eventually this takes a toll on her, so she jumps out of her window holding her baby

577
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,660
 and dies in the front of the hotel.

578
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,540
 This is the most common ghost story you hear.

579
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,060
 Effie is a nickname that people have given her, but the most common story you hear is

580
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,460
 that one.

581
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,700
 And the New York Times looked into this and they go, "We could never find a record of

582
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,580
 anyone named Effie."

583
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,980
 But it turns out that was just a nickname.

584
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,500
 But they go, "We've never come across anyone who jumped out of the hotel with their baby

585
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 and died."

586
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,980
 You even had local historian Steve Lachmeyer, he's a reporter for the Oklahoma.

587
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
 He said, "We looked into this.

588
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,780
 I wrote a book about the scurvin.

589
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
 We looked into this.

590
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,740
 It's a really well-known story in town.

591
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,780
 There is no record of this happening."

592
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,040
 And he goes, "Back then it was a small town.

593
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,740
 That would have made huge news.

594
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,340
 There's no proof of a housekeeper jumping out with a baby and dying in front of the hotel."

595
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,780
 The earliest reference, John Branch was able to track this down, the earliest reference

596
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,940
 of this being written down.

597
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,220
 This story comes from the mid-90s on a haunted places website.

598
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,100
 So it may have been a local story that was going around that only particular, like you

599
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,860
 know, you may have a bridge in your area that's kind of spooky, but if you move five miles

600
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,780
 out of that area and nobody knows of the story, this must have been a super local legend.

601
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,980
 Because there's no books written about it long ago.

602
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,940
 But in the mid-1990s there was a haunted, like a ghost research website.

603
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,700
 And New York Times tracked down the guy who wrote that.

604
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,260
 His name is Jason Gammon, who currently has a ghostly website.

605
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,060
 Jason Gammon said, "This is what the story I heard."

606
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,420
 Like he goes, "Yeah, I posted it online back in the 1990s.

607
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,940
 This was how I heard of the story."

608
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,180
 He goes, "We used to hang out.

609
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,180
 There was like a parking garage near this hotel.

610
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
 At this point it was abandoned.

611
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,700
 He said, "We used to hang out.

612
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,220
 It would have been like in the 70s, the 80s."

613
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,300
 And they befriended an elderly security guard there.

614
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:11,100
 And he told us the story about a woman named Julia who was in room 832.

615
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,820
 And she with her baby fell out of her room, fell out of the window, and landed in front

616
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,580
 of the hotel and died.

617
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,140
 So that was the story Jason Gammon told.

618
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,500
 But there has never been a room 832.

619
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,580
 That room has never existed.

620
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,580
 The most rooms that hotel ever had was 500 rooms.

621
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,980
 Now there's 14 floors, but it still has only had up to 500 rooms that they've now turned

622
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,180
 into 225.

623
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,280
 So we're basically at a dead end with the legend.

624
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,180
 Because that story just isn't true.

625
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,860
 It's probably a bit of truth in there, but it could also just be an old man making up

626
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,180
 stuff to impress a bunch of kids.

627
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,740
 That's the most likely thing.

628
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,940
 It could be that the story is partially true, but he just got the number wrong.

629
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,060
 And maybe there wasn't a baby involved, because again, you think that would be in the news.

630
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,900
 You don't think some just elderly guy would be like, "I am the true guardian of the knowledge

631
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
 of Oklahoma City."

632
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,260
 And he has this staff, "Welcome to my repository."

633
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,660
 People did have newspapers back in the 1930s.

634
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,020
 And this would have been a story.

635
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,380
 It's super salacious.

636
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,100
 This is a fascinating story, because I believe this ghost is real, but it has an unknown

637
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,420
 origin.

638
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:26,500
 I believe these incidents of the baby crying and the ghost woman are real for two reasons.

639
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,900
 One, you have a ton of witnesses to the activity.

640
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,420
 You have a ton of witnesses to the activity, and it kind of fits that only men are hearing

641
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
 it.

642
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,540
 Again, that is a detail that seems to make it stand out more than you go into a room,

643
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,980
 you feel a cold draft, anyone can feel the cold draft.

644
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,580
 I find that detail intriguing.

645
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,300
 Also the fact, and I've talked about this a hundred times on the show, the hotel absolutely

646
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,580
 does not play this up at all.

647
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,540
 They don't talk about it.

648
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,180
 They instruct all of their employees.

649
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,020
 If anyone asks about the ghost, tell them you don't know what they're talking about.

650
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,860
 They have an official statement.

651
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,780
 You do not talk about the folklore of this hotel.

652
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,980
 That is extremely suspicious.

653
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,380
 They could easily cordon off a little room and say this is Effie's room and charge a

654
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
 little bit more.

655
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,020
 And then on Halloween, charge people to go through on ghost tours.

656
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,900
 And even though it's a luxurious hotel, you'd have people paying extra money just to stay

657
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
 in Effie's room.

658
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,980
 No, they want no extra money.

659
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,380
 The ghost does not exist.

660
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,460
 As far as the management of the hotel is concerned, it is not real.

661
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,900
 That makes me think it's real.

662
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,460
 Because almost every other company would be like, "Yes, this is a haunted sewage treatment

663
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
 plant."

664
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,820
 And on Halloween, we open it up and we make an extra thousand dollars.

665
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
 I think it's real.

666
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,340
 I think this is a real ghost activity.

667
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
 We don't know the legend.

668
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,420
 We don't know where she came from.

669
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
 We have to...

670
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,880
 Based on the evidence, we would assume that it is a mother and her child.

671
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,280
 But it almost seems like a mother ghost who, even though she has a kid, is still looking

672
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,180
 for a little something special on the side.

673
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,780
 She's always hitting on dudes, getting into their showers naked.

674
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,980
 Who knows what she did to metaworldpeace, but she's definitely out there still looking

675
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,940
 for male affection.

676
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
 Bizarre story.

677
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,300
 It's a creepy story.

678
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,220
 Just as a standard ghost story, it's more than just, "Oh, a ghost walking down the hallway."

679
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,420
 We have a very active spirit.

680
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,900
 We have management denying it exists while multi-millionaires in front of cameras are

681
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,700
 saying, "That place is haunted."

682
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,660
 Again, it's not just people off the street going, "Oh, I went and saw an orb."

683
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,840
 We have people whose mental and physical abilities are worth millions of dollars and even more

684
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,540
 money is being bet on them every day and they're coming forward and being like, "There's a

685
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,060
 dead baby in my room.

686
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,180
 I don't like playing this team."

687
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,980
 All of this takes it to a level above just orbs floating down a hallway.

688
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,620
 The ghost that exists in this hotel is actually costing people money.

689
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,380
 If you bet against Oklahoma City Thunder at a home game, you will most likely lose.

690
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,620
 Fascinating.

691
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:04,540
 I can't think of a ghost story that has had such a financial impact on the people around

692
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,220
 it than this one.

693
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,220
 So if you ever find yourself in Oklahoma City and got a couple hundred dollars to spare,

694
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,700
 why don't you check out the N.R.A. man.

695
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,660
 I guess if a woman you go, it's just a nice hotel.

696
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,780
 But if you're a man in Oklahoma City and you have a couple hundred dollars to spare, check

697
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,180
 out the Skerven Hilton Hotel.

698
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,220
 At the very least, you'll have a nice night in the luxurious hotel and then the next day

699
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,700
 you can take in the sights and the sounds of the city.

700
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:34,780
 But you may possibly not just be paying for a room, you may be paying for a paranormal

701
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,420
 encounter that involves a hot ghost in your shower.

702
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
 Lathering up your back.

703
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,860
 I don't think she can hold the soap.

704
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,340
 But just for this scenario, she's lathering up your back.

705
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,260
 She's whispering sweet nothings in your ear.

706
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,820
 You may have the opportunity to make love to a ghost woman.

707
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
 You leave the next day.

708
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,460
 You don't have a basketball game to play.

709
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,700
 You don't have to worry about the stresses of that.

710
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,060
 You just go back to your daily life.

711
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:05,740
 However, nine months later, someone else is staying in that hotel and they wake up.

712
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,100
 They don't take a shower with a beautiful woman.

713
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:16,540
 They wake up and they hear two ghostly babies crying in the darkness.

714
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:27,220
 You thought you were having a one night stand with a specter.

715
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,100
 Instead.

716
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,460
 Now your Casper's dad.

717
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
 Now your Casper's dad.

718
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,740
 It probably would have been funnier if I had gone it out.

719
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,780
 And I know I made a Casper joke last week, but what are you going to do?

720
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,380
 DeadRabbitRadiotGmail.com is going to be our email address.

721
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,980
 Casper is not a baby.

722
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,380
 Casper I imagine was like 10 or 12.

723
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,580
 And he didn't cry like a baby.

724
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,540
 But anyways, you guys get it.

725
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
 You guys get it.

726
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,260

730
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,700
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

731
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,620
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

732
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,380
 Have a great one, guys.
