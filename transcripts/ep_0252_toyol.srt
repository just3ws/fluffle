00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
 A young Jason Carpenter was looking for a job, and when he opened the Wontads in the Sacramento

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,040
 Bee one day, he found an ad to become a telephone psychic.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,560
 And then how evil would you be willing to go to raise your own army?

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,160
 We'll go to Southeast Asia and meet shamans and dark wizards who lend out baby ghosts

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,400
 for hire.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,240
 You need something protected?

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,320
 Hire a baby ghost.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,080
 You want something stolen?

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,960
 Hire a baby ghost.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,800
 And if you want someone whose heart is crushed to death by little baby hands, you know where

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
 to go.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
 The Baby Ghost Place, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,600
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,960
 Go to the Baby Ghost Place, but we'll get to that story in a second, because first off,

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,120
 I want to talk about me being a psychic phone operator.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,040
 So I mentioned that a couple of episodes ago.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
 I just kind of said, oh yeah, I used to work for a psychic phone hotline, and then I just

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,760
 continued on with the story.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,440
 Someone online was like, dude, tell us that story.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,560
 So I will tell you that story.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,040
 That is the origin story for this.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,480
 Well actually, the origin story for this is me getting the job.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,960
 I answered a classified ad back in 98, 99.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,560
 They needed psychic phone operators.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,640
 Now what it was was, I would dial into a call center type thing, and then phone calls would

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,080
 be rerouted to my phone.

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,000
 It was one of the only jobs, it wasn't the only one, but it was one of the only jobs

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,120
 that I actively drank at, because it was so depressing.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,840
 Everyone who called had a really deep Southern accent.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,920
 Everyone who called was sad and depressed.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,360
 No one ever calls a psychic hotline because everything's going perfectly in their life.

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,120
 What they want to know is my life going to continue to be exceptional.

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
 Nobody does that.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,320
 They call because they're at the lowest point in their life.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,880
 When I got my packet to join, like they sent me my introduction packet, a little owl brought

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,320
 it in with a little scroll and unraveled it.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
 Thanks owl.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,960
 It had a list of suicide hotlines for every single state in the world.

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,680
 Not every single state in the world.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,960
 It would have all of the suicide hotlines for every state in America.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,040
 And so I was like, "Oh, that's not a good thing."

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,280
 No, I mean, it's good that suicide hotlines exist, but I don't want to have a job where

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,080
 that is part of it.

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,200
 Because then I was like, the people who are calling me like, are really, really depressed.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 And that was true.

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,880
 Now, there's a couple rules I had to follow.

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,080
 One, never fall in love.

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,760
 Two, that wasn't actually a rule, but it should have been.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,560
 Two, you had to keep them on the phone for five minutes, and they did that like an average.

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,440
 So if you had one person hang up within five minutes, that's no big deal, because they

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
 took it a monthly average of it.

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,960
 But the caller got the first two minutes for free.

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,800
 Every minute after that was 399.

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
 You had to have an average of over five minutes.

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,920
 And in each phone call, they wanted us to get the name and the address of the caller

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,320
 so we could send them coupons, and then they'd call back and get like an extra additional

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,680
 minute free or half off the phone call or whatever it was like that.

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,720
 So I started doing it, and I basically would sit down with my phone.

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,720
 I don't think I drank the first night, but by the second or third night I was drinking.

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,720
 I would sit down with my tarot cards, a bottle of Jack Daniels, and I'd get on the phone.

63
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
 I dial in.

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,520
 And these people would call in with pretty normal problems.

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,480
 They'd call up, you know, am I going to get this job?

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,800
 Am I going to find my cat?

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 Whatever.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,960
 There's really only two phone calls I remember.

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,800
 I did the job for about a month.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
 There's two phone calls that I remember.

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,280
 One, this woman called me up.

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
 This was towards the end of my time there.

73
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,240
 I ended up quitting after the month, but this woman called me up and she's sobbing, and

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,080
 I'm like, "Oh, take a shot of whiskey."

75
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
 And I go, "What's going on?"

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
 I mean, obviously you got a sobbing woman on the phone.

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
 I was a little more empathetic than that.

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,680
 I was just like, "Come on, lady."

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,720
 She tells me that she wants to know if her husband is going to leave her.

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,880
 So the obvious question I have is, "Well, is there any reason why he might?"

81
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,760
 And she goes, "He's going to leave me because I keep spending too much money on psychic

82
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 hotlines."

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,200
 And I was like, "Oh my God, this is a double shot one."

84
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,880
 And I'm like, "Well, I got to keep her on the phone for five minutes."

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,440
 I remember trying to wrap that one up real quick, but I did the tarot reading because

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
 I still do tarot card readings.

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,240
 I'll go a little bit into that at the end here, but...

88
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,480
 So I'm dropping out a tarot card.

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
 I knew exactly what I was going to tell her.

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
 I didn't really care what the card said.

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,280
 I said, "I didn't tell her her true destiny."

92
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,120
 I said, "Okay, so here's what the tarot card say.

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,680
 He's not going to leave you, but you need to work on your marriage and don't call us

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
 again.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,360
 You can call us months from now, but give it a while.

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
 Don't call any more psychic hotlines because I see in your future your husband will leave

97
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
 you if you continue to call psychic hotlines."

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,400
 And she said, she goes, "I got a coupon in the mail and I saw it as a sign that I needed

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,560
 to call the psychic hotline."

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
 And I remember that was a call that made me, one, really want to quit.

101
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
 And two, I didn't never send the company the names and addresses of the people that I had

102
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
 been collecting.

103
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
 I was like, "Nah, throw it away.

104
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
 I don't want them to...

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,200
 I don't want to give them this information."

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,920
 They already automatically had hers, obviously, but I was like, "I don't want to get anyone

107
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
 else hooked on this."

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
 I ended up getting paid from them.

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,320
 I don't even remember how much I made, but I got like one month to pay for it.

110
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,640
 But I never sent off the list.

111
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,120
 I never sent off that stuff.

112
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
 The other really notable phone call, and this, I always use this story to talk about how

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,480
 psychics work.

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,320
 Now, when I use the term psychic in reference to me, I'm not psychic.

115
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
 I'm not psychic.

116
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,120
 I don't claim to have any psychic powers whatsoever.

117
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,720
 What I can do is I can read people incredibly well.

118
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,480
 This guy calls me up and he goes, just before I even get through my introduction, he goes,

119
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,240
 "If you can't tell me why I'm calling, I'm going to hang up.

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,960
 I get two free minutes and you got two minutes to tell me, 'Mr. Psychic, why I'm calling

121
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
 or I'm hanging up.'"

122
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
 Now, I'm obviously thinking, "I got a five minute average."

123
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 I can't afford...

124
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,800
 And I was keeping people on the phone for like 15, 20 minutes.

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,760
 So I wasn't worried about it, but it did spark something in me.

126
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,600
 It's like, "Oh, no, I can't let this guy hang up within the first two minutes.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,200
 Can't let him get that free phone call."

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,760
 And so I pause for a second and I go, "You're calling because of something you own, but

129
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
 can't touch."

130
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,080
 And he goes, "Whoa."

131
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,000
 Now obviously that's so vague it can mean anything because it means nothing.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,600
 When I said it, it was just a statement that I knew would give me enough wiggle room to

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 keep them on the phone.

134
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,720
 And you're going to be like, "Jason, you're a total scam.

135
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 I'm not going to go into this because I think there is a healing process.

136
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,600
 I think I wasn't just doing this for the money as time goes on and stuff like that.

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,640
 There's a reason why I actually advocate for this.

138
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,360
 The Psychic phone hotlines, I think they rip people off money-wise, but really a lot

139
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,320
 of times it can work as a therapy and it's around the same prices going to a therapist

140
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
 without insurance.

141
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,280
 So anyways, Blue was mine and we started talking and I actually kept him...

142
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,560
 This is my longest phone call.

143
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,640
 I kept him on the phone for an hour, which was the legal limit.

144
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,000
 I think 57 minutes, a beep pops up on my phone and then at 58 it beeps again and at 60 minutes

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,880
 it will actually automatically disconnect the phone call.

146
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,920
 So I think this phone call probably cost him $4 times, $58, $4 times $60 would be like

147
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,480
 $240 this phone call cost him.

148
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,680
 But the way he felt after the phone call, he was at peace.

149
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,320
 And I know you're thinking, "Well, what was something you can own but can't touch?

150
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,480
 How did he react to that?"

151
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,840
 As we're talking about it, he tells me he was calling because he wanted to know if

152
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,080
 his music career would be successful.

153
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
 Music is something you can own.

154
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,640
 You can own the songs in your head.

155
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
 They're part of you.

156
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,040
 But you can't hold music.

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,560
 He can hold the instruments.

158
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
 You can hold the recording, but you can't hold music.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Such a vague answer.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 It would have applied to art.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,520
 It would have applied to relationships.

162
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,000
 It would have applied to so many possible things outside of a physical object.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,760
 If he really wanted a car, he would have hung up.

164
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,640
 It's something that he could actually touch you would have hung up, but it's so vague.

165
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,840
 But we talked and at the end of the phone call, I basically gave him the confidence to focus

166
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
 on his music.

167
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
 I was like, "You got to do it, man.

168
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,440
 I know it can be hard and you'll be working.

169
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,920
 You'll be doing the music thing, but you got to do it."

170
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,680
 That's why I don't feel bad about it.

171
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,840
 I don't want to give people the coupons, but I never felt bad about the conversations

172
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,560
 themselves because everyone I talked to ended the conversation in a better place mentally

173
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,920
 than they were before they called me.

174
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 They weren't crying.

175
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
 They weren't depressed.

176
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,440
 Now, they may have been a little depressed when they got that bill, but again, you go

177
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,320
 to a therapist without insurance.

178
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,280
 It's going to be a ton of money anyways.

179
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,200
 You're going to be less likely to be honest face-to-face with a total stranger than you

180
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,040
 are to be with someone over the phone in a completely different state.

181
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,800
 Now, remember this was like in 98, 99, and I wanted to get his name for the logbook.

182
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
 I go, "Hey, man.

183
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 Hey, I never got your name."

184
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,200
 He goes, "Mayor, John Mayer."

185
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,800
 I was like, "Nice to meet you, John.

186
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,680
 Hope things work out for you."

187
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
 Click.

188
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,280
 Actually, that last part didn't happen.

189
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,600
 That's where it didn't happen.

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,240
 I actually have always wondered about what happened with that dude.

191
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,760
 He was working in oil, or he was working in some engineering job, but he really wanted

192
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
 to be a musician.

193
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,000
 He wanted to know was it worth even venturing to try to do music?

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,600
 The answer is, of course.

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
 He didn't want to quit his job to do music.

196
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,240
 He just wondered if anything would ever come of it.

197
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,400
 "Of course, man.

198
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,760
 What will come of it is your enjoyment."

199
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,160
 I never felt bad about actually engaging with these people.

200
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,120
 They always were in a better headspace afterwards.

201
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
 I don't want to do it.

202
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
 It was super depressing.

203
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
 It took a lot out of me.

204
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
 That's it.

205
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,520
 That's the psychic phone operator hotline.

206
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,280
 Really, that's the key to any psychics.

207
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
 I don't know if you guys go to psychics.

208
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,920
 It might be your way of talking to people.

209
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
 I don't know.

210
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,600
 We're just getting out issues and stuff like that.

211
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,840
 It's all basically a game where I'm going to make vague statements.

212
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,560
 You are going to respond to those statements until they become more specific.

213
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,040
 Then I'm going to actually repeat back to you what you told me.

214
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,720
 You will forget all of the questions it took for me to get to that main point.

215
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,280
 I can guarantee you that that guy, the musician guy, didn't realize that I was made such an

216
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,480
 incredibly vague statement and I just slowly narrowed it down to the point where I could

217
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,440
 openly ask him, "What are you calling for?"

218
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
 He says, "Well, I'm calling for my music career."

219
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,480
 At that point, we just talked about his music career at that point.

220
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,440
 I gave him advice to follow your dreams.

221
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,240
 I'm sure he got off that phone call and wasn't like, "That man, all he did was tell me to

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
 follow my dreams.

223
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,480
 That's no psychic."

224
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,200
 He was like, "That guy had all the answers."

225
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,680
 I just kept asking these questions.

226
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,000
 At one point, I just straight up said, "What is this?"

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,280
 He goes, "My music," and so on and so forth.

228
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,320
 You ask very vague questions as a psychic and then you just narrow them down, narrow

229
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 them down, narrow them down.

230
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,840
 Then I'll just repeat them back and you'll think that I'm some sort of evil wizard.

231
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,280
 It's all a trick.

232
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,040
 In the hands of a scrupulous person, it can be used as a form of therapy.

233
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,680
 In the hands of a less scrupulous person, it is just a way to manipulate people and

234
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,560
 steal money for them and stuff like that.

235
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,400
 That is actually a good segue for our next story because we're going from, I wouldn't

236
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,160
 necessarily call what I did white magic, but I think it would fall more in the level of

237
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,040
 gray magic.

238
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,120
 You might call black magic because people are spending a ton of money, but I feel like

239
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,040
 they left the phone call in a better place.

240
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 Let's go ahead.

241
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,840
 We're going to leave behind 1999 Jason.

242
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
 Sorry, dude.

243
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
 I can't warn you about all the troubles that are coming up.

244
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
 He's like, "What troubles?"

245
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
 I'm like, "See you later."

246
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 He's like, "No.

247
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
 Tell me.

248
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
 Warn me, please."

249
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,120
 I shed a little tear for young, naive, 99 Jason.

250
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,480
 And I get, not just me, we get into the, I got lost in there for a second.

251
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,480
 I'm looking at myself through that paint glass window.

252
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 I'm like, "If only I could warn myself, but I can't."

253
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,280
 He must have struggled those things, dude.

254
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,600
 You're like, "Jason, why are you talking to yourself?

255
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,280
 Let's just get on the carpenter copter."

256
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
 I'm like, "Oh, yes, sorry."

257
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
 And then I'm looking at him.

258
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 "What's this?

259
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
 You're going to jerk it."

260
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
 We get in the carpenter copter.

261
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
 We take off.

262
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,960
 We're going to Southeast Asia.

263
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,160
 It's a whole region over there.

264
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
 You know geography.

265
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,280
 China, a bunch of other stuff.

266
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,080
 What else is over there?

267
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,600
 Malaysia, you know, Southeast Asia stuff.

268
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,160
 Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam.

269
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,960
 Anyways, we're flying our helicopter over this place.

270
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,200
 I don't know where we're going.

271
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,480
 And we land somewhere in Southeast Asia.

272
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,040
 You're like, "Jason, that's incredibly vague."

273
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,120
 I know, I know.

274
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,760
 It's all over the region.

275
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
 We get off.

276
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
 We don't get off.

277
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,920
 We land.

278
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,600
 We disembark into a small Malaysian village.

279
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
 We're in Malaysia.

280
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,040
 You're like, "You could have just said that, dude."

281
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
 So we're in Malaysia.

282
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,200
 But we might go to China and these other countries.

283
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,320
 Walking around Malaysia, there's a small village.

284
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,960
 And there's a guy there and his name is...

285
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
 I'm not going to make...

286
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,560
 I'm not going to make a Malaysian dude's name.

287
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
 Norvish from Scandinavia, that's fine.

288
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,800
 I'm not going to make a Malaysian dude's name.

289
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,440
 His name is Mr. Jones.

290
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,560
 So we go into this Asian village.

291
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,680
 Mr. Jones and me and you.

292
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,840
 We're going to be big stars.

293
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,960
 But today, Mr. Jones is going to show us around his stereotypical Asian village.

294
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
 And we're like, "Thank you, Mr. Jones.

295
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
 Nice to meet you."

296
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
 And he's like, "Thank you.

297
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
 Thank you."

298
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,360
 We just hand the rocker and Lee looking at each other for a while.

299
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, you're here to talk about the toils."

300
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,720
 And I'm like, "Yes.

301
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,520
 Tell us about the toils."

302
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,040
 And he goes, "First off, I can almost assure you that you're mispronouncing that."

303
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,720
 Secondly, these things are also known as the komin tong or the kwee kia.

304
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,640
 Kwee kia, which is an exceptionally cute name.

305
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,520
 But what these things are, are anything but cute.

306
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,600
 So Mr. Jones leads us into a shack.

307
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
 Not a shack, a hut.

308
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
 It doesn't matter.

309
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,040
 Both are pretty stereotypical.

310
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,800
 It's actually a one-story adobe house.

311
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 Breaking the stereotypes.

312
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,120
 So we walk into this one-story adobe house in the middle of Southeast Asia.

313
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,160
 And he's like, "Take a seat, my friends.

314
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:26,160
 And I will tell you all about the toile, aka the kwee kia, which is much cuter."

315
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
 So sit down.

316
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,640
 And we sit down, we walk in this hut.

317
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
 It's a nice little place.

318
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
 We're going to a hut.

319
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,520
 It's a one-story adobe house.

320
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,400
 We sit down and they're like looking around.

321
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,600
 It's a shaman's hut.

322
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
 It's a shaman's hut.

323
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,400
 And you know, got trinkets, chicken bones, a bunch of other shamanistic stuff.

324
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
 Big earthen vases next to us.

325
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,360
 Mmm, smells like kombucha.

326
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
 Take a big drink.

327
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
 Here, you want some?

328
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,480
 I'll let you decide whether or not you drink any of this kombucha from a shaman's hut.

329
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
 Drinking it up.

330
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,760
 Mr. Jones is standing there and he goes, "The toile is a weapon.

331
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:14,160
 We have perfected the ability to take the undead and turn them against the living.

332
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,200
 But the first step to create one of these things is we must dig up the fetus of a dead

333
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 child."

334
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,880
 Okay, this is kind of dark, Mr. Jones, but silence!

335
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,240
 The second step is we take the body and crush it, creating a liquid known as corpse oil.

336
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,320
 At that point, he turns around.

337
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,760
 He's like, "Were you just drinking out of the earthen vases and wiping corpse oil off

338
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
 my face?"

339
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
 No, sir.

340
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
 I was not.

341
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
 Oh, my stomach, I don't feel so good.

342
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,320
 It's like, good.

343
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,680
 Because if you did, that's totally gross.

344
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
 Don't do that.

345
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
 Like, yes, sir.

346
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,600
 Don't drink stuff in a shaman's hut is basically what I'm saying.

347
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 So we take this corpse oil and it's, "God, you didn't drink any.

348
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,640
 No, no, man, I didn't drink any."

349
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,800
 Feeling like super powerful now.

350
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,440
 I feel like I have the power of 10 babies inside of me.

351
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,840
 He goes, "What we do is we take the corpse oil, we make a little statue of a baby, and

352
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,840
 we drop it in the vase.

353
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,720
 And then you have created a toil."

354
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
 At that point, I'm wondering if I can swallow the statue of a tiny baby.

355
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,760
 This is what these things do.

356
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,400
 And this is actually quite fascinating because we've talked about this in past episodes, but

357
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,440
 the escalation of magic warfare is fascinating.

358
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,080
 You don't really hear about it a lot, but that's what we're going to be talking about

359
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,720
 with the toils.

360
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,120
 So the toils are pretty much what he described.

361
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,080
 And what you do is you create a little ghost baby servant to do some bad stuff in the neighborhood.

362
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,240
 They're technically created for evil, which makes sense because of the ingredients.

363
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,440
 Nothing good is going to come out of magic involving a baby.

364
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,680
 So what happened was, back in like the 1500s, this soldier in Thailand, this is one of the

365
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,920
 origin stories for these things, he's getting ready to fight this great war, and his wife

366
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,520
 died at the same time, and his wife was pregnant with his son, so he took the son out of his

367
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,440
 - well, the kid was dead too - and then used this magical ritual that he invented and created

368
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,080
 a ghost baby warrior to follow him into battle.

369
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,960
 And what it would do is it like Casper, it would fly - Casper didn't do this, but it

370
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,400
 had the abilities of Casper, where it could fly through stuff.

371
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,600
 So as this soldier from Thailand is chopping all these people up, the ghost baby is flying

372
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,600
 into his enemies and like phasing into them and then crushing their hearts from the inside.

373
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,400
 And that's when people saw the power behind the toil.

374
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,320
 So what they were used for in modern time - this was a myth, but it still persists today,

375
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,880
 people still talk about these things like they're real.

376
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,560
 The toils were used after the great war, the toils were used for thieves, because they're

377
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,360
 an invisible little tiny guy that sneaks into your house and would take gold from you or

378
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,200
 money, anything, watches, whatever.

379
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,920
 I don't have to explain what thieves are.

380
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,520
 So that's what they would do, they would use these thieves.

381
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,560
 And then people said, you know what, I'm tired of getting my stuff stolen, I'm going to create

382
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,040
 toil bodyguards.

383
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,960
 So they go out and dig up a bunch of babies and they are ringing the corpse oil out of

384
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,360
 them and creating little ghost babies in front of their house.

385
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,120
 So then when the other toils would try to sneak in they'd be like, "Uh-uh."

386
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,760
 And they'd be like, "There'd be a little ghost baby fight out in your front yard."

387
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,400
 Then other people started saying, "Okay, well, if I can't get into your house, I'm going

388
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,880
 to create a baby saboteur."

389
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,120
 So these babies would be able to go in and break your windows, smashing stuff up, smashing

390
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,600
 it up real good, taking the wheels off your cart.

391
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,320
 At that point they're basically gremlins.

392
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,360
 And other people said, "You know what, I'm going old school with this."

393
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,200
 And they were training their toils to assassinate people.

394
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,000
 So you'd have these people just dropping heart attacks.

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,400
 And in Southeast Asia they'd be like, "Oh, a toil must have gotten them."

396
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,760
 Who doesn't like this guy?

397
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
 Who has a toil?

398
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,120
 Because they're not the easiest thing to create.

399
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,080
 You have to have access to the materials.

400
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
 God help you if you do.

401
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,200
 And you have to know the incantations as well.

402
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,240
 So you would go to shamans and you would basically special order these ones.

403
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
 Which one did you want?

404
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 Did you want the thief?

405
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
 Did you want the saboteur?

406
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,580
 Do you want a bodyguard?

407
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,160
 You want an assassin?

408
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,400
 Some people actually, this is found this absolutely fascinating.

409
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,460
 Some people said, "You know what, I don't want to do any of that stuff.

410
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,480
 Bodyguards are probably the best of them.

411
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,600
 But I think we can do one better.

412
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,440
 I think we can have good toils."

413
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,720
 So doctors would go and to shaman.

414
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,080
 I don't know if George Clooney level doctors.

415
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,560
 I don't know if doctors in hospitals did this.

416
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,480
 Regional doctors in the past would say, "I want a toil because they can go inside people."

417
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,440
 And the shamans like, "And crush their heart."

418
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
 He's like, "No, no, no.

419
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
 I don't want them to crush their heart."

420
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,520
 I want the baby to go inside people and look around and then come back out and tell me,

421
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
 does he have gallstones?

422
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
 Is liver inflamed?

423
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,160
 Did he drink some corp soil?

424
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,720
 I want a baby to fly around in a human body and tell me what's wrong so I can diagnose

425
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
 them."

426
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
 Shamans like, "And then crush their heart."

427
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,880
 Is it no heart crush bro?

428
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
 Just give me one.

429
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,920
 They don't want to crush anybody's hearts.

430
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,440
 They just want to be a medical aid.

431
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,920
 So people started using these as diagnostic tools as well.

432
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,820
 You had entire communities that had these.

433
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,920
 You either had ones that stole for you or protected your house and everyone would have

434
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,280
 these earthen jars with these little tiny statues in them.

435
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,440
 But full of corp soil.

436
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
 It wasn't just something you'd put on your mantle.

437
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
 It was still quite disgusting.

438
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,960
 Now they're obviously like all spirits or cryptids from mythology.

439
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,360
 They had built-in weaknesses.

440
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,480
 Werewolves have silver bullets.

441
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,720
 Vampires have the cross and garlic.

442
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,040
 So what weakness does the toil have other than another toil other than another little

443
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,260
 ghost baby that could fight them?

444
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,140
 And they actually- people who said they could see these things.

445
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,140
 They just look like babies.

446
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,740
 There's been a modern retcon, like a grim dark retcon where they have green skin and

447
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,420
 sharp teeth and pointed ears because there's been a couple movies made about these things.

448
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,500
 But in the old literature they just look like a baby just walking around.

449
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,460
 Which is ten times more terrifying than like a green goblin little monster running around.

450
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,860
 I'd be like, "Oh, that's a monster."

451
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,220
 If I saw a baby sneaking through my house I'd be like, "That is terrifying.

452
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,400
 That is the ghost of a human baby."

453
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,560
 But these guys have some very interesting weaknesses.

454
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,120
 So the main thing they were used for was theft.

455
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,200
 Now they have a fear of needles because they don't like to get poked, which is weird because

456
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,280
 they're ghosts.

457
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,200
 So you would put your money down and then you'd put needles underneath it.

458
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,160
 And then you'd wake up and your money would be there and you'd be like, "Oh, it protected-

459
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,160
 the needles protected my money from the toils."

460
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
 Problem is now when you go to get your own money you're like, "Ah-ha!

461
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,380
 My hand!

462
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,380
 Maybe I'm a toil as well."

463
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,140
 Also if you put your money on top of a mirror toils hate their own reflection.

464
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,900
 Which is also much safer than the needles.

465
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,940
 But anyways they would start to take the money off, they'd see the reflection and they'd

466
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
 run away.

467
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,620
 So that's a viable tactic.

468
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,240
 They're all- and I think this is the biggest problem with these guys.

469
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,460
 They are as smart as a baby.

470
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
 I.e.

471
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,980
 They're completely idiotic.

472
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,140
 Yeah, they can fly around, they can crush people's hearts and they can steal.

473
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,720
 But they're so dumb, if you want them to steal something, you have to show them what

474
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,340
 they are going to steal.

475
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,160
 So when I was reading up on this they said, "If you want them to steal $100, you have

476
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,040
 to show them $100 bill."

477
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,440
 If you already have a Rolex watch to show them, then you don't need that dude's Rolex watch.

478
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,360
 But the problem was the myth persisted because basically if someone became super rich in the

479
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,480
 community everyone else would think, "Oh, he must have a toil.

480
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,640
 He must be stealing it from other people."

481
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,420
 And also, how do you use a baby as a diagnostic tool if they're that stupid?

482
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,660
 You could take a one-year-old and show them someone who's been blown away by a landmine.

483
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,380
 Babies are not going to know what it is.

484
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,140
 They can't tell you that.

485
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,220
 You would have to show a baby what an inflamed liver looked like and then be like, "If you

486
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
 see this, let me know."

487
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,340
 And the baby's like, "Yeah, this doesn't make any sense."

488
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,540
 Well, I guess that's one actual medical school is.

489
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,860
 I guess they have to see an inflamed liver.

490
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,780
 Maybe doctors are as dumb as babies.

491
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,720
 But anyway, they're as stupid as babies, so that is a good defense against them.

492
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,920
 Also if you leave out marbles or beans, they'll actually come in your house and they'll see

493
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,600
 a bunch of marbles and they'll start playing with them and they'll forget why they were

494
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,280
 there and then eventually they'll just walk home.

495
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 They'll be like, "What was I doing there?

496
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
 I was playing with marbles."

497
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,080
 And then they go back home and they'll be like, "Hey, where's my $100 bill?"

498
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,240
 And the baby's like, "I don't know."

499
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,600
 Now again, you're just going to walk out.

500
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 You're going to wake up in the morning.

501
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,840
 You're still in a bunch of marbles, slip and fall on a pile of needles.

502
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,500
 So all of the tools, most of the tools to defeat them are actually not that handy to begin

503
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 with.

504
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,740
 But it got to the point where people began using, people began using toils to go in,

505
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,620
 this is actually quite ingenious.

506
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,980
 They would have ocean 11 style heists at casinos using ghost babies.

507
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,500
 Local gambling dens, not casinos, they didn't have all the bright lights because we're talking

508
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,700
 from about the 15th century to the modern day.

509
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,520
 Well, they have bright lights now over there, but it's not like they were like robbing

510
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
 Las Vegas.

511
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,440
 They'd have ocean 11 style heists with ghost babies or you would show up with your ghost

512
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:19,480
 baby because you can have such a loyal connection to your toil that you can communicate telepathically.

513
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,600
 So you would be gambling, you'd be playing cards and your ghost baby would be floating

514
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,000
 around the other people and be like telepathically saying, "Fold, fold, he has a full house.

515
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 He has a full house."

516
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,020
 But again, you'd have to show a baby all the combination of hands and stuff like that.

517
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,100
 But it got to the point where casinos then have to go to the shamans and order be like,

518
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,620
 "We need to be far past security."

519
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,180
 They'd just hire a bunch of ghost babies to hang out at their gambling den.

520
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,220
 So again, you have that escalation of warfare.

521
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,860
 If someone goes to gamble and they're winning too much, people are going to assume there's

522
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,880
 a ghost baby floating around.

523
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,500
 So then gamblers started bringing their own ghost babies and then the casino had to hire

524
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,700
 a bunch of their own ghost babies to hang out.

525
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,840
 They're working, they're walking around in the suits with little earpieces.

526
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,360
 They're monitoring all the cameras.

527
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,640
 They're like, "You've got to ghost baby in sector seven."

528
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,760
 So there's rules too for having these things.

529
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,800
 Toil rules that you have to follow otherwise bad things are going to happen.

530
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,520
 So even though they look like regular babies, they're very dangerous.

531
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,680
 They can have claws come out of their hands and like I said, they can fly into you and

532
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
 crush your heart.

533
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
 That's not really a rule.

534
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
 That's just in my notes there.

535
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,480
 I don't think I said that earlier.

536
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,940
 One of the rules is you've got to be aware of that.

537
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,180
 Toils are super jealous creatures.

538
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,900
 Especially if you have a baby on the way, they'll become more mischievous.

539
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,500
 So if you have a baby on the way, you have to be really careful around these guys and

540
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,380
 you always got to feed them like toast and milk every day.

541
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,000
 That's like their favorite meal.

542
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,700
 And if you leave fruit out for them, the fruit will spoil very quickly.

543
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,100
 That means the toil ate it.

544
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,460
 Like you obviously don't see a pear going little bites being taken out of it, but a

545
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,760
 toil will suck the essence out of a pear and rot very quickly.

546
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,400
 So if you have a baby on your way, you have to feed it extra.

547
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,680
 You got to let the toil know that he's still number one in your book.

548
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,240
 So there's 31 of these rules.

549
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,360
 We're obviously not going to go through all of them.

550
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,920
 One of them is you got to feed them blood on the 14th of every month.

551
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:20,080
 But and there's little disclaimer to this rule, it can't be blood on a sanitary napkin.

552
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,640
 That's a weird disclaimer.

553
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,660
 It seems so specific.

554
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,420
 It's not, it can't be period blood.

555
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,300
 I'm sorry, this sounds kind of gross, but it's not that it's like no period blood for

556
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,620
 this ghost baby.

557
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,620
 It just doesn't want period blood on a sanitary napkin or sanitary pad.

558
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
 So what?

559
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,540
 And nobody wants it.

560
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
 Nobody wants it.

561
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,260
 Why would you need that disclaimer?

562
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,460
 That's like saying don't get hit by a train.

563
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,740
 Yeah, of course, dude.

564
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,220
 Nobody, no, no, nobody wants a vampire to be like, no thanks.

565
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,920
 I'll come back a couple days from now.

566
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,640
 Another rule is you if the owner is a male, the toil can help you seduce women.

567
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
 No explanation for how that works.

568
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 Absolutely.

569
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
 I'm fascinated by that.

570
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,000
 You have a baby wingman floating around.

571
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,240
 I mean, I guess if the baby like was able to read her mind, you might help.

572
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,840
 It might be like what women want milk Gibson type of thing.

573
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,880
 But how do you, I mean, understand sometimes like if you have a puppy in your park, women

574
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
 are going to approach you.

575
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,700
 That's a big difference between carrying around a jar of corpsoil and having the ghost of

576
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,640
 an infant float around you.

577
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
 Not a good pickup tool.

578
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,120
 And it only works with dudes.

579
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,740
 So women can't use, there's actually a very specific rule with female toils.

580
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,540
 Because obviously, you know, there's female, human babies, male and female.

581
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,660
 A female toil are known to not be very good at all.

582
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,540
 Now this isn't, I'm not saying this.

583
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,460
 I'm sure that a female toil would be just as good as a male toil.

584
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,000
 I believe in equal opportunities for all ghost babies.

585
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,160
 But according to this belief system, female toils are terrible.

586
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,000
 They don't ever leave the house.

587
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 This isn't me guys.

588
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,920
 They don't ever leave the house.

589
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,520
 They're insanely jealous and they don't steal stuff.

590
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,800
 So you can't really get them to do anything.

591
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,680
 They kind of work as bodyguards, but they're weaker than the male toil.

592
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,240
 So they're just going to get wrecked anyways.

593
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,100
 And here's the phrase here.

594
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,300
 Due to their lack of usefulness and control issues, female toils are not common.

595
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,520
 So yeah, you can have a female toil, but there's no advantage to it.

596
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,820
 They're actually a disadvantage.

597
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,220
 Because they're going to get even more jealous when you have a kid.

598
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,280
 They're not going to do what you want.

599
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,780
 And they're just going to be a total nuisance.

600
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,580
 So if you wanted to, like, you could give one to an enemy, you're like, "Hey, I knew

601
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,980
 we had some problems in the past.

602
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
 Made you this."

603
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,120
 They're like, "Jar Corpse Oil," and they're like, "You didn't."

604
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,800
 And you're like, "I did.

605
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 You got your own toil."

606
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,520
 And if they have a little girl, goes, hops out, and she like, crosses her arms.

607
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,680
 She's on the phone all night.

608
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,080
 You're like, "Oh my God, please."

609
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,520
 Just like a super rebellious little girl floating around punk rock hair.

610
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,840
 There's like little biker toils, little tattoos coming in every night, bringing home the bad

611
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,760
 boys, the bad boys of the toil world.

612
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,440
 And you're like, "What did I do to deserve this?"

613
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,960
 Oh yeah, I crushed up a baby and turned it into a ghost.

614
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,660
 So the toils, because you have this close communication with them, and you've created

615
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,780
 this thing, a lot of families, because they've become powerful through their use of these

616
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,180
 ghost babies, they'll actually hand it down through the years.

617
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,460
 You have to be careful not to break the jars, because then they get really mad and you've

618
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,300
 got to hurry up and go back to the shop and get a new one made.

619
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,020
 So you have to put it in a place, because so you have to put it in a place that's not

620
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,380
 going to get knocked over and spilled Corpse Oil, all of your brand new stolen rug.

621
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:44,640
 But at a certain point, you may decide I'm done with the toil.

622
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,200
 It's time for me to just get rid of it.

623
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,960
 It's been a bad influence on me.

624
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,520
 I have all the stolen stuff and I feel bad about it.

625
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,240
 I've killed a couple of people and I feel bad about that.

626
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,640
 It's time to let the toil go.

627
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,800
 Now, like I said, there's 31 rules and we've gone over a couple of them.

628
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,280
 Rule 31 is if the toil knows that the owner is planning to destroy it, it will make sure

629
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,940
 that the owner dies together with it.

630
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,180
 So it's a cursed item, really.

631
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,660
 Like once you create it, you are bonded with it for life.

632
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,540
 Your family is, you can hand it down throughout the generations, but you have to take care

633
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
 of it.

634
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
 You have to feed it.

635
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,180
 You have to keep it away from sanitary napkins.

636
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,420
 It's going to get jealous.

637
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,500
 It can turn against you and start creating havoc in your own house.

638
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,140
 People have tried dropping them off overseas and the baby swims through the ocean.

639
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,720
 Actually, what they said is that when you drop it off overseas, the toil will crawl in the

640
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,240
 luggage of people and then they'll go to where you're at and then it'll crawl out of the

641
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
 luggage.

642
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,280
 So it doesn't even need a swimmer, which makes sense because they're babies.

643
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,500
 And if you decide you're just going to smash it, destroy the vase, destroy the little effigy

644
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,760
 inside, it can read your mind when you're thinking that and it will make sure that you

645
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,120
 die with it.

646
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,820
 The toil is a weapon and it's just part of a magical arms race.

647
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,940
 Somebody wanted an advantage in a battle and they did whatever it took to get it.

648
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,700
 And then long after the smoke and fire of that war ended, people still saw that they

649
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,780
 could use these creatures for their own gain.

650
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,460
 These creatures became an everyday occurrence, something to be afraid of and something to

651
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,280
 own to protect you from other people's bad intentions.

652
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,080
 In 2006, there's a story of a fisherman who was fishing out in the area and he pulled

653
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,580
 up a small vase.

654
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,880
 I didn't know what it was.

655
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,160
 When he opened it up, there was a little statue in it and then he knew exactly what it was

656
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,760
 and it filled him with dread.

657
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,680
 So these things still are being used today.

658
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,040
 Are they real?

659
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,540
 Probably not.

660
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,480
 But the fear of them is.

661
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,480
 It's a good way to explain things like sudden heart attacks, missing items.

662
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,100
 It's also a way to make you feel peaceful at home knowing that that little vase on your

663
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:15,800
 shelf is giving you some sense of protection from the darkness of the outside world.

664
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,960
 But whether or not the spirits themselves are real is really not the point.

665
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,560
 The practice itself is.

666
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:34,180
 And even today, there are shamans going through cemeteries, digging up baby body parts to

667
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,560
 engage in centuries old black magic.

668
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:49,780
 The ghosts of a baby is supernatural, but the people who practice it are truly inhuman.
