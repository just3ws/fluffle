1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 A prospector finds a mysterious rock, an Uber driver pulls up to Walmart to pick up his

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,440
 latest ride, and two friends and their dog are on a trip to Yellowstone Park.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,280
 What do all of these stories have in common?

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,840
 They're incredibly terrifying to me and scare me to death today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:32,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,680
 A little asterisk next to that one.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,920
 I really do hope you guys are having a great day.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,320
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, HotDiggityDane.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,840
 HotDiggityDane, thank you so much for supporting the show.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
 Sorry for that long pause.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
 I do thank you.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
 I'm just thinking of that Mickey Mouse Club song.

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,520
 I can't say HotDang, HotDiggityDane.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,280
 I don't know the song apparently, but you know what I'm talking about.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,800
 I mean, assuming you're six years old and you're listening to this podcast, HotDogHotDogHotDiggityDog,

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,640
 that's the song.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,680
 That was a waste of 30 seconds of my podcast.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
 If you can't celebrate the Patreon though, that's okay too.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,960
 Just help get the word out about the show.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,160
 That also helps a lot.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,960
 Now HotDiggityDane, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,360
 We're gonna go for a little drive to Skokie, Illinois.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,120
 On Mondays, you don't have to listen to Monday's episode to get this one, but on Monday's episode,

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,120
 I did a segment on intrusive thoughts.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,520
 Those are thoughts that pop in our head.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,600
 They're totally unwanted.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,160
 We would never act on them, but they're scary.

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,800
 We go, "Why am I thinking about pushing my mom off a cliff?

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
 I love my mom."

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
 Also, there's no cliffs around, so it's not physically possible, but you're sitting next

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,000
 to your loved one.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,920
 You think about doing them harm or saying something really rude to them, or you think

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,000
 about self-harm, or you think about robbing a bank.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,120
 And sometimes it can get to the point where you stop going to banks because you're afraid

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
 you might rob one.

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
 Even though you would never do it.

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,280
 You don't own any of the tools.

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
 You're not a fan of the movie Heat.

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
 You wouldn't do it.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 Point is intrusive thought.

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
 Something you wouldn't act on, but your brain's putting the thought in your head.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,400
 And everybody gets them.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,680
 And I discussed some of my intrusive thoughts on that episode.

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,480
 I thought it would be "fun" to find some stories that actually are related to intrusive thoughts

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
 I've had.

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,640
 So if you haven't listened to Money's episode, that's totally fine, but we'll be talking

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
 about, I'll explain them, because some of you are like, "What?

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
 Why are you afraid of that?

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
 I'll kind of explain it."

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,160
 So, hot-digity Dane, we're driving out to Skokie, Illinois.

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,240
 It's May 30th, 2017.

57
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,440
 It's about 5 a.m. and the Jason Jalopy's sitting outside of a Walmart in Skokie, Illinois.

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,920
 Hot-digity Dane goes, "Hey, can I go in and buy some groceries?"

59
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,640
 And I'm like, "Whatever you do, do not leave this car, because I know what's going to happen."

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,680
 We're sitting there and we see a car pull up to the front of Walmart.

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,640
 That is driven by Grant Nelson.

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,720
 He's a 34-year-old Uber driver.

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,480
 And he had just gotten a call, an Uber request, to pick up a 16-year-old girl named Eliza

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
 Wozny.

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,520
 So, he sees this young girl walk out of Walmart and get into his Uber.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,440
 He starts to drive away.

67
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,800
 Within two minutes of that car leaving Walmart, Eliza pulls out a machete and a knife and

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
 begins attacking Grant Nelson.

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,600
 When police looked at the video footage, when they were trying to piece this whole thing

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,320
 together, they know that she was in Walmart.

71
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,920
 So they're watching the video footage at Walmart and they see this 16-year-old girl walk into

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
 this 24-hour Walmart.

73
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,720
 This is a great product placement for Walmart, right?

74
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,200
 I've said their name like 10 times.

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
 I'm sure they're going to love this episode.

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,760
 He had a call from CEO later on.

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,240
 The Eliza Watkins walked into your local neighborhood, Walmart.

78
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,200
 She walks to the sporting goods section, gets a knife, gets a machete, which they sell right

79
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,360
 off the rack, right?

80
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,520
 You can just go up and you can just pick them up off the rack.

81
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
 They're not locked up.

82
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,320
 Walks out of Walmart, steals them.

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,640
 Someone might have questioned her, right?

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,600
 10-year-old girl's trying to buy two edged weapons at 5 a.m.

85
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,680
 Someone might have said, "Hey, don't do that.

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,160
 Or can I see your ID?"

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
 Or "You're not a murderer.

88
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
 Are you?"

89
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,080
 They have a little pop-up button like when you buy cigarettes.

90
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,560
 Are you over 18?

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,000
 Are you a murderer?

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,680
 She walks out, shoplifts these weapons.

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,640
 And then I'm assuming in some way concealed them as Grant Nelson was pulling up.

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,920
 She did it literally while she was waiting for the Uber.

95
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,360
 So she called him to meet her there when he got the weapons and then as she was coming

96
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
 out the car pulled up.

97
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,040
 I'm assuming she had them concealed in some way because you're not going to let anyone

98
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
 in your car if they're carrying just one of those two, right?

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
 You're like, "Huh, a knife, but luckily no machete.

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
 Hop on in, ma'am."

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,800
 She must have had them in like a backpack or something like that.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,240
 Big jacket, I don't know.

103
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,280
 But anyways, so she walks out and gets in the car with Grant.

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,240
 She begins attacking Grant. He gets all cut up in his face and his neck and his chest.

105
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,920
 He eventually is able to get out of his car and he's running through this neighborhood.

106
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,000
 Again, it's very early in the morning and there's a condo building and he runs up to

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,640
 the lobby and he's banging on the door screaming out for help.

108
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,240
 They call authorities.

109
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,760
 As the rescue personnel gets there, they actually follow a trail of blood from the street across

110
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,680
 the grass into the lobby of the condo building.

111
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
 Car is gone.

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,720
 And now the police are looking for the car.

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,560
 They actually find it a couple blocks away.

114
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,120
 It was crashed.

115
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
 So the cops find this car that's been crashed.

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,640
 No one is in the car.

117
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,960
 But Grant's cell phone is there.

118
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,400
 And right on the cell phone, it shows that he had picked up a fare just a couple minutes

119
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
 ago under the name Eliza Wozny.

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
 The cops are now looking for her.

121
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,480
 They find her hiding behind an office building covered in blood, still gripping her knife

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
 in machete.

123
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,320
 Grant Nelson died the next day.

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
 He didn't make it.

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,200
 I mean, he was pretty badly injured.

126
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,480
 The cops ask Eliza why she did it and she's like, "I don't know.

127
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,160
 I don't know why I did it."

128
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
 And they're like, "You obviously had this plan.

129
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
 You went into Walmart.

130
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,280
 You shopped, lived through this stuff and you called the Uber driver.

131
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
 Why would you do it?"

132
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
 She's like, "I don't know.

133
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
 I don't know why I did it."

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,360
 Fast forward three years later, August 2020.

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,640
 This recently just had a new development.

136
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,720
 She sentenced to 27 years for murder.

137
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,600
 A 16-year-old girl is now going to be in prison for 27 years.

138
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,800
 Lawyers ask, "Why'd you do it?"

139
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,880
 Judge asks, "Why you do it?"

140
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,000
 Psychologists ask, "Why you do it?"

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
 Every time she answers the same thing.

142
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,480
 I don't know.

143
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,360
 That terrifies me at the most core level of my being.

144
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
 That was one of my intrusive thoughts, was people just snapping.

145
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
 I've never, ever snapped.

146
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,400
 I've been in a lot of fights and I talked about this.

147
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,320
 I've been in a lot of fights in my life from about age six to about 36.

148
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,800
 I was always getting in fistfights.

149
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,840
 I've been in fights my entire life.

150
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,920
 Then I ran out of people to fight when I moved.

151
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
 I no longer lived in bad neighborhoods.

152
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 I don't fight anymore.

153
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,680
 Then I go start doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu and stuff like that.

154
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
 That's fine.

155
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,520
 Maybe not if you're anti-street fighting, which is how I engage the knit for 30 years

156
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,480
 of my life, but I've never lost control.

157
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,400
 I've never, ever lost control.

158
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,880
 The idea of people snapping and losing control and not knowing why they do something terrifies

159
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
 me.

160
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,200
 Because I always think, "Well, if that happened to them, what if it could happen to me?"

161
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,640
 But you have to think like, obviously there's stuff like chemicals sometimes involved, falling

162
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,280
 into a vat of chemicals and becoming a joker.

163
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
 Sometimes there's drugs involved, alcoholism involved.

164
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,720
 Sometimes you can look at supernatural causes like demon possession.

165
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,960
 Those stories really scare me because it's about losing control.

166
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 I don't drink.

167
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
 I don't do drugs.

168
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,640
 I drink super rarely, super, super rarely.

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,760
 Couple times a year maybe.

170
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,560
 And I'll drink a beer and I'll be like, "Oh, that's it.

171
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
 That's it.

172
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
 My vision's getting hazy.

173
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
 I'm not in control anymore."

174
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:12,280
 I think I have OCD from my fear of alcohol equals alcoholism and alcoholism equals losing

175
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
 control.

176
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
 It's this whole thing.

177
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,240
 I did talk about it in a lot of the Monday episode, but you didn't have to listen to that

178
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
 episode.

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,320
 But the idea, that stuff scares me, but the idea of somebody just one day waking up and

180
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,960
 deciding to murder somebody absolutely terrifies me.

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,920
 It terrifies me on two levels.

182
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,360
 One of thinking, "Could that happen to me?"

183
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,840
 Now, this person may have had a lifelong mental illnesses, but they don't, I mean, again,

184
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
 there's no, they look at all the paperwork.

185
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,840
 They're like, "We don't know why she didn't."

186
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 It wasn't even like I wanted to know what it was like to kill someone.

187
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,960
 That stupid edge lord excuse.

188
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,840
 It's just she never reveals it.

189
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,240
 It's spooky, man.

190
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,760
 It's also scary for the victims, right?

191
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,240
 I could be on the other side of the coin.

192
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,840
 I could be like, "I'm totally calm and peaceful."

193
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,800
 "Oh, lookit, there's a 16-year-old girl walking by this coffee shop."

194
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,320
 And then I just get chopped up, dude.

195
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,320
 That's actually to me less scary, because I think I could take her.

196
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 Not in a car.

197
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,160
 See, your defensive options are really limited in a car, but, oh man, I don't think I could

198
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,400
 be an Uber driver.

199
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,320
 We were always told not to pick up strangers and stuff like that.

200
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,160
 And now we, most people have jobs where they do it.

201
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,080
 Taxi cabs have kind of done that.

202
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,520
 Actually, that's the definition of a taxi cab.

203
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,840
 They're like seasoned veterans of the taxi industry.

204
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,680
 I think that's the thing, right?

205
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,640
 Or did I just make up that stereotype?

206
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,960
 It's a generational thing.

207
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
 It's passed down.

208
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,120
 Fathers are talking to their little sons.

209
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,880
 It's a dirty world out there.

210
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
 Sometimes streets gotta get cleaned.

211
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,760
 They're showing them this documentary about taxi driving called Taxi Driver.

212
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,320
 This is your life now, son.

213
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
 So both of those, that scares me on just a core level.

214
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,640
 That idea of being able to snap like that.

215
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
 Because I've never done that.

216
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,880
 I've never, I've gotten mad obviously before and I've been thinking, dude, I'm about to

217
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,680
 knock this dude out.

218
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,520
 But, I'll always try to use my words first.

219
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,920
 And I've never gotten so mad that I've acted out physically.

220
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
 Never.

221
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,480
 I've gotten so mad that I've punched somebody out of anger.

222
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,200
 It's always out of this situation.

223
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,320
 The talking has ended.

224
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,800
 This situation now has only one way to be resolved.

225
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,720
 It's very, very calm.

226
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,920
 Because people who get mad and fight lose fights.

227
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,040
 And that was an early, early lesson I learned.

228
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,520
 Actually, now that I say that, when I was a little, this is funny, in a little self therapy,

229
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,840
 when I was a little kid, I would, you get so mad, I would start fighting other little

230
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
 kids.

231
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,680
 And I wonder if that, I wonder, and I stopped doing that because I was constantly losing

232
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,120
 fights.

233
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
 When you're, I was a big kid too, so I was strong.

234
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,880
 But if you get mad during the fight, you lose.

235
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
 If you're calm during the fight, you have a better chance of winning.

236
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
 It's not guaranteed obviously.

237
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,640
 I'm not saying if you're calm, you pick a fight with Mike Tyson, you're like, "Oh, I

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
 got this guys.

239
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
 I've been drinking green tea all day."

240
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
 It's still a risk.

241
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,120
 But it's a more calculated risk.

242
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,920
 So anyways, the idea of losing control terrifies me.

243
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,680
 Maybe that's why I was never a fan of the Incredible Hulk as well.

244
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,360
 Let's go ahead and move on our next story.

245
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,520
 Hot Diggity Dane, we are going to hop in a new vehicle I just invented.

246
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,640
 The Wabbit Wagon.

247
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,120
 It's an old stagecoach with horses and stuff like that.

248
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,000
 Hot Diggity Dane's like, "Dang it dude, this vehicle sucks.

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,080
 It's super slow and I gotta feed the horses."

250
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
 I'm like, "Ah, they're cool.

251
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,240
 Just feed them a couple of carrots.

252
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,400
 Make sure they don't bite your fingers off."

253
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,160
 The reason why we have the Wabbit Wagon is because we are, that's so stupid.

254
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,760
 The reason why we have that is we're going back in time.

255
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,200
 Let's go back to the year 1858.

256
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 We're back in time.

257
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,040
 We're riding the CPI colored wagon down a dusty trail.

258
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,480
 I found this story from an article called "When Giants Roamed the Earth" by Mark Rose.

259
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,840
 We're going to talk more about the main point of that article in a separate episode because

260
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,120
 I think it's pretty fascinating.

261
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,880
 We've covered giants before, but this kind of has a unique view on them.

262
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,240
 But in this article he starts talking about how for a while there was the stories going

263
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
 around of people.

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
 I don't want to give away the Indian.

265
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
 I don't want to give away the Indian.

266
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,000
 So anyways, Mark Rose talks about in 1858 the Alta California newspaper gets a letter

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,360
 from Friedrich Leichenberg M.D.

268
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,840
 So this German doctor writes this letter in "Dear Alta California Newspaper, let me tell

269
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,520
 you the story about a prospector and a dangerous thing that once happened."

270
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:29,240
 Then he puts dot, dot, dot, and then he puts in parentheses wiggly lines as we flash back.

271
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,200
 We're going to meet a prospector.

272
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
 His name is Ernest Fluchterspiegel.

273
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 And Ernest is away from the work camp one day.

274
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,680
 He's doing what he does best, finding gold.

275
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,280
 Actually, if I think about it, if he was the best at finding gold, he probably wouldn't

276
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
 be working anymore.

277
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,360
 He probably would have found enough to not have to work.

278
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
 But anyways, he's looking for gold.

279
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,280
 He's walking around with his pickaxe and other stereotypical prospector stuff.

280
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,360
 He has like a pan full of water and he has like clothes on.

281
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,440
 You know, I'm sure they weren't naked out there.

282
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,160
 He finds this geode as he's looking for gold.

283
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 What?

284
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
 Intarnation is this.

285
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
 This is one of them rocks.

286
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
 You crack open.

287
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,840
 It's all pretty inside, he says.

288
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,920
 In an oddly southern accent considering he's a German immigrant, he takes the geode and

289
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,800
 he does what we all do with geodes.

290
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,000
 He breaks it open.

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
 I've actually never had that.

292
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
 I've never been able to do that.

293
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,360
 I always thought it would be pretty awesome.

294
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,680
 But I guess I could just go buy one and just smash it on the ground and be like, "Oh, it's

295
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
 okay."

296
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,440
 And he breaks it open and it's beautiful crystal inside, makes him go, "Ooh."

297
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,520
 But there's something else going on with this geode.

298
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,440
 There's a half pint of liquid inside of it.

299
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,840
 It's like, "What?

300
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
 Intarnation?"

301
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,400
 So he touches the liquid.

302
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
 Hmm.

303
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
 That's what I thought.

304
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
 It was a liquid.

305
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 My observation was correct.

306
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
 Now, if you came across a strange liquid, let's say you walked into your house tomorrow.

307
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,320
 You saw a rock sitting in your fridge and it was full of liquid.

308
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,240
 You might drink it, right?

309
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
 You might.

310
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,880
 You might think, "Oh, I don't remember leaving that five million year old rock in my fridge,

311
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,080
 but here it is.

312
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,760
 Everything in my fridge is edible," you say as you're eating a milk carton.

313
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,960
 He takes this rock full of a half pint of clear liquid and he drinks it.

314
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,200
 He starts walking back to base camp and he's like, "I've done a lot of bad things in my

315
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
 life.

316
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,640
 I'm starting to think I shouldn't have drank that fluid.

317
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,760
 I think that might be the ultimate regret."

318
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,320
 As he's walking to base camp, he starts to feel some pain.

319
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,680
 "Oh, my stomach.

320
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,080
 Oh, man.

321
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:45,080
 After a hard day's work, I wouldn't expect my stomach to hurt."

322
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,480
 That's a little bit of foreshadowing.

323
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,440
 He's like, "Oh," and then he keeps walking.

324
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,960
 He's like, "Oh, man, my feet feel so heavy."

325
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,520
 I think I've run out of puns.

326
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
 He gets to the base camp.

327
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
 That was it.

328
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
 That was the only two we could come up with.

329
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,840
 It was like a five mile journey.

330
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,360
 He's thinking, "Uh, do I rocks in my socks?

331
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
 Is that a pun?

332
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
 No.

333
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 Rocks in my brain?

334
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
 I don't know.

335
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,160
 Anyways, he can't come up with any either."

336
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,560
 By the time he gets to base camp, he's walking super stiff.

337
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,160
 People think it's Frankenstein attack, but it's not.

338
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,480
 It's just this guy, Ernest, walking up to them.

339
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,840
 And he's like, "Guys, guys, help me, help me."

340
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,280
 I think I'm turning into a rock.

341
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
 And they're like, "What?

342
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,720
 Which would be the only way to react to that?"

343
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,240
 So hey, Jerry, how's it going?

344
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,320
 Oh, it's going great, but I might be turning into a stalactite.

345
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
 What?

346
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,800
 So anyways, he's walking all stiff and he's like, "Oh, I drank this geode juice."

347
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,200
 Which again, Alyssa, what?

348
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,640
 I drank this geode juice and ever since then, everything in me is getting hard and stiff.

349
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 Dang it.

350
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 Why didn't I have an erection joke?

351
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
 Because it's fine.

352
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,720
 The moment's passed.

353
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,520
 He's like, "Ahh!"

354
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,440
 And he starts complaining about pain in his epigastric region and his left hypochondriac

355
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
 region, which I thought, "Those are fake.

356
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
 Those are real places.

357
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,000
 Your left hypochondriac is where your spleen is.

358
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Weird.

359
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
 Epigastric is your stomach and all that stuff."

360
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
 He's like, "Ahh!

361
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 My epigastric!"

362
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,640
 They're looking up a medical dictionary.

363
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,440
 They're like, "Oh, his stomach hurts."

364
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,560
 He's like, "Ahh!"

365
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,760
 And then eventually, they can see his skin actually turning to mineral.

366
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,800
 He died a very agonizing death.

367
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,040
 He turned into a rock.

368
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,200
 And then in the bizarre turn of events, I don't know why they would do this, obviously they

369
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
 watched this guy turn into a rock.

370
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
 That's his cause of death, right?

371
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
 He's a rock now.

372
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,600
 He's not alive.

373
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,240
 They do an autopsy on him.

374
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,120
 They get a doctor to show up to do an autopsy and he's like, "Guys, you could have told

375
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
 me he was a rock."

376
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,760
 And he brought all of his medical supplies.

377
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
 He has a scalpel.

378
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,000
 He's like, "I gotta go back home."

379
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,920
 He comes back with a chisel and a mallet.

380
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,000
 They eventually do an autopsy on this guy.

381
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,240
 When they chisel his chest apart, his heart is now just a solid piece of red jasper rock.

382
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
 Spooky.

383
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,200
 You're like, "It's not really spooky, Jason."

384
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,640
 It's a guy who drank juice out of a rock and became a rock.

385
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,400
 It's not really bone chilling.

386
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,640
 Well, if you'll remember my Monday episode, one of the weird intrusive thoughts that I've

387
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,880
 had was, "I wanna eat.

388
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,600
 I wanna eat if I go into a Wiccan magic store and I see it's super specific.

389
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,120
 If I go into like a magic supply store, if I see polished rocks, I wanna swallow them.

390
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,560
 I don't want to swallow them.

391
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,400
 I don't want to swallow them.

392
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
 But my brain goes, "Dude, you totally wanna swallow those things, don't you?"

393
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 And I'd be like, "No, I don't."

394
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
 And they're like, "Yeah, you do.

395
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 Come on."

396
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,880
 And they didn't swallow at least one of them.

397
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
 They totally wouldn't hurt you.

398
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,380
 I never have.

399
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,640
 That's the thing with an intrusive thought.

400
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,440
 It makes you think like, "Oh, I wanna just yell at this person.

401
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,240
 They're irritating me so much."

402
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
 But then you're like, "No, this person I really love a lot.

403
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,080
 Why am I having these negative thoughts about a person that I love and care about?"

404
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,120
 It's like that with me and magical rocks.

405
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,280
 I don't know where it came from.

406
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,920
 I remember the first time it happened I was at a magical supply store buying books or

407
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
 tarot cards or something like that.

408
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
 And I was like, "Oh, dude, those rocks, you should eat those rocks.

409
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,040
 I'm just super bizarre."

410
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,560
 And it happened every single time I went into that store.

411
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,520
 And then I would go into other magical supply stores and I would see a bunch of rocks and

412
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,080
 I'd be like, "I don't wanna eat those."

413
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,560
 But see, it would become...

414
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,480
 See, here's the thing because I think I already mentioned this.

415
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,320
 If you let the intrusive thought grow and grow, it becomes OCD, it becomes obsessive-compulsive

416
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
 disorder.

417
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
 So you'll have...

418
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,040
 There is a possibility where I say, "I don't go into magic stores anymore."

419
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,840
 One, because it's a waste of money, but two, you're afraid if you go in there you're gonna

420
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
 swallow rocks.

421
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,320
 I never have and I actually just kept going to the stores.

422
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
 It was basically like...

423
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,920
 And I kept spending my money.

424
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,720
 But it was one of those things like I could have developed a fear of magic witchcraft

425
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,360
 stores and had more money or I could have just said, "It's just a stupid thought.

426
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,600
 I would never actually do that.

427
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,160
 I didn't know what the term was back then.

428
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 I know now it's an intrusive thought."

429
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,840
 The story is super spooky to me because it involves a guy ingesting a rock.

430
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,640
 It involves a guy finding a beautiful rock and wanting to swallow it.

431
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,200
 Now this one was just the juice, but that's a matter of semantics.

432
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
 Like, it's rocks.

433
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,240
 It's rocks all the way down.

434
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,440
 This story, I shouldn't have to add to this point, the story is cool as it is.

435
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
 It's totally fake.

436
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,720
 It's a fake story.

437
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
 It was a joke.

438
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,120
 The doctor didn't exist.

439
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
 The dude didn't exist.

440
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
 I knew that when I was reading the story.

441
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,920
 That's why I thought Epigastric and Left Hypocondria Act.

442
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,160
 I thought those were terms that the fake doctor was using to see if the editor of the newspaper

443
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
 was smart enough.

444
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,680
 Those are actual terms.

445
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,400
 But the story never happened.

446
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,440
 It was a story that doctor didn't exist, earnest, flikal, spygol or whatever his name was.

447
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
 It doesn't matter.

448
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
 I'm not insulting him.

449
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
 He's a fictional character.

450
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
 It doesn't exist.

451
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,540
 There was a time.

452
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
 You can do it these days.

453
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
 You can do it these days.

454
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,720
 It's still absolutely hilarious.

455
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,400
 There was a time where it was all the rage to make up new stories about petrified people.

456
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
 Mark Twain did it.

457
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,680
 Mark Twain, Master Troll did it.

458
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
 And make up stories about giants.

459
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,400
 There's a lot of people saying, "Oh, I found a giant."

460
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
 It was totally made up.

461
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,520
 It was totally made up.

462
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,720
 Not all giant skeletons were fictional, but most of them were.

463
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 Most of them were.

464
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,120
 There are stories about giant skeletons going way back into antiquity.

465
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,360
 And we'll cover some of those too.

466
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,860
 But this was fake.

467
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,860
 And most of the stories when people go, "Oh, there's reports of giants in the 1850s.

468
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
 They were just fake."

469
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,820
 Yellow journalism is the term.

470
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,460
 But still, I saw this story and I was like, "Yeah, stupid.

471
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
 Too many."

472
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,020
 What are the chances of me coming across the story where a dude eats a rock?

473
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,500
 Again, I was researching something else and found this story and I go, "There we go.

474
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,060
 That goes in my bone chilling episode that everyone else is like, "Dude, that's obviously

475
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
 fake."

476
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,200
 Also, this isn't an intrusive thought, but I also have a fear of becoming a statue or

477
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
 a tree.

478
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,120
 Like, ever since I was a little kid, I saw an episode of Doctor Who, which apparently

479
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,600
 never existed.

480
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,440
 I saw an episode of Doctor Who.

481
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,880
 I think I've talked about this before.

482
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,320
 When I was a kid, my dad watched a ton of sci-fi.

483
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,440
 We watched an episode of Doctor Who and it was like four or five different doctors.

484
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,840
 It was the first -- this was like in the '80s, 'cause I'm like 43.

485
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,560
 It was like the first couple doctors.

486
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,000
 It was the first time that multiple doctors had been in a show together and the bad guy

487
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,140
 was trying to find the secret to immortality and all the doctors were trying to stop him

488
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,660
 'cause this guy couldn't have that ability.

489
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,820
 They're like, "That's only for us.

490
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,620
 That's only for us, Doctor Who."

491
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,860
 And he ends up getting to this alien layer and he finds out that the secret to immortality

492
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,900
 is he becomes a statue, a sentient statue frozen in place forever.

493
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,980
 He'll never die now.

494
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,940
 But they show him freezing and he's screaming, "No, no, this isn't what I meant.

495
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,020
 I should have read the fine print.

496
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,740
 No!"

497
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,720
 And the four or five doctors, whoever was there, looked at him and they just walked away.

498
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,920
 Like they weren't gonna rescue this dude.

499
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,360
 He was trapped until the end of time, until the heat death of the universe.

500
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,440
 He would be a statue frozen in place.

501
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,880
 His mind still thinks, but his eyes shut.

502
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,280
 His soul trapped in cement.

503
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,560
 I had to have been -- that was probably like in the mid '80s, '86, '80s.

504
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 I would have been like 10, 11 years old.

505
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,440
 Absolutely terrified me and I've tried looking for that.

506
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,460
 Probably that movie's never existed.

507
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,020
 I've even talked about it on this show and I've had some of you guys try to go, "Was

508
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
 this it?

509
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
 Was this it?"

510
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
 No.

511
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
 It never existed.

512
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
 Childhood fear of mine, even to this day.

513
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,500
 He turned it into a statue and now we got this guy drinking a geode.

514
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,460
 It's like two things combined into one.

515
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
 Hot Diggity Dane.

516
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,540
 Hot Diggity Dane is like, "Seriously dude?

517
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
 This is the episode I'm in.

518
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,380
 The episode where you keep going.

519
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
 Oh, that's spooky."

520
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,900
 It's a fake letter, but a guy who turned into a statue.

521
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,240
 But Hot Diggity Dane is a trooper just like the rest of you.

522
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,280
 We got one more of these to cover.

523
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,040
 Let's hop in that Carbentercopter.

524
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 Hot Diggity Dane.

525
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,600
 We are leaving behind old, timey California.

526
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,240
 We are headed out to Yellowstone National Park.

527
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,600
 Helicopter is flying over the vents.

528
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,040
 It's July 20th, 1981.

529
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,280
 David Allen Kerwin.

530
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
 He's 24 years old.

531
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,960
 And his friend Ronald Ratliff are driving around and they say, "Hey, let's swing by

532
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
 Yellowstone.

533
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
 They're on a road trip.

534
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
 Let's swing by Yellowstone.

535
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,260
 Let's go see what all this hot water is all about."

536
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,700
 We don't have that where we live.

537
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,820
 It's all cold water.

538
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,300
 And Ratliff's dog, Moosey, is also there.

539
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,380
 So they got their dog in the back of the truck.

540
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,100
 These two guys pull up to the Celestine Pool.

541
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:47,620
 The pickup truck stops and they open the doors and Moosey jumps out of the car and starts

542
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,620
 running.

543
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,940
 That's what dogs will do, right?

544
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,340
 Most dogs won't do this though.

545
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:58,360
 He then jumped into Celestine Pool, 200 degrees Fahrenheit boiling water.

546
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,560
 Because the elevation of water boils at like 190 or something up there.

547
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
 So that's horrible, right?

548
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,840
 But that's not the end of the story.

549
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,080
 Ronald and David pursue the dog and they get to the pool and the dog is in the boiling

550
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
 water.

551
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,520
 Now it's a middle of the day.

552
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,080
 There's a bunch of people there and everyone's freaking out about what's going on.

553
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,580
 But then something happens that makes everyone's attention turn from the dog to David.

554
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,860
 David begins to motion like he's going to jump into the pool of boiling water to save

555
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,100
 the dog.

556
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,780
 Onlookers begin screaming and "Don't do it!

557
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,140
 Don't do it!"

558
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,580
 And he's taken a couple steps back like he's going to run and jump.

559
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,580
 And Ronald turns to his friend and says "Don't do it.

560
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,820
 Don't go in there."

561
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,920
 And David says "Like hell I won't."

562
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,880
 And he jumps head first into the boiling water.

563
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,640
 I mentioned on Monday's episode this weird thing about pouring boiling water on myself.

564
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
 I've never done it.

565
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,720
 I would never want to do it.

566
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,080
 When I'm boiling water I think "Oh, I just poured on my head."

567
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,160
 Intrusive thought.

568
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,240
 If someone else poured it on me, I'm not going to have a great day, but that doesn't scare

569
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
 me.

570
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,320
 And like I said, if someone forces me to pour it on me, it doesn't bug me either.

571
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,520
 It has to be a, it's a weird quirk.

572
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,540
 It has to be me willingly pouring boiling water on myself.

573
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,500
 Very bizarre thing.

574
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,580
 So he jumps into the boiling water.

575
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
 It's so funny.

576
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,700
 I knew this story by heart.

577
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,740
 I went and got a single source for this story.

578
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,900
 I knew this story by heart.

579
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,500
 I'd read it years ago.

580
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,660
 I really didn't even, I'm not even looking at my notes other than to remember the dude's

581
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,700
 names and the dates.

582
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,820
 I remember everything about the story from the time I read it because it terrified me.

583
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,340
 He jumps into the boiling water and the people are now speechless.

584
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,160
 Nobody knows what's going to happen next.

585
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,420
 And they see Ronald.

586
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,180
 He swims through the water and he grabs Moosey.

587
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,820
 He gets a hold of the dog.

588
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,520
 But then David goes underwater, completely underwater.

589
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,360
 And then they see the dog start to drift away.

590
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,060
 So they realize that he's no longer holding onto the dog.

591
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,200
 He's most likely dead at this point.

592
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,280
 David resurfaces though and he's swimming, swimming through this boiling water.

593
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,960
 He gets to the shore.

594
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
 He can't get out of the water completely.

595
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,900
 Ronald runs over to help him out.

596
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,620
 Ronald actually gets second degree burns on his feet from the scalding water.

597
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,500
 They pull David out and he says, "That was stupid.

598
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,860
 How bad am I?

599
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,020
 That was a stupid thing I did."

600
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,400
 He's completely blind.

601
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,420
 He can't see what's going on with his body.

602
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,500
 And his burns are so intense, he can't feel anything either.

603
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,840
 He has suffered third degree burns over 100% of his body.

604
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,560
 That's your butthole is burned.

605
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,160
 That's the inside of your nostrils burned.

606
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,400
 That's every single inch of his body was completely blistered and peeling.

607
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,940
 The muscles had started to cook.

608
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,960
 One of the people decided, I don't know what was going through this shoe's head, right?

609
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,520
 They just pulled this guy out of boiling water.

610
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
 Someone goes, "Take your shoes off.

611
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 Take your shoes off."

612
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
 Maybe he had Air Jordans on.

613
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
 They didn't want to ruin them or something like that.

614
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:12,460
 One of these rescuers takes one of his shoes off and all the skin of his feet just come

615
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,500
 out with the shoe.

616
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,580
 It just is like when you cook tomato soup and it skims on the top, except he was the

617
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
 tomato.

618
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
 You get it.

619
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
 You get it.

620
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,740
 I don't think I needed an analogy for that.

621
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,100
 It's like when you make nacho cheese, right?

622
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,580
 But you just take one chip and all the cheese comes off of that one chip.

623
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
 Probably wasn't a smart thing.

624
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,280
 I don't know what he was thinking to take off this dude's shoe.

625
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,720
 I hope he stopped at the one shoe.

626
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,960
 I hope he didn't go, "Oh, that was disgusting, but maybe the other shoe isn't so gross."

627
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
 Now let's take off his jacket.

628
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,920
 Like I mean, that guy's obviously boiled alive.

629
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,240
 They take him to the hospital.

630
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
 He dies the next day.

631
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,680
 The dog dies as well.

632
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,960
 Apparently, this is a common thing.

633
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,920
 Not super common, but dogs are constantly jumping into the water.

634
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,000
 That's like a, I guess dogs are just stupid.

635
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
 Just dogs are just dumb.

636
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,460
 You never hear of a cat jumping into a hot spring.

637
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:11,620
 But that story, I remember reading that story years ago and I was like, "Uhhh."

638
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,660
 Again, I mean, I get it.

639
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,500
 You wanting to, first, I wasn't even his dog.

640
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,980
 It was Ronald's dog, right?

641
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,220
 But secondly, if I saw a dog jump in boiling water, I'd be, it's not going to be the highlight

642
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,220
 of my week.

643
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,420
 Obviously, I'm going to be pretty bummed out.

644
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,000
 I would not in a million years jump in a boiling water.

645
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,280
 I don't even know if I'd jump in a boiling water for a close friend of mine, right?

646
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,080
 Because at a certain point, I had the opportunity once to, I don't want to get into that story,

647
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,760
 but I've had to put myself in situations where I may have gotten badly burned by flame.

648
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,080
 But I don't know if I'm going to, I'm not, first off, first off, as my good friend is

649
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
 in this hot spring.

650
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,380
 First off, hey dude, sorry, I'm not a really good swimmer to begin with.

651
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,740
 So like, even if I was able to get you, now there's two people in the hot water.

652
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,700
 It wasn't a pun, that was a literal thing.

653
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,780
 I'm not even a good swimmer.

654
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,820
 So even if it was like lukewarm water, sorry bro.

655
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,180
 But the idea of jumping into head first, head first, I don't know why that's worse, right?

656
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,700
 It's boiling water.

657
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,500
 But jumping head first into boiling water and then being pulled out blind and so much

658
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,760
 damage to you that you can't feel any pain, just terrifies me man.

659
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,520
 The stories actually make me a little sick to my stomach.

660
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
 It's really weird.

661
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,040
 Now I know I run the risk of people now just sending me tons of stories about people boiling

662
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
 alive.

663
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,120
 Again, it doesn't bug me.

664
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,240
 It has to be a very specific thing where you do it on purpose of your own free will.

665
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,640
 That's what's terrifying to me.

666
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:56,480
 And I think all of those stories, the eating the rock or drinking the fluid, the Uber driver,

667
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,580
 or the girl in particular, and the jumping and boiling water, they all play into the

668
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,100
 same thing.

669
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,180
 Losing control.

670
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,540
 One of them is a mental losing control where she just snaps one day.

671
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,060
 Nobody knows why she did it.

672
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,460
 She may not even know why she did it, which is more terrifying.

673
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,580
 The other two are losing physical control.

674
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,400
 One guy literally turned into a rock and lost control over his body.

675
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,620
 That was fake though, but it's still spooky.

676
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,580
 It's still spooky.

677
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:27,040
 This other one, he tried to be a hero and ended up dying, which is one of the ultimate

678
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,200
 ways you lose control, right?

679
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
 Because you kind of now no longer have a body.

680
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,040
 I don't know, maybe it's totally awesome floating around and stuff like that, being

681
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,720
 a ghost, but I don't know.

682
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,120
 I love being alive.

683
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,240
 So yeah, all of these stories play into that idea of losing control or even just being

684
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,960
 so badly burned you can't even feel any sensation.

685
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,240
 The skin of your foot could kind of just slough off and you not even realize it.

686
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,720
 You're like, "Oh, why is that guy holding my shoe?

687
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,420
 Why is that guy holding my shoe full of lasagna?

688
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,420
 When did he bring lasagna?"

689
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,980
 Oh wait, I can't see, so I couldn't even see it.

690
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,140
 But these are all utterly terrifying stories to me and one way or the other.

691
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,340
 I really have no other way to end this episode other than, one, if you have intrusive thoughts,

692
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
 they're totally normal.

693
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,900
 Again, I want to hit that home because a lot of people suffer in silence and a lot of people

694
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,140
 think that they're mean people, that they're evil people.

695
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,260
 How could I think these thoughts about people I love?

696
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,060
 How could I think these thoughts about myself?

697
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,960
 They're totally normal.

698
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,320
 They're unwanted thoughts.

699
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,800
 If you are walking around and you want to put boiling water on your head and you can't

700
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,920
 wait until you get and find a cauldron big enough for you, that's something you need

701
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,400
 to address with a psychiatrist, right?

702
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,160
 If you love shoplifting knives at Walmart and you can't wait until Uber's available in your

703
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,800
 area, that's something you address with a psychiatrist.

704
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,520
 But when you're sitting next to someone and you have a thought where you just want to

705
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,900
 scream in their face and tell them to shut up, or you want to harm yourself or harm someone

706
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,220
 else, but you would never do those things.

707
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,780
 You get these thoughts totally normal.

708
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,100
 Just roll with them.

709
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
 Just acknowledge what they are.

710
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,220
 Say they're intrusive thoughts.

711
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,100
 I'm not going crazy.

712
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:07,420
 And you'll be surprised how less scary things will be unless your job is finding spooky stories

713
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,140
 to talk about and then you decide to use yourself as an example.

714
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,620
 And hopefully these two episodes have helped you.

715
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,000
 I really kind of put myself on the line for these.

716
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,560
 I think they're fairly funny, but I'm putting myself out there.

717
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,760
 I hope you guys are able to go, "Hey, I've had thoughts like that.

718
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,640
 Maybe not as ridiculous as eating rocks, but I'm okay.

719
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
 I'm okay.

720
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,680
 I know what they are now and I hope these two episodes are able to help you find a little

721
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,800
 bit of humor in something that 95% of the world population deals with.

722
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,760
 You are not going crazy.

723
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,600
 It's totally normal."

724
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,200

 Some boiling hot soup.

732
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
 It's not a joke.

733
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
 I'm starving.

734
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
