1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
 What happens when you discover something that doesn't exist?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,420
 Then we travel to Australia to take a look at an underground organization that's looking

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,700
 at committing a nationwide kidnapping spree.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,460
 And then we travel to New York City to meet a man who has officially declared war on the

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:34,620
 shadow people today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,160
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,220
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,180
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,300
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing out there in the world.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,020
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today so first off walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,260
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today so first off walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,220
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today but first off walking into Dead Rabbit Command making

13
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,340
 his Patreon debut.

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,860
 Everyone give a round of applause for Thor Doss.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,780
 Woohoo yeah come on in Thor Doss welcome.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,020
 Thor what a powerful name Thor walking into Dead Rabbit Command bench pressing all of

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,020
 us.

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,980
 I wonder how many other people are named after deities.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,420
 Or there are a lot of people called raw.

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,660
 Actually now that I think about it there's a bunch of people called Jesus which is named

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,460
 after Jesus so there's a lot of them.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,460
 There's a lot of them.

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,860
 Thor you are not original but I do love your name and thank you for supporting the show.

24
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,540
 Thor you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,940
 Patreon if you guys don't electrocute people that's fine too.

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,140
 Just helps read the word about the show that really really really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,980
 Thor let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,780
 And grab on to his muscular waist.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,060
 He's going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command and glide us all the way

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,340
 out to an old folks home.

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:12,700
 I'm kind of chuckling because this is one of those stories that I came up with probably

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,340
 like three weeks ago a month ago and I go I don't know if I can ever talk I don't know

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,900
 if I can actually ever talk about this.

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,500
 This is so bizarre and as I'm holding on to Thor's waist I think man this guy really

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,380
 got a bad leg on the draw.

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,260
 These three stories are absolutely nuts.

37
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,460
 This is probably the weirdest one we've talked about in a while.

38
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,900
 We're landing at this old folks home and we're standing outside sunny state Glen.

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,420
 Just a beautiful day out and we see a bunch of old people walking around with their walkers

40
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,340
 and wheelchairs playing bingo and stuff like that.

41
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:53,060
 And I turn to you and I go I think I've discovered something that doesn't exist.

42
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,060
 I think I have found something that breaks all the rules of not just the internet but

43
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,060
 human desire.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,460
 You're already trying to walk away and put my hands on your shoulder and like ahhh.

45
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,540
 Nope you've already downloaded the episode you have to listen to all of it that's the

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,540
 rule.

47
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,700
 The other day I was sitting outside.

48
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,260
 I know people are always like oh it'd be so cool to hang out with Jason in real life.

49
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,620
 Trust me it's not.

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
 Trust me.

51
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,580
 It's way more insane than anything on the podcast.

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,220
 With the podcast there's a filter where I can edit things out.

53
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
 Right?

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,540
 And when I'm, people are spending time with me in public they're like oh no.

55
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,340
 I was sitting outside the other day with a friend who will remain nameless I'm not going

56
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,980
 to bring them into this whole thing.

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,780
 I was sitting outside and I go do you think there's an Alzheimer's fetish?

58
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,660
 And they're like they didn't want to engage me.

59
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,820
 They didn't want to part of this conversation.

60
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,900
 Basically was a monologue.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
 I go I waited for them.

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,180
 I waited for them to respond.

63
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,380
 There was no response.

64
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,140
 I go do you think there's an Alzheimer's fetish?

65
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,500
 I'm fully in public as I'm having this conversation.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,940
 I'm sitting down in a park.

67
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,300
 I go do you think it's possible that there is either a group of people who want to have

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,060
 sex with people who have Alzheimer's?

69
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,660
 Like that's their fetish.

70
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,180
 They want to have sex with people.

71
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,700
 You're like hitting on them.

72
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
 You're like hey baby what's up.

73
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,740
 They're like oh I remember I was called a baby once on the Titanic which happens to be

74
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
 right now.

75
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,500
 We're both on the Titanic and you're like getting all turned on.

76
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:44,380
 Is that they're that or are there people who fetishize having Alzheimer's?

77
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,860
 Either one right?

78
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,780
 Either one because there's fetishes for everything.

79
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,500
 There are people who think they're like big old babies and stuff like that.

80
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,340
 They walk around in diapers.

81
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,260
 They have to change them and like give them a bottle and stuff like that.

82
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,620
 There's people who fetishize that.

83
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,660
 So is it possible to do the reverse?

84
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,300
 Is there someone out there and the 7 billion people on their planet?

85
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,220
 Is there someone who gets off on the idea of one day having Alzheimer's?

86
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,420
 And I thought about it.

87
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,620
 I almost lost a friend in the process.

88
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,300
 I thought about it very loudly outside.

89
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,020
 So I started looking it up.

90
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,860
 And again I was like clearly there I'm going to find some weird deviant art group or some

91
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,780
 just like dark corner of the internet where people are talking about this stuff.

92
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,300
 Think about just the fetishes we've covered on this show.

93
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,980
 The people who had silicone injected into their genitals.

94
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,540
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,020
 You're not going to go to the show notes.

96
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,700
 We've talked about a lot of fetishes on this show and they're all just absolutely insane.

97
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,980
 The people who like to wipe their herpes on toys in Walmart.

98
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,500
 Put that episode on the show notes.

99
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,340
 The one you like Jason, please don't stop.

100
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,060
 We have all sorts of crazy fetishes out there.

101
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,180
 Is there anyone who's into having Alzheimer's?

102
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,780
 It turns out no.

103
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:13,500
 I looked all over to see if I could find some sort of bizarre subculture that fetishized

104
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,060
 Alzheimer's zero.

105
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,660
 None.

106
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,660
 We have human babies.

107
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,580
 All babies are human but we have adults wanting to be babies but we don't have adults wanting

108
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,740
 to be old people who have lost their memory.

109
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,260
 I started to think why not?

110
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,020
 Why not?

111
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,180
 On the one hand I started to think I can understand why there's not a bunch of Alzheimer's porn

112
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,340
 out there because at the end of the day that would be considered non-consensual.

113
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,540
 They think they're having sex with Harry S Truman but it's really Mike from the night

114
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
 club.

115
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,300
 It would still be considered I think by most people non-consensual.

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,260
 Then the idea of someone fantasizing about being an elderly person who can't remember

117
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,140
 anything, who keeps fading in and out of time periods mentally.

118
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
 Doesn't exist.

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
 I was shocked.

120
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
 I was absolutely shocked.

121
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,260
 I'm glad it doesn't.

122
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,540
 This is one of those things that I'm glad I doesn't.

123
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,380
 But I'm kind of shocked that it doesn't.

124
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,580
 People are chopping off their legs for sexual satisfaction.

125
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,660
 That's a recognized sexual fetish.

126
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,180
 Where are all the people who want dementia?

127
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,100
 Or maybe it's coming.

128
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
 Maybe that's coming.

129
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,580
 Maybe Alzheimer's and dementia and all that stuff.

130
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,140
 They didn't talk about that stuff when I was a kid.

131
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,020
 It was not part of the regular discourse.

132
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,860
 It was just the crazy lady down the street.

133
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,980
 Maybe it's something as it becomes more part of society as more people get it and maybe

134
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,380
 it will become a fetish.

135
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,780
 Maybe I'm just ahead of the curve.

136
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,940
 Again, hopefully I'm not.

137
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,780
 But yeah, it's just something disturbing that I discovered that doesn't exist.

138
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,740
 Thor Dos is flying away.

139
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
 Flying away in the hang glider.

140
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
 He's like, "Nope, I'm done.

141
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,940
 I'm out of here.

142
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,140
 Find another Patreon dude."

143
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,540
 Thor, let's go ahead and Tosh you.

144
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,980
 Throw him the keys anyways.

145
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,540
 Thor, let's go ahead and Tosh you the keys to the...

146
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
 Jason Jalopy.

147
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,580
 We're leaving behind this old folks home.

148
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
 Folks, folks.

149
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,380
 We're leaving behind this old person's home.

150
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,420
 We're headed all the way out to Australia.

151
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,500
 Let's head back to the year 2019.

152
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 We're in Australia.

153
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,380
 We're going to meet a support group called Domestic Violence Against Men.

154
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,220
 This is a support group that's on Facebook.

155
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,500
 I'm not one of those people who thinks that men can never be the victims in these type

156
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
 of things.

157
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 It can be the perpetrators.

158
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,700
 Men can be the victims.

159
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,780
 So on the one hand, when you see a group that's domestic violence against men, I get it, right?

160
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,780
 I get it.

161
00:08:52,780 --> 00:09:00,220
 And it does suck to be a man who has suffered sexual violence or physical violence.

162
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,140
 And society's just kind of like, whatever dude, brush it off.

163
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,940
 Rep some dirt on it and get back to work.

164
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,200
 It sucks.

165
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,280
 So on the one hand, I totally get that.

166
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,420
 On the other hand though, the Domestic Violence Against Men Facebook group, back on September

167
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:23,740
 12, 2019, called for a national uprising in Australia.

168
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:31,900
 They declared December 1, 2019 to be the day that all Australian fathers should take their

169
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,660
 children away from the mothers and then file false sexual abuse complaints against the

170
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,180
 women.

171
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,260
 And that's a bit of a bridge too far, right?

172
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,000
 Because, and I see, again, like I can sympathize with someone who's suffering from physical

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,020
 abuse or emotional abuse from anyone, man or woman.

174
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,900
 But what they were trying to do was they were trying to, one, basically the idea is that

175
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,060
 the fathers are getting a bunch of false sexual abuse complaints about them.

176
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,340
 So let's flip the script.

177
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,740
 We all take our kids to another state, another state in Australia, and we file false sexual

178
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,340
 abuse complaints against the women and it will completely clog up the Australian justice

179
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,380
 system.

180
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,300
 Whether or not the mothers ever did this is irrelevant.

181
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,100
 We're using the courts as a weapon against them the same way they've used the weapons

182
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,620
 against us.

183
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,100
 Now obviously this never happened, right?

184
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,780
 I mean, the Facebook poster reel, the threat was real, but there was never this mass uprising

185
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,140
 of this group.

186
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,620
 And I actually came across this story back in September of 2019 and I typed up a little

187
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,180
 bit of notes on it and I go, "Well, let's see if something happens on December 1st."

188
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
 Obviously not.

189
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,180
 And this wasn't something I just stumbled across on a Facebook group.

190
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,780
 This was being reported in the media over there.

191
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,580
 And I took those notes and I kind of filed it away.

192
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,140
 I have a folder called maybe, which means like I'm going to wait for the story to develop

193
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,340
 or maybe it's too weird.

194
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,860
 Maybe the Alzheimer's one should have ended up in there.

195
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,740
 Well, I've been going through the maybe file recently and I saw this one.

196
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,620
 I go, "Let's see whatever happened to this group.

197
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
 Let's see whatever."

198
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,540
 Because obviously I know the mass kidnapping thing didn't happen.

199
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,900
 So I pulled them up.

200
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:24,060
 When you're covering true crime, there is still kind of a layer between you and the story,

201
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
 right?

202
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,060
 I'm reading words on a page.

203
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,580
 There have been a couple of times I've researched stories.

204
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,620
 I found the photograph on the true crime website of the 13-year-old girl who'd been murdered

205
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,740
 in her living room.

206
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,940
 That was not a pleasant photo to come across in the middle of the day.

207
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,460
 And I've seen, you know, obviously video footage.

208
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,260
 I've watched reading a news article on some not mainstream news website and there's like

209
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,460
 video footage.

210
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,860
 There's a story about like someone being stabbed to death and then they autoplay the video

211
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,420
 footage.

212
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
 That's never fun either.

213
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,860
 I go to this Facebook page and it shows the, they shows like these close up of these toddler's

214
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,220
 wrists that have burns on them.

215
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,660
 Like someone took a curling iron or a cigarette and put it on these little kids wrists.

216
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,340
 This is horrific stuff, right?

217
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,820
 You don't want to see that when you're eating a bagel in the morning.

218
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,260
 But I come across that and obviously like he's saying this guy who's posting this website

219
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,900
 up is stating that his wife is doing this.

220
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,500
 His wife is burning his toddler and he can't get custody of his kid.

221
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,220
 And he keeps posting these photos and he keeps posting these photos.

222
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,020
 It's tragic stuff.

223
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,620
 And we cover on the true crime TikTok, right?

224
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,980
 That's on that I have up on TikTok and post to YouTube from time to time.

225
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,340
 We cover actually a lot of stories that are kind of this reverse where it's the woman

226
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,460
 faking allegations against the man or it's the woman abusing the kid and the dad trying

227
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,460
 to get that stuff.

228
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,700
 We do cover quite a few of that on the true crime TikTok.

229
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,660
 But again, those stories are always cut and dry, right?

230
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,940
 The stories that I'm covering are after the court cases and things like that.

231
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,100
 This story is just a picture of a toddler's wrist burned.

232
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,300
 And the last post is from February 17th, 2021.

233
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,780
 We have no updates from here, but he keeps posting these pictures of this toddler's

234
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,180
 wrist with burns in them.

235
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,300
 You know, he's like, "This is what my wife's doing to him.

236
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,780
 This is what my wife's doing to him."

237
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,220
 And you know, all this stuff.

238
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,860
 And that sucks, right?

239
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,060
 That totally sucks.

240
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,820
 Let me take you at your word, dude, that this is happening.

241
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,860
 It sucks that you can't get custody of your kid.

242
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,740
 But then he's posting stuff like this.

243
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:39,700
 "This is exactly why suicide or violence rates are so high or murder suicide happens."

244
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,540
 I feel almost, I'm actually surprised, I was actually surprised to go back and see that

245
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,900
 the Facebook group was still up.

246
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,020
 I'm surprised they didn't shut it down.

247
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,860
 In the Facebook group, he keeps talking about this guy named Charles.

248
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
 He says that this father's name is Charles.

249
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,780
 And I don't know if Charles is the one running the group.

250
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,940
 That's kind of the implication I got, but I could be wrong.

251
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,940
 But you come across that and you're like, "This is one of those true crime stories waiting

252
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
 to happen."

253
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,300
 Like, hopefully nothing happens, right?

254
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,420
 Hopefully, if the mother is doing it, that the father gets custody of the kid.

255
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,940
 But I mean, if the, they're talking about like murder, suicide and stuff like that.

256
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,420
 Like, I don't want kind of want nobody to have the kid, right?

257
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,540
 Like I want an aunt or a grandma or grandpa or whatever to have the kid.

258
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
 If the mom's burning them.

259
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,020
 I'm so sorry, this is so depressing.

260
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,660
 The mom's abusing them and the dad is even having an inkling, even thinking for more

261
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,740
 than one second about murder, suicide, then you can't be near that kid either.

262
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,740
 Tragic, right?

263
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,740
 It's tragic.

264
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,500
 And I, listen, you could easily have a group like this on one hand free speech, right?

265
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,980
 And they're trying to fight for what they see as justice.

266
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,140
 And he may be in the right.

267
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,140
 I don't know.

268
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,940
 I'm getting just his point of view.

269
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,380
 With the photos and stuff like that.

270
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,580
 But the murder, suicide, that's not right at all.

271
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,980
 That shouldn't even be an option.

272
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,980
 But if someone's saying, "Hey, man, my wife's abusing my son and I can't get possession

273
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
 of him.

274
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
 I can't get custody of him."

275
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,020
 Like I said, we cover that all the time on the Tik Tok.

276
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,660
 And then the mom goes nuts and like drowns the kid or shoots the kid or throws the kid

277
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,860
 out of a moving car.

278
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
 We see that.

279
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,300
 A lot of times the justice system is set up to be like, "Well, you know, we'll keep

280
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
 them with the mom."

281
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,020
 Even though the mom's like doing meth and stuff like that.

282
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,540
 So I empathize with that.

283
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,300
 But calling for a national rising up of fathers to, if you're starting off as kidnapping kids

284
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,660
 and then the second phase of your plan is filing false sexual assault reports.

285
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,500
 Like at a certain point, you kind of have to look in the mirror and go like, "Are we

286
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 the bad guys?"

287
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,820
 Like they're the bad guys.

288
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
 Find that word.

289
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
 That's how they see them.

290
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:55,180
 And then what we're doing is atrocious and contemplating murder, suicide and creepy stuff.

291
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,820
 The website hasn't been updated since February 17th, 2021.

292
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,460
 So you can see that as either a good sign or a bad sign, right?

293
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,540
 It could be a good sign that the guy just is like, "You know what?

294
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,820
 I'm done with all that stuff.

295
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,460
 I'm going to move on with my life."

296
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:15,060
 It could be a bad sign because this guy may have done something that makes it so he can't

297
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
 post.

298
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,700
 Crazy, crazy story, crazy story.

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,980
 I really don't have any other way to wrap that up.

300
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,180
 Thor Dost is like, "Okay, those two stories are pretty rough.

301
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,380
 What's the third one, Jason?

302
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,660
 What do you have for me now?"

303
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,540
 Well, Thor, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys of the carbon helicopter.

304
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,180
 We are leaving behind Australia.

305
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:43,820
 Take us all the way out to the city that never sleeps.

306
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,980
 New York City.

307
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,740
 A sparkling gem on the east coast of the United States.

308
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
 I've never been there.

309
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,220
 I don't know how sparkling it is.

310
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,940
 I am a child of the '70s and '80s.

311
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,940
 When I was growing up, it was a urine-soaked, prostitute-filled, murder capital.

312
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,980
 Nowadays, maybe it's better.

313
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,460
 I don't know.

314
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:11,500
 But someone who would know is Phoenix Reborn 69.

315
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,020
 Let's go ahead and call this guy Tony.

316
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,260
 We don't have his real name.

317
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,500
 I came across this post the other day and obviously had a bunch of buzzwords I'm looking

318
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,580
 for.

319
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:28,540
 He wrote, "I have been tortured" because I'm all into that anytime anyone puts "tortured"

320
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
 online.

321
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
 I get a Google alert.

322
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,860
 "I have been tortured and accosted by spirits for six years.

323
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,740
 And I'm ready to share with you my war with them."

324
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
 That diggity dog.

325
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,460
 I'm always down for a good human versus the paranormal type story.

326
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,940
 I'm a sucker for the hidden war trope.

327
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,500
 It shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, the idea that you could be on the streets

328
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,020
 fighting this great war while the rest of civilization just goes about their business.

329
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,580
 The Matrix, right?

330
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,580
 Did that trope.

331
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
 Vampire the Masquerade.

332
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
 I love that.

333
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
 Teenage Ninja Turtles.

334
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,620
 I can keep naming them off, all this type of stuff I love.

335
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,100
 So I always wanted to be in the secret war.

336
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
 When I was younger, right?

337
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,860
 And I wanted to be too tired.

338
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
 My knees hurt.

339
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,060
 I don't want to have to outrun Mousers as they're chasing me into a darkened alley.

340
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,180
 But back when I was a kid, that would be so dope, right?

341
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,980
 To be part of a small group of freedom fighters fighting the paranormal creatures that haunt

342
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,420
 the darkness.

343
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,340
 Be awesome.

344
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,060
 So when I came across this post, I was like, "Dude, this guy might actually be living my

345
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
 dream.

346
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,620
 Is it possible that Tony is fighting paranormal monsters?"

347
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
 You're shaking your head.

348
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,540
 You're like, "Of course not, Jason.

349
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,900
 Something's mentally wrong with this guy."

350
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
 Well, hold on.

351
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
 Is it possible?

352
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,980
 Is it possible that this guy is fighting the fiends of the darkness that haunts our

353
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
 dreams?

354
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,900
 They're part of his reality and he's winning this battle.

355
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,140
 I look it up.

356
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,220
 He says for six years he's been a professional videographer and he's been documenting the

357
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,980
 shadow people.

358
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,220
 I've personally had run-ins with the shadow people.

359
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,500
 They are...

360
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,820
 I've never been beaten up by one.

361
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,340
 I've never had to go to war with one.

362
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
 I wouldn't want to.

363
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,100
 They're pretty powerful, right?

364
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,220
 You can just sense...

365
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
 They're not ghosts.

366
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
 They're not demons.

367
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
 We've done a couple episodes on them.

368
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,940
 I'll put my personal experiences in them and then other stuff.

369
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,340
 There's a theory that they're the original inhabitants of hell.

370
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,140
 They predate the demonic fall and the rise of Lucifer.

371
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
 Very fascinating stuff.

372
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,740
 We don't know how much of it's true, but the shadow people are definitely a real phenomenon.

373
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,260
 Anyways, he's been documenting the shadow people with his video camera.

374
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
 At this point I was like, "Okay."

375
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,380
 I was kind of expecting him to be like...

376
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,980
 And I invented a shotgun that you can shoot a hole through a ghost.

377
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,140
 I was like, "Okay, he's just video taping stuff."

378
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,420
 That's not what I was expecting.

379
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,500
 I had a little pinnit up that said, "Secret War."

380
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,740
 And now you're just documenting stuff.

381
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,700
 But then here I'm reading his post and it says, "I am here to tell the world and show

382
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,580
 my story of how I've been accosted and tortured by shadow people for the past six years and

383
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,300
 my attempts to war with them."

384
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,420
 Okay, so now he's...

385
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,540
 Now he's just being like, "Tomorrow the war begins, but tonight I'm gonna videotape him."

386
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:22,220
 So I'm already losing a little bit of my shadow war thing, but I'm still in.

387
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,300
 I'm still in.

388
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,900
 So when he posted a Dropbox link to one of his videos showing the shadow people, I was

389
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:35,460
 both eager and not eager to click on it because you never know what you're gonna get, right?

390
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,540
 But before I clicked on it, there was a couple people who had responded to him posting this.

391
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,740
 I mean, like, "I'm at war with the shadow people.

392
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
 It's been a six-year-long struggle."

393
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,100
 He posted it on the Ghosts subreddit.

394
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,780
 That was the first place that I saw it.

395
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,780
 The second...

396
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,700
 The first comment was like, "Okay, post the video."

397
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,060
 So then he posted the Dropbox.

398
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:00,700
 The second comment was, "Bro, you smoke meth.

399
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,500
 Of course you see shadow people."

400
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,860
 I was like, "Oh, are you freaking?"

401
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,140
 So I clicked on this guy's profile, this professional videographer.

402
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,540
 He may have filmed your wedding.

403
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
 You don't know.

404
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,420
 He may have been at your wedding if you live in New York.

405
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,500
 Not only does he post in the Ghosts subreddit, and the Truth is Here subreddit, which are

406
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,540
 really good, like, paranormal subreddits, he also posts...

407
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,940
 You guys were also residing.

408
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,020
 You guys were like, "Shadow war.

409
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,860
 Shadow war the whole time you're listening to the Alzheimer's stuff."

410
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,460
 You're like, "Oh, at least he's going to get to some paranormal conflict in the end."

411
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,500
 And then the father all that depressing stuff about kids.

412
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,140
 And you're like, "Well, this is pretty rough, but at least he's going to end with a guy

413
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
 beating up ghosts."

414
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,140
 And it's some meth.

415
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,220
 It's some weirdo method.

416
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,500
 So I clicked on this guy's...

417
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,540
 But I'm going somewhere with this.

418
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,540
 I'm going...

419
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,540
 This wasn't a trick.

420
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
 This wasn't a trick.

421
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,340
 Well, not anymore than I was tricked, because I was super excited when I saw this.

422
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,300
 And then the second comment said, "Bro, you smoke meth."

423
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,940
 He also posts on the subreddits, "Tweaker talk."

424
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,140
 "Tweaker talk."

425
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,140
 So this guy...

426
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
 The fact...

427
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,580
 There are so many meth subreddits, which makes sense, because meth people are constantly

428
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,580
 bored.

429
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,380
 So you may be privately just going from bored to bored.

430
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,380
 Looking for someone to talk to.

431
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,060
 He is on "Tweaker talk."

432
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,140
 He's on "Spun horny fun" for people who want to have sex on drugs.

433
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,860
 So he's on a couple of those.

434
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,180
 And the reason why we know where he's located is he's also on "New York hookup."

435
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,180
 New York hookup subreddit.

436
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,340
 So with this additional information, I totally clicked on the link.

437
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,900
 I was like, "Okay, whatever this guy put on Dropbox, it has to be insane."

438
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,340
 It's a six-minute long video.

439
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
 And it was shot like...

440
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,700
 I was like, "For a professional videographer, he must have ponded his camera off for drugs,

441
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,140
 because this is like terrible video quality."

442
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,380
 He's videotaping out of his apartment into his neighbor's apartment.

443
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,460
 So just right there, it's super creepy.

444
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,460
 And it's like a little bit after dusk, so the audio...

445
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,580
 So the video quality is not that great, but he's videotaping the neighborhood.

446
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,500
 And you do very clearly see a shadow man.

447
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,660
 It's one of his neighbors, like walking around his living room.

448
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,420
 But because the distance is so far and the neighbor is backlit, he looks like he's completely

449
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,740
 made of shadow.

450
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:48,380
 So what we have here is a meth head who's videotaping his neighbors, and he thinks his

451
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,340
 neighbors are creatures from beyond reality.

452
00:23:52,340 --> 00:24:00,380
 I mean, that's a setup for a nightmare scenario by any definition, I think.

453
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,380
 Already that's creepy.

454
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,620
 Already that's unsettling.

455
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,020
 He's sitting there, he's videotaping his neighbors now in his defense.

456
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,140
 His neighbors do kind of look like shadow people, not just the fact that they're backlit,

457
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,380
 so you can't really see any facial features and they look like a shadow.

458
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,540
 They're also doing some weird stuff.

459
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,940
 There's only one shadow person in particular, because it is a real human, but the way he

460
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,820
 moves, not like in a glitchy way, not because of the poor camera quality or because of the

461
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,340
 lighting or anything like that, but he just seems to be standing out his window doing

462
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,660
 some weird stuff.

463
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,940
 Maybe he's playing a game of charades, maybe he has a Wii Fit and he's exercising or something

464
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,940
 like that.

465
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,380
 DDR, he's an avid dance dance revolution player.

466
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
 I don't know.

467
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,580
 He's not energetic, but in this dude's defense, what do we name him?

468
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
 Tony?

469
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,260
 In this Tony's defense, the guy is acting kind of weird.

470
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,580
 But let's just step back for a second.

471
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,420
 I'm sure the guy is fine.

472
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,060
 I'm sure he's not actually neighbors with a shadow person.

473
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,220
 Think about it right now.

474
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,300
 As you're listening to this podcast, there's a man videotaping his neighbors because he

475
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:15,420
 believes that his neighbors are demons, his neighbors are ghouls and ghosts and shadow

476
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:22,460
 people from beyond, and he's talking about going to war with them.

477
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:29,100
 Just the fact that we have, imagine you're in this podcast, the New York girl, you're

478
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,460
 looking around, you're making all these weird movements as you're trying to close the blinds.

479
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,420
 Shadow person confirmed.

480
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,820
 Like already, that's creepy because we have this guy who really likes math, which is a

481
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,500
 bad combination, combined with paranoia and living next to you.

482
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,700
 Who knows what's going to happen, but I also wanted, this is another story I kind of want

483
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,460
 to step back from for a second because when I came across this, remember in the beginning

484
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
 I was super excited.

485
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,940
 I was like, oh, a fellow warrior that had a thinned earth realm against the Denzians

486
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,420
 or Desians or every pronounce it of hell.

487
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,620
 And then I find out this guy's a meth addict.

488
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:16,900
 I started to think, is there any other form of research, any other type of inquiry, right?

489
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:24,260
 Any other type of group of investigators that has such a problem with mental illness?

490
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,740
 Because I don't think astronomers really have to deal with people showing up to the giant

491
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,940
 telescope and there's spun on tons of meth.

492
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,620
 I don't think there's a whole bunch of mathematicians out there that have, well actually they might

493
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,420
 all be addicted to Adderall, but I think for the most part, even those, they're pretty

494
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,020
 self-sufficient, right?

495
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:50,860
 I don't think there's a bunch of lunatics in the field of biology or chemistry or, and

496
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,340
 I would say even like automotive.

497
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,460
 Okay, no wonder those people have a bunch of meth heads in them as well.

498
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:03,340
 But really like the study of the paranormal, we do have a lot of lunatics.

499
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,500
 Like people with diagnosable illnesses in our field.

500
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,620
 At the very least, let's say you're just a hobbyist.

501
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,540
 You just love hearing all of these stories.

502
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,860
 And then you have people who are on the ground like making their living as researchers, as

503
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,780
 writers, as creators of documentaries and things like that.

504
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,860
 Why do we have such a problem with mental illness?

505
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,700
 And I would argue, you're like, "Shakes me."

506
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,740
 Because obviously you guys are talking about crazy things.

507
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,340
 But I would say even if you were a meth head and you were say, into cryptid hunting or

508
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,780
 Bigfoot and stuff like that, I mean, you might do meth because you live out in Arkansas and

509
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,900
 you're looking for Bigfoot, but I don't think the two go hand in hand.

510
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:47,980
 I don't believe that people who are hunting Bigfoot have a serious mental health issue.

511
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,100
 And I don't think we see the same thing in UFOology.

512
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,900
 We don't see it in a lot of types of paranormal investigations.

513
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:03,340
 Even in this niche, I think that mental illness, for whatever reason, it seems to be with ghosts

514
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
 and demons.

515
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,220
 Now, conspiracy theory, we do have a trouble with meth addicts as well.

516
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,220
 We have trouble with drug users as well.

517
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:18,260
 But I just, I mean, I was thinking about it when I read this and I was kind of bummed

518
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
 down.

519
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,900
 I don't think there's any other field of inquiry that has such a mental health problem.

520
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,380
 And I'm not saying, I'm clearly not saying that everyone who believes in ghosts or shadow

521
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,780
 men are mentally ill at all.

522
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,080
 But for whatever reason, the Venn diagram is there between people who believe in the

523
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,420
 shadow men and people who are non-drug users and people who are drug users.

524
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,700
 The Venn diagram is there and I don't believe it's there for UFOology.

525
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,380
 I don't even really think it's there for astrology.

526
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,820
 I really have an interest in magic, high magic, low magic, what have you.

527
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,060
 I mean, maybe weed, right?

528
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:58,500
 But that's not going to impact your life as much as this, as much as doing methamphetamines.

529
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 So I wonder what it is.

530
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,740
 Now, obviously, you can look at it two ways is that when you look at the world of the

531
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,820
 paranormal and conspiracies, like I said, those two get the most people in them who

532
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,100
 have mental health problems.

533
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,340
 You could see it plays on a worldview that we're not alone.

534
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,340
 You're never alone.

535
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,180
 It's always something watching you and it plays on the worldview that someone is always

536
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,500
 controlling the string so the paranoia, the naturally comes along with drugs.

537
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,460
 But then there's also the conspiracy element of it.

538
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,980
 And I see this pop up a lot, that when I see a shadow person in my grandma's backyard and

539
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,820
 I'm totally sober, I'm looking at a unique phenomenon.

540
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,100
 I'm looking at something because when I was seeing these things, the term shadow men wasn't

541
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,340
 even in the vernacular.

542
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,220
 Is there something you saw?

543
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,660
 You described it as something darker than dark.

544
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,100
 It was very, they're very, very weird to look at.

545
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:00,740
 The idea is that meth doesn't make you crazy.

546
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,340
 Meth doesn't make you crazy.

547
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,140
 And that's why you hallucinate shadow people.

548
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,700
 Meth makes it so you can perceive that which is already there.

549
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,980
 That's not an endorsement for doing meth, but it's not that meth makes you paranoid and

550
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,940
 begin to hallucinate the shadow people.

551
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,740
 The shadow people are always there and now you're seeing them because the meth is interfering

552
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,540
 with whatever sort of mental block either you've put up or the universe is put up or

553
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
 whatever.

554
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,940
 The government is blocking you from seeing these things.

555
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,660
 So that would be the conspiracy theory, right?

556
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,820
 Like that's the reason why you have people who use meth seeing these things is that it's

557
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,220
 actually removing the filter.

558
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,060
 It's hard for me to say because I've seen shadow people.

559
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,500
 Someone whether they're on meth or not when they start talking about shadow people, I

560
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,180
 know what they're talking about.

561
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,660
 I know what they're talking about.

562
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,220
 I've seen it too.

563
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,980
 I can't really dismiss every time someone sees a shadow person and then it turns out

564
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,140
 they're a huge meth head.

565
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,740
 I can't dismiss it just out of hand and being like, "Oh, their experience isn't real because

566
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,540
 they're on meth."

567
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,860
 But I wouldn't let them into my house.

568
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,980
 I'm not going to let them borrow my car or anything, but I'm not necessarily going to

569
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,380
 not believe them because they're on that drug.

570
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,620
 But again, like even when I was seeing shadow people, I wasn't spying in other people's

571
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
 houses.

572
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,540
 I was in video tape in other people's houses, right?

573
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
 It was a bizarre phenomenon.

574
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,860
 I didn't really know how to put it into words.

575
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,140
 I figured it was a ghost or something.

576
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,860
 When you see a shadow person, it is the equivalent.

577
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,260
 I think the analogy I use, it's like an ant looking up at a human.

578
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,820
 You clearly can tell that this is something so much more...

579
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,540
 I don't even want to use the word "advanced."

580
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,300
 That's a good word for it.

581
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:52,540
 Advanced implies some sort of comparison even, like even the ant to the human.

582
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,900
 It's the equivalent of the ant looking at the sun.

583
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,700
 It's looking at something that is so unknowable to where you're at.

584
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,020
 It's not just a ghost.

585
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,820
 The ghost, you can look at a ghost and you go, "Oh, I understand that that's the spirit

586
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,900
 of a human or a demon disguising as a human."

587
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,460
 Even seeing a demon, you can realize that it has some sort of motivation, right?

588
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,300
 It hates humanity.

589
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,140
 That's its goal, is to destroy humans.

590
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,100
 Shadow people are neither of those things.

591
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
 It's like watching...

592
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,660
 I was about to say it's like watching a tidal wave.

593
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,300
 It's more like watching a tidal wave on another planet.

594
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,940
 It is such a bizarre phenomenon.

595
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:34,620
 Out of all of the things I've seen, the Shadowmen, they...

596
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,140
 It's really hard to compare.

597
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,180
 It's really hard to compare how you feel when you're...

598
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,660
 I didn't feel menace.

599
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,660
 I didn't feel menace.

600
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,900
 I didn't feel like I was in danger.

601
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:49,260
 I felt like I was watching something that...

602
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,580
 I was watching something that was not of this world, was not of this reality.

603
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,900
 And even that seems to be understating it.

604
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,100
 It's just so weird.

605
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,500
 They had such a weird phenomenon.

606
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,220
 But it is kind of bummy to think like you do have a lot of people with mental health

607
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,180
 struggles who also are seeing these things and reporting these things.

608
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,180
 And while it doesn't make me take their stories any less seriously, it does make you take

609
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,220
 the stories less seriously when you think about it, right?

610
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,260
 This guy may be seeing Shadow people.

611
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
 Probably not.

612
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
 He's probably just seeing his neighbors.

613
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,660
 Like once I looked at the video.

614
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,740
 But again, tomorrow I'm going to be researching more stuff and you do start to think like,

615
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,980
 is the guy reporting this?

616
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
 Is he just crazy?

617
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,500
 When you come across conspiracy theories, right?

618
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
 When you start...

619
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
 What was that?

620
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 I was reading a conspiracy theory recently.

621
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,940
 I'll see if I can find out if it's shown up.

622
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,700
 A guy believed that his...

623
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,220
 The guy who installed his sliding glass door was a convicted child sex offender, which apparently

624
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,540
 that part's true, right?

625
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,420
 He said like he knew for a fact that the guy was a sex offender.

626
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,300
 And then that same guy started putting in the doors on his neighbor's house.

627
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300
 Here's a pro tip, dude.

628
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,940
 If you find out the guy installing your doors is a sex offender, get new doors installed.

629
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,020
 And secondly, if you see your neighbor also getting doors from that guy, just tell him

630
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
 that that's not a good...

631
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,500
 Just tell him that's not a wise idea.

632
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
 But anyways, he said...

633
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,820
 He was reading this post and he goes, "My doors got installed and the guy did a good

634
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
 job."

635
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,500
 The other thing is that he's a child predator.

636
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,260
 He knows his workmanship.

637
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,380
 He installed my doors and then like a month or two later, they start installing the doors

638
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,500
 in my neighbor's house and I noticed my internet dropped down.

639
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,260
 Like my internet bandwidth just cratered.

640
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,260
 Like he goes, "When you're playing video games or watching movies or anything like that."

641
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
 Everything was super slow.

642
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:47,260
 Then he said, "One day, a bunch of cops swarmed his neighbor's house."

643
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,780
 And then after they swarmed his neighbor's house and I...

644
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,740
 If I remember correctly, I didn't plan on covering this, but we've kind of moved into

645
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,740
 this.

646
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:59,300
 If I remember correctly, they arrested the guy, the door installer and his wife.

647
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,500
 His wife was also helping him install doors.

648
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
 They got arrested.

649
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,700
 I can't swear on that detail.

650
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,620
 But anyways, the cops swarmed the neighbor's house and then all of a sudden, the dude,

651
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:15,060
 the original guy, got his internet bandwidth returned to normal.

652
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,460
 So it was this idea like maybe these guys who...

653
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,220
 This guy and his wife and they installed his doors, maybe they somehow tapped into his

654
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,380
 internet and was doing God knows what.

655
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,540
 Doing God knows what on his internet.

656
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,140
 And I'm reading this post and then like maybe like two thirds of the way down, he goes,

657
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,940
 "Hey guys, I also got to let you know that I have a major psychological problem and I've

658
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,940
 been unmedicated for a while."

659
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:49,060
 And you're like, "Okay, okay, so how much of this story is real?"

660
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,620
 Like different parts of it maybe.

661
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,420
 Maybe the guy's not a convicted sex offender.

662
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,980
 Maybe that is some sort of delusion he came up with.

663
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
 Right?

664
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,740
 And it was interesting because I was reading the one I read that I was like, "Hey, it's

665
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
 like how..."

666
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,260
 Again, like you automatically start questioning everything in the narrative above it, which

667
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,220
 you should question it when you see anonymous postings online.

668
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,020
 But then you double and triple and quadruple question it when you realize that the person

669
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:16,860
 telling you the story is knows that they need medication or psychosis and they're not taking

670
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
 their medication.

671
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,220
 And what was interesting because of the replies to it was, "You have a family.

672
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:28,500
 You have kids and now that you've got a child sex offender to install your door, but why

673
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
 aren't you medicated?

674
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,540
 Like if you know you're not medicated and you're not taking your medicine, you're putting

675
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,860
 everyone at risk.

676
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:40,340
 And the very least, your kids realize that you're not acting normal and it was just interesting

677
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,660
 to see people react like that.

678
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,180
 You need to stay medicated for your children, but you have that, right?

679
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,180
 You have that crossover.

680
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,980
 I'll put that whole thing in the show notes, but you have this crossover between conspiracy

681
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,580
 theories and paranormal and mental illness and drug use.

682
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:02,220
 And I don't really see it in any other type of, even the fun stuff we talk about, like

683
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,180
 again like UFOs and cryptids and missing people.

684
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,380
 Those might be caused by the drug addicts.

685
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,140
 They might be even snatching them out of the woods.

686
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,020
 But why ghosts?

687
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,540
 Why specifically ghosts and shadowmen and demons?

688
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,020
 Why does it attract the drug users and the mentally ill?

689
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,660
 As well as the people who are neither of those things, right?

690
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,900
 It's a fascinating story and let's not forget that right now as you're listening to this,

691
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:36,180
 there is a man videotaping his neighbors in New York believing that they are demons, believing

692
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,740
 that they are shadow people and believing he's at war with them, believing that they have

693
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,460
 accosted him and tortured him.

694
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,900
 And they live right next door to this guy.

695
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,300
 He's sitting in his house smoking meth, having these paranoid delusions and typing about it

696
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
 online.

697
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,300
 Hey, it's a free country, right?

698
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,660
 I mean, it's illegal to smoke meth, but whatever.

699
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,700
 It's a free country if you want to have these insane beliefs you're allowed to, but what

700
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,420
 happens when the beliefs become action?

701
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:14,220
 When he's tired of being tortured by these shadow people in his neighborhood and he

702
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:22,920
 decides it is finally time to turn this war into a bloodbath.

703
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,420
 What happens then?

704
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:32,540
 A paranormal story can turn to a true crime tragedy at any moment.

705
00:38:32,540 --> 00:39:00,420
 And right now in New York City, that moment grows closer every single day.

706
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:28,900
 It's true.

707
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,900
 It's true.
