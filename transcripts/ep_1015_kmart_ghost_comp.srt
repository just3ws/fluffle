00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
 When a young woman is over at a friend's apartment, she already knows that this place

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,560
 gives off a creepy vibe, but little does she know she's about to witness something that

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,440
 will make her question reality.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,260
 And then we travel to a Kmart to meet a man who's just there to do some quick shopping

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,340
 before he goes on with the rest of his day.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,440
 Instead he meets an old friend from the past and this chance encounter has him questioning

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,780
 what happens after you die.

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:47,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenterder, and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,320
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world doing whatever you're

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
 doing.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,400
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so let's go ahead and get started here.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,000
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is a longtime supporter of the show and pretty

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,920
 much becoming my own personal librarian.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,120
 Everyone give it up for Greg Gorley.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
 Woohoo!

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,520
 Yeah, come on in, Greg.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,840
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,360
 Greg's been sending me books recently off of my Amazon wishlist.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,840
 They started thinking maybe I should put groceries on there.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,480
 Maybe I should get some Gatorade Zero dropped off in my house.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,280
 I do love these books though.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
 This is a book.

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,920
 I don't even know if I have this on my wishlist.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
 I think you can buy stuff just for me.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
 I don't know.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
 Maybe not.

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
 This is a book called The Darkest Places.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,760
 Unsolved Mysteries, True Crimes, and Heroine Disasters in the Wilds.

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,840
 So yeah, really, really cool book.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,720
 It's from the editors of Outside Magazine, so it's out in the middle of nowhere.

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,840
 Time for horrific stories.

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,000
 The places I never go.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,880
 I never go into the middle of nowhere.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,640
 I hate the outdoors because it's too spooky.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,560
 And now Greg has gotten me a book that reinforces my view of the natural world.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
 Thank you so much.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,840
 Greg, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
 You guys can't buy me anything.

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,720
 If you guys can't support the show financially, it truly is totally okay.

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,960
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,240
 You have no idea how much that helps when you let other people know that you enjoy the show.

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,760
 Greg, let's go ahead and let's dust off the bunny bicycle.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
 We haven't used this guy in a long time.

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,320
 We'll hop on the handlebars as he pedals us out of Dead Rabbit Command all the way out

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,240
 to a creepy apartment.

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,320
 Wicca, wicca, wicca.

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,480
 Wicca, wicca, wicca.

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,680
 There's a reason why we don't use the bunny bicycle a lot.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,560
 I haven't found a good sound effect for it.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,200
 We are at our destination.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,400
 Everyone hop off the bunny bike.

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,440
 Let's lock it up to a nearby tree and we're going to enter this apartment complex where

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,320
 we're about to meet a young woman.

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,400
 Now she didn't give her name.

58
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,480
 She doesn't give her real name.

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,960
 We're going to go ahead and call her Abby.

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,440
 Online she goes by the name Euphoric Mycologist 39.

61
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
 We don't have any real names.

62
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,720
 We don't have an exact location.

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 We do have a time period.

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
 This is a fairly recent story.

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,840
 She said this happened around three years ago.

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
 She classifies it as the beginning of COVID.

67
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,840
 So February, March, April of 2020 is when the story popped off.

68
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,800
 Abby was hanging out at her friend's apartment.

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,680
 She said this was an older apartment.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,080
 I don't know if this, I'm sure the whole entire complex was older, but I don't know

71
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,840
 if the entire complex gave off a creepy vibe, but Abby's friend's apartment definitely gave

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,040
 off a creepy vibe.

73
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,440
 When she was over there, when her friend who lived there, anyone was hanging out over there,

74
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,000
 it did feel a little off.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,200
 On this particular day, Abby's over at this apartment complex with her friend and there's

76
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
 two other friends there as well.

77
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,800
 So there's four women and there's also two little girls who are at the apartment complex.

78
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,520
 A four-year-old and a seven-year-old, we'll go ahead and call the four-year-old Samantha.

79
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,120
 And it's just kind of a get-together.

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
 Everyone's having a lot of fun, just hanging out, watching television, talking, making a

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,880
 little lunch, and just an all-around get-together.

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,960
 Little did we know that this would soon become very difficult to do after COVID really struck

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,480
 and you had all of these isolation guidelines and things like that.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,080
 But towards the beginning, you're like, "Hey, did you see the news about that disease coming

85
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
 out of China?

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,200
 Let's all hang out together.

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,120
 Let's get all these different people together in this tiny apartment and hang out."

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
 Because who knows what's going to happen next.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,400
 She's over at this apartment hanging out, making lunch.

90
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,600
 She does say this is always good to acknowledge.

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,520
 She goes, "We do smoke weed, but on this particular day we weren't smoking any weed.

92
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,400
 We were all totally sober over at my friend's house."

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,560
 And she says, "I'm sitting there and the two little girls, the four-year-old and the seven-year-old,

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,360
 Samantha and the other little girl, are just kind of running around having fun in the apartment.

95
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,480
 Everyone else is just chilling."

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
 And time passes.

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,000
 Time marches on and they're just hanging out.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,960
 So after an indefinite amount of time, she just said, "Time passes.

99
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,280
 Everyone's just kind of relaxing doing their own thing."

100
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:37,680
 Abby goes at a certain point, she realized that Samantha is running around in the kitchen

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
 area of the apartment all by herself.

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,280
 Just her in there and she's running around in the kitchen by herself.

103
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:57,560
 And Abby gets this strange feeling in her gut that she should go check on Samantha.

104
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,240
 Now looking at my notes, I don't know if Samantha is the four-year-old or the seven-year-old,

105
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,120
 but that's neither here nor there.

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
 But just for clarification, I'm not entirely for sure which of the girls.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,160
 But anyway, so Abby gets up and she goes into the kitchen because she hears Samantha running

108
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,280
 around by herself.

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,680
 That's not enough to get Abby off the couch, but she also just has this really weird feeling.

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,560
 So she gets up to check and when she walks into the kitchen area, she sees Samantha staring

111
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,400
 up at the ceiling.

112
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,160
 Samantha then points towards Abby.

113
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,800
 She's pointing towards Abby, but she's pointing past her.

114
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,680
 She's pointing up towards the ceiling directly behind Abby.

115
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,560
 Abby slowly starts to turn around.

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:57,760
 What she sees, what Samantha's talking about and what Abby now sees herself is a, what

117
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:06,600
 she can only describe as a floating blob of ink.

118
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 This big black puddle floating in the kitchen.

119
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,720
 Abby says the thing was fairly large.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,480
 It was about the size of a human head.

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:33,640
 This glob of darkness hovering in this kitchen.

122
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,120
 But it wasn't still.

123
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,000
 It wasn't just like an image or a stain pressed against the wall.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,320
 It was a 3D object and this blob of ink was moving.

125
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,640
 Abby said it reminded her of the way that an octopus would swim.

126
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,440
 It had this weird movement to it.

127
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,040
 The way that an octopus propels itself underwater and when she looked up, she saw it quickly

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,120
 move around the kitchen.

129
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,360
 And then it completely disappeared.

130
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,600
 It's an interesting phenomenon and it's something that you could compare to a ghost.

131
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,760
 But what's interesting about this is if you've seen a ghost, there's generally two emotions.

132
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,640
 I mean it's a spectrum, but generally there's two emotions.

133
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,840
 There's a, okay, three.

134
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,160
 There's, you don't know it's a ghost, right?

135
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,920
 Technically that's not an emotion, but you look at something, it doesn't dawn on you

136
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
 that what you saw was a ghost.

137
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,200
 Later you find out that it was something, it wasn't really a person on the deck of that

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 ship.

139
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,400
 It wasn't the maid in your room.

140
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,520
 You're not clear of it when you see it.

141
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,720
 The hitchhiker on the side of the road and things like that.

142
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,840
 But if you know it's a ghost, if you're looking at something and it's like hovering in midair,

143
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,920
 it has no legs or it's a shadow person, it's something that you can clearly see.

144
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,200
 It is not a real human.

145
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
 It might take the form of a human.

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,720
 It might be a full body apparition, but you know that that is a ghost.

147
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,920
 There's really two emotions people feel.

148
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,760
 One is fear and the other one is curiosity.

149
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,680
 It could be anywhere in between the two, but generally speaking that is kind of where you're

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
 at.

151
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,200
 You're like, wow, I'm actually looking at a ghost.

152
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,280
 What I just saw is a spirit or something assuming the form of a human spirit.

153
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,000
 Or, ah, and you're running away.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,240
 It tends to be somewhere in between those two.

155
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,040
 What's interesting about this entity that Abby saw, what's really interesting is she

156
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
 gives this quote about her feelings.

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,440
 She goes, quote, "It scared me," which is kind of where it would start to fall into

158
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
 if it was a ghost.

159
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
 She does have that initial "It scared me" thing, but she goes, "It scared me," and

160
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,000
 left the core of my stomach feeling like it was doing backflips.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,680
 I made an excuse and went home shortly after what I saw.

162
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,520
 And so it's almost just more than fright.

163
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,040
 It's revulsion.

164
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,240
 You're seeing something that shouldn't exist.

165
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
 Even if you don't believe in ghosts, you're aware of what a ghost is.

166
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
 So if you're walking down a dark hallway in the middle of the night and you saw your

167
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,840
 grandpa standing at the end of your hallway, assuming you don't live with your grandpa,

168
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,080
 assuming that you're not renting a room from him, he's not supposed to be there.

169
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,320
 He's been dead for 10 years.

170
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,240
 Even if you didn't believe in ghosts, you could put two and two together and go, wow,

171
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
 I actually saw a ghost.

172
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,560
 Maybe there is something to that.

173
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,720
 You could put two and two together that way.

174
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
 But this is something that just doesn't make sense.

175
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,400
 It's a floating black blob the size of a human head.

176
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,760
 And the way she described it, again, it's not moving like a ghost.

177
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,600
 It's not a screaming ghost head, which would be equally terrifying.

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,080
 But what she was seeing, her body was reacting to something that shouldn't exist.

179
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,800
 This was some sort of entity or a life form that should not exist in this realm.

180
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,280
 And so she had an odd reaction to it, a physical discomfort.

181
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,680
 And remember, it started off because she had that gut feeling in the first place.

182
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,480
 There was an interloper.

183
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
 There was something in the house.

184
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,920
 I mean, she couldn't put it into words, but she's sitting there.

185
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,160
 She hears a little girl running around in the kitchen and she realizes, I better check

186
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
 on her.

187
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,800
 I mean, she ends up seeing this thing.

188
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,040
 What's interesting as we get, this is pretty standard for any sort of paranormal activity,

189
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,560
 whether it be aliens, cryptids, ghosts, or more blobs.

190
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,160
 She told her boyfriend about it and he didn't believe her.

191
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,960
 He completely dismissed it and dismissed her for even thinking she saw anything like that.

192
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,320
 And then she stopped talking about it.

193
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,800
 She just really never ever told anyone else about it until she could talk about it anonymously

194
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:14,040
 online.

195
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
 It's an interesting story.

196
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,760
 I really like this one.

197
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,560
 We had, yesterday we talked about the little girls who were flying around the basement.

198
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,040
 And again, this was like something that a child could see.

199
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,400
 She could see this blob and she was running around in the kitchen trying to catch it.

200
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,680
 It was too fast.

201
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,280
 Some answer said.

202
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:42,360
 But when you put an adult into that situation where something unreal was existing, when

203
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,960
 an adult viewed it, who understands the rules of the universe, a child doesn't.

204
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,680
 They're still learning all that stuff.

205
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,280
 Whether you're four or you're seven, you still are trying to figure out like what is reality.

206
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,000
 You understand that cartoons aren't real and things like that, but you still think that

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,640
 there is magic.

208
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,680
 You still think that Santa Claus is real.

209
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,080
 You still believe in these things.

210
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,000
 Even if you don't specifically believe in those things, children have a sense of wonderment.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,320
 They look at the world differently than adults do.

212
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,920
 And what happens is, it's one of the great tragedies of life, is those senses are doled

213
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,440
 over time.

214
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,200
 We actually get worse at being able to perceive things like that as we get older because you

215
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,560
 learn magic doesn't exist.

216
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,360
 So anything that appears magical, you just completely dismiss.

217
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,720
 You may outright not see it.

218
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,360
 It's like quantum physics, the double slit experiment.

219
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
 By simply viewing the phenomenon, you change it.

220
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,960
 A child could be in this apartment and see something that shouldn't exist, but they don't

221
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,280
 understand what should exist and what shouldn't.

222
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,600
 The little girl does realize this is something unique.

223
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
 This is something weird.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,120
 It's nothing she's ever going to see at an aquarium or at a museum or anything like that.

225
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,000
 She knows there's something off about it, but she doesn't understand that this is just

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
 impossible.

227
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,200
 But when you put Abby in there, when you put an adult in there, she looked at it and it

228
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,400
 disappeared.

229
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,840
 She's looking at it through adult eyes.

230
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,680
 It collapsed the phenomenon.

231
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:25,800
 Now she knew it couldn't exist, yet she saw it existing and that collision of two different

232
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 belief systems made her sick to her stomach.

233
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:38,200
 It would ruin your day, but it would start to shatter your reality in a way.

234
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,720
 It's one thing again, if you don't believe in ghosts and you see a ghost, you may go,

235
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,960
 "Well, I understand maybe it's just a trick of the light.

236
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,040
 Maybe I was dreaming when I was walking around."

237
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,440
 But at a certain point, if you don't believe in ghosts and you see a ghost and you have

238
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,360
 a full-on interaction with it, it delivers a message to you in some sense.

239
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,520
 You would have to accept the existence of ghosts.

240
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,720
 If you just woke up in the middle of the night and you saw your dead grandpa standing at the

241
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,640
 end of your bed, you could come up with a hundred scenarios to say that doesn't exist.

242
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,480
 I've met people who are skeptical of ghosts that have had paranormal encounters and then

243
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,920
 they simply forget about them.

244
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,840
 We will be together, we will see something.

245
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,000
 And then years later, this happened on my buddy Josh.

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,760
 I remember we used to go ghost hunting in these large groups.

247
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,400
 We had this really bizarre phenomenon that happened with a shadow man.

248
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
 And years later, I mentioned it to him and he's like, "I don't know what you're talking

249
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 about.

250
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I don't know what you're talking about."

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I was like, "You were there.

252
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 You were there.

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 We talked about it immediately afterwards.

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
 I don't know what you're talking about.

255
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 It happens.

256
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:51,040
 I've seen that happen to a couple different people."

257
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,360
 But I mean, so you do have the ability to just kind of shut down that part of your brain,

258
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
 right?

259
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,560
 You totally didn't believe in ghosts and now you've heard about ghosts all your life and

260
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,360
 you don't believe them and now you've interacted with a ghost that you can't deny that what

261
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,960
 you saw wasn't a dream.

262
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
 It wasn't tricking the mind.

263
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,960
 You're not losing yourself.

264
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,640
 You're not going insane.

265
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,000
 It was a ghost.

266
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,880
 You have to go, "Well, then I guess this ghost existed.

267
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,760
 I don't know if everyone else's ghost stories or anything like that."

268
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:26,040
 But you have that framework, a floating blob of ink in your friend's apartment in the middle

269
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,440
 of the day.

270
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,240
 It really is going to mess with your head.

271
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,560
 If you don't believe in any of this type of stuff and you see something that bizarre,

272
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,240
 that out of the norm, it really could, at the very least it wouldn't make you sick to

273
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
 your stomach.

274
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,520
 And as you talk to other people about it and they dismissed it, you would just, it would

275
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,440
 just be better to keep your mouth shut rather than be ridiculed.

276
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,280
 So it's interesting because you think how many other people experience this totally bizarre

277
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,320
 phenomenon and don't tell anyone because they're afraid of being made fun of.

278
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,960
 It's a lot of people.

279
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
 It's a lot of people.

280
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,160
 Whether or not they believed in the paranormal before or after the story or whether or not

281
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,840
 they saw it and still refused to believe, they actually will try to forget and eventually

282
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,560
 will forget they ever saw that.

283
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,160
 I think paranormal phenomenon is more common than we think.

284
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,440
 Just people don't report it because it sounds insane.

285
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,160
 Middle of the day, a black.

286
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,160
 She didn't even tell her friends who were there when it happened.

287
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,000
 Oh my God, well I just saw this because she knew she'd get ridiculed.

288
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,920
 Also I think she also felt sick to her stomach and she saw something that shouldn't exist

289
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,440
 in her friend's apartment.

290
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,040
 And then the really kind of creepy way to end the story is, remember it started off with

291
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,040
 her sitting on the couch and hearing the little girl running around.

292
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,920
 She got that gut feeling.

293
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,200
 She should go check it out.

294
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:56,440
 What would have happened if Samantha had caught up to the blob?

295
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
 We'll never know.

296
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,760
 They ended up moving out of that apartment a short time later.

297
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,680
 The roommate got kicked out and got evicted.

298
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,120
 But that apartment's still out there.

299
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,760
 Is the blob still there?

300
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,320
 Is there still some sort of weird entity, some sort of interdimensional force or creature

301
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,800
 or whatever just floating around there?

302
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
 Who knows?

303
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,360
 But I think it is creepy what if the girl had caught it?

304
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,160
 I mean it's possible we see so many stories of people just, like imagine if you're sitting

305
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,320
 there and you hear a little girl running around in the kitchen and then all of a sudden the

306
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,200
 kitchen goes quiet and you're really not putting two and two together.

307
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,560
 You're just sitting there having fun with your friends.

308
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,720
 You're not really keyed into all the other stuff.

309
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,120
 And then after a while someone walks in the kitchen and there's a dead seven year old

310
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,600
 laying there.

311
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,440
 And of course she called 911.

312
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,000
 The medics come out and they go, "Yeah, we don't know what it was.

313
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,120
 We don't know why this seven year old just dropped dead.

314
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,720
 It looks like she had some sort of heart attack."

315
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,400
 She doesn't have any genetic issues.

316
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,280
 It's not like she had any flaws with her heart.

317
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,680
 But yet here we have a seven year old who had a heart attack.

318
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,680
 And what happened was she ended up catching this thing and released some sort of electrical

319
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
 discharge and stopped her heart.

320
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,560
 It would just be a tragedy, a family tragedy.

321
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,200
 A seven year old dropped dead, did the autopsy.

322
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,560
 We don't know what caused it but it's obviously natural causes she had a heart attack.

323
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,480
 Because that stuff does happen.

324
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,040
 Science because we don't know what happened.

325
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:41,400
 We can't explain it but what would have happened had she caught that glob.

326
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
 Fascinating story.

327
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
 Fascinating story.

328
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,200
 Greg, let's go ahead and tashie the keys to the carbonar copter.

329
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,200
 We are leaving behind this apartment.

330
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 It's probably still out there.

331
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,640
 It's probably, you're like chasing, you got real dark real quick.

332
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,680
 You're talking about a girl chasing a blob.

333
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,280
 You're like, "What is he at heart attack?"

334
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,640
 Greg, let's go ahead and tashie the keys to the carbonar copter.

335
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,600
 We're saying goodbye to this apartment.

336
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:09,160
 Take us all the way out to a local Kmart.

337
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:17,920
 Before we get the next story started I want to do a really quick dead rabbit recommends.

338
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
 Man, I saw this movie.

339
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,680
 It was so weird the other day.

340
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,400
 It's funny when I tell people the title they're like, "What?

341
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,280
 Sounds like a Jason movie."

342
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,160
 It was called "The Girl in the Crawl Space."

343
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,760
 And based on the title you could probably figure out the plot, right?

344
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,560
 It's about a girl in a crawl space.

345
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,800
 I watch a lot of horror movies.

346
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,600
 So maybe like some sort of slasher chasing a girl through a house.

347
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,800
 The movie begins with her escaping from the crawl space.

348
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,040
 And it's about her experience back in real life.

349
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,560
 But it's not some dumb drama.

350
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,480
 It is so weird.

351
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,400
 An interesting component of it is that the script is awesome.

352
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,400
 There are these monologues and these scenes that you're like someone really crafted these

353
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
 words.

354
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,720
 They have a lot of really cool scenes.

355
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,040
 A lot of really good characters.

356
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,640
 A lot of really good acting.

357
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,400
 The cinematography is not good.

358
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,200
 I don't think it's because the person was a bad cinematographer.

359
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,320
 I think it's a budget thing.

360
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,280
 The movie felt like it was very, very...

361
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,480
 It wasn't like straight up like August Mortem Underground or anything like that.

362
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,560
 It wasn't like Gateway Meet.

363
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,360
 It's not one of these really bad cinematography movies.

364
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
 But you know what I'm saying?

365
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,240
 You could tell they did not have the budget to get the best cameras.

366
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,480
 It was one of those movies that looks like they're like, "Hey, it's in the afternoon.

367
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,400
 Let's start shooting a scene right now."

368
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,200
 It's just weird scene to it.

369
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
 So you gotta go in knowing that.

370
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
 That doesn't bug me.

371
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,120
 That doesn't bug me at all because I watch stuff like Gateway Meet and there's just

372
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,320
 no cinematography at all.

373
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,000
 But you have this movie about this girl.

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,760
 It starts off with her escaping the crawl space and it's not a drama.

375
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,440
 I guess it's still a horror movie with dramatic elements.

376
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,320
 I don't watch dramas, so I wouldn't recommend one.

377
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,600
 But it is so interesting.

378
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:35,160
 It is so interesting from scene to scene that I would argue maybe 30% of the movie has zero

379
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,960
 to do with the plot.

380
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
 I've never seen anything.

381
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,000
 It's like this movie was either made by a genius or an amateur who didn't know how good

382
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,480
 they are because there's so much of the movie that any editor would be like, "Dude, why do

383
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,280
 you have all of this stuff in here?

384
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,160
 It's not moving the plot ahead at all, but it informs the characters so much.

385
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,920
 You learn to love certain characters just because of their antics that have nothing to do with

386
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,560
 the plot."

387
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,240
 And the plot itself is just wild.

388
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,840
 It's so weird.

389
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,960
 And it keeps getting weirder and weirder and weirder.

390
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,880
 And it got to the point where I go, "This movie is going to come down to the last five

391
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
 minutes."

392
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,640
 Like depending on how they end this movie, I'm either going to really, really enjoy this

393
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,840
 movie or be like, "It was just okay because the ride had been...it was not going to be

394
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
 bad no matter what the ending was.

395
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
 I wasn't going to be like, 'This is a bad movie.'"

396
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,440
 Because I had so much fun getting there.

397
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,840
 The last five minutes, they did it for me.

398
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,480
 I was like, "Didn't see it coming.

399
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,440
 They totally set that up.

400
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,920
 Didn't see it coming.

401
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
 Bravo."

402
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,120
 Very, very, very well-made movie, especially in the constraints of the budget as well.

403
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,920
 The girl in the crawl space.

404
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
 Just a fun...

405
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
 It's not fun actually.

406
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
 It's about torment.

407
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,040
 It's about torment and what the human soul can go through.

408
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,760
 But just great acting, great riding, twists and turns, weird stuff, weird visuals kind

409
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
 of.

410
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,040
 I mean, as much as you can have weird visuals in a low budget movie, it fascinates them.

411
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,080
 Dead Rabbit recommends the girl in the crawl space.

412
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,400
 So one of those movies that each scene gives you a little bit more information about a

413
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
 character.

414
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
 And I love that.

415
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 That's really hard to do.

416
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,000
 You walk in a room and they'll be like, "Jag it."

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,920
 Ever since your wife was killed by the Colombians, you've been on a one-man mission to take down

418
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
 the cartels.

419
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,200
 And you're like, "Okay, I mean, that's fair.

420
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,160
 We're watching a movie.

421
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
 We're watching an action film.

422
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,400
 We don't need to know much about this guy."

423
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,720
 The girl in the crawl space is totally different.

424
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
 There's a...

425
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,680
 My favorite character in it is the husband.

426
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,680
 And every scene has nothing to do with the girl in the crawl space.

427
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
 He has nothing to do with the plot.

428
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,720
 And this husband, every scene, you learn something new about him.

429
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 And he is...

430
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,400
 I mean, he's obviously like a main character in the story, which is odd because he has

431
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,320
 nothing to do with anything else.

432
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
 Each scene, a character will make a comment.

433
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,240
 They'll have this scene and the character will make a comment and he'll be like, "Yeah,

434
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
 I know."

435
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
 But...

436
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,360
 And you're like, "I didn't know that.

437
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,320
 I totally didn't know that about him."

438
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,840
 Someone makes a comment about him and then we find out more about him and his relationship

439
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,240
 with other people and why this happened.

440
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,800
 And it's a very, very just well-written movie, "The Girl in the Crawl Space."

441
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,320
 Okay, let's move on to this next story.

442
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,200
 You know, it's funny the way I put together this show.

443
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,040
 It's quite slapdash.

444
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,880
 I pick stories pretty much at random.

445
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,560
 I try to find different stories, so I try not to do two alien stories in an episode

446
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,520
 or two ghost stories in an episode.

447
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,600
 Kind of mix it up.

448
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,160
 And sometimes we see similarities between the stories.

449
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,240
 And this is no exception.

450
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,720
 I actually, when I was reading that last story, I go, "Hmm, interesting.

451
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,880
 Some of the visuals are the same."

452
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,200
 But it's a quite different story.

453
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,800
 No children will have heart attacks in this story.

454
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,920
 We're walking around this Kmart.

455
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,720
 I haven't been to Kmart in years.

456
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,760
 I don't know if they still exist.

457
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,240
 It's a big giant department store.

458
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,720
 Walking around, you can get anything from your Atari 2600 to a brand new LaTigra shirt.

459
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,240
 It's fantastic.

460
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,120
 It's a good store if you're in the 1980s and there's no Walmart's around.

461
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
 Kmart.

462
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,440
 Just just shopping them all the time, actually.

463
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
 That's where we're at right now.

464
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,960
 We're about to meet longtime supporter of the show, Hot Diggity Dane.

465
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,080
 Hot Diggity Dane, longtime supporter of the show.

466
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,280
 He's one of the mods on the Patreon Discord, along with Mason.

467
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,520
 They do a great job keeping everyone else from slowly losing their mind and posting insane

468
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
 memes.

469
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,120
 They help out a lot with the Patreon Discord, for sure.

470
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,360
 Hot Diggity Dane recently posted this on the Patreon Discord.

471
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,720
 He said, "Episode 1005, you talked about interacting with ghosts, people interacting

472
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
 with ghosts."

473
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,720
 And he said, "Let me tell you a story about my dad.

474
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:11,200
 That my dad had told me when I was just a child."

475
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
 So that's the setup for this story.

476
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,240
 We're going to meet Hot Diggity Dad, aka, we're going to go ahead and call him Michael.

477
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,760
 I don't know if that's his real name.

478
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,600
 If that is, it's just a guess.

479
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
 Hot Diggity Dad, aka Michael, has this story.

480
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,280
 He goes, "One day I was walking through Kmart.

481
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:38,080
 When I ran into an old friend from high school, I hadn't seen this guy in years in a long

482
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
 time.

483
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,680
 He was a good guy.

484
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,200
 We didn't stop hanging out because of any particular reason, just life.

485
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,640
 People just kind of move on.

486
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,080
 I was excited to see him, but life.

487
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,640
 I got stuff to do.

488
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:04,000
 It was really cool to run into an old high school buddy of mine, but I'm on my way to

489
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,540
 do something else.

490
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,920
 So we engaged in small talk.

491
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
 Shit chat.

492
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
 We didn't talk long.

493
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,200
 It was just a couple minutes.

494
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
 It was nice to see him.

495
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,840
 It definitely wasn't nice to see him again, but I had stuff to do.

496
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,600
 So hey, Johnny, hey, what's up?

497
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,840
 Man, I haven't seen him forever.

498
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,920
 Oh my God, dude, what have you been up to?

499
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
 What that?

500
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,640
 Oh yeah, no, I'm doing good.

501
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,760
 I'm shopping to Kmart.

502
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
 I'm not doing that good.

503
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,000
 I am shopping to Kmart, but no, it's really cool.

504
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 How's so-and-so?

505
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,320
 Oh no, casual conversation.

506
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,800
 We have these types of conversations all the time.

507
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,440
 He goes, "We talked for a couple minutes and then, hey, I got to get going.

508
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,840
 Sorry, we're going to have more time to talk.

509
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,400
 But Johnny, I hope to see you around.

510
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,680
 Are you back in the area?

511
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,200
 It's been years since I've seen you.

512
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
 I got to run."

513
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
 Oh yeah, no, it's fine.

514
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
 It's fine, Michael.

515
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,760
 It was nice to run into you, too.

516
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,480
 And as Michael is saying goodbye to his old high school buddy, Michael goes, "I was walking

517
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,520
 away and I looked and..."

518
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,760
 We're just calling him Johnny.

519
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,920
 That was the name I made up during their fake dialogue.

520
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,480
 Johnny goes, "I turn around.

521
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,400
 Johnny's staring up at the ceiling."

522
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,160
 I thought it was weird.

523
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,520
 That was odd.

524
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,400
 He wasn't a big ceiling sterrer in high school.

525
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,520
 It's not what he was known for.

526
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,720
 Here we are in this Kmart and I got my stuff and I'm on my way and I look and he's just

527
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,440
 staring up at the ceiling.

528
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,560
 And I didn't think a lot of it at the time.

529
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,200
 I just thought it was weird.

530
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
 Like what?

531
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
 You know, but I'm busy.

532
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
 I'm busy.

533
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 I got stuff to do.

534
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
 It's just kind of a weird way.

535
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 I think that's the conversation again.

536
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,880
 That's not what he was known for.

537
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,040
 If he was known for that, then I'd be like, "Oh, it's typical Johnny.

538
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
 Staring up them ceilings."

539
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:07,800
 I walk away and he's staring up at the ceiling as he's standing in the middle of this Kmart.

540
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,720
 The next day, Michael gets a phone call.

541
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:21,160
 Hello, this is Michael.

542
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
 Working at Kmart.

543
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
 I'm working at Kmart now.

544
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
 That's what I do.

545
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
 Can I help you with anything?

546
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,360
 He gets a phone call and it's an old friend.

547
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,400
 Just a mutual friend that him and Johnny both knew when they went to school together.

548
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,360
 We'll go ahead and call this guy Bill.

549
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
 Hey Bill, what's up?

550
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
 How's everything going?

551
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,440
 I haven't heard from you in a long time.

552
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:50,640
 Bill goes, "You know, things are okay, but you know..."

553
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,320
 Michael, I'm calling to deliver some bad news.

554
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:02,360
 Kind of calling everyone that I know of who knew Johnny.

555
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:08,400
 Two days ago, Johnny killed himself.

556
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,880
 I'm sure that the friend went on to talk about, like, you know, this is when we're going to

557
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
 have the service.

558
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,360
 This is how the family's doing.

559
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,880
 Giving Michael some more information, but Michael's just sitting there on the phone and he's

560
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,320
 thinking, "Wait a second.

561
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,760
 I saw Johnny yesterday."

562
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:35,520
 Dude, are you sure?

563
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,120
 This isn't some sort of horrible prank.

564
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
 This isn't some sort of joke.

565
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,520
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

566
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
 No, Michael.

567
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,320
 Not joking.

568
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,240
 Johnny killed himself two days ago.

569
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,320
 I know it's a shock.

570
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,120
 I know we haven't all kept up, but yeah.

571
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,560
 This is, you know, we're going to have these arrangements for him in school.

572
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:10,640
 So what Michael realizes at this point was that he saw Johnny the day after he died.

573
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,720
 The day after he had killed himself, Michael ran into him in the middle of a Kmart, had

574
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,680
 a conversation with him.

575
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
 Small talk.

576
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,160
 And then Michael left.

577
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,920
 And Michael, when he tells his story to Hot Diggity Dane, he says, you know, "I wish

578
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:39,840
 I deeply regret that I didn't take more time to talk to an old high school buddy who, at

579
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,200
 the time I was talking to him, committed suicide the day before."

580
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:56,760
 It's an, you know, this is one of those super interesting, like what I like to call like

581
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,960
 the day-to-day paranormal type stories.

582
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,160
 Where obviously this was a huge event in Michael's life.

583
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,080
 It probably did.

584
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
 Stick with him.

585
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,160
 You know, he's telling his son about it.

586
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,320
 This is one of those stories that, sure, someone could go like, you know, you talk about a

587
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,200
 floating blob in a kitchen, your boyfriend could just be like, "Shut up.

588
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
 That's stupid.

589
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
 That doesn't exist."

590
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,760
 Someone tells you this story, even if you don't believe in ghosts, there's a certain

591
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,400
 reverence to the "I was visited by a loved one after they passed" story.

592
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,600
 I've met people personally who say, "I don't believe in ghosts at all."

593
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,640
 But when people tell me that they were visited by a dead loved one in their dreams, I believe

594
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,800
 that.

595
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 Believe in air quotes, basically, saying, "I'm not going to question that.

596
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,680
 I'm not going to try to debunk that."

597
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,840
 I've run into quite a few people like that, skeptics, who don't believe in the paranormal,

598
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,880
 because there is a certain reverence to it, right?

599
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,080
 At the end of the day, whether or not it's a dream or it's grief manifesting itself or

600
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,560
 it's an actual spirit from beyond, you're not going to be like, "Well, actually, did

601
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,760
 you check your carbon monoxide detectors?"

602
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,080
 Like it's a deeply personal story.

603
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,760
 As opposed to I was in a haunted graveyard and I saw a goblin jump out from behind a

604
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
 grave.

605
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
 You know, you could say, "I don't believe you."

606
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,360
 And this is why I'm actually three goblins wearing a trench coat right now.

607
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,280
 The goblins were with you all along, not just in the graveyard.

608
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,360
 These type of stories people tend not to debunk, because they're really, what's the point?

609
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,960
 It's the story of a man saying goodbye to a friend.

610
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,360
 It's definitely a weird one.

611
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,360
 This is one of the stories that I do think happened, not just because of who I'm getting

612
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,680
 it from, like Hot Diggity Day.

613
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,440
 I mean, his dad could be making it up.

614
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,960
 Again, what would be the point?

615
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:52,120
 What would be the point in terrifying your son?

616
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,640
 We talk a lot about this.

617
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,960
 I think this is what we were talking about on episode 1005.

618
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,000
 It's like, how many ghosts do you think we interact with on a daily basis?

619
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,040
 The other day I was walking home, probably like one in the afternoon, noon, something

620
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
 around that.

621
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,760
 I had just gone to get coffee at a local coffee shop.

622
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,360
 I was walking down the street.

623
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,640
 I heard little kids giggling.

624
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,480
 I turned and I looked and I didn't see any kids.

625
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,960
 My brain goes they're on the other side of that car.

626
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,120
 They must have just gotten out of this minivan.

627
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,240
 That's the most likely answer.

628
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
 I didn't see any parents.

629
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,320
 I didn't see any kids.

630
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,040
 The giggling came right from the other side of this minivan that was parked on a relatively

631
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
 busy street.

632
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,360
 Then I never saw any kids.

633
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
 I never saw any kids.

634
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:47,000
 I think when you hear noises, when you hear people, when you see people during the day,

635
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,280
 you assume you're going to see people and hear people during the day.

636
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,000
 So you don't chalk it up as paranormal.

637
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,980
 You assume you're going to see other living, breathing humans in a Kmart and maybe even

638
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
 an old friend.

639
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,920
 So it doesn't click with you immediately when you see something that's weird, that it's

640
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
 a ghost.

641
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,360
 If you hear kids giggling in the clothing racks at a department store, you assume there's

642
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,120
 a real kid in there and he's hiding from his mom.

643
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,720
 You don't understand that that kid's been in there for 30 years and his skeletal hands

644
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,160
 are gripping around the center rack hoping someone will reach in so he can suck them

645
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,280
 into his own hellish dimension.

646
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
 You don't assume that.

647
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,960
 You never even thought that that was a possibility, but it's possible in the world of paranormal.

648
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
 So you have that.

649
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,080
 You have them interacting with it, but then also just this whole idea of the tragedy of

650
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,160
 the suicide.

651
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,840
 When I read this story, thanks for sending it over.

652
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,720
 When I read this story, I was thinking about it, it reminded me of those times where sometimes

653
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,600
 we have friends that we like them infinitely more than they could ever like us.

654
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,840
 Not saying that they dislike us, but there are some friendships that are so close, but

655
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
 they're a little one-sided.

656
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,320
 And again, I'm not saying in a bad way.

657
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,520
 I'm not saying someone's taking advantage of you, but you can have a friend that you

658
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
 really really like.

659
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,200
 If you could, you would spend all your time with this particular friend and they just

660
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,560
 want to hang out with you every month or two.

661
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:23,920
 And I wonder if that was the relationship between Michael and Johnny.

662
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,720
 You know, I have friends like if they stopped in to visit me, like I would just kind of drop

663
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,080
 everything and you know, tell work, hey, I can't come in for a couple of days.

664
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,960
 My buddy from across the country or my buddy that I haven't seen in years since high school

665
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,880
 is here, you know, I'm going to take a couple of days off, hang out because I haven't seen

666
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
 him in years.

667
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,000
 I don't know if they would do that for me, but it doesn't matter.

668
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,160
 I'm not saying that that's a bad friendship at all.

669
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
 I'm not saying that at all.

670
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
 But you know what I mean?

671
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,760
 Like, that's just the way life is.

672
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,200
 And I'm wondering, I mean, you imagine out of all the people that Johnny wanted to say

673
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:08,400
 goodbye to and it wasn't even like he appeared and goes, goodbye, I'll never see you again.

674
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,880
 And then he floated away like he just wanted to talk to Michael one last time.

675
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,720
 And you know, Michael had stuff to do.

676
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,320
 Just small talk, talked for a couple of minutes and then they passed on.

677
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:31,920
 And it's just so interesting because Johnny defied the laws of death to go talk to his

678
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,080
 high school buddy that hadn't seen him in years.

679
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,720
 And you wonder if like this whole time Johnny was thinking like, oh, I wonder what my, you

680
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,280
 know, my high school buddies are up to.

681
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,800
 I wonder what Michael's up to.

682
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,320
 And again, it sounds bad.

683
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,960
 It's I'm not trying to say that Michael's a bad friend or anything like that.

684
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
 We just have different.

685
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,360
 Does this is you're like, no, Jason, you're clearly making like his souls floating around.

686
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,280
 He's like, and now to see my best friend Michael and Michael's holding a bunch of groceries.

687
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,560
 He's like, Hey, I got to go.

688
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,680
 I'm not saying that at all.

689
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
 I don't know.

690
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
 It'd be interesting.

691
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,240
 Like if the roles were reversed, if Michael died, sorry, hot diggity dane, if Michael died

692
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,160
 and Johnny was still alive, would Johnny be one of the last people Michael would want

693
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,400
 to see on earth?

694
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,840
 Would that be one of the people that he slips through the bonds of the afterlife to go visit?

695
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,160
 I don't know.

696
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
 It's fascinating.

697
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
 I can't think about it.

698
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
 He's super depressing.

699
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,560
 If you're a ghost and you're like, and now to see my best friend from high school.

700
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,280
 And then you land in the middle of Kmart and he's like, Hey, buddy, yeah, yeah.

701
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,680
 You just talk about like the weather and how families do.

702
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
 And he's like, how are you doing?

703
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,760
 And he's like, well, you know, not good.

704
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,680
 You'll be getting some bad news in a couple of days.

705
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,000
 But and it's just chit chat.

706
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,440
 But who knows who knows.

707
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:52,300
 I'm really putting a lot of like human emotions and human desires on this story.

708
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,040
 It's possible Johnny just wanted to say goodbye to a bunch of people.

709
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,720
 And this was his way of doing it.

710
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,200
 And just the imagery, like the final imagery of Johnny looking up at the ceiling, like

711
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:12,080
 it obviously that to me makes it seem like something is calling him home.

712
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
 Right.

713
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,160
 He's headed up to the afterlife.

714
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
 He's headed up to heaven.

715
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,040
 Something's calling him home and he's looking up.

716
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:25,440
 He's hearing something that no mortal man hears until he's no longer mortal.

717
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,160
 But Johnny wanted to see his buddy one last time.

718
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,240
 I think I've leaned really heavily into the part.

719
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,240
 I do not think that Michael is a bad friend.

720
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,040
 You're like, wow, dude, I'm not ever recommending a personal ghost story to you.

721
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,440
 I'm afraid you're going to read to it anyway.

722
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,640
 I'm not saying Michael's a bad friend, but I just find it fascinating that he does come

723
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,000
 into visit him.

724
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,640
 And one final note before we wrap this up, I think it's interesting.

725
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:55,040
 A lot of times we'll see stories where somebody goes.

726
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,440
 I woke up in the middle of the night.

727
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,320
 A loved one was by my bedside.

728
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,840
 They sat there on my bed and they said, don't worry, everything's going to be okay.

729
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,480
 And then they disappeared.

730
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:14,600
 And then I found out later that was the same time they died in the hospital.

731
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
 You see those stories a lot.

732
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,640
 And I'm not discounting those stories at all.

733
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,760
 What I find interesting about this one, it was a full day since Johnny had killed himself

734
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,840
 that he appears in the Kmart to Michael.

735
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,480
 And really as a ghost, he could have appeared in the middle of Michael's house.

736
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,440
 He could have appeared in Michael's car as he was driving down the road.

737
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,880
 He could have appeared to him anywhere, but it almost like he appeared in the place that

738
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,800
 would scare him the least.

739
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,200
 So even in death, Johnny was a good friend.

740
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,840
 Johnny didn't want to scare his buddy.

741
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,160
 He just wanted to say, hey, what's up?

742
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,200
 Talk to his buddy for a few minutes one last time.

743
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,120
 Then something calls to him from the beyond.

744
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,000
 He looks up.

745
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,920
 Michael sees him looking at the ceiling, but he's looking past that ceiling.

746
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,720
 He's seeing sights that we will never see until we see those sights ourselves.

747
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:19,480
 And then he goes home.

748
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,480
 Johnny may not have found peace in this life, but he'll find it in the next.

749
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:35,120
 And he'll be waiting in paradise for his friends to join him.
