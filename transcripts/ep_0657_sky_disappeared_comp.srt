00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 A man, a car, and a death in the middle of the afternoon in Hollywood.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,000
 We've all heard of the stories of a cursed film, but today we're going to take a look at a cursed script.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,500
 And then we traveled to Scotland to go on a camping trip with the man and his dog.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 It was just intended to be a fun night, but we don't cover fun nights on this podcast.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
 It's supposed to be intended to be a normal, non-paranormal night.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 But instead, he came face to face with eternal darkness, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 [music]

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm having a great day. You guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an awesome week, and we got a ton of stuff to cover.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 So first off, let's introduce our newest Patreon supporter. We're getting so many Patreon supporters. I really, really appreciate this, guys.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Our newest Patreon supporter, writing in on himself, because there's no way I can top this name. There's no object that can come in on.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Our newest Patreon supporter, a creamy squid.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 [makes squid noises]

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It's a, I don't know if it's a squid made of cream. I don't know if it's a squid. It shoots out cream. Both are disgusting.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 But a creamy squid, as you ooze your way into Dead Rabbit Command, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon, or if you're not that disgusting, that's preferable. The second part is, just spread the word about the show.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Really, really helps out a lot. Creamy squid. Squids have what, 10 arms, right? Doesn't matter. I'm just going to toss you the keys.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I'm not going to toss you 10 sets of keys. A creamy squid. I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're taking a trip down to California, specifically, Hollywood.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 [makes squid noises]

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I don't know why I'm doing that song this story. It's super depressing.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Probably shouldn't have a funny, copyright-free version of Huey Lewis in the News.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 It's Sunset Boulevard. This happened just yesterday, April 24th.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 April 24th, 2021. We're on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. It's 237.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I know you're going to imagine, I know you're going to imagine a creamy squid driving a car during the segment, but everything else is completely serious.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 This is tragic. There's a police officer on route to a distress call, a phone call. Help me, help me.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's Lois Lane falling off a building. He's on his way to the scene of a crime or traffic stop. It doesn't matter.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 He's there on police business, and as he's driving down the road, a car cuts him off in the cop's side.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 That was the wrong person to cut off. I have lights on, obviously.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Then the car in front of the cop hits their brakes. The police officer then has to brake.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So now both cars are coming to a stop, and then the car in front of the officer hits reverse and crashes into the car.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So first off, you could think, maybe the guy didn't see me, maybe it's a blind guy and I should pull him over for driving, or he's just a jerk or whatever.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 We'll give him a ticket. But once he starts doing all that other shenanigans, something's really up.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Police officer jumps out, the driver jumps out. Police officer sizes him up and realizes he's wearing bulletproof vest, wearing bulletproof armor.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And he has one arm behind his back. And he goes three, two... I don't know if he sounded like the Joker, but he probably did, considering the details are about to go to you.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Riddle me this, police officer. Three, two, one. And as the man starts moving his hand from behind his back, which the police officer figures as a gun, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, he shoots the dude, guy dies.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 We don't know the name of this suspect, we don't have an age or anything, this information is coming out, it's brand new.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Street level crime. It happens all the time, this is a true crime podcast, but we don't normally cover local news stories.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 What we do, but when they involve weird stuff, this story got really weird really quickly.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I saw it on the news, officer involved shooting in Hollywood and I was like, okay, that sucks, but it happens.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Quickly after this, images of this man's vehicle started to appear online. The car was one of those cars that had writing all over it, like it says, "Toriota," where it has like, you could tell they bought decals, like the car from Stephen King killed John Lennon.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Just so one of my favorite conspiracy theories of all time, I covered it in two episodes, episode four and five. I don't think I've ever done a double episode like that before.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 They used their whole vehicle, basically imagine bumper stickers, but the bumper stickers are a sentence instead of just little individual sentences.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 They're a paragraph, they tell a whole story, it's all chapter one on the bumper. These were what the decals on its car said. One of them said 333, the other one said 666, that's not good, right?

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 One of them said New World Order, and then underneath it, Women Rule.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And when I first read it, it's funny, someone was joking about it on the X-Board, when I first read it, I thought he was saying, "Go women!"

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It was just a weird, like, I don't know if that's what he's saying, I don't know if he's a huge fan of women, he has a little pinnit that says women.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Well, he doesn't have anything now, because he's unfortunately been shot. I mean, he's obviously suffering from some sort of mental distress, but Women Rule, I don't know if that's like an anti-feminist thing or a pro-feminist thing.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Then he has a paragraph on his door, it goes across both car doors. All the T's are upside down, there's a ton of misspellings, and this is what it says.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And thank you to the anonymous user on X who helped translate this, because I was like, I'm having a hard time with that last two sentences.

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 This is what it says, "I'm Truman, I'm Satan, lost angel of Hollywood." That's actually really evocative, it's interesting.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 The reason why I wanted to read this is because it's kind of cool. It's kind of punk rock, the problem is, is that I think you took it seriously.

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 If these were lines in a Marilyn Manson song, it'd be dope. I'm Truman is a reference to what I believe at least, the Truman Show delusion.

54
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 We covered it on a show a long time ago, I'll put it in the show notes.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 There are people who believe the entire world revolves around them to the point that everything is a movie set and they're constantly being filmed. It's a deeper version of gangstalking where they're the star of a television show and we're all watching it.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 I'm Truman, I'm Satan, lost angel of Hollywood. I'm a rock star. Jesus Christ is my son, he is black. Mary is my wife.

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I guess I got a glossed over all that stuff. I wanted to detail about the Truman Show and I'm just like, "Oh yeah, no, he just happened to be Jesus's dad."

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I just keep going on. When you research this stuff long enough, I'm like, "Oh, that's normal, I've seen stuff like that before."

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So let me continue before I actually break this down, even though I did gloss over that. Jesus Christ is my son, he is black. Mary is my wife.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 We created this world, not God. Take our son off the cross, cancel all Bibles. So that's just weird, right?

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Because kind of a key component of Jesus is that fact that I don't want to say, whenever I turn into a biblical podcast, people shut it off.

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But a key point of Jesus Christ is the fact that he was crucified and he came back from the dead.

63
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Is he saying that that never happened, that that was fake news? Is he saying that it did happen but don't have an icon of it?

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Is he saying that he created the universe if God did? Is he 2000 years old? Is this man that he happened to be a giant beard when the police shot him?

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And then just when he thought it couldn't get any more confusing, he's Jesus's dad. God isn't. Mary is his wife.

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And take my son off the cross, take my son off the cross, cancel all Bibles, which again is bizarre.

67
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 He then goes on to say, Mary is Illuminati. So now Mary is a bad guy? He's looking over at his wife and his wife's a lizard person?

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 It's funny, I originally just had this segment about how I thought conspiracy theorists were going to be committing more crimes and I said something on a recent episode.

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I didn't think I'd do a breakdown of this as much, but now that I'm in the haunted closet studio, I'm looking at it.

70
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 He's married to Mary and Mary is the mother of Jesus, but she's also Illuminati, so wouldn't that make him an ally of the Illuminati?

71
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Maybe he is. Maybe he is. Maybe he is. He does have 666 New World Order on his car, but he also says that women rule, so who knows.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Mary is Illuminati, and then he goes, you're all in my matrix and then free my son.

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Satan is the ending. So he's pleading to Satan to free his son, or possibly free my son.

74
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Satan. That's his signature because there's a little comma there. Maybe he is Satan.

75
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's really hard to tell, it could be because he has 666 on his car. I don't think Satan's the world's biggest feminist. That kind of throws me off.

76
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Women rule. I guess someone, and who knows about this, but someone did pull out an archived post from the export on April 21st saying,

77
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 "F at all, I'm doing this, watch the news." And it went on for maybe 8 or 10 comments.

78
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And he goes, "I'm going to hell and devil's going to give me high five and stuff like that." And then the thread just kind of ends.

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 So that could have been this dude. Maybe not. Maybe it's a totally unrelated thing. That's the thing with an anonymous board.

80
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 We don't know. Law enforcement obviously knows. All of those websites are heavily, heavily monitored.

81
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Doesn't matter how many VPNs you're hiding behind. Everyone knows what you're doing online.

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 But it's an interesting story. The reason why I wanted to tell it, I didn't expect for it to go on this long, is I do believe we're reaching a zenith

83
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 of where we're going to start to see more weirdos acting out their conspiracy fantasies.

84
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Because once the fuel runs out on those conspiracies, once you realize that X event isn't going to happen, that this great thing isn't going to happen,

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 that the awakening or the blue beam invasion or the downfall or whatever it is isn't going to happen.

86
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Most rational people go, "Oh, that guy said the world's going to end and it didn't end, but I'll let him predict it two more times."

87
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And after two more times they go, "Oh, okay. I was fooled." Or they'll figure out a way to back out to get out of that sunken cost fallacy.

88
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 That's how most people deal with it. And they just stop talking about it.

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And the best thing you can do is never bring a backup. If you know someone who believed in a failed prophecy, like 2012 or something like that,

90
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 don't keep going, "Hey man, well, there's mine, God's treating you." Just kind of drop it after a certain point, even though they were super adamant beforehand.

91
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 But some of them are going, a very, very small minority of them are going to act out on it.

92
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 But when you have more people than ever believing in conspiracy theories, I don't have a, I don't have proof of that,

93
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 but it just feels like more people than ever on every political aisle, every religious group believes in conspiracy theories more than ever.

94
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 That small minority is bigger than it used to be.

95
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 So I think we're going to see more stuff like this, more people jumping out.

96
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And it's funny because when I first saw the headline, I thought, I thought immediately pop, "Suicide by Cop."

97
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 When I was kind of looking at the article, I didn't really dig into it and was first on the news, I go, "Oh, it's some guy probably wanted to kill himself."

98
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But he's wearing body armor. So that wouldn't make sense. Why was he wearing body armor if he wanted to kill himself?

99
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 He may have been on a mission. He may have been trying to wake us up from the Matrix.

100
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 He could have been trying to send a signal to the Illuminati. He should just turned over to his wife, Mary, and go, "Hey, hey, I got a message for you."

101
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 But whatever the case, he's dead because of his delusion.

102
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And I think we're going to see more of it. And that's quite frightening.

103
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 A creamy squid. Let's go ahead and leave the Jason Jalopy here. Hollywood Boulevard, hopefully nobody steals it.

104
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It hasn't been stolen yet, surprisingly, in all the places we've left it.

105
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Let's go ahead and hop in the debt. Wait, no, we're still in Hollywood.

106
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 But because I want to give you another vehicle, let's go ahead and hop on the bunny bicycle.

107
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Whoa, this is so eco-friendly. I just came up with this.

108
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 A creamy squid. You have the honor of taking us on the very first bunny bicycle ride.

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 We're sitting on the handlebars. Wee! Wee!

110
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 We are headed out from this street, Sunset Boulevard, to a movie studio also in Hollywood.

111
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Ling-ling! Ling-ling! That's the bell.

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Jason, I knew what that sound effect was. You dork. I knew. I told you. What's a bicycle bell?

113
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 We pull into a movie set and we're walking around.

114
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Now, I had recently read a Rotten Tomatoes article about cursed films.

115
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And it'll be in the show notes. You guys will feel free to look through it.

116
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I'm sure you guys know most of the stories. The Omen was cursed.

117
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 There's a bunch of people, like some dudes, Uncle died on the set.

118
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Some dudes, Uncle died and then one of the actors died.

119
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And then someone got in a car accident on Omen.

120
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 There's a road in Germany called Omen. They died at like 666 kilometers or something.

121
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 You can tell how enthusiastic I am about all that stuff.

122
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Poltergeist, a couple of people died after the shooting of the movie.

123
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Stuff like that. Cursed films, Rosemary's Baby, and that one really wasn't cursed at all.

124
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 There is an honorable mention. There was a movie, I don't think I ever talked about it on the show.

125
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I watched it probably about a year or two ago when it first came out called Antrum.

126
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 The most dangerous movie ever made. It's one of those...

127
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 The first 10 minutes of it is a mockumentary saying the movie you're about to watch is so demonic

128
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 that everyone who watches it dies.

129
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And here we go. Shout Factories. Releasing in for the first time on DVD.

130
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And it's fake. Like the opening mockumentary stuff, it's all totally made up.

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 The movie itself is actually really interesting. I thought when I watched it I said,

132
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 "Ah, it's okay." So I didn't recommend it on the show. I never talked about it on the show that I can recall.

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I might have mentioned it. I watched it maybe a year and a half ago.

134
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I still remember scenes from it vividly. That to me means it's a good movie in some fashion or another.

135
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 It wasn't terrible. So I don't know if I'd give it a full dead rabbit recommend,

136
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 but if you're looking for something to watch on a Saturday afternoon, Antrum, the most dangerous movie ever made.

137
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Not cursed, though. Not cursed. So I'm reading this list of cursed movies and I'm kind of going through it.

138
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Seen it, seen it. Still alive. Still checking my pulse. Yeah, you have seen it.

139
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Some of them I hadn't seen. I never saw the Omen. I never saw Guinea Pig.

140
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Neither of those movies. They're completely opposite movies, but neither of them really appeal to me.

141
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Omen's just kind of old and boring.

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Anyway, so they're all horror movies, though. They're all horror movies. At the very, very end of the list,

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 even the writer acknowledges now everything else above this was a horror movie. This isn't a horror movie.

144
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 The year is 1963 and there's this guy named Mordecai Richler.

145
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 He writes a book. He's a Canadian satirist. He writes a book called The Incomparable Atook.

146
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It's about an Inuit who travels to the big cities.

147
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Look at me. I'm from this little village and I used to catch fish with a spear, but now I'm in New York City.

148
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Spears are illegal. He's getting knifed. He's getting knifed to death by muggers. It's a very, very short novel.

149
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It was a pretty big novel. People loved it. So, of course, movie studios wanted to make a movie of it.

150
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So, who will play Atook? Who will play this Inuit...

151
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 First off, spoiler alert. None of these people are Native American. None of these people that they're trying to cast are Native American.

152
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So, it would have involved some uncomfortable makeup. But anyways, Atook... Who's going to play Atook?

153
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 The very first choice was John Belushi. Because Atook is like a heavyweight dude.

154
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So, they're like, "That's all they want. They want a funny, heavyweight guy."

155
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 So, the first person they go after is John Belushi. A couple months later, he dies of a drug overdose.

156
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 No one really thinks anything of it. They go to find a new actor. They find Sam Kinnison.

157
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 That's old school. If you guys are younger, you guys don't know who Sam Kinnison is.

158
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

159
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 My dad hated his guts. Hated his guts. Sam Kinnison was pretty much banned from our house.

160
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 My dad hated him. Sam Kinnison, though, was a very, very famous stand-up comedian.

161
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 He was one of the dudes who'd come out and basically yell at the audience. He used to be a minister.

162
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Then he left the ministry and became a really raunchy stand-up comedian.

163
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And he died in a car accident. But he died in a car accident a couple years after reading the script of Atook.

164
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So he read the script. They actually started shooting the movie. He wanted to change some stuff.

165
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 He's like, "How many times can I yell, get drunk, and harass women in this movie?"

166
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And they're like, "None! None of those things!" And he's like, "I'm out."

167
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 He tried making the movie. He died in a car accident much, much later.

168
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And I'm going to take a break here to tell you this little story about Sam Kinnison,

169
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 because I have no other way to fit this in. But I remembered this from my childhood,

170
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 and I think it fits the theme of the show. Sam Kinnison died in this car accident.

171
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 He wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Where are your seatbelts? His girlfriend, or his wife, maybe,

172
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 was in the passenger seat. She had her seatbelt on. Minor injuries.

173
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 He didn't have a seatbelt on. He was headed to a sold-out show, and a drunk, 17-year-old kid crashed into him.

174
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 It was like a head-on collision. Now, this was in, like, the 1980s, the kid causing this accident,

175
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 who killed Sam Kinnison, got like a year in prison.

176
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Drunk driving used to not be a big thing at all. Legally. I mean, obviously, like, morally, and it hurt a lot of people.

177
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 But Sam Kinnison, when he gets in this car accident, the impact basically shredded his internal organs.

178
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He was only going to be alive for a few minutes. Even if Medics got there earlier, there was nothing they could do to save him.

179
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And he's in this car. There's two versions of the story. One, he's in the car, and one, he's outside the car.

180
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Probably wasn't outside the car because of all the internal injuries, but he's dying.

181
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And the woman who was with him, this is what she said happened. He said, "I don't want to die. I don't want to die."

182
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And then there was just a pause. And it was like he was talking to someone. It wasn't like he was crying out to the universe.

183
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It was like he saw something, and he said, "I don't want to die. I don't want to die."

184
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And then there's a pause, and then he goes, "But why?" And then there's another pause, and he goes, "Oh, okay."

185
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And he dies.

186
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Very, very famous story. There's a version of where he went out the car and said that.

187
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And other people heard, and then there's a version where he's saying in the car, but either way, it's just interesting that you did have that near death.

188
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Well, that's not any death experience, but I thought, and I remember hearing that as a kid, and then when I was doing research on for this story,

189
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 that reminded me of it, I wanted to share with you. Kind of creepy, but it's also very peaceful. It's also very peaceful.

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Whether or not my dad hated Sam Kinnison, nobody wants to see people suffer, and he's in a better place.

191
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Little trivia. Little depressing trivia for you.

192
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 The script is then given to John Candy. Dies of a heart attack a few months later.

193
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 At this point, the script does get a reputation of being cursed.

194
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Because now we have three high-profile people who have three very high-profile people who have died, who have been attached to the script at some point.

195
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Two of them within a couple months of reading the script.

196
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Now, you could say, well, the character is an overweight character. They're looking for overweight people.

197
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Other than the drunk driving accident, John Belushi, unfortunately, had drug problems.

198
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 John Candy just had health issues all around. Just coincidence, right?

199
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's definitely possible. After John Candy passes away, I'm sure you can guess who's next, unfortunately.

200
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 This is sad, because all of these guys are really talented.

201
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 He gives it to Chris Farley.

202
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 John Candy is having a heart attack. He's walking through the ER.

203
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And Chris Farley is walking through, I don't know, just pulling pranks, pulling pranks on people with serious diseases.

204
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And John Candy hands him the script.

205
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Chris Farley gets the script, dies of a drug overdose as well.

206
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But see, here's the interesting thing. Chris Farley wasn't interested in the role of a took.

207
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Probably, probably because he had this ability to read the newspaper and to know knowledge from the past.

208
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 As in, everyone attached to the script dies.

209
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 He read it, he wasn't interested in it. He gave it to somebody else.

210
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 He gave it to Phil Hartman, who was murdered by his wife while he was laying in bed.

211
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Now, to be fair, to be really fair, that is quite a list.

212
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And we know for sure, Sam and John and John Candy and Chris Farley all dealt with the script.

213
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 The Phil Hartman one, people are a little more if-y-on.

214
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 That might have actually been, because you know, with friends trading stuff back and forth, trading baseball cards,

215
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 "Hey, I'll give you a Mickey Mano for that a took script, it's all glowing green."

216
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 There's clawed hands reaching out of it. He may have given it to Phil Hartman.

217
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 He did pass on it, we do know that he wasn't interested in it.

218
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 That could have been something at the end.

219
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And, again, to be fair, like, I was blowing off the Omen stuff,

220
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and they're like, "This 89-year-old actor died two years after the shooting of this horror movie."

221
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Well, unfortunately, humans pass away.

222
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Also, with this one, Will Ferrell was offered the script, Jack Black was offered the script,

223
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 John Goodman was offered the script, they're all alive as of the recording of this episode.

224
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 April 25th, 2021, and hopefully they live a very long life.

225
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 So it hasn't killed everyone.

226
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And the writer of the script said it didn't kill anybody.

227
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 The writer of the script, he kind of hates it, he kind of hates the fact that he goes,

228
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 "I think the movie should be made. It's death."

229
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He's sitting there with a giant cloak and a sickle.

230
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 He's like, "Yes, would you like to be in the movie, reporter?"

231
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 He thinks that this is just coincidence, and it very, very well could be.

232
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 But I do like the idea that there is, because we've talked about this before, cursed items out there.

233
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And if you could have like a cursed doll or a cursed painting or a cursed mirror,

234
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 could you have a cursed idea, like, say, the despair code?

235
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And if something like that could exist on that extreme, could you have something in the middle?

236
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Could you have a cursed script?

237
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 The book itself isn't cursed. The book itself sold hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of copies.

238
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 But the script, I'm not saying it's the same script that John Volusia had.

239
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 It's all yellowed and there's coffee stains everywhere.

240
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 But the ideas in the script itself are a cursed item.

241
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Cursed item? Who knows.

242
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 But I wouldn't read it. Don't cast me in it.

243
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 If you really like the show Dead Ravra Radio, don't come knocking on my door and be like,

244
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 "Hey, how would you like to be in a feature-length film?"

245
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I would. "Would you like to play a toke?"

246
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And I'd be like, "No. No, thank you. I don't want to come anywhere near that script."

247
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 A creamy squid? Let's go ahead and leave behind Hollywood once and for all.

248
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 We're never headed back. There's no more stories in this cursed city.

249
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Let's hop in that carboner cop to use your creamy, squiddy arms to fly us from Hollywood.

250
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 We're headed out to Scotland.

253
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
 Just a beautiful night. There's stars. There's no light pollution. There's stars everywhere.

254
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 There's like trees somewhere, I'm assuming. I've never been to Scotland.

255
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,760
 I'm assuming there's at least one tree within the distance of Dunn-Donald Hill.

256
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,760
 Just a beautiful night to be out by yourself with your puppy.

257
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 And then it's time to go in the tent.

258
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:26,760
 [Somber,

260
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,760
 We've all been in this position right? You see something out of the corner of your eye?

261
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,760
 You immediately turn, you see no more movement, you think, "Oh, I might have been mistaken."

262
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,760
 He goes back to reading, and then he sees it again.

263
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,760
 But is it a trick of the light? Remember, his only light source is coming from inside the tent.

264
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,760
 So how he would even be seeing this thing is troubling.

265
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,760
 But he sees a shadowy figure now standing outside the tent.

266
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 Not moving, it's not a trick of the light.

267
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 Could it just be a can? There's no one up here.

 He begins to hear that noise, begins to hear rasping, heavy breathing.

 And he still is convinced it's just a trick.

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
 There's nothing outside of my tent."

275
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 He shakes to one side. He described it as if someone was walking around outside

276
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,760
 and tripped on one of the ropes that was securing the tent down, and it violently made the shake.

277
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:03,760
 It wasn't a constant shaking, just like a guitar string being strummed, the entire tent, "Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

278
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:33,760
 He's on a constant shaking, just like a guitar string being strummed, the entire tent, "Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

279
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:43,760
 He's actually in the 4th corner of the tent.

280
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,760
 He didn't say that he wouldn't know if he said this, but this is what I would say.

281
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,760
 George goes, "Looks like it's going to be a long night, Rover.

282
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,760
 A long, long night."

283
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
 He says it all super creepy.

284
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 Rover's like, "Why can't I have been adopted by someone else?"

285
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,760
 He secures the door of the tent shut as much.

286
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
 I laughed so hard when I heard that.

287
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 How hard can you secure a door shut on a tent?

288
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
 You're like, "Put a chair up against it to brace it."

289
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
 You have like a giant, like, board down in front of it.

290
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,760
 No, it's like you tie a couple ropes around it and hope they're not stronger than a toddler.

291
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
 They won't get in.

292
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
 I guess it would slow someone down, though.

293
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,760
 So he secures the door shut and a moment passes.

294
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
 He's sitting there in the tent and he's like, "Should I try reading again?"

295
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
 "Rober, should I pay attention to what might happen?"

296
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,760
 Slowly, the tent begins to sway back and forth.

297
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,760
 Like it's being pushed upon by a strong breeze.

298
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
 And then the inevitable--

299
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
 This is going to happen, right?

300
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 The tent door burst open.

301
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,760
 All of that twisty ties that he used, all those Boy Scout knots where to no avail, the door burst open.

302
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
 And he can look out into the darkness of the night.

303
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 He doesn't see anything.

304
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
 He doesn't know what could possibly have opened the door.

305
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
 But Rover is done.

306
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
 Rover runs out of the tent, barking into the night.

307
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,760
 Not barking to protect, not barking to try to go, "Come this way, boss."

308
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,760
 He ditched George.

309
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,760
 George is watching his faithful companion.

310
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,760
 George is watching his most treasured ally run off into the darkness leaving him.

311
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,760
 And as George is processing the idea that he needs to buy a new dog when he gets back home,

312
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,760
 something grabs his ankle.

313
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:42,760
 He's looking down and he feels a grip around his ankle and he's slowly being pulled out of the tent.

314
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,760
 Now, he can't see what it is even when he's looking at his ankle, expecting to see a hand or a claw or a maw.

315
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
 You know, like the mouth of something.

316
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
 Not like someone's grandma pulling him out.

317
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
 Hey, sonny!

318
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
 Like the jaws of something.

319
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
 He doesn't see anything.

320
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
 He just feels the pull of this.

321
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,760
 He's getting pulled out of the tent and he's reaching down to try to pry off what's ever there,

322
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
 but he can't feel anything there.

323
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,760
 Except for the grip.

324
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
 He can't touch anything else.

325
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,760
 Something is pulling him that he can't see, can't feel, can't get away from.

326
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,760
 He's dragged out of the tent and he's carried about 10 feet along the ground.

327
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:38,760
 And he's looking up at this starry night sky and then it goes pitch black.

328
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,760
 The entire universe disappears.

329
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
 Now, he doesn't black out.

330
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
 He can still see the landscape.

331
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
 He can still see himself.

332
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
 He can still see the ground.

333
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:59,760
 But when he looks up out of the sky, there is nothing but everlasting darkness.

334
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,760
 That is when he begins to get lifted off of the ground.

335
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,760
 Whatever is dragging him by the ankle, still simply holding onto his ankle,

336
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
 begins to lift him off.

337
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
 He's starting to hover off of the ground.

338
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
 Float.

339
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,760
 He gets two inches off of the soil.

340
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,760
 His ears are deafened by a thunder clap.

341
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,760
 And the black void that used to be the night sky cracks in half with a powerful lightning bolt

342
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,760
 that streaks across the horizon.

343
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
 He is immediately dropped to the ground.

344
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,760
 The grip has let go.

345
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,760
 He stumbles to his feet and begins to run back to his tent.

346
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,760
 And before he can even get to his tent, he sees the night sky slowly reappear.

347
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:57,760
 The stars, the constellations, the moon are once again shining brightly down upon him

348
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,760
 as he finds the little shelter he can in his tent.

349
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
 He stays in the tent all night long.

350
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
 This was so successful the first time, right?

351
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,760
 He stays in the tent all night long.

352
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
 And in the morning he packs stuff up.

353
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
 I don't know how much packing he did.

354
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
 He might have just left his tent there.

355
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
 Obviously, it's useless.

356
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
 People can just break in.

357
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,760
 He makes his way down the hill and at the very bottom of the hill sits Rover.

358
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
 Hmm, hmm.

359
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
 Totally unharmed.

360
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
 Probably looking a little suspicious.

361
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,760
 Probably feeling a little bad that he abandoned George.

362
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,760
 They both go home.

363
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
 That story is from World of the Strange.

364
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
 I got it from thinkaboutadox.com.

365
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
 They got it from World of the Strange.

366
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,760
 It's a truly terrifying story.

367
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
 If the story's true, it could obviously be made up.

368
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,760
 But if the story's true, you're facing something that is undefeatable.

369
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 There's so many levels of it that are chilling.

370
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
 One is fighting something.

371
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,760
 Like the ghost, the shadow showing up and shaking the tent.

372
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
 Very, very cliche stuff.

373
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,760
 I mean, this thing had the ability to wipe out the known universe.

374
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
 But it's like, ooh, I want to shake your tent.

375
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,760
 But it adds to that feeling of helplessness.

376
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
 Was this thing toying with him?

377
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,760
 Whenever he kept trying to dismiss what it was, it seemed to escalate these things.

378
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
 So you have that.

379
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
 You have the playfulness of the spirit.

380
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,760
 But then you have a raw power level that's very, very rarely encountered.

381
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
 Boogity ghosts coming out of your closet.

382
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
 Or shadow men walking down the hallway.

383
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
 They're terrifying.

384
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
 But they can't...

385
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,760
 Well, on the one hand, they can technically be seen.

386
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
 This thing could be seen walking around the tent.

387
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,760
 But once things really mattered when you need to see it, it was completely invisible.

388
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
 He's being dragged by it.

389
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
 Now, that does follow a ghost thing.

390
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,760
 But most ghosts, again, can't go, oh, that universe, you left so much.

391
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
 It's not here.

392
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
 Like, what was that?

393
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,760
 What was that?

394
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
 Why was that?

395
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,760
 This story is interesting because it has those questions.

396
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,760
 It falls out of the normal ghost lore.

397
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
 It falls out of the normal UFO lore.

398
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
 Normally, aliens don't act like ghosts.

399
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
 Normally, ghosts don't act like aliens.

400
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
 So what was this?

401
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
 It seemed like it was an abduction encounter.

402
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,760
 But it had the appearance.

403
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,760
 It had the kind of, like, theatrics of a ghost.

404
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,760
 But it literally was being abducted.

405
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,760
 Then when he starts hovering, you start to think, is a ship gonna show up?

406
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
 But the universe is gone.

407
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
 Is it gone?

408
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
 Was it some sort of weird out-of-body experience?

409
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,760
 That was another theory I had when I was reading this.

410
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,760
 The lightning strike almost reminded me of a seizure.

411
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,760
 Sometimes when people have seizures, they'll see electricity.

412
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
 So I was thinking, was this guy having a seizure?

413
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
 And the dog was like, I'm out, bro!

414
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
 I'm out!

415
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
 This is so weird.

416
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
 Was it all in his head?

417
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
 Did he scare the dog away?

418
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,760
 But he remembers it because it was created in his brain.

419
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,760
 The stories we run into, like, you can always argue you can't ever know the truth about

420
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:13,760
 any paranormal story, but certain paranormal stories, they'll fit into the lore.

421
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
 I use that term a lot on this show.

422
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,760
 UFO encounters, we can kinda check boxes, and every show often we'll find one that doesn't.

423
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
 Those are the ones I like to cover on this show.

424
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,760
 But then you find stuff that's so bizarre that seems to cross all these boundaries.

425
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,760
 Ghost encounter, missing 411 encounter, UFO encounter, even then the power level of being able to wipe out

426
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
 the universe.

427
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,760
 And we have covered stories before where people have gone to other universes.

428
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,760
 There was the one where that guy was walking through the woods, he ended up, and I'll put it in the show notes,

429
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,760
 he's walking through the woods, he goes through a portal, and the first thing he realized, I just remember this,

430
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,760
 there was no stars in the sky.

431
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,760
 There's no stars in the sky, and then the hand tried grabbing him and said, "Gotcha!"

432
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,760
 Definitely, that one in the show notes, we were like, I wanna hear that in a second.

433
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,760
 We've covered stories before with no stars in the sky, but I think we've only covered it twice.

434
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,760
 Both times they've involved portals, one of them may have involved a UFO taking someone, I won't be able to find that one,

435
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,760
 I don't remember the context, but I think one of them is a UFO took someone to a place on Earth where there are no stars in the sky.

436
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,760
 So we've seen that imagery before, and even then it's hard to make sense, but we've never seen this switch over happen on our planet.

437
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,760
 UFO, yes, land there, no stars in the sky.

438
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,760
 Guy walks through a portal in the middle of the woods, no stars in the sky. This guy's being dragged in the ground, he looks up,

439
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,760
 no stars in the sky. What is going on in this story?

440
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:43,760
 And you may go, Jason, that's your job, you're the paranormal podcast host, you're supposed to figure it out.

441
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,760
 Sometimes the only answer is, I don't know, and that's what makes this story so scary, is not knowing.

442
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,760
 You accept a certain level of not knowing when you're investigating ghosts and aliens in Bigfoot,

443
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:04,760
 but when even someone who researches it all the time, there's less scratching their head and going, I have no idea what could possibly be going on here.

444
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,760
 That's when it gets truly frightening. I've handled ghosts before in demons, and I don't have any problem with those.

445
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,760
 Never handled an alien before, but I think I would do okay.

446
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,760
 I think I'd get him in like a little sleeper hold on his little tiny alien neck, put him to sleep.

447
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:28,760
 But something that toys with you like a ghost has the strength, the raw power of a Bigfoot type creature, but is invisible.

448
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:36,760
 You can't see it, you can't break free of it, and has the reality altering powers of aliens.

449
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,760
 Mind wipes, reality changes, interdimensional travel.

450
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,760
 When something has the combination of those three, how would you ever be able to stop it?

451
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:54,760
 There's no silver bullet, there's no exorcism, you're just at its mercy.

452
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,760
 And here's something too, well into like this.

453
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,760
 Because I think this is a combination of these stories, I don't think that's how that story ended.

454
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:12,760
 I think he started to get lifted off the ground, and then he remembers the lightning and the thunder.

455
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:20,760
 He could have been taken somewhere for hours.

456
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,760
 I don't think it just gave up.

457
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:36,760
 I think it did what it wanted with him, and he has no memory of the true terror that he faced in this thing's layer, or starship, or dimension.

458
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:45,760
 And sometimes not remembering is the best thing, because if he remembered all of these terrifying events,

459
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,760
 how horrible would something have to be before your mind said, "Nope, don't think about that night."

460
00:37:52,760 --> 00:38:01,760
 Don't think about what really happened when the sky disappeared.

461
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,760
