00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Are you ready to spin the night in a haunted McDonald's?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,080
 A man makes a terrible decision and pays for it $1 a week.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then we travel to England, where we meet a man who's trying to outrun a German bombing

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,280
 raid and instead runs right into the long furry paws of a demon cat today on Dead Rabbit

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
 Radio.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:40,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
 I really do.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,640
 I hope you guys are having an awesome day.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,440
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're just going to get started here.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,120
 First off, I got to say thanks to my newest Patreon, McCallBongLabal.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
 Thank you so much McCall.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
 I actually asked.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,080
 Hey dude, can you tell me how to pronounce your name?

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,320
 He sent me a vocal file so I really really appreciate that.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,000
 It's always helpful when I know how to pronounce your guys' names.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,120
 So thank you and it's also helpful when you guys support the Patreon.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,880
 I really really enjoy that.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,080
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,600
 Just help get the word out about the show.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
 That helps out a lot as well.

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,920
 So we're going to toss McCall the keys to the Carpenter copter.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,280
 Go ahead and grab those keys.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,360
 We are first flying off to Pueblo, Colorado.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,120
 We're flying.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
 We're going to fly low.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,120
 I want to enjoy the maces and the ground and stuff.

29
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
 It's not...

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,520
 Wait, no, I'm thinking of Arizona.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
 Never mind.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
 Go up.

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
 Go up.

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,160
 I was thinking it was all magical Sedona, Arizona stuff.

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,480
 Colorado is just a bunch of mountains.

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
 I'm used to mountains.

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,960
 Take us up high McCall.

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:02:02,000
 Flying over and we're going to land in the parking lot of a McDonald's.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,320
 Employees uniforms because we're actually working at McDonald's right now and we're

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,760
 loving it.

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,320
 We walk in saying hey to our buddies.

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,400
 We should all get a job together.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 We should just all have...

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 I guess that's a cold.

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
 Never mind.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,520
 We should all move to a commune and grow potatoes.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
 We're all hanging out at this McDonald's dancing around.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,160
 We have a dunk tank built over the deep fryer.

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,560
 You're like Jason, this is a terrible idea.

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,120
 It's only a terrible idea if I'm able to hit the target.

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,620
 Throw in potatoes.

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,280
 Do they actually have potatoes there?

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,040
 We're doing all sorts of stuff at this McDonald's.

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,240
 We're doing the twist on the tables.

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,680
 The real employees there are quite disturbed, but they're not really disturbed by our antics,

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,840
 even though we're super annoying at this McDonald's.

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,400
 This is a McDonald's in Pueblo, Colorado, and this just happened on February 13th, 2020.

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,600
 The employees, it's 3.30 a.m. and the employees are working on this McDonald's.

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,520
 I'm assuming it's the 24-hour McDonald's, but it's possible they're just the cleaning

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,600
 crew.

61
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,000
 And they hear outside in the darkness surrounding this McDonald's.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,440
 You got the big expansive parking lot.

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,400
 Parking lot lights shining down, just singular circles of light trying to cut swaths through

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,840
 the pitch blackness.

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,920
 And while they're cleaning up, they hear over the bustling noise of a bunch of young McDonald's

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,520
 crew people doing McDonald's crew stuff.

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:37,240
 [Metal clanging]

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,920
 What in the world was that?

69
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 Did you hear that?

70
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,280
 Deep fryer, turn it down, turn it down.

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,760
 Did you hear that?

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,320
 Other employees like, "Ahhh, I heard something."

73
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,080
 Sounded like it was saying something, but not any language that I know.

74
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,160
 [Metal clanging]

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,120
 They hear barking now from outside the McDonald's.

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,920
 But it's not the sound of a dog, it's the sound of a human barking.

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
 Which is more terrifying.

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,200
 I mean, unless it's like a little kid doing it and they're like, "Look at me, I'm Paw

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
 Patrol.

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 Ruff, ruff, ruff."

81
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,080
 You're just like, "That's not what a dog sounds like, idiot."

82
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,280
 Then you correct them.

83
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,720
 But if you're in the middle of a darkened area and you hear a dog bark, you probably won't

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
 even register it.

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,240
 If you're in the middle of a darkened area and you hear a human bark, you're going to

86
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,400
 be a little concerned.

87
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:40,480
 So now they've heard a strange language, human barking, and then, "Ahhh, a woman screaming,

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,240
 but I'm going to assume, one, it was louder than that.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,600
 I'm trying to save your eardrums and two, it didn't sound like the mom from All in the

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
 Family screaming.

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,120
 That actually would be super creepy."

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,000
 You'd be like, "What?"

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,360
 And then they hear just general demonic sounds.

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,240
 So any one of those, you'd be like, "Meth head," and you go back to like, "Scramming

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
 dishes."

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,280
 Here a woman screaming, you'd be like, "Uh, hopefully that someone's just playing around.

97
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,000
 Hopefully that's not like a real terrified scream."

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,040
 If you hear a weird language, you're like, "I don't know."

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,280
 Could just be some people who are new to the neighborhood.

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,240
 Apparently from Demonville, Demonville, USA.

101
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,760
 They're not from around here.

102
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,320
 But all of those pushed together, you'd think that something's wrong.

103
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 They call the police.

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
 And you can imagine the cop.

105
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
 I was a cop.

106
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,760
 I'd love to get calls like that, dude.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,960
 I'd be like, "Aw, great."

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,520
 Another meth heads beating up a telephone pole.

109
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,400
 But when someone's like, "Hey, I think there's a ghost outside.

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 I'm having tunnels.

111
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,960
 I'm like, step on it, boys."

112
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,560
 Driving all the way over there.

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
 Get out of the way, evil.

114
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,160
 People are robbing banks.

115
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
 So I'm driving on the road.

116
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
 I'm like, "I have no time for your petty crimes.

117
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
 I've got a ghost to catch."

118
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
 The cops go out to the location and they check around and they don't find anything.

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
 They don't find any meth heads.

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,440
 They don't find any weirdos.

121
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,000
 They don't find any recent immigrants from Demonville.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,920
 So they go back to the McDonald's people and they go, "There's nothing out there.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,320
 We don't know what you heard, but there's nothing out there.

124
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,640
 So you're good to go."

125
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,280
 And the crew said, "No.

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,160
 We will not leave this McDonald's until the sun comes up."

127
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,360
 Which think about that for a second.

128
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,720
 Think about wherever you work.

129
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
 Come on, man.

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,760
 There's very few jobs where you want to keep working.

131
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,440
 If I'm working somewhere and someone's painting too much, I'm like, "Oh, I'm getting dizzy,

132
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
 man.

133
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 I gotta go home early."

134
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
 And then I walk out.

135
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 I'm like, "Hehehe."

136
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,760
 Then I go home and I'm huffing paint.

137
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,240
 I'm like, "If I'm going to get high, I'm going to do it at home where I can start watching

138
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,640
 movies."

139
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,720
 People will look for any excuse to go home, right?

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,680
 They could have been like, "This is too spooky.

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,280
 I'm going to go home early.

142
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,920
 My boss isn't going to be able to do anything because there's monsters outside."

143
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
 No.

144
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,640
 They could have at work longer than they had to.

145
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,840
 They could have went home, but they were like, "No way.

146
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,720
 I'm way safer in this McDonald's.

147
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,000
 That's all glass walls.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,040
 This is my, this is where I'm hanging out."

149
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,400
 So I find that, to me, that makes it more believable, honestly.

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,360
 I think they heard something, definitely.

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,000
 But I think the fact that they heard it and it was so terrifying that they chose to stay

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,080
 at work.

153
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,320
 They figured they were safer inside of a McDonald's than making it to their car is a sign that

154
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
 they heard something that terrifying.

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
 Because again, I will look for any excuse to go home from work.

156
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,400
 Oh no.

157
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,120
 That dude over there sprained his ankle.

158
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,640
 "Oh, sympathy, ankle pain.

159
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,440
 I better go home, man."

160
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,360
 But maybe I'm just a bad employee.

161
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
 But you know what I mean?

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,440
 The fact that they decided, they not only stayed, but stayed until the sun came up.

163
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
 They stayed longer than their shift.

164
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
 Makes me think there really was something out there.

165
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
 They heard something out there.

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
 Now, our next one, it's kind of an interesting one.

167
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
 It's kind of a short one.

168
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,200
 I've had it ready to go for a long time, but I feel a need to talk about it today.

169
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,120
 December 31st, 1982, we're in Fairfax County, Virginia.

170
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,080
 There's a guy named Kevin Tunnel, 17 years old, young man, driving home from a New Year's

171
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,520
 Eve party.

172
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 His friends go, "Dude, you're way too drunk.

173
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
 You're a..."

174
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
 "Good.

175
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
 I'm good."

176
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,040
 Quote, "Nothing will ever happen to me."

177
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,720
 His friends are like, "Why did you just say quote?

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
 Why did you quote yourself?"

179
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,960
 And he's like, "I assume that that statement I just made will play a huge effect in my

180
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
 life."

181
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,640
 He's driving home drunk.

182
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
 He's super drunk.

183
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,920
 And at the same time, Susan Herzog is driving home as well.

184
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,480
 She's a mile from her house.

185
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
 She's sober.

186
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,160
 He hits her, kills her.

187
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,760
 He survives.

188
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,400
 He's charged with drunk driving, charged with involuntary manslaughter.

189
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
 Gets found guilty.

190
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,960
 1982, though, was a different time.

191
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,600
 This was before mothers against drunk driving.

192
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,360
 This was before dads against drunk driving.

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,800
 Drunk driving was just a thing you did.

194
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,120
 It was a stupid decision you made, but there weren't all of the laws against it.

195
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
 I mean, there were laws against it, but it was...

196
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,680
 I mean, nowadays, you can...

197
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
 It's bad.

198
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,560
 Like, you can serve some serious prison time.

199
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,800
 I know a guy who he was driving with his girlfriend and their friend, and he got in

200
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
 a car accident.

201
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,920
 They were visiting Arizona.

202
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,480
 They got in a car accident, and the friend died.

203
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,360
 Then the driver was drunk.

204
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,920
 He was taken to jail.

205
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,360
 And within like a couple hours, he has to process all of this stuff.

206
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
 One, his best friend's dead.

207
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,240
 Two, he's facing 10, 15 years in prison.

208
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,360
 This guy who'd never been in trouble with the law.

209
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,480
 And his fiance, who's actually...

210
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,080
 I know the fiance more than I know him, but the fiance is now in Arizona, and her friend

211
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,360
 is dead, and her fiance is in jail facing 10, 15 years in prison, and she has no way

212
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
 to get home.

213
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,160
 Anyway, so it's totally different now.

214
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
 I mean, like, you're...

215
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,280
 When you get hit with that drunk driving charge, you're like this...

216
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,480
 And when you cause a fatality, a regular drunk driving charge...

217
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,600
 A regular drunk driving charge, I think, can even still just be like a year of like, no

218
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
 license and stuff like that.

219
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,960
 But when you kill someone in a drunk driving accident today, it's a big issue back then.

220
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,720
 He got three months probation in one year community service.

221
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
 And there's a civil penalty.

222
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,840
 The judge goes, "We're gonna give you a civil penalty for this as well," because that's

223
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
 not right.

224
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
 The judge is like, "That's ridiculous.

225
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
 So we're gonna give you a civil penalty as well.

226
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,040
 You got three months probation, you got your one year thing.

227
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,000
 The laws hadn't caught up to the brutality of drinking and driving.

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,480
 Every week, Kevin Tunnel had to write a $1 check, mail it to her family.

229
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,040
 It only added up to $936.

230
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
 Not a lot of money even back in 1982.

231
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,280
 But he couldn't do it.

232
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
 It broke him.

233
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,680
 18 years every week writing a check.

234
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,840
 Pay to the order of the Herzog family.

235
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,640
 Put in an envelope.

236
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,080
 Susan Herzog family's address.

237
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,600
 Drop it in the mail.

238
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,400
 Next week, pay to the order.

239
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,600
 A constant reminder.

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,960
 In 1990, he actually got thrown in jail for 30 days because he stopped sending the checks.

241
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,200
 He did 30 days in jail when he gets out and they're like, "You have to keep sending these

242
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
 checks.

243
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
 You have to do it for 18 years.

244
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
 You gotta send these checks."

245
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,520
 Susan Herzog was 18, by the way.

246
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
 She was 18.

247
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,440
 And that's why there's these...

248
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,960
 He has to write a check for every year she'd been alive.

249
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,040
 So every week, he was reminded of that pain.

250
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,400
 One day, he sent a box of checks that were pre-written out and says, "Here's the next

251
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,640
 couple months of checks plus an extra year of checks.

252
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,920
 I paid you an extra 52 bucks."

253
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
 Family sent it back.

254
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,800
 They said, "No, you gotta write a check every single week."

255
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 Sent it to us.

256
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,880
 And he said, "You know, I'd be up at night.

257
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
 I'd hear something in my house and I'd think, 'She's here.

258
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
 Susan's in my house.

259
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,600
 Her ghost is coming to haunt me.'"

260
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,160
 He ended up completing his thing of writing the checks.

261
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,720
 He also does...

262
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,280
 As of writing of this article, which was a couple years ago, he was still doing community

263
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,800
 service stuff, talking to people about drunk driving.

264
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,920
 Susan's parents, they both joined MAD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

265
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,400
 They're not gonna be like, "No, sir.

266
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,040
 You're not allowed, obviously.

267
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,640
 All the help is needed."

268
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,760
 Their other daughter, after they had joined Mothers Against Drunk Driving, they had another

269
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,360
 daughter that got hit by a drunk driver, has a permanent limp now.

270
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,760
 But is otherwise fine.

271
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,320
 Now I came across that story.

272
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,480
 I thought it was an interesting story about crime and punishment and the mental toll on

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
 people.

274
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,120
 The simple act of writing a check broke him to the point where he just couldn't do it.

275
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,200
 His quote was, "You get to a point where you kind of snap and say, 'It hurts too much.'"

276
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,320
 You know, and all he's doing is writing stuff down.

277
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,280
 I know a lot of people are like, "Oh yeah, I could do X, Y, and Z.

278
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,880
 I could be like this total badass criminal."

279
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,560
 Anyone can be a badass criminal.

280
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,720
 It's a matter of living with it, not for the next week or next eight weeks.

281
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,280
 It's a matter of living it for the next 30 years, 40 years, 50 years.

282
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,200
 Very, very few people can do that.

283
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,520
 Generally, it does haunt you.

284
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,720
 And the thing with drunk driving is it's not like, "Oh, look at me.

285
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,880
 I'm such a badass criminal."

286
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,600
 It's like I'm trying to get home and I'm making a bad decision.

287
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,360
 It's not only affecting my life, it's affecting everyone else's life.

288
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,640
 And again, I've had this story probably a couple months now, just sitting in my notes

289
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,200
 and I had a pull to do it today.

290
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
 So I'm assuming, I'm thinking maybe there's some listener out there that really needs

291
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,280
 to hear this before the weekend coming up.

292
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,520
 Or maybe you're hearing this story six months from now before you make a bad decision.

293
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,160
 Maybe you just discovered the podcast.

294
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,080
 Maybe this is the first episode you listen to.

295
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,320
 But I just had a feeling to record this segment today.

296
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,280
 I had a friend, my cousin actually, who's paralyzed from the neck down due to drinking

297
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,040
 and driving.

298
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,520
 And then he was in his motorized wheelchair maybe about two or three years ago.

299
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,960
 And he was going through a parking lot on his way to my aunt's house for Taco Tuesday

300
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,520
 and the truck was lifted and couldn't see him and backed up and knocked him over and

301
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,580
 he hit his head.

302
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,760
 And then he was like, "I'm good.

303
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
 I'm good.

304
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,520
 The guy gets out of the truck and helps to write the chair up."

305
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,040
 And he's like, "It was my cousin, Chris."

306
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
 He goes, "No, no, no.

307
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 I'm fine.

308
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 I'm fine."

309
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,200
 But the driver noticed he had blood coming out of his ears.

310
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,320
 All the ambulance died at the hospital that night.

311
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,840
 Yeah, so I mean, during a drive-in, it's a serious...

312
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,640
 I mean, obviously, it might kind of sound trite, but I think hopefully this episode stops

313
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,440
 you this one time you might go, "Oh, you know what?

314
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
 I don't know.

315
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
 I don't know.

316
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
 I just felt like I wanted to tell this story today because I think somebody needs to hear

317
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
 it on this episode.

318
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:56,800
 Let's go ahead, though, and move on to a more uplifting story, the story of a demonic cat

319
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,600
 and a madman with a bone to pick, or would it be a claw to pick because cats have claws?

320
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 Cats have bones, too?

321
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,880
 So it doesn't matter.

322
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,400
 We are traveling to...

323
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,320
 We are traveling to London.

324
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,000
 So, McCall, get that helicopter going.

325
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,200
 Get it warmed up now.

326
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
 We're going.

327
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 While he's warming it up, we're giving this...

328
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,760
 He's like, "I want to hear the introduction, too."

329
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,000
 We're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,640
 Just work on the helicopter, bro."

331
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
 I'm giving the...

332
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,160
 I go, "Hey, guys, come over here.

333
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,960
 We're going to talk about this McCall can here this part."

334
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,880
 So we're going to go to London, and it's October 1943, and one of you guys goes, "What's

335
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
 the exact date?"

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And I go, "Hmm.

337
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,880
 Kind of look down at my feet."

338
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,280
 And I go, "It's one of those stories."

339
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,480
 And everyone's like, "Ah."

340
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,020
 Now, what I mean by that is there are a lot of stories that I come across that are super

341
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,320
 vague and they shouldn't be, because the people involved in the stories, this would be the

342
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,960
 most important night of their life.

343
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,520
 So generally, when a story doesn't have a specific date, it tends to lean towards it

344
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,880
 being fake.

345
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,400
 And I originally heard about this story on Backpackerverse, and at this point it's almost

346
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
 a full revolt.

347
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,560
 So guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, hold on, hold on.

348
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,120
 Now for you guys who don't know, who are new to the show, Backpackerverse, I haven't talked

349
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,200
 about them in a while.

350
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,800
 I've very been very, very restrained.

351
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 However, the episode I did recently about the Popobawa, I found that on Backpackerverse,

352
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,600
 and that was a great episode, so don't get mad.

353
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,640
 Backpackerverse, for the new listeners, is a website that is basically like a California

354
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,920
 hippie psychic website, but they also tell ghost stories, but they make them up.

355
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,680
 Now this one's not made up.

356
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
 Neither was the Popobawa.

357
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,520
 Well, I mean, they might be made up in the fact that they don't exist, but I'm so sorry,

358
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,240
 no, you exist, Popobawa.

359
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,320
 The thing is, is that they tend to exaggerate certain details.

360
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,600
 So we're going to go into that in mind.

361
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,080
 So we're going to turn back, and I made McCall wear big headphones, big of those big old

362
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
 aviator headphones.

363
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,280
 I'm like, you can take this off now.

364
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,000
 We are hopping back in the Carbenter Coffin.

365
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Take us at McCall.

366
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,240
 We're going to London.

367
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,200
 Again, not a very specific place.

368
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,040
 And there we're going to meet a man.

369
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,520
 Well, I guess that is a city.

370
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
 Public Colorado.

371
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,960
 I didn't give you the address of the McDonald's.

372
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
 That was real though.

373
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,960
 Anyways, we're traveling to London, and there we're going to meet Howard Leland.

374
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
 So hello, Howard.

375
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
 Pip pip cheerio.

376
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,440
 He's shaking hands with this guy.

377
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,120
 He works for something called air raid precautions, because it's 1943.

378
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
 Did I say that?

379
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,600
 So we're in the middle of World War II.

380
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,200
 So we're not just going to London and like drinking milkshakes over there and stuff.

381
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,920
 We might be, but there's also bombs dropping, the threat of Nazi Germany overtaking the

382
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,240
 planet really.

383
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,320
 We're meeting this guy.

384
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,520
 He's works with the air raid precautions, which in my notes I put, what the hell is

385
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,680
 that?

386
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,080
 Like what is, you have your air raid precaution is the air raid siren.

387
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:05,400
 I can just imagine these sirens are going, bombs, and a guy's like, look out everyone,

388
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
 bombs, bombs.

389
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
 Run, run.

390
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,360
 It's like the one thing you can't hear is the man running through the city going, bombs,

391
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,200
 everyone, bombs, bombs.

392
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,960
 What is your job?

393
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,360
 That's a made up job.

394
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,720
 That's the job that they give the idiots who can't have any other job in the military

395
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,960
 or really in civilian life.

396
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,400
 Yes, Howard, you're warning people of the bombs.

397
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,960
 You're doing a good job, a real good job.

398
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
 Here's your medal.

399
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
 It's a gold star.

400
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
 He's like, thank you.

401
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,800
 Dude, you either hear the air raid siren or you don't.

402
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,960
 The guy running through the street.

403
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,960
 Now I'm sure someone might email me and be like, this is actually like a super integral

404
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
 job.

405
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,280
 They repaired the air raid sirens, whatever.

406
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
 Air raid precautions.

407
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,400
 Look out guys, bombs are coming.

408
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,920
 Huge explosions everywhere.

409
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
 See?

410
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,480
 Anyways, there's a bombing run.

411
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,720
 He's out in the middle of nowhere and there's a bombing run.

412
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,920
 Basically, it's the sound effects of a game of battle ship, electronic battleship.

413
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,160
 But in real life.

414
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
 So he's running, he's out running these bombs.

415
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
 He's like, oh no, I got to warn people of these bombs that have already fallen.

416
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,240
 Look out guys, a bomb blew up.

417
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,160
 He jumps into an abandoned house and he's sitting there in the dark.

418
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,920
 I better get my torch because that's what we call it in Britain.

419
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,560
 We don't call it a flashlight.

420
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,520
 Also, I should get one of my cigarettes but I'm gonna use the American word for that.

421
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,960
 Puffing on a cigarette with my torch.

422
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,840
 Anyways, Howard is sitting there at the bottom of the stairs and he gets a feeling that something's

423
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 watching him.

424
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,000
 He's like, there must be something else in this house.

425
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,120
 Something not too pleasant as I smoke my cigarette.

426
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,560
 And then he notices that he's getting the feeling of being watched from the top of

427
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
 the stairs.

428
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,160
 I will crane my head ever so slightly to...

429
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,520
 He gasps.

430
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,320
 He sees at the top of the stairs a giant cat.

431
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,200
 Now that's not scary, right?

432
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,000
 I mean, unless it's like a bobcat.

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,720
 Actually Britain has a huge thing.

434
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,560
 Like you know we have Bigfoot in America supposedly and every other cryptid, Mothman

435
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,720
 and Melonheads and...

436
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,880
 I don't know, you can listen to best episodes, I've covered them all.

437
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,680
 In Britain, they have giant cats.

438
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
 That's their big thing.

439
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,720
 They have people who hunt giant cat hunters.

440
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
 They can pronounce it correctly.

441
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,360
 And they are like getting footage of the giant cat.

442
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,000
 It's so lame.

443
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,280
 Because when I grew up reading the 40 in Times magazine, which covers like all just weird

444
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,240
 stuff around the world, there was always a section just on giant cats in Britain and

445
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
 I'd always skip it.

446
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
 I'm like, who cares?

447
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
 Who cares if there's giant cats in Britain?

448
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,720
 There are or there aren't, I don't care either way.

449
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,560
 If it turns out Bigfoot's real, that has implications for a lot of different things.

450
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,880
 Like how could something that big be existing?

451
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,240
 Do we then give credence to other supernatural phenomenon if it turns out that Bigfoot was

452
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
 real?

453
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,280
 This is just a giant cat.

454
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
 Who cares?

455
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,440
 It's such a big thing over there.

456
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,520
 There's actually a term for them.

457
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,040
 They're called like ABCs or something like that.

458
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,320
 Like all black cats or something like that.

459
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,440
 I don't remember but there was like an acronym for them.

460
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
 But anyways, this isn't one of those.

461
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 This isn't one of those.

462
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 This is a cooler cat.

463
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,880
 I want to waste your time with just a story about a giant cat, Garfield.

464
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,440
 Hey, this actually is a tabby.

465
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,360
 Garfield's a tabby, right?

466
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,080
 But anyways, it's a big tabby cat.

467
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,400
 You're like chasing that's not, that's even less scary than an all black cat.

468
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,520
 Like I said, I imagine it's some sort of panther.

469
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,080
 Now I'm just imagining it's basically Garfield up there.

470
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,720
 Heathcliff is up there getting ready to go into a garbage can.

471
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,080
 I wonder if Heathcliff and Garfield got in a fight who would win.

472
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,200
 I actually, I know that Garfield has like that weight behind him.

473
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 He has that mass.

474
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,480
 But Heathcliff, you know, he's out and about.

475
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,120
 You guys are like, dude, I'm not 43 years old.

476
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,160
 I have no idea who Heathcliff is.

477
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,640
 Anyways, back to the story.

478
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,040
 Howard smoking a cigarette, bottom of the stairs.

479
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,080
 Looks up, he sees this giant cat.

480
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,240
 But again, it's not just any cat.

481
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
 It has glowing red eyes.

482
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
 What?

483
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,160
 See guys, this whole dude is going to be spooky.

484
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,640
 And long horns.

485
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
 Whoa, dude.

486
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,000
 Have you ever seen a cat with horns?

487
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,640
 I know you haven't.

488
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,680
 This is a demon cat.

489
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
 Cat from hell.

490
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,000
 Howard's looking at this thing.

491
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,280
 It's at the top of the stairs looking at him.

492
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:39,440
 Making that super annoying cat noise and Howard snuffs out his cigarette.

493
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,040
 Fogus is his torch on the creature.

494
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,960
 And it jumps through the air towards him.

495
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,400
 Giant claws sling out of those big old cat paws.

496
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,840
 It's coming down the stairs.

497
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,040
 And at that moment, two of his buddies who also work for the air raid precautions people

498
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
 bust through the door.

499
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,640
 Did you know bombs just fell?

500
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,040
 We're doing our job.

501
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,180
 And Howard looks over at his buddies who came through the door and he looks back at the

502
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,360
 cat and it's so close and it's going meow.

503
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,720
 And fades from existence.

504
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,120
 But the echo.

505
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,200
 Continued on for a little bit longer.

506
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,920
 Cat never got to him.

507
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,280
 But what would have happened if it did?

508
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,600
 Well that's the part Backpacker verse made up.

509
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,680
 That's the part Backpacker.

510
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,600
 This is the way I first came across this story.

511
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,380
 So this is a real cryptid story that has been going around in the paranormal world.

512
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,340
 It's not super popular but you can find a lot of sources on this.

513
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,380
 But it's not one of the big cats of Britain.

514
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:57,340
 According to Backpacker verse, the cat comes down and slashes his arm open with big old

515
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:04,940
 grody cat claws and then super realistic blood shot out of the wound and he goes no.

516
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:12,000
 And then the cat disappeared and he's holding his bloodied arm and is chewed up to pieces

517
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,920
 and to this day the scar still remains of the demon cat that none of that happened.

518
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
 None of that happened.

519
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,240
 There's a question of whether or not the story happened at all.

520
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,320
 And I think it did.

521
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,360
 I think it's vague which makes me a little suspicious about it but there's just some

522
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,800
 follow up to this.

523
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,740
 But then Backpacker verse just adds that he actually gets maimed by this thing.

524
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
 What?

525
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,460
 Well okay Backpacker verse, you gotta make it a little sexier I guess but let's go back

526
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,540
 to the real story.

527
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:48,100
 So apparently what happened was Howard Leland was traumatized by this event.

528
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,540
 Traumatized by this event right?

529
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,420
 So Howard Leland ends up meeting or going to a clairvoyant named John Pendragon and

530
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,220
 goes oh you know I heard that you're really good at making stuff up and people believing

531
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,340
 you and John's like that's how I get paid.

532
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,880
 That is 100% my profession.

533
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,880
 I simply make vague guesses and rubes like you believe me.

534
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,180
 And Howard Leland goes perfect that's what I want.

535
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,280
 He goes I ran into this demon cat at this house and he pulls a map out.

536
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,280
 He goes this house right here and John Pendragon goes this house and puts his finger on the

537
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,880
 map and he's like yeah that's the house I just pointed at and he goes oh yes that house

538
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,700
 my powers my quote unquote powers are activating.

539
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,580
 I can tell you what happened at that house.

540
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,180
 I can tell you that something's in my head now.

541
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,060
 I'm seeing images.

542
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,780
 I see a man surrounded by a dozen.

543
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
 No.

544
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:52,020
 A hundred angry hate filled cats.

545
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,860
 And now he's holding he's looking directly at the camera.

546
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,180
 He's looking directly at the camera.

547
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,400
 He's holding the news.

548
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,280
 Oh the connection's been broken.

549
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:08,880
 Howard Leland's like that sounds insane but you're saying it and you're a renowned clairvoyant

550
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
 so I'm going to believe you.

551
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,160
 Now Howard Leland apparently goes and does more research on this house and finds out

552
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:21,240
 that the former occupant was actually a practitioner of the dark arts black magic.

553
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,160
 This guy was trying to do some really heavy metal stuff before heavy metal was even invented.

554
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,860
 And he did it with cats.

555
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,580
 He had apparently according to neighbors hundreds of cats in his house.

556
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
 They're just hanging out.

557
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,980
 You can't walk anywhere without stepping on two or three cats.

558
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,340
 And of course they're hate filled because one there's a hundred cats crammed in one

559
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,940
 house so you can just imagine the smell.

560
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,780
 Two he's sacrificing them.

561
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,740
 This former occupant is taking these cats he has an altar built for him and he's sacrificing

562
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,460
 these cats.

563
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,280
 Now eventually I love this.

564
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,840
 This is a quote from cryptids.fandom.com.

565
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,960
 This is probably the greatest sentence researching this quote.

566
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,060
 He eventually went insane and hung himself at the top of the staircase.

567
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,840
 I don't think hanging yourself is the symptom of being insane.

568
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,960
 I don't think he eventually went insane.

569
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,480
 I think he was insane the first time he started sacrificing cats.

570
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,020
 And I would definitely say he was insane when the time when he said he had 50 cats in his

571
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,620
 house and he goes you know what I need?

572
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,620
 Double this amount.

573
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,220
 I think that's when he went insane.

574
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,340
 I don't think he eventually I don't think the hanging himself was the sign he was insane.

575
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,380
 He was insane long before that.

576
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,940
 So you're go Jason this is interesting because you just said to this guy this clairvoyant

577
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,460
 John Pendragon was a hack was a fraud.

578
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,740
 You're saying all that stuff allegedly.

579
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,840
 I didn't say allegedly back then but I'm saying it now so it still works.

580
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,960
 But Howard Leland went and he did this research on his own and the thing matched up.

581
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
 Well here's my thing.

582
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,200
 What I believe happened with this story again assuming any of it's a truth assuming it's

583
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,920
 not some viral marketing stunt for some horned cat 8-bit rogue like video game that's going

584
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,480
 to come out in 8 months.

585
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,080
 Assuming it's not that.

586
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,480
 Here's the thing.

587
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,720
 Generally what happens and it's really easy to control the narrative on this.

588
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
 Let's see how my clairvoyant.

589
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,680
 I've told you I used to work for a psychic phone hotline and all that stuff.

590
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,400
 It's a really easy trick to pull.

591
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,560
 You come to you call me up and you'll say hey can I make an appointment.

592
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,920
 I need to check out something I have this experience with a horned cat and then I kind

593
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,080
 of put the phone on hold and I laugh and then I go oh yes yes the horned cat.

594
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,120
 Yes tell me some information about yourself so I can prepare something and you coach you

595
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,320
 maybe not that blunt about it but you say it in such a way that the person gives you

596
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,580
 information.

597
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,920
 They don't know you're giving information and in this case all John Pendragon would have

598
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,360
 to know is do you roughly know the location of where you were at.

599
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,160
 He'd be like yes I was during that bombing run I worked for the air raid precautions

600
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,320
 board John puts the phone back on hold.

601
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,480
 Oh my god I'm going to make so much money off this room.

602
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,440
 Oh yes you do a lot of great service for our country sir.

603
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,040
 Once he knows a general location you can just do research because if this story is true

604
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,600
 and again we're going to assume it's true Howard Leland was able to find this information

605
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,340
 which means that John Pendragon could have found the information first and had the quote

606
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
 unquote vision.

607
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,420
 This is very very typical scam.

608
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:26,620
 So it's possible I will believe that I will believe that there wasn't a cultist sacrificing

609
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,300
 cats because we know people do that.

610
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,780
 I will believe a man ran into a demon cat during a bombing run because I mean why not.

611
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,140
 It's funny because I would believe both of those stories before I would believe John

612
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,980
 Pendragon had any sort of clairvoyant power.

613
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,860
 That's one thing you know and now I'm saying that.

614
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:47,840
 That's one thing that I'm extremely skeptical on because I know the tricks behind it because

615
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,320
 I've done tarot cards and I've done fortune telling and stuff like that.

616
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,600
 I know how it works and not only do I know how it works I'm really good at it and I do

617
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
 it all the time.

618
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,040
 It's just a subtle manipulation and it's looking for reactions in you and that's when I'm trying

619
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,680
 to figure out something about you when I'm reading your future or your past because when

620
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,920
 I do the tarot cards first off I tell you what your past is then I tell you your current

621
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,520
 situation and then I tell you your future.

622
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,660
 By the time I get to your future you're so convinced.

623
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,860
 Now this has become a debunking psychic thing.

624
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,340
 Goodbye horned cat.

625
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,060
 Now that you've become so convinced because I got the first two kind of right then I tool

626
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:31,180
 the message so I'll be looking at you looking for subtle shifts in your eyes and you'll do

627
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,180
 it either way.

628
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,260
 It won't be like I'll be like oh you used to rob banks and your eyes shift from side

629
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
 to side.

630
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,100
 If you're wrong you'll have a reaction too.

631
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,220
 Some people try to really hide their body language because they know the trick.

632
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,740
 I've done it over the phone when I was a telephone psychic I've done it over the phone that's

633
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,920
 just guesswork.

634
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:54,720
 But yeah so I'm super skeptical of it because I've never seen anyone fake a haunting other

635
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,940
 than go what's over there?

636
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,920
 Oh your mom.

637
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,040
 Like fine you made me turn around when we were in a haunted field you tricked me but

638
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,920
 I've never seen anyone in real life fake a haunting or fake a UFO sighting or things

639
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
 like that.

640
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:15,040
 I have faked psychic powers so I'm super suspicious of that stuff.

641
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,600
 So anyways haunted demon cat we'll bring him back so it's possible that there is a demon

642
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,300
 cat and that even offers up a more interesting question.

643
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,720
 Was the demon cat a conglomeration of a thousand cat souls that have been sacrificed in this

644
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,000
 house that had become a monster cat or how I like to think of it?

645
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,280
 A man who spends his life sacrificing cats which I don't normally like to think about

646
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,120
 guys who do that but a man who spends his life sacrificing cats must really really hate

647
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
 cats right?

648
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,000
 He could have picked anything to sacrifice frogs or mushrooms or something but he sacrificed

649
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,400
 cats for unlimited power and in the end it's his soul trapped in that house in the form

650
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,640
 of the thing he hates the most.

651
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,120
 A cat.

652
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,760
 And not only is he trapped as a demon cat he's impotent.

653
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,180
 He's a useless demon cat.

654
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,040
 He couldn't even attack this one dude.

655
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,600
 He just jumped down the stairs and then disappeared when his buddy showed up.

656
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,020
 So you could have a man looking for power from beyond the veil calling on the dark ones

657
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:30,000
 to turn his fury and rage into something useful to him.

658
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,880
 But instead he just became a big ol' house cat with long horns, red eyes.

659
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,920
 And if there's any justice in the universe when this house cat isn't jumping down the

660
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:51,440
 stairs and disappearing, it doesn't even get to eat lasagna.
