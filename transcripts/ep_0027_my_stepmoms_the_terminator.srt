1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The war between cops and criminals takes an unusual turn

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 and do sex robots make good role models

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Hey everyone, thanks for coming back for another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 It's the Daily Paranormal Conspiracy and True Crime podcast.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Little intro, throwin' that in there, see how that works.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 It was a good day today. It's hot.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I spent pretty much the entire day inside, slept a bit.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm finally, I think, about 90% recovered from my whole infection thing.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm still just kinda taking SudaFed and taking it easy.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Gotta get back to my normal routine tomorrow, normal diet, all of that stuff.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It is, the point is, it is Friday the 13th.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I was actually gonna try to find some spooky stories for Friday the 13th,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 but I didn't. I kinda looked around.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I still need to find some ghost stories that I'm not gonna immediately disprove as I'm reading them.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I need to find, I love reading ghost stories online,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 but recently I've been finding a lot and they just don't really hold up to any sort of scrutiny.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I mean, like basic level scrutiny.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 The thing with the ghost story is that someone can tell me a ghost story and I'm like,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 "Okay, that's plausible."

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 But it's the stories, you know, and that's like a personal event.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Like if someone says, "I saw a ghost," and they tell me that story, fine.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 That's totally legit.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 But I'll read stories that involve like researchers and colleges coming out to test stuff

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 and they're like, "And after 44 hours, here's our proof."

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 18 photos of orbs and a voice recording of something saying something.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It's like, "Come on guys."

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 You know, like you tell me a ghost story, you tell me a ghost story,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 but don't try to tell me that you've done all sorts of research on it

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 and you can't produce anything more than, you know, some dust particles floating around orbs.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Orbs are the lamest inclusion ever into paranormal belief.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 It's not, there's nothing there, bro.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 You can see, anyways, anyways, I don't want to get off on orbs.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Here's a little story to start us off.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 The other day I was watching a cat drink water out of a faucet.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Not in real life.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I was watching a video of a cat drinking water out of a faucet

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and my cat's head leaned over the sink and it was just like licking the water up.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And I, you know, so cats, the way that their tongues work, they like scoop water in,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 like they don't actually drink water out of the, like a puddle.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Their tongue actually like hits the water and lifts it up

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 and then they catch the single droplet on their tongue.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It's amazing to look at, because we just see cats going,

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 but there's actually like when you slow it down, you see all of these,

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 all of this amazing stuff going on with it.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Now raccoons have little hands and they're actually adept enough that they'll wash their food.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So they'll take food and they'll like put it in and they'll like wash it and like eat it,

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 like take their time.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 They kind of like kick back on their butt and eat a walnut or whatever

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 and like watch squirrels run around in front of them.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Here's my question.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Do you think animals are jealous of each other?

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Because they're not idiots.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 They're not idiots.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Do you think the cat is like, "Oh, I'm so thirsty.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 This is going to take so much effort.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Oh, great.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I get to lean my head over into this bucket and I get to go, that's one drop.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Well, that's two drops.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Well, that's three drops.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And this cat is super dehydrated.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 He's like, dude, I haven't drank like in a day.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I'm just going to take me forever to just quench my thirst for four drops and so on.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And then he looks over and he sees the raccoon like pick up a solo cup with his hands,

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 scoop water in and he's just like chugging it.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Or like a dog who's like, "Oh, here's a stick.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I need to, I want to make this stick into a smaller stick."

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Dogs are kind of stupid, but let's say that this dog goes,

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 "I'm going to make this stick into a smaller stick."

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So he holds it in his mouth and then he takes this paw and he's like pushing on it,

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 pushing on it, pushing on it.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And that can't be comfortable.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I don't care how strong your jaw is.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 You still got a stick in your mouth and you're like rank, moving your head one way

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and you're hitting with the paw and then it finally breaks off and you're like,

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 "Yay, I have a shorter stick."

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And then you look up and you see a monkey just like snapping logs or gorilla.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Like, "Oh, look at this tree. I want all the branches on it break."

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Not even thinking about it. Scratches back.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Do you think animals get jealous of each other?

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Do you think animals that don't have hands look at animals that do have hands

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and go, "That is lame."

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And here's the thing, we have done studies that there are certain species of monkeys that get jealous.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 We've been able to reward monkeys and do all this stuff

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 and we can tell that certain animals get jealous.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But do animals in general get jealous?

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Does a lion look at a cheetah and be like, "Oh, I wish I was that fast."

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And the cheetah looks at the lion and goes, "Man, I wish I had such great hair."

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 It's interesting.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 My answer is I think they might.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I think they might. I think there might be some sort of innate...

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Well, you know, here's an interesting thing.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And this actually plays into the idea.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 This is one of those thoughts that have always kind of creeped me out.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I have some interesting theories about reality and stuff like that

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 and it's a little hard to explain in the podcast.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It's actually...it comes across as probably not that well thought out.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 But what I think is interesting, so I think, basically, reality is what you make of it.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Reality is what you see of it.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 It's, you know, my reality is different than your reality and so on and so forth.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And here's the interesting part of that.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And so you can always take it to the infleval.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 We've done studies where we've taken cats and we've put electrodes in their brains.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And when cats look at humans, how they perceive us is they perceive us as giant cats.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 They see us as huge cats.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 They don't see us as evolved apes.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 They see us as giant cats.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And that's one of the...you know, when a cat kills a bird and drops it off at your doorstep,

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 they're trying to feed you.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 They're trying...that's how a cat treats a kitten.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 They'll kill an animal and give it to the kitten to train the animal how to kill

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 and hunt for its own food.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 It's almost like an insult when a cat leaves a dead animal at your doorstep.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 A dog does it like as a trophy for you.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 The cat does it as kind of an insult.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But anyways, when a cat sees a cat, when a cat sees a human, it sees a giant cat.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Here's my question.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I'm human and I look at you and I see another human.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But when the cat looks at me, I'm another cat.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 That's not true. I'm not really a cat.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 So what if when I look at you, you're not really human?

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 That's just how my eyes are perceiving you.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 They're putting you in a human form.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 But because I'm a human and I'm looking at something else that's on my spiritual or reality-based level,

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I view you as a human, but you're really not a human.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I'm not saying you're a synth or a cyborg or something like that,

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 but what if that in my reality, and when I see again this where it gets a little hard to say,

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 and I'm not like married, this is one of those things that I'm not like,

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 "No, this is absolutely factual and I believe this 100% and I'd be willing to preach this to the mountains."

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I just think it's an interesting thought where if reality is what we make of it,

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 if reality is perception, and I'm looking at all these people around me,

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 what if they're not people?

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Or if we could remove those filters, I would see spiritual beings or beams of light or nothing,

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 and I'm alone on this huge grid, and my brain's just constantly updating information to make it feel like the world is real.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 If a cat sees a human and sees a cat, that does not mean that human is a cat.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 If I look at a human and see a human, does that necessarily mean that that's another human in front of me?

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 That's a little philosophical question from a man who has a podcast and is sweating profusely,

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 even though it's only 88 degrees out.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 It's funny, it has not, it's cooler now than it was yesterday, but for some reason I'm dripping with sweat.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So because of that, we're going to go ahead and get started here.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I came across a couple interesting stories lately.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 One has a little bit of a local twist.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 So I'm sure you guys have all heard of the Golden State Killer recently being caught, if you haven't, I'll include the link in the show notes.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But basically this guy was in operations from the 70s, I think to like the 90s, and he was first, he started off, I believe, breaking into homes.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Then he began raping and murdering people. The cops can never find them, and they finally arrested him.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So I have a friend up here, his name is William, and usually I don't use real names,

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 and I'm going to go ahead and use his real name, because he kind of has a real claim for this.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 So what happened was, he's been following, he's a smart guy, and he gets kind of involved in certain, you know, back, I think, 20 years ago or so,

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 he got involved in a true crime case. It's kind of a funny story, and maybe someday I'll have him on the show and talk about it,

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 but he started following this true crime case, and he's just smart as far as looking at clues and puzzles.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And I've asked him, why doesn't he go more into like investigation side, and he's like, well, I'm not a huge fan of true crime, just every so often.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 A case pops up, and I'll look into it, and I'll be interested.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And he kind of was thought that that guy that he was looking at, and I don't remember the name, unfortunately, but he thought that guy may have been the Golden State Killer.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And so what happened was, he ended up, he's, you know, he was contacting, I believe members of the FBI, Sacramento FBI, which is funny,

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 because I used to drive by the FBI building all the time. It's next to American River College in Sacramento.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Anyways, he contacted them, and one of the pieces of advice he gave, and I think he might have even found the lead investigator on the case with the police department,

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 but he said, he emails them and says, you know what you guys should do?

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You should look at the genealogical websites. Let me back up for a second.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So a genealogical website is like 23andme, or ancestry.com, where you send them a swab of your DNA, and they send you back a list of your genetic markers

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and what races you, what regions of the world you came from, your family lineage, and so forth.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Now, and then once you, that's private information. You send it to them, they send it back to you, that's private.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 You can then upload that information onto their website so other people can try to find family connections.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Once you upload it to the website, it is public domain.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And he said, my friend William said, why don't you look at that website to see if you can find, because they had the Golden State Killers DNA from crime scenes.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 They go, you may not be able to find him, but you may be able to find one of his relatives who have taken one of these tests and uploaded it to the genealogical website,

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 and then that will narrow down the search.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So he sent that to them, and then about a month later, two months later, they caught him.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 They caught the Golden State Killer using a genealogical website.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 They found, I think, his brother or cousin or something like that, and they were able to trace him back.

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 He was an ex-cop, disgusting man, disgusting, disgusting man. I think he was in his 70s or whatnot.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 So he's caught.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And he, my friend is like, you know, I've asked, like, did you, you know, he's tried to kind of get clarification of whether or not he helped in the case, and he hasn't gotten any clarification.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Here's the thing, the cops are never going to admit if some rando sent them an email and they all of a sudden goes, hey, let's try that out.

175
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And I told him, I said, dude, it's very possible that you played a part in catching this guy.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I would just walk away with that.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I would say, you know, this is my story. I sent this off a couple months later. I don't need an official response from the, from the police.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 But then he goes, well, there's also a reward. And I go, okay, well, then yeah, I would want an official response from the police.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But that's also probably why they're not going to officially name you.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And he's putting his bid in for the reward. So good luck to him. Hopefully he'll get it.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 If you listen to this podcast and you have any sway in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I wonder if any FBI agents will listen to the show or CIA agents or anything like that.

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I think they'd be fairly interested in the topic. I'm sure I've popped up on some watch lists as I'm searching for some of these topics.

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So if you are, I hope you're having a good time. I hope you're enjoying the show.

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And if you know anybody, try to help my buddy out.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So anyway, so they've done that. And the story, though, that I really wanted to talk about was in Washington, so across the river.

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 This is crazy. So back in the, back in the 80s.

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Okay. A 12 year old girl is murdered. Michelle Walsh.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And then a about five months later, a 13 year old girl named Jennifer Bastien was also killed.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And the cops are like, okay, great, we have a serial killer killing these young girls. Tragic, tragic.

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And based on the DNA samples they found at the time, it was actually two different people.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 So they're thinking, well, maybe it's like a pair of murdering pair of people.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Maybe they're completely unrelated, but that's weird because they actually were relatively in the area.

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Oh, yeah. So what happens is now we're going to go ahead 32 years later.

194
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And they caught them by saying, hey, why don't we see if any of these idiots, I'm trying not to cuss.

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And I want to use really harsh language for them. But why wouldn't these idiots, maybe one of their relatives uploaded their information to a genealogical database.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And guess what? Both of them did. They were two totally unrelated murders. These two guys did not know each other.

197
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 They both decided to kill a teenage girl.

198
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And now they're caught, now they're in jail. The one guy is 66 and the other guy is 60. So insane.

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And you know, I don't know, it would be weird if that was the only one that they did.

200
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 If they did it once and just like, well, that's done. That fetish is over with or what.

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But here's, so I'm glad that they're locked up. I'm glad the Golden State Killer is locked up. Here's my thing.

202
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Are the cops playing fair? See, there's always been police and criminals.

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I've always been opposing sides, like the Bloods and the Crips, like the Nazis and the Doughboys.

204
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Wait, no, the Doughboys were over one. Like the Nazis and the GIs. Like the Japanese and the Chinese.

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Like, they're two opposing forces. The criminals do something, the police react to it.

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And there's like a set of rules that have been set up. Is this, is this fair?

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Now I know what you're thinking, Jason. I mean, of course I'm Jason.

208
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Now I know what you're thinking. Jason, why do you care how they catch these guys?

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Well, yeah, I don't, like, on the, I'm glad these guys are caught.

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 But let's say that I go into a crud, like I'm a hit man and I'm taking out my targets and I'm super, super careful about what I do.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And then my dopey brother sends his DNA to an ancestry.com thing and they find him and he goes like, "All right, I'm half Belgium."

212
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Belgian? People from, anyways, he's half that. And then finally the cops are like, "Oh, this is the guy who's murdered like 15 high profile politicians."

213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And now I'm caught because my brother wanted to know how much Swiss he had in him.

214
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Is that fair? Is that, is that part of the rules? Is that, you know, it's, and to be fair, yes, it is. It's completely fair.

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 These people deserve to go to jail. I get it. I get it. It's fascinating though because, and I've talked about that book.

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 It wasn't the history of crime. It's the mammoth book of true crime by Colin Wilson.

217
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And I'll post that in the links again because again, it's one of my favorite books.

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And he talks about the history of crime and the history of crime detection.

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 If you were committing crimes in the 1600s, you didn't worry about fingerprints.

220
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And then all of a sudden they started fingerprinting and then you were caught up in that.

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 So you had to start wearing gloves and then the same thing originally it wasn't DNA was blood type.

222
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And then it became DNA. And now it's not only your DNA, it's your relatives DNA.

223
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Facial recognition technology. What's next?

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 If I'm a criminal now and I'm committing some high profile crimes that the police are going to put massive resources towards,

225
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 what do I have to worry about 30 years from now? Where is the crime detection software going to be 30 years from now?

226
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Because again, we never thought about DNA before, you know, I think it was like the 50s.

227
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And DNA crime detection was I think started in the 80s, but maybe a little bit later.

228
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 So what's coming up next? Will they be able to put neural transmitters into people's brains and read the information from the like a victim's brain?

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Or will they be able to get it's like a DVR? Who knows? That may sound fantastical, but who knows?

230
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Because all the other crime techniques and it's amazing fingerprints, they used to, there's only like so many different basic types of fingerprints.

231
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So when you found a fingerprint at a crime scene, you had to have some guy in Jolly Old England in Scotland Yard.

232
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 They'd have a stack of fingerprints that were like oval shaped fingerprints and a stack of fingerprints that were this type of shape, like a basic shape.

233
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And you'd have to flip through cards of every criminal.

234
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 You know, if the crime scene had an oval shaped fingerprint, you'd break out the oval box and you would look through every single card and hold it up to the picture.

235
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Now that's all done in the database. Fascinating.

236
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I've actually thought about writing a story about a murderer that takes place on a space station.

237
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 So all of our crime scene techniques, all of our crime fighting techniques are useless.

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 There's no blood splatter because everything's in zero gravity.

239
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 There's no DNA because everyone's in a suit. No ballistics.

240
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 The gunpowder would be everywhere. Whatever weapon was used, a laser cutter.

241
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 A laser cutter would be even better because we'd have no basic forensic techniques.

242
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So you'd have this space station up there and an astronaut is killed and we have to send a detective up into space to solve the very first murder in space.

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Yeah, I think that'd be an interesting idea.

244
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 That's one of those ideas that I really like that I've came up with years ago.

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 But as a writer you go, I'm not talented enough to write that story now.

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Maybe someday. But right now that's a little out of my experience level of what I can write.

247
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 But I do think that's a fascinating story and if I do write it, I will maybe read it on the air for you guys.

248
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Or just post a link to where you can buy it, one of the two.

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Now, I did come across another story and this kind of made me laugh.

250
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Now there's a lot of controversy going on about sex robots.

251
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And I get it. You build a robot that looks just like a woman and I can do whatever I want to this.

252
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And we'll speak in generalities. I know that there's sex robots for men and women by them and gay men by them.

253
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 But the main ones right now are the female based robots for men, for straight men.

254
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So you build a robot that is the hyper realistic ideal version of a woman.

255
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 It's Vanessa in a robot form.

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Now I have mixed feelings about it because on one hand I like, part of the reason why I'm attracted to women is their personality.

257
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I mean, obviously their body plays a big part in it, but I like conversing.

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I like the back and forth and all of that stuff.

259
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 If I had a robot, if I had like, I think there's a difference between like a sex doll that is just immobile.

260
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 But if they ever built a robot with an AI that's like walking around my house and be like, "Hello, Jason. How are you doing? How was your day?"

261
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Then we tell you about mine and I can have a conversation with it.

262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Yeah, I'd buy one of those. I think that'd be awesome.

263
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But anyways, we're not there yet. So they do have them with a bit of AI right now.

264
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But anyways, so and then people are saying you're taking the female form and you're turning it into an object.

265
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 It's the ultimate objectification of women and other people are saying, "Listen."

266
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And on the men's side, they're saying, "Listen, I don't want to deal. I don't want to get married. I don't want to have kids.

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I've completely removed myself from the dating world, but I still want to have a attractive companion that I can have sex with."

268
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 This is the best option for me.

269
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 We want creeps to stop hitting on women, but then when they buy a robot that looks like a woman, that's considered worse.

270
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And I get where both sides are coming from.

271
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Men just want a subject in their life that they can love that they find physically attractive because their biology is telling them that is an attractive form.

272
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And then the other side is saying, "No, you're objectifying women. This is the ultimate objectification of women."

273
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And before I go any further, I'll say I really don't have a problem with sex robots.

274
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Like, I get both sides of the argument, but if I go over to someone's house and they had a sex robot there, I don't care.

275
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And like I said, if they get advanced enough, I'll have one.

276
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 That being said, children's sex robots? Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

277
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 People may go, "Well, that keeps them from going out and committing real pedophilia."

278
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Yeah, and I could buy a robot and chop its arms and legs off, and that may keep me from becoming a real serial killer.

279
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 But part of being a serial killer and part of being a pedophile isn't so much about the physical form, it's about the power domination.

280
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 So if I have a 10-year-old-looking robot, eventually that's not going...

281
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I'm not going to be happy with that because it's not giving me the true power and manipulation that you can have over a child.

282
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 If I just want a companion robot, an adult woman robot sitting in my living room, I can have that.

283
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Because part of being in a relationship isn't completely based on power, it's just companionship. Pedophilia is based on power.

284
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And I get it, virtuous pedophiles, all that stuff, blah blah blah. We'll do another episode about that, but child-like robots? Absolutely not.

285
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I don't think they can have adult robots with the most exaggerated forms of what an adult woman would look like.

286
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And I find that 100 times less offensive towards women than a natural-looking 12-year-old girl robot. That's gross.

287
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That rant being said...

288
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I read this article on The Sun and the headline is "Dirty Droids, Sex Robot Makers Blasted Over Sick Family Friendly Love Dolls That Steal Husbands and Scar Kids."

289
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 So they built these robots that you can actually... because usually the ones with AI will be like, "Yeah, spank me, Daddy.

290
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Ooh, yeah, I love you so much." But you can actually switch them so they are less sexual.

291
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 So they can have "normal conversations."

292
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And the article really focuses on a particular family, or a guy who has... he's married and he has kids, and his wife is like, "Yeah, sure, you can have a sex robot. I don't have a problem with that."

293
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And the robot, it will sometimes... he'll take it into the living room and it's dressed up and it interacts with their children.

294
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 The children will be like, "Hello, robot." And the robot will talk to them. And the article makes this guy out to be the grossest person in the world, that how dare he lets these kids interact with this sex robot.

295
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And again, she's not... he's not banging it in front of him.

296
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 But this is the funniest quote.

297
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 So he's married and has kids. He hasn't left his wife for this. And I read the headline.

298
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 This is the funniest quote from Dr. Kathleen Richardson. She's Professor of Ethics and Culture of Robots and AI at De Montfort University.

299
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 She said, "Children will imitate machines if brought up by them."

300
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Are they going to sit there motionless and just spout off pre-programmed phases? Are they going to rise up against humanity and be the... what is it?

301
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 The "Queeslings" of the robot revolution? Shooting down humans to appease their robot overlords because their dad had an attractive woman sitting on their couch as they grew up?

302
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Next sentence. "A daughter is going to grow up and think, 'Maybe this happened because mommy wasn't beautiful enough. Am I?'

303
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 They'll learn that women only have certain uses and then they start to use that as a template for how they interact intimately with others.

304
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 This is profoundly damaging." It's a robot sitting on the couch. And this is my question with this. Let's flip this.

305
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Let's say, take the robot out of the equation. This daughter's mother is stunning. Absolutely beautiful. She's perfect.

306
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Is that not... by this woman's logic, is that not psychologically damaging to the kid?

307
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 "Oh, my mother's so beautiful, but I'm not. How will I interact with the world if I'm not as beautiful as my mom?"

308
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 It's ridiculous. Because humans are still more attractive than these robots. These robots are very well made.

309
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 But a human woman is more attractive than one of these things, at least to me.

310
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 When you see these... and you'll see these robots, I'll see pictures and I'm like, "Damn, that robot's hot."

311
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 But you have to remember, too, that's the perfect lighting for these things. And this is a professional photographer.

312
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Because when you put these robots in a real situation, and when you look at this website, you'll see a couple different photos.

313
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 When you put the robots in real situations, they look like mannequins. They lose a lot of their sex appeal when these photos are taken under natural lighting.

314
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 But I just think that's so ridiculous. And again, this is almost like complaining for the sake of complaining.

315
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Children will imitate machines if brought up by them. Do children imitate a television set? Do they just sit there and make themselves as wide and flat as possible?

316
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And just let other people view them for hours a day? Do people imitate shower heads or toasters?

317
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 It's a robot sitting on a couch. Is it psychologically damaged to have a... damaging to have a beautiful mom?

318
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And then that sentence, "They'll learn that women only have certain uses." They have a mother in the household.

319
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 There's a mother in the household who's doing normal stuff. This is an object.

320
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And the thing is, eventually we're going to have to get used to robots eventually. I don't think the robot revolution is as close as everyone's lighting on.

321
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 You're going to lose your job. Robots are going to take over. I don't think it's as close as we think it is.

322
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I think it's coming, but I think, again, a lot of it is scare tactics. And we've gone over that multiple times.

323
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And I just don't... I don't see this idea. I don't agree with this doctor at all that these are going to be damaging.

324
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 We actually have another doctor, Dr. Kathy Hirsch-Pasek. She's a professor of psychology at Temple University.

325
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And her quote is, "It's like the Barbie doll image, telling girls how they should look. If the culture gives you this image, what are you going to do?

326
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 What a shame as they grow up. This is what they learn about their dad."

327
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Here's my question. Let's, again, flip the switch.

328
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Let's say the parents were in a polyamorous, open relationship.

329
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 So the dad had another woman who was a good friend. She comes over. She interacts with the children as well.

330
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 The woman is dating another woman. And she comes over and interacts with the kids. And they just have this open relationship.

331
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 There's no way this article would be about how damaging that is to children.

332
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 These professors would not come out and say that it's completely wrong. You need to have a man and a woman in the house.

333
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 How are these kids going to learn to interact with people with the same sex or in the house?

334
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 How is a little girl going to look at mommy with a mommy and go, "How am I supposed to interact with society because I feel heterosexual?"

335
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 This article would never have been written.

336
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Because we look at a polyamorous relationship or a same-sex relationship and we go, "Eh."

337
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Okay. You know, it's none of my business.

338
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 But you throw a robot in the mix and people who automatically have a bug up their butt about sex or robots go,

339
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 "This is damaging. This is wrong. That guy's a bad person. These kids are learning horrible things."

340
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And again, in that polyamorous relationship, what if the mom's girlfriend and the dad's girlfriend are 10s?

341
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 They're Victoria's secret models. Would that be damaging to this young girl's self-esteem?

342
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 No. They would, they would never be an article about that.

343
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Any article would say, "This is normal. This is celebrating this thing."

344
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Because if there was an article about that, people would go, "Why are you being bigoted about what people are doing in the comfort of their own homes?"

345
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And a professor's like, "No, no. Her girlfriend is so hot. You don't understand how damaging that is."

346
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 These little kids are going to learn that polyamory is okay.

347
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 People would be like, "Who care? Why do you care?"

348
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But the son knows that they'll get clicks and they know this is bashing sex robots

349
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 which is an industry a lot of people don't like, like I was saying in the beginning.

350
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Who cares what people do in the safety of their own home? They're not hurting anybody.

351
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 You have a sex robot sitting on your couch.

352
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And it's not, again, it's not like they may not even reference the dad's not like, "Oh, yeah, kids, meet Annabelle.

353
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 This is the robot I bang when I'm tired of looking at your mother naked."

354
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 It's just the thing they have.

355
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 People hate sex robots. I remember a couple episodes back, I said that when I was talking about pornography moving

356
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 the internet ahead.

357
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 If it wasn't for pornography, we wouldn't have Netflix.

358
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Pornography created that demand for high-speed video streaming.

359
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Same thing with robots.

360
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Robot technology is not going to advance because of economic factors.

361
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Robot technology advances. All technology advances for one of two reasons. Warfare and sex.

362
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 VCRs was the main reason behind VCRs.

363
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 The explosion of VCR technology was pornography, being able to watch pornography at home.

364
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Robots will be the same thing. Robots in the battlefield.

365
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Robots in sex, that's where the initial investments are going to be.

366
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And then 20 years later we'll have robot maids or robot police officers.

367
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 We already have some of that now, but you know what I mean?

368
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Like you have, it's generally a military application or a sexual application that moves technology forward.

369
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 So I applaud you, British family, for having a sex robot in your house.

370
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I think it's completely normal.

371
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Just like I would applaud any quote-unquote "untraditional family structure" in the house.

372
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Because it doesn't impact me.

373
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 As long as the kids aren't being physically or emotionally hurt,

374
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 if these families can raise their kids better than a heterosexual mother and father family

375
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 where they are like beating their kids, why is this anyone's business?

376
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 So people don't like these sex robots. That's really the main thing.

377
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 They're going to find any reason to trash talk this technology.

378
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And now it's think of the children, think of the children, and that's not going to work.

379
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It's just an untraditional relationship.

380
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And untraditional relationships shouldn't be shut down just because you're scared of them.

381
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Don't be a robophobic, basically.

382
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 That's going to be tonight's episode of Dead or Abbey Radio.

383
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I hope you guys had a good time. I thought those were pretty interesting stories.

384
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 It's sweltering hot in here. I think I've lost 5 pounds just in water weight.

385
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And I hope you are comfortable and cool wherever you are at.

386
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 You can hit me up. Our website is deadrabbit.com.

387
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 We also have our email address at deadrabbitradio@gmail.com.

388
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 You can email me there with any stories.

389
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 You got some facts that I got wrong, and my whole email address would be full of facts that I got wrong.

390
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 But feel free to send me any story ideas, things like that.

391
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 You can also hit me up at Twitter @jasonocarpenter.

392
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 That is my Twitter. We're going to be getting Instagram set up soon.

393
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 We got the YouTube channel under Deadrabbit Radio. That's going really well.

394
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 I'm getting-- that's mostly people clicking on the smaller videos.

395
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 What I do is I'll generally take one of these recordings, chop it in half, or take out a particular story

396
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 that I know people will be interested in and throw that up on YouTube.

397
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 That's working out really well for us.

398
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 But what's working out best for me, and I hope it's working out best for you, is this podcast.

399
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 I'm having a ton of fun doing this. I'm always looking forward to doing it.

400
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 On the weekends, I'm always kind of bummed out because I'm not recording anything.

401
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 I'm always like, "Oh, man, you know, I wish I was doing that."

402
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 But I got to pace myself. I got to pace myself because I don't want to burn out.

403
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 This was episode 27. That's awesome.

404
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 I'm having a great time, and if you've just discovered the podcast or you've been listening to us since the first episode,

405
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 thank you so much for spending your time and your day with me.

406
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Have a great weekend. We will be back Monday with some brand new stories.

407
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 My name is Jason Carpenter, and thanks for hopping in. Have a great day, guys.

408
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
