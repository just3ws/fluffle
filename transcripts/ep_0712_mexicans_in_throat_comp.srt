1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Thomas Hanks, a man whose name is normally associated with great films like Big, The

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,720
 Burbs, Dragnet, and Joe vs. the Volcano.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,440
 I'm sure he wants some Academy Awards, but those are his best ones.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,560
 But nowadays the name Tom Hanks is synonymous with Adrena Chrome Parties, and being executed

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:37,400
 just a few days ago.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,280
 And then talk about the ramblings of a man man.

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,240
 While I was on vacation, I got so sick.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,600
 I was on Death's Door, I went on a "unintentional spirit quest."

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,240
 I blacked out and journeyed through the void.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,680
 And while I was walking through the endless eternal darkness, I found out that two Mexican

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,600
 people live in my esophagus.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,280
 Today, on season 15 premiere of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:21,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,800
 I hope you guys are okay with that unusually long intro.

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
 It's season 15.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,360
 It is the start of a brand new season.

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,600
 I do apologize.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,080
 I'm a day late.

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,880
 I thought I got mixed up with- I did almost die.

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,880
 I did almost die on my vacation.

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,280
 So you'll have to excuse me.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,480
 My date keeping skills aren't up to par yet.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,800
 But yeah, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,960
 So we're only gonna have two episodes this week and the next week.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,080
 We're gonna start doing the normal weekly.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
 Sorry, I apologize for that.

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,800
 It took a little bit longer than I had planned to do.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,840
 But I know someone who will always allow me to take as long as I want.

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
 It sounded weird.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,080
 One of our newest Patreon supporters floating into Dead Rabbit Command.

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
 It's Morphous Gas.

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,080
 Everyone give a round of applause to Morphous Gas.

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,480
 This little cloud's floating into Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,440
 Morphous, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,280
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,400
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,560
 Ask yourself, what did I do to promote Dead Rabbit Radio today?

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,600
 And then do something.

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,000
 Don't just ask yourself that question.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Do something.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,040
 Also, quick behind the scenes note, we are gonna be doing a lot of stuff on TikTok going

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
 forward.

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,440
 So subscribe to my TikTok @DeadRabbitRadio.

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
 It's gonna be a lot of the stories that you've heard in the past, but a minute long.

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,840
 So if you haven't listened to every episode, that's a good way to catch up.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,320
 And there will be no dancing.

50
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,000
 If you're afraid that I will be dancing, I guarantee you there will be no dancing on

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 my TikTok.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
 Just lots of cool, old stuff.

53
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
 And some new stuff.

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,680
 There's gonna be a lot of true crime that I don't really want to talk about on the podcast.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,280
 I don't want to talk about on the podcast.

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,000
 So I'll pollute my Dead Rabbit Radio TikTok account for that.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,520
 So, but TikTok dancing or no TikTok dancing, it's time to get today's episode started.

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
 Morphous Gas.

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,480
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to one of our brand new vehicles, the Dead Rabbit Dropship.

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
 Go, go, go!

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
 Everyone's running on it.

62
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
 You're just sitting there.

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
 You thought you were just listening?

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,440
 You thought you were just gonna sit and listen to a podcast?

65
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
 No way!

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
 You gotta get up and run.

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,000
 You got all your military gear on.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
 We're running onto the Dead Rabbit Dropship.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,640
 And there's like a sergeant on board and he's like, "We're moving in with first wave.

70
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,000
 You kill anything that looks like Tom Hanks?"

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,880
 And you're like, "What?

72
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,040
 That's so specific.

73
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
 Why don't you just say we kill Tom Hanks?"

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,320
 And he goes, "No, we're gonna smash the entire area.

75
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,320
 If it looks like Tom Hanks, you get him.

76
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,040
 What if I were supposed to kill him?

77
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 He's a really bad sergeant.

78
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,360
 Cause you don't like where he's supposed to kill him?

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
 Are you arresting this guy?

80
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 Dead Rabbit Dropship.

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,160
 Leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

82
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,920
 We're headed out to Milan, Italy.

83
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,120
 It's June 12th, 2021.

84
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 Super recent story.

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,320
 I'm surprised this isn't getting more play in the lame stream media.

86
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,840
 This is too busy talking about the Olympics and medals and stuff like that.

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,560
 When the real medals should be put on the chests of the 173rd Airborne Combat Brigade,

88
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:25,440
 because those are the heroes that recently arrested no one Adrena Chrome Smuggler, Tom

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
 Hanks.

90
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,840
 I know you guys have fond memories of Tom Hanks starring in all of those movies.

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,280
 All those childhood movies you watched.

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,440
 Like Philadelphia and Saving Private Ryan.

93
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,040
 All those Saturday afternoons.

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,280
 Watching a man's face get blown to pieces.

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,520
 But maybe you're like me before he started doing all this ultra violent and depressing

96
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
 stuff.

97
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
 When I was a kid, Tom Hanks was hilarious.

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,680
 Tom Hanks was so funny.

99
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,600
 He was in Dragnet, which is very, very interesting, and the Burbs.

100
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,720
 You know the Burbs is a very, very famous movie he was in and it was about a conspiracy.

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,600
 It was about a man who believes there's like a satanic, cannibal cult in his neighborhood.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,360
 And when we talk, Tom Hanks is such a fascinating character outside of his whole acting career.

103
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,880
 Outside of the stuff that's real.

104
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,560
 Because he's been embroiled in this huge Pizza Gate, pedophilia, Adrena Chrome scandal for

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,520
 a couple years now.

106
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,400
 And the COVID thing first started.

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,360
 When those lockdowns first started, he was in New Zealand, I believe.

108
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,280
 And he was one of the first casualties of this war where people go, he's not really

109
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,960
 in, because he said, I have COVID.

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,320
 And he was one of the first like famous people who got it.

111
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
 And he goes, I got COVID and then the conspiracy started.

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 No, he doesn't have COVID.

113
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,200
 Well, he may have COVID, but he's not in a medical facility.

114
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,880
 He's not locked down in his hotel room.

115
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,840
 He's actually in prison.

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
 You guys remember that?

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
 We covered it a little bit back then.

118
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
 So weird.

119
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,960
 But Tom Hanks has been embroiled in these weird conspiracies for quite a while.

120
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,000
 But when you go back and look at his filmography, he actually had two movies that dealt with

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,360
 secret satanic societies trying to take over the world or take over the city or the neighborhood.

122
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,840
 The Burbs, most famously, but Dragonet was a remake of the old television show was him

123
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
 and Dan Ackroyd.

124
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,400
 And there was a satanic cult in Los Angeles.

125
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,960
 Like it was the powerful and elite people of Hollywood trying to sacrifice virgins and

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,760
 drink their blood and all this stuff.

127
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,680
 Fascinating because when you look at the Tom Hanks conspiracy theories, a lot of people

128
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,040
 bring up the Burbs.

129
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,120
 A lot of people kind of say that maybe he was trying to warn us or maybe that was predictive

130
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
 programming.

131
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,760
 No one brings up Dragonet.

132
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,120
 And I spent 30 years since I watched Dragonet, but I remember I watched it a lot as a kid.

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,320
 I thought it was super fascinating.

134
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,960
 Now I wonder if there is a connection between people who were fans of the Burbs and the

135
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,160
 one person who apparently saw Dragonet me and people who do or went on to be conspiracy

136
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,640
 theorists because there is a really interesting Venn diagram between people who believe that

137
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,760
 Tom Hanks is an Adrenaline Chrome addicted freak today and who also enjoyed the movie

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
 the Burbs.

139
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,640
 But all of this information, quote unquote information, is coming from us from one of

140
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,600
 my favorite websites.

141
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,640
 Real raw news.

142
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,520
 It is a website that's right.

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,160
 I can't even describe it as like a journalism website or a news website because neither

144
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,560
 of those words really fit it.

145
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,160
 It would be closer compared to like Wattpad, like a straight up fictional website.

146
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,880
 But people believe it.

147
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,840
 People totally believe that what this guy's saying, most of the articles are written by

148
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,920
 an author named Michael Baxter if that's his real name.

149
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,040
 But he's been going on and on about body doubles and Nancy Pelosi.

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,640
 You can pull her head off like it's, don't try, don't try this.

151
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,880
 Don't actually go to Washington DC and go, oh dead rabbit radio.

152
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,840
 I can do this and start yanking on Nancy Pelosi's hair.

153
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,800
 But apparently if you see Nancy Pelosi, there's like a 50/50 chance that she's actually a

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,760
 Scooby-Doo villain and it's a body double and a mask.

155
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,760
 And Joe Biden is either hologram or he's a body double who was in the movie Curse of

156
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
 the Komodo.

157
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
 We've covered all of this stuff.

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,000
 We've covered all of this stuff because I find it so fascinating.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,080
 But now on June 12th, 2021, the chickens have come home to roost in the story of Tom Hanks

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,120
 because a lot of people do believe he's highly tied into this Adrenaline Chrome smuggling,

161
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
 pedophile horrible stuff.

162
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,680
 He was arrested by the 173rd Airborne Combat.

163
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
 Let me back up.

164
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
 According to Real Raw News, according to this website, I don't want people to be like,

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
 "Whoa, Jason said it."

166
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,360
 According to Real Raw News, all of this.

167
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,280
 He's sitting in his private jet with his longtime friend.

168
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,600
 This is what I don't understand.

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 You can eat.

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,360
 Tons of people are saying that Tom Hanks is an Adrenaline Chrome addict and a pedophile.

171
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,680
 And those are both horrible accusations to make.

172
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
 But whatever.

173
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,920
 Like, that's horrible and people make those accusations.

174
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,760
 This is what I don't understand about Real Raw News.

175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 Because they add details that are so superfluous to the article itself that I think they're

176
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,040
 joking at this point.

177
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,320
 I clearly think they're pulling everyone's leg and the audience doesn't realize that.

178
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,400
 So Tom Hanks is arrested at his private jet.

179
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,520
 He's also hanging out with his buddy Peter Scalarri from Buzzing Buddies, which is interesting.

180
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,120
 Peter Scalarri, for you Scalarri heads out there.

181
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,640
 You're like, "Oh my God, is he tied up in this Illuminati Plateau?"

182
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,760
 No, it's weird.

183
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,320
 Michael Baxter reports that even though Peter Scalarri is a longtime friend, half of you

184
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,760
 are Scalarri heads, the other half of you is, "Who the hell is Peter Scalarri?"

185
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,000
 Why are you kidding me?

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,680
 So back in the 1980s, there was a show, this is the height of sitcoms, right?

187
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,240
 Like high concept sitcoms.

188
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
 There was a show, I loved it, as a kid called Buzzing Buddies.

189
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
 It was about Tom Hanks and Peter Scalarri.

190
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,040
 Future Adrena Chromatic Tom Hanks and his longtime friend Peter Scalarri.

191
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,600
 They were dudes whose house was demolished on accident or on purpose, I don't remember.

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,200
 And they had to then live at the woman's dorms on college so they dressed up like women

193
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,000
 and pretended they were women on this whole sitcom.

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,360
 They ran for like two or three seasons.

195
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,400
 And they're constantly spying on their sexy roommates.

196
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,600
 Buzzing Buddies, best theme song for a television show ever as well.

197
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 Second best.

198
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 The gummy bears theme song is really good too.

199
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,040
 You should have taken a couple more days off, you're clearly not up to this job again.

200
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,560
 What I can't figure out is that Michael Baxter goes through the detail of adding this saying

201
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
 that Peter Scalarri was on the plane.

202
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,360
 Most people do not know who Peter Scalarri is.

203
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,640
 I'm sure even Peter Scalarri's listening to this podcast, he's like, "Huh?

204
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
 Who's this guy?

205
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,960
 Who's this guy he's talking about?"

206
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,080
 And then if you do know who Peter Scalarri is, for the rest of the article you're singing

207
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,680
 the theme song to Buzzing Buddies, because it's super catchy.

208
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,520
 He says that Peter Scalarri's on the plane and then you go, "Oh no, Peter Scalarri must

209
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,320
 be wrapped up in this Illuminati Plateau."

210
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,400
 No, the 173rd Airborne Combat Brigade lets Peter Scalarri go.

211
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,560
 Which doesn't make any sense because if he...

212
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
 How...

213
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
 Let me ask you this, dude.

214
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
 How...

215
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,060
 Let's say you have a buddy.

216
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,960
 Let's say you have a buddy you used to dress up as the opposite sex with and you used to

217
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,840
 peep on women.

218
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,080
 Or don't do that.

219
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
 Let's not imagine that.

220
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,200
 But imagine your best friend.

221
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,600
 You're hanging out with your best friend for past 30 years.

222
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,360
 And that friend also injected the adrenaline.

223
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,120
 That friend who you're like, "Hey buddy, what's up?

224
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
 What are you doing this week?"

225
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
 And you hang out with them.

226
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,080
 What are the chances that that guy, without your knowledge, without you knowing it all,

227
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,480
 also injected the adrenaline of dead children into the base of his neck?

228
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,360
 How long do you think your best friend could get away with that?

229
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,920
 And you not know.

230
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,360
 Because we apparently know this is being talked about all over the internet.

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,840
 But even forgetting that, like, if my...

232
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,600
 Every so often I saw my friend, he had a big black eye and he seemed a little hyper than

233
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,280
 normal, I'd start to suspect he must be injecting the adrenaline of dead children into the back

234
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 of his neck.

235
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,080
 I don't think you could get away with it that long.

236
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,400
 So anyways, long time Tom Hanks friend, Peter Scolari, is free.

237
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,640
 So if you are a Scolari, don't worry about him.

238
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,600
 But Tom Hanks was arrested and was taken to like a military tribunal.

239
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,120
 You know, he never served in the military.

240
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,040
 Saving Private Ryan was not a documentary.

241
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,000
 For some reason, he's brought before like a...

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,200
 Three generals have to review the footage against him.

243
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,440
 Like all the evidence against him.

244
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 But apparently, there are hundreds of videos of Tom Hanks engaged in heinous acts against

245
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
 children.

246
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,520
 Also according to Real Raw News, the judges watched snippets of four of the clips and

247
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,200
 said, you know what, that's it.

248
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,720
 You're guilty.

249
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 You're guilty.

250
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
 We just watched four snippets.

251
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,220
 And that made me think.

252
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,520
 Is that how trials work?

253
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,160
 Can you present a bunch of evidence?

254
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,200
 And then someone just watch a little bit of it and go, I'm good.

255
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,160
 Because you think...

256
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,320
 You think I'm someone who came to you with 500 videos of Tom Hanks engaged in horrible

257
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 acts?

258
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,680
 Like would you be like, I've watched the first 470, but these last 30 may change my

259
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
 doesn't mind.

260
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,520
 They may change my decision.

261
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,080
 Would you just be able to watch snippets?

262
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,680
 Because you wouldn't want to watch all of it, right?

263
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,520
 And then I started thinking, if you're in a jury for like horrible stuff against kids,

264
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,560
 they don't make you watch that stuff, right?

265
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,640
 I'm assuming they don't.

266
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
 I don't know.

267
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,080
 Like, I can't imagine they would subject a jury to that.

268
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,920
 And they would ask the jury, are you comfortable with watching this material beforehand?

269
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,440
 And anyone who said yes, well, they're just going to get arrested anyways.

270
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,360
 So maybe they wouldn't have to watch all 500 videos.

271
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,680
 I'm not saying that they should, but anyways, apparently there's 500 videos of Tom Hanks

272
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,320
 doing this stuff.

273
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,280
 And again, the weird details that they add is always so fascinating to me.

274
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,400
 Not only are there a bunch of videos of Tom Hanks supposedly doing horrible stuff to kids,

275
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,560
 we have this quote from Real Raw News.

276
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,920
 "One video showed Hanks and Songstress."

277
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
 That's a word.

278
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
 That's a word now.

279
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
 Did you not know that?

280
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
 She's not a singer.

281
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 She's a Songstress.

282
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,400
 "One video showed Hanks and Songstress, Lady Gaga, injecting each other with the Drina

283
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:47,000
 Chrome, injecting each other while an unseen child screams," echoed in the background.

284
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 "That video doesn't exist.

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
 That video does not exist at all."

286
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
 So why would Michael Baxter make that up?

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,680
 I don't, that's what's always so fascinating to me.

288
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,720
 Like, why does he add that creepy element into it?

289
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,280
 Did he, does he think that video exists?

290
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,000
 Did someone tell him this video?

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 That's always a weird thing.

292
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,600
 Someone's feeding this information, but imagine, like why is he imagining that and putting

293
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
 it in?

294
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
 Who knows?

295
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,480
 But anyways, according to him, that exists.

296
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,240
 And oh, I'm sorry, I misspoke.

297
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,000
 I said there were 500 videos.

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,760
 I'm looking further down on my notes.

299
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
 That's incorrect.

300
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
 There's 50 videos.

301
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
 Big difference.

302
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
 But I also left this part out.

303
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,400
 There's not 500 videos.

304
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,120
 There's 50 videos and 2000 photographs.

305
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,720
 So I think actually I kind of met him in the middle somewhere, but that was all the evidence

306
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,680
 that the military tribunal needed.

307
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
 They watched a couple clips.

308
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,440
 They're like, "Gros, you know Lady Gaga?

309
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,200
 Guilty, guilty of all charges."

310
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,680
 And so he has been executed, death by lethal injection.

311
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,520
 Quite ironic for a man who's most famous, not for saving Private Ryan, not for getting

312
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,720
 big or forced gump in it.

313
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,320
 No, he's the man who will always be known as the Adrenochrome addict.

314
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
 Tom Hanks.

315
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,640
 It's so funny because the reason why, I'm not going to go really into this.

316
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,400
 I've touched on it in different episodes.

317
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,760
 You know why Tom Hanks is tied into this?

318
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,200
 Two people.

319
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,160
 Two people really started the whole Tom Hanks thing.

320
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,440
 There was a woman on Twitter named Sarah Ashcraft who said her father, when she was 12, sold

321
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,920
 her as a mind-controlled slave to Tom Hanks.

322
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,360
 That was one of the big accusations.

323
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,760
 There was a random account on Twitter that's been shut down now.

324
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,520
 A woman named Sarah Ashcraft says she was mind-controlled monarch slave type of thing,

325
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,200
 sold to Tom Hanks.

326
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,800
 And then Isaac Cappy, a actor who's done bit parts his entire life.

327
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,680
 And then he started making accusations that he knew about the Illuminati pedophile control

328
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,640
 of Hollywood.

329
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,800
 And then he killed himself.

330
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,920
 The conspiracy theorists say that he was, uh, suicided.

331
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,420
 That he was actually killed.

332
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,880
 And he publicly accused Tom Hanks of pedophilia.

333
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,760
 And this is such a weird thing.

334
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,120
 Tom Hanks has a hobby of taking photographs of lost items.

335
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,280
 And a month before, I, this isn't weird because of the coincidence.

336
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,160
 It's just weird that Tom Hanks has this bizarre hobby.

337
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,360
 A month before Isaac Cappy died, Tom Hanks took a photo of a glove on historic Route 66

338
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,800
 and titled it Roadkill.

339
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,400
 And then a month later on Route 66 actually was Interstate 40 where he killed himself

340
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
 or was suicided.

341
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,920
 Isaac Cappy jumped or was forced off of a bridge and then got hit by a car.

342
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,640
 It was about 2,300 miles of Route 66.

343
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,440
 So, but people have said that the origin, the story behind the photograph has changed.

344
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,960
 Some people say the photograph now was taken days before Isaac died.

345
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,160
 Some people say it was at the same location.

346
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,360
 That's it.

347
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,960
 That's how Tom Hanks got wrapped up in all this stuff.

348
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,840
 And people, it's now part of pure Illuminati, Adrenochrome conspiracy theory that Tom

349
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
 Hanks is browning.

350
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,960
 Imagine if two people made allegations against you.

351
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,680
 Two people.

352
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,720
 And for the rest of time you're tied into that.

353
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 That's really what this is.

354
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,960
 I find the whole Tom Hanks getting wrapped up in this conspiracy theory so fascinating

355
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,440
 because it's really two people and it's tragic that Isaac Cappy died.

356
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,640
 It is tragic that Isaac Cappy died.

357
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,720
 But yeah, even Isaac Cappy's origin story, he does, there are pedophiles in Hollywood.

358
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
 See that's what always clouds this thing.

359
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,600
 There are pedophiles in Hollywood and they are powerful and they do protect each other.

360
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,900
 That's real.

361
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,800
 But it's when you get into the Satan worshipping and they eat the babies and drink the blood

362
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 and the Adrenochrome and stuff like that is when you actually stop looking at the real

363
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,560
 pedophiles and you start looking for the imaginary ones.

364
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,000
 And you start to think who's the one who's actually propping up these conspiracy theories.

365
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,440
 Because if more and more people are looking at Tom Hanks and trying to figure out if he's

366
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,800
 really in prison, are you looking at the actual pedophiles in Hollywood?

367
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
 And you're not.

368
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
 You're absolutely not.

369
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
 So it's all very fascinating.

370
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,640
 Isaac Cappy, what happened was this is really his Illuminati awakening origin story.

371
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,240
 He was hanging out with Seth Green and he was being shown a tour of Seth Green's house

372
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,200
 and Seth Green pointed to this door in his house and he goes, "That's where we keep the

373
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
 children."

374
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,640
 And he goes, "Edgy joke."

375
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,360
 And Isaac Cappy took that joke seriously and thought that there are actually children

376
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,520
 behind that door and that really kind of started his Illuminati, trying to expose the Illuminati.

377
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,040
 And again, I go back to the thing.

378
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,280
 Think about an edgy joke you've made in your past or maybe you were going to make later

379
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,720
 this afternoon and someone hearing that and taking that joke as truth and then spreading

380
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,600
 that throughout the internet and then that person killing themselves.

381
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,480
 And you for the rest of the time will be accused of being part of this conspiracy theory.

382
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,960
 You made this racist joke or the sexist joke or just this out of place edgy joke and now

383
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,240
 you're tied into this conspiracy theory.

384
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,080
 It's fascinating stuff how these conspiracy theories develop.

385
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,920
 And then I was watching a music video Isaac Cappy did because Isaac Cappy was a struggling

386
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
 actor.

387
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
 He was trying to make it in the industry.

388
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,200
 He made a music video with this guy from Bander Plump Rules.

389
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,000
 And in the music video, Isaac Cappy uses a device to mentally control women and have

390
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 sex with them.

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,840
 In the music video that Isaac Cappy himself decided to make uses monarch mind control and

392
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,600
 Illuminati symbology.

393
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 It's fascinating.

394
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 It's fascinating stuff.

395
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,920
 See, that's, I'll put that video on the show notes, but that's been completely, oh no,

396
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,800
 he's one of the good guys.

397
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,240
 He's trying to expose the Illuminati.

398
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,200
 I remember, and the reason I want to say this too, the reason why I love covering real

399
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,840
 raw news is this episode is going to go long.

400
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,640
 It's first episode of the season.

401
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,240
 One of the reasons why I love covering real raw news is you have to remember I used to

402
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,840
 believe in this stuff way more than I do now.

403
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
 Nowadays, believe in aliens, ghosts, demons, stuff like that.

404
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,280
 But I used to, and some conspiracy theories, but I used to really, really believe in conspiracy

405
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
 theories.

406
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,840
 I was 100% a 9/11 truth or I was 100% believe.

407
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
 I want to say 100%.

408
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,760
 I was like 90, 80% that the powerful people in Hollywood and in the world had to make

409
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,840
 sacrifices and have to be part of the secret society and all of these things.

410
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,440
 I believe that stuff.

411
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,720
 I'm sorry, I had to take a break there.

412
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,640
 Someone started power washing, power washing their house right next door.

413
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
 Three weeks.

414
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 I don't record an episode.

415
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
 Everything's fine.

416
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,800
 And then I start recording someone starts power washing.

417
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,480
 But what I was saying, and I'll wrap it up like this, I never believed in conspiracy,

418
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,000
 I always believed in conspiracy theories and things like that to varying degrees.

419
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,960
 But the idea of a powerful cabal controlling Hollywood and you have to be on the inside

420
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,560
 to really make it and that they gave, they Illuminati gave you commands and they had to

421
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
 put certain things in your video.

422
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,880
 He had to do certain rituals.

423
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,440
 I believed that and I never believed it more than when I was a struggling musician.

424
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,480
 Because you're working your butt off trying to make it.

425
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,520
 And you start to think, why is this dude making it?

426
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,080
 Why is this super attractive guy with tons of talent and connections?

427
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,080
 How come he's famous and not me?

428
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,960
 This little shrub from Orangevale, California.

429
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,880
 You start to think, how come I'm obviously better than this dude?

430
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,760
 What is this old Michael Bolton?

431
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 I'm like, what?

432
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,800
 I'm totally a better singer than him.

433
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,040
 You start to think, how come I'm not good?

434
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,800
 I never believed in Illuminati conspiracy theory more than I was a struggling musician.

435
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,960
 Like nowadays, I believe that there are people trying to rule the world.

436
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,240
 I believe there are multiple groups, not just one.

437
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,200
 I believe there are multiple groups trying to rule localities, cities, the world.

438
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,760
 If they're super rich and they really want to try it, but I don't think it's any one

439
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
 group in particular.

440
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,120
 I think it's a lot of other groups fighting for control.

441
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,760
 But the idea of this one group controlling everything and you have to be an Illuminati

442
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,280
 mind control slave or you had to like bow down to the Dark Lord.

443
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,440
 Michael Bolton, you had to sit there and you had to be like, please, please let me be famous.

444
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,480
 I believe that I never believed that more than when I was a struggling musician.

445
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,160
 Nowadays, I believe that, you know, there are groups like that out there, but I don't think

446
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,080
 it's the end all be all to success.

447
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,880
 And I think that's what Isaac Cappy, you'll see reviews and info wars.

448
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,200
 Alex Jones said he's a pretty big actor.

449
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,680
 People refer to him as a Marvel actor because he was he was the pet shop owner in the first

450
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
 Thor.

451
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,400
 He and I'm not knocking extras.

452
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,840
 I'm not knocking people who are working the industry.

453
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,560
 But he was by no means a successful actor, more successful actor than I am.

454
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,640
 But you know what I mean?

455
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,800
 And I think they try to build it up.

456
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,960
 And I think his origin story was he's struggling actor.

457
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,320
 Seth Green made that joke about that's where we keep the kids.

458
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,160
 He starts thinking what it maybe that's why Seth Green to be fair.

459
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,960
 I don't know why Seth Green is famous.

460
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,240
 I've been watching him my entire life growing up.

461
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,600
 I'm sure he's a really nice guy.

462
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,000
 But I don't mean to throw shade at Seth Green.

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,120
 I'm sorry if I lost some green ads.

464
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,240
 I'm paid transport or some sure he's a great guy.

465
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,000
 But I've always been like huh what?

466
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,720
 So anyways, maybe Isaac Cappy thought that because he's like really this guy's famous.

467
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,240
 Struggling actor and he starts to think and and because he is an actor in any way shape

468
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,000
 or form and when he starts saying the Illuminati controls Hollywood and Tom Hanks as a pedophile

469
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
 and Seth Green has kids in his basement.

470
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,400
 People outside the industry who all read I think the Illuminati controlling Hollywood

471
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,880
 I think that attracts a lot of struggling artists.

472
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,720
 I think that does attract a lot of people who are writers and musicians and filmmakers

473
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,240
 and they are really trying to be creative and their professional and their private life

474
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,200
 and they can't be.

475
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,000
 And I think they start to go maybe it's because the Illuminati.

476
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,040
 Mark Marin one of the most famous comedians now.

477
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,240
 He was a struggling stand-up comedian for decades.

478
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,960
 And I was listening to his podcast, BETF podcast years ago and he said there was a time period

479
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,600
 and when he believed the Illuminati existed because he was struggling in Hollywood for

480
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,880
 so long and he thought started thinking maybe they do exist.

481
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,000
 But you know now that he's interviewing President Obama now that he has like what the number

482
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 one maybe in the top five podcasts in the world he doesn't believe in anymore because

483
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 he's not a member of the Illuminati but when he was struggling no matter what he did he

484
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 couldn't make it.

485
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,160
 I think that that's where this Illuminati controlling Hollywood conspiracy theory really

486
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,040
 flourishes and I think that's what happened with Isaac Cappy and because he was in Hollywood

487
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,200
 if he was just a plumber making these YouTube videos people would people he would just be

488
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,760
 one of many people who were making these comments.

489
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,440
 If he was a plumber at a Hollywood producer's household the presence would go up then he

490
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,000
 could go aw you won't believe it this producer one day he took a big dump and I went to go

491
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,920
 fix his pipe and I saw Tom Hanks injecting Adrena Crome and you'd be like what well maybe

492
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,200
 because he has more access than I do and at the end of the day it's still a man just

493
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
 saying things.

494
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,400
 And the guy who played Butzer Pie from Clown Camp Massacre does he really have did Isaac

495
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,800
 Cappy in roles like that he was in Breaking Bad as Rowdy Prisoner did he really have access

496
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:41,640
 to these Illuminati secrets because then you figure everyone would what about the other

497
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,080
 ten clowns from Clown Camp Massacre.

498
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,760
 He was in the cast of Lemonade Mouth as Mel like you start to think like if someone at

499
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,080
 this low level knows all these secrets and does everybody because I have friends in

500
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,800
 who in the Hollywood machine and they haven't said anything but again maybe they are Illuminati

501
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:06,280
 agents I think the story of Isaac Cappy is tragic because he passed away but I think

502
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,200
 it's it's made him more famous than he would have ever been and I'm not saying that him

503
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,200
 passing away made him more famous but the saga of because he was getting famous while

504
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,000
 he was alive the saga of he's exposing the pedophiles and the Illuminati control of Hollywood

505
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,640
 has made him more famous than he would have ever been if he'd continue to work his entire

506
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,520
 life in the industry.

507
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,560
 And Tom Hanks for a huge segment of the conspiracy theory society there's a minister named Pastor

508
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,240
 Greg Locke who's becoming more and more famous he's doing all these sermons against wearing

509
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,240
 masks and don't get vaccinated and stuff like that and he's kind of starting to become a

510
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,640
 viral no pun intended a viral video minister if he's really taken off there's a video

511
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,040
 of him I'll see if I have a copy of it I don't know actually where I got it I got it off

512
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,280
 like YouTube or something like that but I'm trying to think of anyways there's a video

513
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,080
 of his private video of that Greg Locke's sermons no no he's doing this thing and he's

514
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,880
 doing the sermon and he starts going off about Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey and I'm

515
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,400
 thinking if you went to his church just thinking oh you know what I wonder what Jesus is up

516
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,280
 to today I haven't heard from him in about 2000 years I wonder what Jesus is doing you

517
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,280
 go to church and then he starts screaming about Tom Hanks you'd be like what and the

518
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,160
 audience's congregation is like yeah yeah boo Tom Hanks you're like what did he do he's

519
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,200
 not he's just in the okay fine saving private Ryan wasn't that good of a movie but I don't

520
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,840
 think he should be listed up there with that horrible war criminal Oprah why it would totally

521
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,720
 boggle your mind why someone was going off about Tom Hanks in church but if you know

522
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,120
 the code if you know the story Tom Hanks is a pedophile but to 98% of the world they're

523
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,720
 like what fascinating story and again I used to believe I didn't believe this conspiracy

524
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,520
 theory specifically because I was out of it by the time this was growing up but I believed

525
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,400
 in all of these conspiracy theories that Hollywood was taken over by the Illuminati St. worshiping

526
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,760
 groups and you know and I that's what I love about real raw news it's not far from what

527
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,320
 I used to believe these totally insane conspiracy theories to me it's like looking at a fun

528
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,880
 house mirror and you got to remember where you came from it's okay to mock people but

529
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,200
 sometimes you got to admit that that those people used to be you let's go ahead and move

530
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:31,240
 on to our last story for the day and this one is a little more personal myself as a

531
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,040
 horrible conspiracy theories back in the day man I was cool back then I was one of the

532
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,520
 cool conspiracy theories don't think I was some big old dork but yeah no I totally believe

533
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,960
 in all this stuff. Morphous gas let's go ahead and toss you the key we got to dust this bad

534
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,880
 boy off because we have not used this in a while let's toss you the keys to the carpenter

537
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,880
 gas take us in this carpenter copter we're leaving behind Milan Italy we are headed out

538
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:15,280
 to Sacramento California Sacramento California my hometown anyone trying to hack my passwords

539
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,680
 and they ask what city were you born in Sacramento California my hometown the place I visit every

540
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,840
 show often that's where I've been after the past three weeks lounging taking a vacation

541
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,200
 from the show taking a vacation from work just chillin playing video games which is something

542
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,240
 I don't get to do anymore because I'm so busy watching movies hanging out with my mom a

543
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,760
 lot of fun but I almost died I almost died we talked about this briefly on the July 18th

544
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,560
 Alien Abduction Special I'll put that on the show notes you guys should listen to it I

545
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,680
 had a lot of fun during that a lot of fun with them but right before that happened so

546
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:57,960
 I recorded that on Sunday July 18th I was horribly sick for the week previous to that

547
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,800
 from Sunday the 11th pretty much right when my vacation started I got a really bad air

548
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:09,840
 infection really really bad sore throat it got to the point where I went four days without

549
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:19,720
 eating and over the course of those four days I had maybe a liter and a half of water spread

550
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,800
 out over those four days it was bad it was super super painful it was the most ear pain

551
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,960
 I've ever had in my life I get ear aches I get sore throat all the time hands down the

552
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,760
 worst but finally I was able to survive this is not a ghost this is not a clone doing this

553
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,560
 podcast I was able to survive and I was able to get better through the help of my mom my

554
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,000
 mom taking me to the doctor my mom is not a doctor herself but you know got mama's love

555
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,720
 keeping me going and then she then when that ran out she's like oh you know more refills

556
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,600
 on this you got all the love possible then she took me to a minute seven clinic and I

557
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,720
 ended up getting antibiotics and prenatal zone for the pain and everything cleared up

558
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,080
 but the reason why I'm talking about this on a paranormal conspiracy and true crime

559
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:12,600
 podcast it's not a conspiracy that I got horribly sick I had a spiritual awakening in my sickness

560
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,760
 it felt like a vision quest and it's such an interesting thing so I have tangled with

561
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:25,240
 ghosts and witches and demons and shadow people but having this vision having this hallucination

562
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,840
 I ever want to put it in it's interesting because I it happened multiple times over

563
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:39,040
 the course of a few days and it put into perspective when people talk about shifting to other realities

564
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,320
 and people talking about going to different planes of existence stuff we cover on this

565
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,600
 show because what would have a nutshell my pain was so intense and not only could I not

566
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,760
 drink or eat my body didn't want me to my body had basically given up like I was still

567
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,120
 hopeful I was still like maybe we maybe we can be this I was actually still doing my

568
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,720
 normal vacation stuff I was still playing some Far Cry 5 I was watching movies with

569
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,960
 my mom that's what we do when we go down there I'm watching slacks about killer pants I'm

570
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,560
 watching carousel about a killer killer carousel horse floating around poking people with its

571
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:25,400
 unicorn horn virus shark big freaking rat slash or ret party all great movies still doing

572
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,920
 the normal thing but my body was breaking down my body had given up as much as my mind

573
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,560
 was wanted to hold on my body's like we're just not even going to get hungry we're not

574
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,800
 going to get thirsty and I had to force myself to drink she can only go three days really

575
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,080
 without water before you die and so I was forcing myself to drink that water my body

576
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,480
 wasn't thirsty but I was forcing myself to and every time I took a swallow it felt like

577
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,800
 someone was taking a toothpick and sticking it in my ear and pushing as hard as they could

578
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,120
 for 45 seconds I timed it and you don't know how many times you swallow throughout the

579
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,640
 day until you feel every time you swallow because you're constantly swallowing just a little

580
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,480
 bit of saliva and as some sort of horrible side effect to this whole thing I was drooling

581
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,600
 and sessently I was just drooling making me swallow even more so but that's all just gross

582
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,480
 disgusting stuff we talked about that stuff on Dead Rabbit Radio too but what would happen

583
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,680
 was periodically I would just be sitting there playing Far Cry 5 or hopefully just doing

584
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:33,080
 that sometimes I'd be walking through my mom's house sometimes I'd be in the shower and bam

585
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:41,200
 I'm in the void I'm in the void it's this endless dark expanse oddly enough wasn't

586
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,360
 pitch black how you would picture an endless void because I'm sure we often do it reminded

587
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,920
 me more of the black that you see on black construction paper had a bit of a grain to

588
00:34:52,920 --> 00:35:00,600
 it but it was endless with no ceiling no floor no walls it went on forever the only reason

589
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:07,920
 you had any orientation in the void was there were other people in the void with me let me

590
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:16,760
 back up here too before I go into that the void was not some other place the void was

591
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:27,820
 inside of me the void was inside my upper body I'm in this place endless darkness inside

592
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:33,640
 this place are two Mexican people standing there as well as a man and a woman they're

593
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,200
 both wearing like peasant clothing like 1800s clothing you would see if you're watching

594
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,480
 like the three amigos or reading history book doesn't have to be from a movie it's just

595
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,080
 very traditional like peasant garb in Mexico so standing there and I'm looking at these

596
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:56,240
 two Mexican dudes and realize that I'm in my own body and I read that what's so weird about

597
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,980
 this whole thing is that it didn't feel weird at all when we've reported on stories about

598
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,660
 people going into voids or standing in these UFOs that are more than just a UFO metallic

599
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,900
 but like an endless expanse of like red lights showing from nowhere I always say dude one

600
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,580
 of that be so weird one of the be so weird to be there but the fact is when you are in

601
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:23,420
 some sort of hallucinatory state it doesn't feel weird at all I wasn't like whoa where's

602
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:28,760
 the ground bro the walls they go on forever it's just like okay it's like standing in

603
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:36,040
 the middle of Macy's like it's just a location but I'm in this endless void that's inside

604
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,040
 me there's two little Mexican people standing there they're completely silent they look

605
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,800
 really stern they look like they don't want to be there I mean it doesn't want to be in

606
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:52,680
 the endless expanse and in between this man and this woman there's a donkey head an oversized

607
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,340
 donkey head the donkey head was about as big as they were it was just from the neck up

608
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,980
 and the donkey wasn't making any noises it was just sitting there and they had a rope

609
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:09,500
 around its neck and I would shift in and out of this and I really wouldn't even go like

610
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,700
 whoa dude it just hallucinated I think I knew it was some sort of fever dream or some sort

611
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:22,540
 of side effect to the dehydration or the pain or both but I kept going back to this place

612
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,640
 and this is what it's again fascinating I can't say they spoke to me telepathically

613
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,740
 or a sign appeared or anything these are just things that my brain constructed the two people

614
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:42,200
 inside of me were completely benign they neither wanted to be there nor didn't want

615
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,760
 to be there they were neither invaders or inhabitants they were simply there the donkey

616
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:58,460
 however was an interloper what I came to realize in my adult state is that the donkey symbolized

617
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:06,500
 a piece of mucus that was stuck in my esophagus a bacterium factory post nasal drip dripping

618
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:15,260
 down into my throat had formed a piece of mucus in the shape of a donkey's head and

619
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,320
 was stuck inside of me and the message was very clear remove the donkey head from your

620
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:29,920
 body and your illness will leave my mom loves me I'm probably her favorite I'm not going

621
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,160
 to be after she gets her water bill because I took some of the longest showers there that

622
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:45,960
 hot water just hitting my back and breathing in that steam I could feel everything loosening

623
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:55,980
 up and what would be weird is as I would continue to go in and out of this state of semi consciousness

624
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,620
 however you want to put it the void the void was always eternal in all directions but remember

625
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,320
 because it's oriented because I can see where the people are standing there's a floor you

626
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:19,040
 can't see it but there's obviously a floor there as time goes on the floor moves up

627
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,220
 because the mucus is moving up through my esophagus this is happening over a matter of

628
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:30,880
 really a day and a half this these visions and I remember feeling that the mucus was

629
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,140
 moving up through my esophagus my quest to get this out of my body to expel this out

630
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,300
 of my body was working and the image of the two Mexican people and their donkey that they

631
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:50,500
 have in captivity is moving further up my body expel the donkey and you'll be fine I

632
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,700
 don't know if the little tiny people told me this I don't know if the donkey introduced

633
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:02,160
 himself I don't know if it was just a joke my brain was playing on me but at one point

634
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,160
 I came to learn that this donkey was known as Lucas this mainly happened so I got sick

635
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,040
 on Sunday got really bad on Monday and got worse on Tuesday this is really happening

636
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,360
 Tuesday night Wednesday all day most of Thursday when my mom gets off work Thursday she can

637
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:30,380
 tell I'm about to die she can tell that I have been a brave little boy of an mommy strong

638
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:36,500
 little soldier but she can tell that I'm obviously as much as an act I wasn't trying to let on

639
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,620
 how sick I was she could tell I was way sicker than she thought because I was really just

640
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,740
 being like oh no it's no big deal let's keep watching capsized blood in the water movie

641
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,340
 about people going through extreme pain as sharks are circling them and I'm watching

642
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,080
 and it's like oh man it'd be so nice to have water splice on my body I'd be drinking up

643
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,880
 all that saltwater she takes me to the med 7 they go you have an air infection you have

644
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,040
 a raw red throat gaming antibiotics I ended up getting prednisone which is a steroid which

645
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,440
 really really helped the anti inflammation and then by Sunday I did a what an hour and

646
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,120
 a half long July 18th alien invasion special which was really like up until that morning

647
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,560
 I did not know if it was gonna happen and I did get to share a story that I had forgotten

648
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,900
 about for 20 years about the drill the drill squad at my old high school confronting me

649
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,780
 and telling me what an awful person I was it was such a fun memory to rehash and I'm

650
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,700
 glad I'm glad I was able to share with you guys but the story is so interesting and

651
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,860
 and it's the it's interesting on a couple different levels one it made me think about

652
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,020
 when we cover stuff that's unusual when we cover stuff that's unusual that I've been

653
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,860
 through when we talk about demons and ghosts and things like that I do kind of have an

654
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,360
 attitude like yeah no I understand what they're going through but now I think I understand

655
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,160
 stuff like the void like what it's like to be in a place that is endless it's like being

656
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,360
 it's like being in a macy's it's simply a location and it's scary when you step back

657
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:12,680
 and think about it but when you're in it it's as real as any location to it started to make

658
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,040
 me think about this idea which I don't really talk about on this show but I find very fascinating

659
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,900
 and it's pretty well known that's what I'm talking about but this genetic lineage this

660
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,940
 idea that all humans are connected in the sense I am from I'm Basque my family came

661
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,280
 from Spain about a hundred years ago I have family members who are from Mexico extended

662
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,900
 family members I have friends from Mexico but I have no genetic link to anyone in Mexico

663
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:47,860
 so it's so fascinating to me that in my darkest hour when I'm in this horrible place of pain

664
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,120
 because I like I said my brain was still hopeful but my body was just shutting down it just

665
00:42:52,120 --> 00:43:00,920
 didn't care about eating or drinking that my spirit is being protected my body is being

666
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,440
 guarded by two little Hispanic people in peasant clothes from like the 1800s so interesting

667
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:17,360
 right it's no one of my genetic code that's super interesting and I'm wondering why that

668
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:25,340
 it why that was the image that my body projected I understand why I had the image of the donkey

669
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,660
 is because I think there was a giant piece of phlegm in me that was in that weird shape

670
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:35,180
 of like a donkey head and my body could only describe it and my body was basically sending

671
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,580
 signals mean you need to get this out or you will die my body your body doesn't know that

672
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:47,060
 medicine exists your body works at a basic eight level by day four of this your body's

673
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,800
 like listen there's something in your body you need to get it out you are only going

674
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,680
 to get sicker as long as it is in because I did have to take antibiotics I had an infection

675
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,440
 there was a bacterial invader in my body but why the little Mexican people I mean I don't

676
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:08,480
 have anything against them I just am curious as to why that was the image my body created

677
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,240
 or my mind created or my soul created but then let's put out a conspiracy caps and wrap

678
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,620
 this episode up wrap up this extra long episode I think I haven't edited it yet but you can

679
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,620
 obviously say where are they now most likely were figments of my imagination or maybe they

680
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,660
 were spirit guardians maybe I'll run into them again somewhere once again in the dark

681
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,180
 void they're like Jason you take better care of yourself they're holding like a whole

682
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:38,100
 zoo back and they're like guy we can't keep doing this I say I think about this from time

683
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:45,040
 to time I think the gut is such an integral part of a human body or really any living

684
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,400
 things body but we dismiss it all the time we'll say stuff like oh I have a gut feeling

685
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,120
 but for the most part we think that the soul resides in the brain we forget about how powerful

686
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,600
 the gut is I remember a long time ago I read this article and they were talking about head

687
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,400
 transplants and I don't know if I can find it for the show notes but the guy and I might

688
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,400
 have mentioned this before on the podcast but this guy goes if you ever truly transported

689
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,180
 a head you'd be sent and seen someone to the worst insanity they ever suffered because

690
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,540
 there everything doesn't reside in the head if you transplanted ahead it the gut biome

691
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,300
 is so radically different it would be like they're living in a different universe so

692
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:28,500
 our guts are everything our whole biology is so important to who we are but with our

693
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:35,460
 conspiracy caps firmly on let's take it down this path we hear a lot about simulation theory

694
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:41,720
 they go statistically statistically the chances of this reality being the real reality is

695
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:49,000
 infatessimally small that there is most likely throughout creation there is a society that

696
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,800
 is created computers advanced enough to run super advanced simulations and once that happens

697
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,840
 and you have a population of say seven billion people on that planet and half of them are

698
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:04,920
 playing this game the chances of us being the real reality and not one of these four

699
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,740
 point five billion simulations that are constantly being run is super small so most likely we're

700
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:18,980
 in the simulation and we're not the real reality what if we're in the gut of somebody here man

701
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:24,820
 you've already shut off the podcast you're like I'll turn back in season 16 let's see

702
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:31,100
 hopefully he's less insane how do we know that we're not little microbes living inside

703
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,840
 some other creature's stomach that we're just amoebas and we're in a pitch black darkness

704
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:43,160
 sitting next to a puddle of acid waiting for him to eat some Cheetos so then I can land

705
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,040
 on one of the Cheetos and eat up just a little enough of a resource so I can last another

706
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:55,920
 day I'm gut flora your gut flora and we have created this entire existence around us we

707
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:04,980
 are really born into darkness it's constantly hot and bubbly and we're just this goo living

708
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:11,380
 inside of this organism we've never truly seen the sun or heard music or felt the touch

709
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:17,260
 of a friend's hand on our back in time of need no we're just an organism in some creature's

710
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,740
 gut and this is all an imagination all of reality is something we have crafted to deal

711
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:30,120
 with the fact that if we knew what reality was we wouldn't want to eat that Cheeto we

712
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:36,680
 would rather just die off but the biological imperative doesn't allow us to die off it

713
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,680
 makes us march forward it makes us live longer to eat just that other piece of scrap to live

714
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:50,040
 a little bit longer and everything is just an illusion that is actually statistically

715
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,580
 far more likely than any simulation theory because if you say there's a society that

716
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:01,940
 has 4.5 billion simulations running at any given time the chances of us being the real

717
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:09,540
 world versus one of the civilizations there are countless living creatures on earth alone

718
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:17,100
 99% of those have guts and have digestive enzymes and little bacteriums and little flora

719
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:25,280
 in their guts just on earth there are more living things with gut biomes than there are

720
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:33,360
 of even the highest level of simulations running in theory and in each gut flora there's tons

721
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,520
 of different little the chances of us actually being something inside a fox's stomach is

722
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,280
 far more likely than you being a simulation and it's 10 times as scarier it's probably

723
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,620
 more than 10 times scarier at least if you're in a simulation you figure maybe you're entertaining

724
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,780
 as someone if you're in a simulation at least you were special enough to be coded into it

725
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,940
 if you're in a simulation at least there's a sci-fi future for someone out there if not

726
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:08,540
 for you but what if we're just flora what if we're just bacteria living in a sperm whale

727
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:15,880
 stomach and eventually despite whatever we do whether we are the greatest author whether

728
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:23,520
 we are a lowly hobo whether we are Tom Hanks or Isaac Cappy that's sperm whale will die

729
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,680
 and its body will sink to the bottom of the ocean and we will just cease to exist with

730
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,800
 it even in the big bang you can figure eventually the universe sure expands expands expands

731
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,820
 and then it begins to contract but after a certain amount of time there's another big

732
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:44,700
 bang reality is back but what if none of that is real not even the sperm whale is real we

733
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:51,820
 imagine what sperm whale is but we're just something in eternal darkness in something's

734
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:58,620
 gut our only mission is to help it digest food and everything else has been made up

735
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:04,020
 to make it more comfortable for us to accept the fact that we are eternally locked in

736
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:10,880
 darkness our only mission is to help some unknown creature we don't even know exists

737
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,520
 eat is far more likely than simulation theory it's far more likely than reality according

738
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:25,440
 to simulation theorist we may be nothing more than a digestive engine and everything we

739
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:33,440
 dream everything we hope everything we create everything we are is an illusion we're just

740
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:42,660
 a chunk of bacteria inside another creature and one day that creature may die one day that

741
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:48,780
 creature may begin trying to expel us and realizes that it no longer needs us someday

742
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:57,540
 that creature may take medicine that rapidly kills us off it's a beautiful world out there

743
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:08,840
 we think full of hope and promise maybe and someday we may realize in our final moments

744
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:18,220
 that all of reality was an illusion everything we knew everything we loved was nothing when

745
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:26,840
 it is finally time for us to pass from this life we see what is truly real some people

746
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:34,300
 fear death because they are afraid it is just eternal darkness but then you realize we were

747
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:45,500
 always in eternal darkness we just didn't know it you're not chasing is this depressing

748
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:50,180
