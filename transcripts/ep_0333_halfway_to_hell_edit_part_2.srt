1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,840
 a guy who's knowing, for doing inappropriate stuff, stuff not me, another guy, another

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,600
 guy, another guy.

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:48,160
 We're gonna meet some other ghosts, one that likes to haunt an unusual place, and then

5
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280
 just some other stuff I found on Backpackerverse.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,960
 Today on the Afterlife Special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
 Radio.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
 Radio.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
 Radio.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,280
 Actually, I'm a walkway girl.

11
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,960
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,240
 So this is part two of episode 333.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,560
 If you didn't listen to episode part one, it's totally fine.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,120
 It's just a health update.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,880
 If you don't want to hear that, you just skip past it.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
 It doesn't matter to me if you're a new listener.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,080
 You're not missing anything.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
 I basically had a heart scare.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
 Everything's fine.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,120
 I was just reassuring people that everything's fine.

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,600
 Let's go ahead though and talk about some spooky, spooky ghosts.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,160
 Now little asterisks next to both of those spookies.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,200
 Probably an asterisk next to ghosts.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,840
 Oh actually, I do have two shout outs to do here.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,480
 So first off, back when I did episode 300, Crispy Bacon.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,840
 The Patreon supporter, Crispy Bacon says, "You know what?

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,040
 Since we all talk about numerology and stuff like that, episode 333 should be

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
 a special episode.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
 Because it's halfway to 666.

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
 And I said, "You're right, sir.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 You are right."

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,800
 And originally it was supposed to be a special episode, but then I ended up in the hospital.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,760
 But technically, it's kind of special because it's the first two-parter.

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
 It's not.

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
 I think I've done other two-parters.

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
 Have I?

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
 I don't think I have.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,440
 So Crispy Bacon is the father of our first two-parter episode.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,560
 I've done other two-parters and I don't think about it.

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,520
 But I've never split them up like this.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,960
 So all it took was my heart to go out of rhythm, Crispy, to get your wish.

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,720
 Secondly, let's say hello to our newest Patreon supporter.

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,440
 We have C. Knowles.

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,240
 C. Knowles, C. Knowles Patreon supporter.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,200
 And I feel bad about this because I wanted this episode to come out on November 11th.

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,120
 Instead it's being recorded on November 11th.

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,200
 But his son Casey, it's his birthday on November 11th, 2019.

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,240
 Ooh, spooky day, 11/11.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,120
 I actually saw a movie called 11/11/11.

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,360
 It was a really low-budget horror movie and it was quite spooky.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,680
 Don't let your kid watch it.

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
 But it depends.

56
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,800
 If your kid's 25, go ahead.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,040
 But because it is Casey's birthday, we're going to let Casey drive us around.

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,600
 Casey is going to be the man behind the wheel of the...

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,200
 We'll bring out the Carverter Cofter.

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,160
 I originally was going to use the Jason Jalopy, but since we have a guest pilot...

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,600
 You're like, "Jason, he doesn't know how to drive a helicopter."

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,080
 "Ah, come on, kid.

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
 Get inside.

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 Here's the keys."

65
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,800
 So while he's getting it all set up, let's go ahead and prepare for our journey to these

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,680
 ghost people that I met when I died.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,000
 I should also say right now I didn't die, but I should also say right now, originally,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,200
 this episode was going to be about near-death experiences where people have come back from

69
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,160
 bad near-death experiences.

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,000
 But I didn't want to talk about that after spending five and a half hours in the hospital.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 So instead we're going to talk about the aftermath of near-death experiences.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Death experiences?

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,320
 We're going to go hunt some ghosts.

74
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,240
 So fire up the copter, Casey, and right now we are headed to El Cerrito, California.

75
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,160
 That is a pretty good pilot, man.

76
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,520
 He knows his way around a cockpit.

77
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,000
 Is that what they call it in a helicopter?

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Oh!

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,320
 I say this too before I get started.

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,000
 Speaking of aerial aircraft, I get out of the hospital at 5.30.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,080
 I go to the hospital at noon.

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,360
 I leave at 5.30.

83
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,520
 I leave in the middle of a chase scene in the Fat Fate of Therias.

84
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,560
 And I was supposed to be at the movie theater by 6.25 to see Terminator Dark Fate.

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,120
 I walked about a mile from the hospital to the movie theater and got there in time to

86
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,040
 see Terminator Dark Fate.

87
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,640
 And it sucked.

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,800
 But I will say this.

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,680
 The action scenes are really good.

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,080
 It was just the plot was a mess.

91
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,200
 The plot was a real mess.

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
 The action scenes were decent.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,440
 The action scenes were decent.

94
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,260
 So anyways, if you like watching people get clawed in the face with a metal hook, every

95
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,080
 fight scene, a guy just gets a hook to the face.

96
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,560
 It's basically saw franchise in action form.

97
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,600
 On the poster, the lead character is holding a hook.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
 Use another weapon.

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,440
 It didn't work the first seven times.

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
 Action scenes are good though.

101
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
 But anyways, there's this ridiculous aerial plane thing.

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 We're not doing that.

103
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
 Casey's flying a helicopter.

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
 We're just flying around.

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,520
 We're not looking for dead franchises to crash into.

106
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,200
 Casey's totally just trying to concentrate as I'm just going off on these rants.

107
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,920
 He's like, "Dude, I've never flown a helicopter before on Petrified."

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,360
 I'm like, "You can do it, kid."

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,680
 Slap him on the back.

110
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,040
 We're landing in Richmond, California.

111
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,120
 [imitates helicopter landing]

112
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,320
 Sound like a transformer?

113
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
 Not a transformer.

114
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 I wish.

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
 Helicopter lands.

116
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
 I'm going to get off.

117
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,840
 I hope you guys brought your beach gear.

118
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 Not beach gear.

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,400
 I hope you guys brought your pool gear, which is probably the same thing, honestly.

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,680
 Hope you guys brought your shorts and nothing else.

121
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,800
 Unless you're a woman, I guess I should have.

122
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,840
 Or you have a nice bathing suit on.

123
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,000
 I personally prefer one-piece bathing suits.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
 Okay, maybe that's not true because I do have a lot of sports illustrated posters around

125
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,960
 my apartment.

126
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,080
 But I think in the wild, in public, I prefer one-piece bathing suits.

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,360
 I don't know what it is.

128
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
 On a poster, I prefer a bikini.

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
 There's nothing to do with the story.

130
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
 Anyways, forget that.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
 So we're at this pool in El Cerrito.

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
 It's called the El Cerrito Swim Center.

133
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,760
 Very original name.

134
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,240
 Now apparently, this pool, this is an interesting one.

135
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,320
 This is interesting.

136
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,000
 Apparently, the pool is haunted.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 A haunted pool.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,420
 Now you go, "Jason, isn't that what happened in Poltergeist?"

139
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
 The pool was haunted.

140
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,640
 Technically, the house was haunted.

141
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,200
 The bodies just came up out of the pool.

142
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,720
 But this pool is haunted.

143
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,200
 Supposedly, this pool was built on a...

144
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
 I don't actually know.

145
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,720
 I don't think there is ever a reason why it was haunted.

146
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,960
 But here's what it's haunted, okay?

147
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,840
 According to multiple websites around the web.

148
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
 What happens is they hate a crowded pool.

149
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
 These ghosts hate a crowded pool.

150
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,240
 So basically, the ghosts are just people who are alive.

151
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,960
 Nobody likes a crowded pool.

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,980
 You're in a pool and you're swimming around, splashing.

153
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,980
 Now these ghosts, if the pool is too crowded, the water gets cold.

154
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,500
 That's a sign that the ghosts are mad at you.

155
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,340
 Now that's also a sign that the pool is closed or that the pool...

156
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,340
 They're trying to save energy.

157
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,940
 The manager of the pool is like, "Oh man, my electric bill is so high.

158
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
 This one turns out..."

159
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,460
 Everyone's like, "Oh, it's cold in here.

160
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,460
 What are you going to do?

161
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,460
 It's ghosts.

162
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
 It's dead people."

163
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,120
 They're like, "Ah!"

164
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,800
 Or that it's in California and their energy grid sucks to begin with.

165
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,440
 I can say that as a longtime California resident.

166
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
 This all happened during the Gray Davis administration, during the rolling brownouts.

167
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,000
 Everyone's like, "Why is the water so cold?

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 It must be ghosts."

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,840
 Also, there are reports that if you're in this pool, the ghosts will grab your feet

170
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,200
 and try to pull you under.

171
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,600
 Which again, is any living person in a pool.

172
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
 Now not any.

173
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 I've been in a lot of pools in my life.

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
 I don't know why that's...

175
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
 I'm not bragging.

176
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
 Everybody has.

177
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,420
 But when you're in a pool, they're actually quite boring.

178
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,300
 Like you're like, "Oh man, I can't wait to get in the pool.

179
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
 Everyone take your shirts off."

180
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,980
 I take my shirt off now, but I was one of those kids who didn't take a shirt off.

181
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,100
 And then I got to the point where I was like, "Why don't I take my shirt off?

182
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,620
 It makes me way heavier.

183
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,100
 When I'm already heavy, I get in the pool and now I'm even less buoyant."

184
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
 Because I have to take my shirt off.

185
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,400
 I don't care what people think, so I started taking my shirt off.

186
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,780
 But I used to not take my shirt off, probably until I was like, I don't know, 13, 14?

187
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,900
 I was a chubby kid.

188
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
 I'm still chubby, but I don't take my shirt off.

189
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
 I don't care.

190
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,180
 I take my shirt off walking down the street.

191
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,180
 I don't care.

192
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,460
 But anyways, you get in the pool and you're like, "Oh yeah, woohoo."

193
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,060
 And then you're like five minutes later, you're like, "Sucks."

194
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,220
 Unless you're hanging out in the pool with your buddies, but even then it sucks.

195
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
 It totally sucks.

196
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,860
 Being in a pool is actually quite boring.

197
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
 So what do you do?

198
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
 You start horsing around.

199
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
 You start pulling people's feet.

200
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,640
 You're pretending to drown them or actually drown them.

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,240
 Play chicken, stuff like that.

202
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,760
 So these ghosts are basically just doing what humans do.

203
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,160
 Which to be fair, you're saying, "Jason, isn't that what all ghosts do?"

204
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,720
 Eh, not necessarily.

205
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,920
 Like if you go to a haunted baseball park, you don't see balls flying around, which

206
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,360
 would actually be pretty dope.

207
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,760
 What I'm saying is it's most likely probably people you can't see.

208
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
 Non-visible people.

209
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
 It's probably just people directly underneath you pulling on your feet.

210
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,720
 Now, we do have a first person encounter from El Cerrito Swim Center.

211
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
 This comes courtesy.

212
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,380
 Now, you may go, "Hey Jason, do you really have to talk about this website?"

213
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,780
 I thought you stopped talking about Backpackerverse.

214
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,860
 I almost died yesterday, man.

215
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
 I didn't, I didn't.

216
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,860
 Just so.

217
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,900
 But for the joke, I almost died yesterday.

218
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,220
 Give me some more Backpackerverse.

219
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,060
 I also, while I was watching Terminator Dark Fate, I thought I might have died if I hadn't

220
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,320
 gone to the hospital and my heart just wouldn't stop beating.

221
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,400
 Most likely wouldn't have.

222
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,120
 But for dramatic effect, as I'm watching Terminator Dark Fate, I go, "It's quite possible that

223
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,960
 this might be the last movie I ever watch."

224
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,560
 And it was not, it was not up to snuff.

225
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,720
 But I could have seen Midway.

226
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,400
 So, I mean, you know, I don't think that movie would have been much better.

227
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
 I'm gonna see you later this week.

228
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 Maybe.

229
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 I don't know.

230
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 Feeling kind of... bummy.

231
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,840
 Because my heart rate can only get so high.

232
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,240
 It can only get up to like 89 or something like that.

233
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,300
 Anyways, you're like, "That's a normal heart rate."

234
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,860
 I'm like, "Yeah, but not for me.

235
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
 Not for me.

236
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,860
 I'm an exciting man."

237
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,460
 We have a first person encounter from Backpackerverse.

238
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,780
 I'm gonna read you this quote and you tell me if you know what this first part is.

239
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,260
 A young man who happens... puberty started all of a sudden.

240
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,620
 A young man who happens to be a video psychic, used to train in the swimming pool center,

241
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,280
 had such a terrible encounter with the angry spirits that he decided to change pools.

242
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,320
 What's a video psychic?

243
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,720
 First off, I'm gonna say, since I've gone back to Backpackerverse, and to be fair, I

244
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
 don't go to Backpackerverse.

245
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,720
 I'm always looking for ghost stories and they constantly pop up.

246
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,120
 I'm not going to them.

247
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
 They're coming to me.

248
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,800
 Their site has taken a huge dip in quality recently.

249
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,440
 Now I'm not gonna attribute it to my exposés on them and they realize, listen, we're caught.

250
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,500
 If we write good stuff or bad stuff, we're gonna get caught by this illusive, wait not

251
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:33,300
 illusive, intrepid journalist, dead rabbit, radio, Jason Carpenter's actual name.

252
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,900
 Let's just pump out poorly written stuff.

253
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,420
 Because when we do good written stuff, it's still fake, so let's just do fake poor written

254
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
 stuff?

255
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
 I don't know.

256
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,500
 But it's taking a huge dive in quality.

257
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,460
 What is a video psychic?

258
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,900
 That's someone who's like, "Okay, without even looking at the case, I can tell you what

259
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,060
 movie that is."

260
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,840
 It's a guy with no shoes on running through an office building.

261
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
 He's all, "That's Die Hard, isn't it?"

262
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,160
 Everyone's like, "Whoa, how did he know?"

263
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 He didn't even look at the case.

264
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
 He turned the case around and said, "That's Die Hard."

265
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
 He's like, "Yeah, huh?

266
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,660
 Yup."

267
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,160
 What's a video psychic?

268
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,680
 What is a video psychic?

269
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,480
 Anyways, he said that one day he was swimming in this pool and he heard a voice.

270
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
 Here's the quote.

271
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:21,240
 I started hearing angry voices of men whispering to my ears, things like, "Get out."

272
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,500
 Now it could be that he was swimming in this pool and there were ghostly people going,

273
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 "Get out."

274
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,900
 Or it's possible he was swimming in this pool.

275
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,660
 They were trying to close and it was the lifeguard yelling, "Get out!"

276
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,820
 But he's underwater, so it all sounds muffled.

277
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,860
 And he's like, "It was so weird.

278
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,080
 These mysterious men, these phantoms in red shorts began grabbing me and I'm wrestling

279
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 with them."

280
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,120
 And they dragged me out and the next thing I knew, I was sitting outside the pool near

281
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
 my car.

282
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,460
 What horrible fate awaits someone who goes to El Cerrito Swim Center.

283
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,360
 One star on Yelp.

284
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,040
 Actually has four stars on Yelp.

285
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,000
 So that should tell you how unhaunted it is.

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,520
 But yeah, if you're in a pool and people hear voices going, "Get out!"

287
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,620
 There's most likely someone who works there.

288
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,900
 They're like, "Look out, dude, someone peed in the pool."

289
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,980
 You're swimming in there, it's turning blue.

290
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,820
 It's already blue, it's turning green.

291
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,180
 I heard that's a myth.

292
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,940
 I heard that they don't actually have a thing that makes urine.

293
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,420
 Well, we have a thing that makes urine.

294
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
 It's called our body.

295
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,460
 But there's not really a chemical in a pool that causes the water to turn green.

296
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
 I don't know.

297
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,460
 Urban Legend?

298
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,460
 Who knows?

299
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,260
 Also, before we leave El Cerrito, let me tell you, I'm going to read you this last

300
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
 thing here.

301
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,120
 This isn't on backpacker verse.

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,160
 I'm not going to waste all your time on backpacker verse.

303
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,920
 I'm going to save that for later stories.

304
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,640
 This is a first person submission from a young woman named Monica.

305
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,320
 Here is her and her family's experiences with ghosts in El Cerrito.

306
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 And if you are a resident of El Cerrito or Richmond, California, get ready because this

307
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,560
 is a representation of not only the spirits that haunt you, but the people who live in

308
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
 that area.

309
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
 Here we go.

310
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,100
 In El Cerrito, the post office on California Drive, as well as Ontario and Grand, so I

311
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,340
 don't know if that's, I'm assuming that's two different post offices.

312
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:22,020
 But anyways, my aunt and cousins have seen giant owls flying around.

313
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,020
 One even stood and stared at them.

314
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,340
 That is, who cares?

315
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,420
 Who cares?

316
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
 Giant owls.

317
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,300
 Okay, but anyways.

318
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,700
 This next part works.

319
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,040
 I've had family members see goblin-like creatures in El Cerrito.

320
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,400
 Lead with that next time.

321
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,080
 Don't lead with the post office and the giant owls.

322
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 Just start off.

323
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,600
 Hey, my family will live in El Cerrito?

324
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 Goblin.

325
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,040
 Also, what's a goblin-like creature?

326
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,240
 Goblin-like creature is just an ugly human.

327
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
 A goblin is a goblin.

328
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,400
 A goblin-like creature is a human who looks like a goblin.

329
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,120
 Imagine that you're a ghost investigating.

330
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,960
 You're walking around talking to people and you're like, "Hey, man, have you ever seen

331
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,860
 any ghosts in El Cerrito?"

332
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,180
 This woman walks up to you and says this, this actual quote, "My uncle said he saw a

333
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,780
 man on a horse."

334
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
 Was it a ghost?

335
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,700
 Man, was it just a regular dude on a horse?

336
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,500
 Oh, no, that's the whole quote.

337
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,820
 My uncle said he saw a man on a horse.

338
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,300
 Was he at a dude ranch?

339
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
 Where?

340
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
 Was it in the middle of the city?

341
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
 Was it in an office building?

342
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,780
 Did it appear before him?

343
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
 Or was it just a man on a horse?

344
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,900
 And he's never seen a horse before.

345
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,160
 That is so confusing.

346
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,160
 And that comes right after the goblin-like creatures.

347
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,640
 But let's wrap it up with this.

348
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,960
 My female cousin said she saw a man with money bags at her house.

349
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,680
 Did he have a lume?

350
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
 Did he have a lume uniform on?

351
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,440
 Was he walking out of a bank and loading up an armored car?

352
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
 These details are important.

353
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,080
 She does go on to say that she's picked up weird conversations about money and thieving,

354
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,560
 like she's heard it in her head.

355
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,540
 She finishes her comment, "This is the wild west and wild it is.

356
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,540
 Don't walk around late at night."

357
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,780
 Submitted by Monica.

358
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,860
 So, giant owls, night time, sure.

359
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,940
 Don't walk around at night.

360
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,820
 An owl might stare at you.

361
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,200
 Goblin-like creatures, you might see ugly humans in El Cerrito.

362
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,820
 You might see a man on a horse.

363
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,900
 And it might see a man walk around with money bags.

364
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
 Don't walk out.

365
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,260
 None of those pose any danger to me.

366
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,420
 It should just be don't walk out at night.

367
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,520
 This is California and the crime rate is insane.

368
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,200
 You're gonna get stabbed by a methodic homeless man.

369
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,840
 He may or may not be holding money bags at the time.

370
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,080
 Most likely will not because he's a methodic homeless man.

371
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 Maybe on a horse?

372
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 Who knows.

373
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
 That would be interesting.

374
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 A homeless...

375
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,880
 I guess all cowboys were technically homeless.

376
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,960
 The home was the range, right?

377
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,640
 Maybe homeless people are just reincarnated cowboys and they have no cows to wrestle.

378
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,220
 They just feel the pull of being outdoors and sleeping under the stars and severe crippling

379
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
 drug addictions.

380
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,900
 Let's go ahead, hop back on the carpenter copter KC.

381
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,620
 We're gonna fire that guy back up and I hope you guys are aware now this is gonna be a

382
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,620
 long episode because it's a special.

383
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,140
 It's the halfway to hell special.

384
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,420
 We're going to Sutter Creek.

385
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,460
 Sutter Creek, California.

386
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,140
 All this stuff takes place in California by the way.

387
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,820
 So he's not flying too far.

388
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,000
 I don't know how far away Sutter Creek is from El Cerrito, but we're allowed in case

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,600
 that you do some loop-de-loops and stuff.

390
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,080
 Oh, you're like Jason that wasn't part of the deal.

391
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,680
 You bought a bunch of marbles when we were in El Cerrito.

392
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
 They're going everywhere.

393
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 Every time, every time.

394
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,920
 Can you even do a loop-de-loop?

395
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
 You might.

396
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
 Casey can.

397
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,680
 The helicopter keeps spinning around and around.

398
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,440
 You're like oh no I bought yogurt.

399
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,080
 Everything you bought needs a lid.

400
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,960
 Like I'm sitting there with pizza.

401
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
 Technically doesn't need a lid.

402
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
 I guess it comes in a lid.

403
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,180
 I'm eating just a hamburger patty, so I'm good.

404
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,020
 I can put it in my mouth and it just flies up into my teeth and automatically I bite

405
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,700
 it like I'm a cartoon character apparently.

406
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
 Whatever.

407
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
 We land.

408
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,940
 The circus is over.

409
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,780
 I don't even know if physically that's possible.

410
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,580
 If you could hold, think about it.

411
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
 Let's figure this out.

412
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,980
 Okay, special episode.

413
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
 Almost died.

414
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,140
 Bear with me.

415
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,100
 If I held a piece of meat in my hands, which that is not an if.

416
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,540
 I do that every single day.

417
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,200
 If I'm holding a piece of meat in my hands, when I'm holding a piece of meat in my hands

418
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,200
 and I go to eat it, I go "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

419
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:54,200
 and I go to eat it, I go "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

420
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:11,560
 to my hands, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like,

421
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:34,680
 "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh,

422
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:50,760
 I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm

423
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:57,800
 going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going

424
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,680
 to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be

425
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,680
 like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like,

426
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh,

427
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:24,680
 I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going

428
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:31,680
 to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like,

429
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,680
 "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm

430
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:45,680
 going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to

431
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,680
 be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like,

432
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,680
 "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going

433
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:03,680
 to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like,

434
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going

435
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like,

436
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,680
 "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going to be like, "Oh, I'm going

437
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,680
 to be like, "Oh, what? This is pretty dope. I'm poking people with my pike." People are

438
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,680
 like, "That's weird. We always knew Jason was into podcasts and bad movies. We didn't

439
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,680
 know he was a Napoleon War rain actor. It's quite odd." But anyways, ghost and old

440
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,680
 timey clothes walking around. We have a story from, of course, Backpackerverse. This hotel

441
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,680
 supposedly really is haunted. There's a lot of stuff about this hotel, but Backpackerverse

442
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,680
 tells a story about this dude who checks into the hotel with his girlfriend or wife. It doesn't

443
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:57,680
 matter. Same thing. Just a contract after that. Ring. No biggie deal. His girlfriend/wife,

444
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 he's hanging out at the hotel with, and then he gets into bed and she's like downstairs

445
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,680
 doing something. And then the ghost gets into, oh, he doesn't know it's a ghost. He feels

446
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,680
 a lump in his bed and he's like, "Ooh, baby." And he's like cuddling up with his lump. And

447
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,680
 then his girlfriend comes in the door and he's like, "Ah!" And he throws back the blanket

448
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,680
 and there's a woman with pale white skin and black hair laying in bed next to him. And

449
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,680
 she vanishes. So that didn't happen. That story is totally made up. Multiple reasons why it's

450
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,680
 made up. One, let's look at it factually here. Okay, so first off, one of the main things

451
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,680
 that human, and you may not know this, I mean, I'm sure you do. I'm not calling you guys

452
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,680
 idiots, but it's mostly subconscious. One of the main things we use to identify people

453
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,680
 is smell, even if we don't know it. There is no way that you are, if you are sober, there

454
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,680
 is no way you are getting into bed with someone who is not your significant other and not

455
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,680
 immediately recognizing it not as your significant other. But Jason, maybe the ghost is able to

456
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,680
 replicate the human smell of his wife. Okay, fine. Then you want me to believe that she

457
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:11,680
 believes a lump, that he can wrap his arms around her and snuggle up to a non-caporial

458
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,680
 intensity. So this would have to, like if there is a power level of these things, a ghost

459
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,680
 walking down the hallway, like you see in a phantom walking down the hallway, would be

460
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,680
 fairly low on the power level. It picking up an object or throwing it or knocking over

461
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,680
 an object would be higher. Turning electricity on and off would actually be probably easier

462
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,680
 to do than moving stuff over, unless it's actually hitting the lights, which it never is, conveniently.

463
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,680
 It's always something happening in the wall. But to be able to manifest as a spirit that

464
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:52,680
 can not only misshape the blankets, be a full bodied apparition, because you can spoon it,

465
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:59,680
 wrap your arms around it and not notice it's not your wife or girlfriend. That is basically

466
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:06,680
 gozer level power. That would mean that this ghost is basically the most advanced ghost on

467
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,680
 the planet. And it's not, it's totally made up. And he pops out of bed and his wife's like,

468
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,680
 "Oh my god, what are you doing about that woman?" And then the ghost disappears. Now to be fair,

469
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 that actually is a great way. If you have a girlfriend/wife or boyfriend/husband and you

470
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,680
 want to cheat on them, make your lover cover themselves in head to toe white makeup. It

471
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,680
 might make some chafing during the actual act of love making, but have them cover their

472
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,680
 body in full body white makeup or baby powder. Or, and I mean dye their hair black. And then

473
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,680
 that way whenever you get caught with them, you shouldn't because you're cheating on them.

474
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,680
 But if you get caught with them, you could then go, "Oh my god, it was a ghost." And then they

475
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,680
 could hide under your bed or something like that. And go, "Don't look under the bed. He's a

476
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,680
 spooky monster now." And if your significant other is an idiot, they won't realize that the

477
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,680
 ghost looks exactly like their cousin. But that's why you fell in love with them in the

478
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,680
 first place because they're an idiot. And you can convince them that your lover is a ghost.

479
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,680
 So we are not done though with the Sutter Creek Inn. We see Casey looking through the

480
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,680
 helicopter window. He's like, "Are you guys done yet? It's getting kind of cold out here."

481
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,680
 I'm like, "It's just the ghost. It's just the ghost making the helicopter cold, bro. Just

482
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,680
 chill out. Get it, chill out. It's like 30 degrees out there." And C. Knowles is like, "Dude, that's

483
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,680
 my son. Just tell him how to turn on the heater. Hold on, hold on, hold on." We got one more ghost

484
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,680
 to look at and then we'll go out. We'll turn on the heater. We are here for the main

485
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 attraction. We've covered tons of ghosts. We've talked about tons of ghost types over this

486
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,680
 show and there are sometimes you run across a ghost that's quite unusual. And this is one

487
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,680
 of them. This is why I brought you to here. We're going to meet a ghost. He doesn't have a

488
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,680
 name. We'll call him... It doesn't matter. I don't need... He doesn't have a name. Okay? He

489
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,680
 just... He doesn't need a name. This ghost has been spotted multiple times. And while you're

490
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,680
 hanging out in the little dining room, you're drinking your tea or soda... I don't even

491
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,680
 think I drink either of those anymore. While I'm drinking water, lame. Like a nerd, like

492
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,680
 a caveman. I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't do drugs. I gave him nicotine and now

493
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,680
 I can't even have caffeine. And I can, but just not... Not eight gallons of it. But still,

494
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,680
 I'm not supposed to have for a while. As I'm complaining about my own lifestyle choices

495
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,680
 that I've made, you're like, Jason, okay, the pity party's over. Ooh, your heart got out

496
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,680
 of whack. Now you guys are making fun of me as I'm drinking my water. You keep trying to

497
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,680
 slip a slip tea into it. I'm like, no, that'll kill me. It'll kill me. You guys are all laughing

498
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,680
 at my weakened state. A ghost shows up. And I'm like, oh, everyone, shh. What's making

499
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,680
 fun of me is I wipe a tear away from my eye. What's making fun of me? Look, watch this.

500
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,680
 And the ghost is standing in front of us and we're standing. We're not standing. We're

501
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,680
 sitting in front of the ghost. And then the ghost drops his pants, fully exposing himself

502
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:11,680
 to us. And then he disappears. Now that's unusual even in the world of the paranormal.

503
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,680
 There's not many cryptids. We talked about the "gurning man." Quite a few episodes back,

504
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,680
 he seemed like an exhibitionist, spirit or alien or demon or something like that, who

505
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,680
 would only appear to women of a certain age group and rub his chest and have this creepy

506
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,680
 smile on his face. But we don't see many exhibitionists as ghosts, which is interesting because

507
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,680
 if you think about it, so many people have weird hang-ups that you think they would follow

508
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,680
 them to the afterlife more often. This one's dead, so he's a ghost that must have been a

509
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,680
 flasher if it exists at all. Let me back up here. If this story is true in any way, shape

510
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,680
 or form. And this is a famous ghost out this place. I found this ghost mentioned several

511
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,680
 times, especially in the book National Directory of Honder Places. This ghost will appear in

512
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,680
 front of women and we're a mixed company, but it's all good. He'll appear in front of

513
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,680
 women and he'll pull his pants down, exposing himself to us. Now, there's no specification

514
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,680
 that he's not pulling his pants down and there's nothing there, so I believe that we're

515
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,680
 actually seeing his ghost junk. That's why we left KC in the helicopter, but that's why

516
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,680
 we left him in the helicopter because he was not supposed to see this. However, we all

517
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,680
 saw it. And that might be the first ghost flasher that we've actually ever covered, or a ghost

518
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,680
 with some sort of bizarro hang-up. Like that. Like he's still in the afterlife, still finding

519
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,680
 a lot of amusement, pulling his pants down in front of women and exposing himself. I did

520
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,680
 tell you guys about this, but I'm going to repeat this story again. When I was in the

521
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:46,680
 Stanley Hotel, which was the hotel that inspired the shining, they had a closet that, I went

522
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,680
 on this ghost tour and the tour guide was like, "Now everybody!" She was this really, really

523
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,680
 hot chick in this colonial outfit, but I'm going to make fun of her voice anyways. But

524
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:06,680
 people, here you go. Now she sounds like Rick or Morty or both of them. Here's a closet,

525
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:15,680
 okay? And if you go inside, there's a creepy old, forget the voice, she explains to us

526
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,680
 that there's a closet in this room where there's this randy old ghost who will like feel up

527
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,680
 women if you go in there. And she goes, "Any volunteers, any woman want to go into this

528
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,680
 dark room and be groped by this supernatural spirit?" Now I'm sitting there and I'm like,

529
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:37,680
 "And this is fake, obviously." And so the woman goes, "Any volunteers?" And this girl,

530
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,680
 this girl, she's probably about 12, goes, "I'll do it." And the demeanor of the tour guide

531
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,680
 completely changed and she looks straight at the girl and she goes, "You have to be 18

532
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:53,680
 to go into the room." "Any volunteers?" And we're like, "What in the world?" So that makes me

533
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,680
 think, and I think I explained, I did an episode on the Stanley Hotel, it was on my birthday

534
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,680
 episode last year. But anyways, so we do have records or stories, is probably a better word,

535
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,680
 of these spirits who have these weird type of hang-ups, but I wanted to expose you,

536
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,680
 unattended to this one, and you're like, "Boo, boo, you're holding me down, you're shoving

537
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:21,680
 caffeine right into my throat of a...Waaaaaah." So, you guys carry my lifeless body in a Christ-like

538
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,680
 pose, back to the helicopter, throwing me in the back, turn the heater on, flying me to

539
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,680
 the hospital, five and a half hours later, I'm sitting in the hospital, you guys are

540
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,680
 like, "Are you ready to go? Are you done?" I'm like, "Hold on, hold on." So, let me get this straight.

541
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:40,680
 Dom Toretto turned against the family because his girlfriend, and you're like, "No, just

542
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,680
 shut the movie off, just shut the movie off." You guys pull me out of the hospital room,

543
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,680
 I'm like, "No, no, no, wait, I need to see more Hobbes and Shaw before their own spin-off

544
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:56,680
 movie." You guys drag me out of the hospital room. We are going to one last place here.

545
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:08,680
 We are going to Sonoma County, flying through the night sky, rotor blades cutting clouds.

546
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,680
 Don't think that happens. Carivers are getting knocked out of their house. I'm like, "Casey,

547
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,680
 fly through those clouds." You're like, "But isn't that carolot?" I'm like, "Fly through

548
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,680
 those clouds." These rainbows are getting destroyed. There's a carobare with no legs. He's like,

549
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:34,680
 "Why? Why? I'm like, "Hehehehe, care about that." Blood going everywhere. Anyways, we eventually

550
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,680
 land the helicopter case. He's like, "Oh, my childhood heroes. I really loved Sherlock

551
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,680
 Bear." I'm like, "Yes, he can share in the misery of losing all of his friends now."

552
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,680
 Ceno takes his son home. He's like, "That's son relieving." Casey's like, "I'm so sorry.

553
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,680
 I'm so sorry, carobares." Anyways, no, they come back. They come back. They're good people.

554
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,680
 Casey gets over it very quickly because he doesn't know who the carobares are. He's like,

555
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,680
 "What's a carobare? I've never even heard of that before." If he was flying through

556
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,680
 like bay blades or something, he'd probably be more emotionally raw. Anyways, we're going

557
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,680
 to a couple places. These are going to be brief. These are all from Backpackerverse.

558
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,680
 So we're going to end on the absurdity. I guess I should say this for new listeners.

559
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,680
 Backpackerverse is a stupid website that just makes up stuff about ghosts. You're like,

560
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,680
 "Jason, why are you really going to do this?" "Yes, I'm going to do this. I almost died yesterday.

561
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,680
 Let's talk about this. We're in Backpackerverse. This is from the website or this is from the

562
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:38,680
 web page, 10 Sonoma County hiking trails with insane paranormal activity. First off,

563
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,680
 we're going to Laguna de Santa Rosa Trail. Let me read. I'm going to read this to you

564
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,680
 because that's the best way to explain this stuff because then you go, "Jason, you're

565
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,680
 just making stuff up." And I'm like, "No, let me read exactly what they wrote to you."

566
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:58,680
 Beware. This is the Laguna de Santa Rosa Trail. Beware. You might encounter someone

567
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,680
 wandering aimlessly in the middle of the woods and that someone is not necessarily a human

568
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:15,680
 being. Numerous stories have reported the bizarre sighting of a body roaming while bending mid-waste.

569
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:25,680
 What does that even mean? What in the world does that even mean? Does that mean, honestly,

570
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:33,680
 that somebody walking down the trail saw another human roaming around bent over and assumed

571
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:41,680
 that was not a human being or sorry, not necessarily a human being? Because if that's the case,

572
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:48,680
 if that is the litmus test we use for the paranormal, then the world is surrounded by ghosts. You can go

573
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,680
 to any place where there's a penny on the ground and someone's like, "Oh, you're like,

574
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,680
 "Oh, no, the invasion has begun." Go to an old folks home. Just walk by a yoga studio

575
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,680
 and see a bunch of people bent over. When this guy walks by the yoga studio, he thinks it's full

576
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:10,680
 of ghosts. He thinks paranormal activity 8 is taking place. There's a bunch of people bent over.

577
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,680
 Maybe it was crawling, but again, that was the end of the story. There was more to it,

578
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,680
 but that was the end of it. And the more didn't explain any of that. Now let's go to

579
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,680
 "Pigme Forest Trail" at Salt Point State Park. Let me read this verbatim to you.

580
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,680
 "Because I think it has a great setup. There is a little known story," i.e. I just made it up

581
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:38,680
 for the sake of this article, "There is a little known story of a small girl who looked exactly

582
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,680
 "like the doll she owned." And I was like, "Ooh, cool. A story about a girl turning into a doll,

583
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:50,680
 "or the doll wanting a twin sister, or the doll is her twin sister. Trapped." That's what I'm thinking.

584
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:58,680
 Rumors say that years ago, she got lost in the forest while carrying her doll. Oh, maybe the doll's

585
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:06,680
 going to help her find her way out, or maybe when rescuers show up, there's two dolls. Or the doll

586
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,680
 takes over the girl, so the girl is still trapped in the doll for whatever. Let's move on to the quote.

587
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,680
 "She never made it out and died alone. Now her spirit wanders the forest, doll in hand, seeking

588
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:28,680
 "aid from hikers. Will you help her?" What? Why did you--that's the whole thing for that one. Why would

589
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,680
 you build up the fact that the doll looked like her? Am I wrong to be disappointed in that? A girl

590
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,680
 has a doll that looks exactly like her. She gets lost in the woods one night. And then she just

591
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,680
 never gets found, and she still carries the doll around. That's stupid. That's dumb. I was so

592
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,680
 insulted by that one, because it actually set it up to be kind of creepy. It could have said, some

593
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,680
 people say that the doll is the kid. That's okay. So maybe it's a little convoluted, but let me

594
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,680
 do this right now. There's a little known story of a girl who used to carry a doll around that looked

595
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,680
 just like her. And one day, the girl got lost in the forest. A couple days later, the little girl

596
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,680
 was found by rescuers. But she didn't have her doll. They didn't think anything of it. But when

597
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,680
 they brought the girl home to her mother, her mother swore, "That's not my daughter. That's not

598
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:30,680
 my daughter." Bam. There you go. What was that, like five, six sentences? It makes it a little

599
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,680
 more scary, like you're thinking, did the doll possess her, or did they change places, or whatever.

600
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,680
 Not, she still has the doll. And I love this last, okay, now her spirit wanders the forest.

601
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,680
 Doll in hand, seeking aid from hikers. Will you help her? Yes. Yes, if I am in the middle of

602
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,680
 the woods, and a little girl shows up and says, "Oh my God, I haven't eaten anything in days. I've been

603
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,680
 lost. Will you help me?" I'll say, "Yes, I will help you." What type of old, and it doesn't even say

604
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,680
 that she kills you if you don't help her, or if you do help her, whatever. She's just a little, yes,

605
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,680
 who reads that, it goes no way. Because even if it's a little ghost girl, with a little creepy doll,

606
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,680
 you go, "Yeah, I'll help you out." And you take her to the edge of the forest, and she goes, "Thanks,

607
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,680
 stranger." And then she disappears. There you go. There you go. Now, if they said she also has a

608
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,680
 collection of G.I. Joe action figures that are in the shapes of the hikers who tried helping her in

609
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,680
 the past, creepy. Again, then I go, "No, I don't want to help this girl, because I don't want to turn into

610
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,680
 Shipwreck." Shipwreck was actually my favorite G.I. Joe character. So funny. There was this episode of

611
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,680
 G.I. Joe about Shipwreck, and this is going to trip some of you guys out, because this is a true

612
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,680
 Mandela thing, or Lost Media, however you want to put it. One of the best two-part episodes, and I'll

613
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,680
 talk about this because this is my two-part episode, one of the best two-part episodes at G.I. Joe,

614
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,680
 because they always did like five-part episodes and stuff like that. They added this episode, and this

615
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,680
 totally fits with the podcast too, so I'm not just going off in a rant. They had this episode where

616
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,680
 Shipwreck, who was like the sailor G.I. Joe, so Shipwreck is involved in this huge battle against

617
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,680
 Cobra, and something happened. He gets knocked out or something like that, and then he wakes up

618
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,680
 it's 10 years later, and he goes, "Whoa, like what's up?" And then he's like, "Have I been in a coma for

619
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,680
 10 years?" He said, "No, no, no, no, no. You've been in a coma for like three days, actually. You did

620
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:33,680
 get injured in that battle, but then G.I. Joe actually defeated Cobra, and you're instrumental

621
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,680
 in that, actually, but you've lost your memories. Like you just recently had this new head injury,

622
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,680
 and you've lost the last 10 years of memories. You have a wife and a kid. I think you had two

623
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:52,680
 kids, and the world's at peace. Cobra is destroyed." And so he goes home, and it's like this perfect

624
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,680
 suburban life, and he's like, "I don't remember any of this." This is a really good episode. He's like,

625
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,680
 "I don't remember any of this, but his beautiful wife, beautiful kids." And he's meeting other G.I. Joe's,

626
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:12,680
 and he starts to catch on. It's kind of a Truman Show type of thing that he is a prisoner. He starts

627
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:20,680
 to kind of figure out that this life is not real, that he's a prisoner, and it must have been Cobra

628
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,680
 who are trying to get information out of his head. Now his buddies are saying, "Shipwreck, no, you're going

629
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,680
 insane. Like you need to go to the doctor." Like this is reality. We've defeated Cobra, and he's like,

630
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:41,680
 "No, no, no, you guys, I know for a fact that something is not right here." And what happens is,

631
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:49,680
 I don't remember what the impetus is for him to finally realize that everything is fake, but he decides to try

632
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,680
 to break out of town, and all of a sudden everything goes to chaos. And it did turn out that Cobra did

633
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,680
 kidnap him during that last battle and had created this whole world for him. It was on an island,

634
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:10,680
 and gave him a fake family. But the people on the islands were basically like bio-robots. So when they

635
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,680
 were killed, they would melt, and it was like their eyeballs would fall out of their head, and they would

636
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,680
 look like an action figure was being lit on fire. They would just kind of melt. And at the ending, he still

637
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:31,680
 hasn't fully grasped how much, how many bio-androids are on this island. He goes home to get his wife and

638
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,680
 his kids, because he's still having a hard time starting this out, and they both pull, all the kids

639
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:42,680
 have these automatic rifles, and his wife has this automatic rifle, and they're going to shoot him, and a

640
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,680
 fire breaks out. Now this is the thing. The first time they aired the episode is different than every other

641
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,680
 airing of the episode, because I love this, it was one of my favorite episodes of G.I. Joe. I just thought it

642
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,680
 was a great storytelling thing, and I saw it back in '85. So I was like nine years old, and it just like

643
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:09,680
 blow in my mind that this story is going on. But in the original viewing of it that I remembered, a fire

644
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,680
 breaks out in the house, and the bio-androids of his family have rifles on them, and they melt. He watches

645
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,680
 his wife and kids melt in front of them, and their eyeballs fall out of their heads, and he's like,

646
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:27,680
 "No, he's totally freaking out that they just melt." Like they were going to kill him, but the fire got to

647
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,680
 him first, and you're just watching these two kids and this wife that he thought that were real, really up to

648
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:39,680
 that point, melt. And the episode ends with the Joe's laying siege to the island, because they figure it out,

649
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,680
 and they save him, and he's just like heartbroken. He just can't, like he's still trying to figure out, because he

650
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,680
 was on this island for a while. It wasn't like two days. He was on this island for a good amount of time, and he

651
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,680
 was being told, "Oh no, you've been here for ten years," or whatever. Really, really good episode in the

652
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:04,680
 ebb and... 1980s cartoon. GI Joe had a couple episodes that... I think that was probably the best episode of GI Joe.

653
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:12,680
 They did tell some really good stories, but yeah. Why am I talking about that? What were we talking about?

654
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:19,680
 Helping people? I was talking about, like, saving a little girl from... Oh, oh, appearing as a GI Joe character.

655
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,680
 Yes, yes, Shipwreck was actually one of my favorites after... So I would be happy to appear as Shipwreck. He was

656
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,680
 actually one of my favorites, I think before that show. I really liked that character. Anyways, everyone's just

657
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,680
 sitting in the forest. The little girl with her dolls just sitting there super bored. She was like, "Okay, Boomer, we don't

658
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:42,680
 care about your 80s cartoons and your Carabaire references." I'm like, "Ugh." So anyways, I'm like, "Okay, girl, you can

659
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,680
 head back to the forest." She's like, "Thank you. I will head back to my eternal torment, as long as I don't have to

660
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,680
 hear about 80s cartoons anymore." 80s cartoons were great, by the way. So, better than, like, your slug tarot.

661
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,680
 Slug tarot nowadays. But anyway, so we're walking through... We're leaving. There. We're going to our last trip on

662
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:08,680
 our special episode, Halfway to Hell special episode. Thanks, KrispyBacon, for making me realize the significance of 333.

663
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:17,680
 So we are headed off to our last destination of our special episode of Dead Rapper Radio. We are going to West County

664
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:26,680
 Regional Trail, Sebasto Pole. That's in California, apparently. Sebasto Pole. Stupid name. Anyways, West County

665
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,680
 Regional Trail. No, nothing about the place. Just dumb name. Don't want to go there. West County Regional

666
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,680
 Trail. Again, I just got to read you this quote, because you can't say it any better than this. But while I'm reading

667
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:48,680
 you this quote, I want you to imagine we're going on this journey together. So, "Cold night air through the very famous

668
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:56,680
 haunted forest of Sebasto Pole." Everyone knows about Sebasto Pole. "Marked by a wooden bridge." Don't know why there's

669
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:05,680
 a whistle there, but there was. There's a little slide whistle there. "Marked by a wooden bridge." It takes you on a short

670
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:17,680
 journey into the mesmerizing horrors of old structures. Who knows what you will find under the piles of rotten

671
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:27,680
 wood? So we're walking through this. We've crossed the old creaky bridge. I reach for the slide whistle. You're

672
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:36,680
 like, "No, that joke." It's dumb the first time. Don't do it again. We walk off the bridge. We go on a short

673
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:43,680
 journey into the mesmerizing horrors. We're like, "Ugh, tripping out." You're like, "Chasing, chasing. That's an acid

674
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,680
 plant. Don't touch it. I'm all tripping out." Anyways, we're walking through the woods and we see old

675
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:59,680
 structures. So old, spooky, broke down buildings. Just wood everywhere. Which is what forests normally have in

676
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,680
 them, but this is processed wood. This is cut and planks of wood. And then what was it? Oh yeah, the next part was

677
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:15,680
 "What will we find under piles of rotten wood?" So brown recluses. Maybe the body of a homeless man. Who knows.

678
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:21,680
 Probably those two things. Or both. And then we get to this last sentence. This might actually be one of the best

679
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:30,680
 sentences I've ever read involving the paranormal. If not one of the best sentences I've ever read, period. So move out of the way.

680
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:36,680
 Hymning way. We have backpacker verse. We're walking through this forest late at night. We see a pile of rotten wood.

681
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:47,680
 We're moving it aside. And then we have this quote. "Some hikers report a strange apparition." Here's the first part, which we need to

682
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:58,680
 figure out. A face without a body. So, "Some hikers report a strange apparition of face without a body." Now, you go, "Jason, that's

683
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:08,680
 not unusual." Okay, but here's the thing. Is it a head or is it just a face? I would assume because of the terminology, it's

684
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:16,680
 simply the face not a head. But wouldn't you just be able to say a face? Like a floating face. Why do you have to add without

685
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:23,680
 the body? That's how all faces are. There's nothing unusual about that. You're going, "Jason, you're getting totally into the weeds

686
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,680
 on this one." This is why this is important. Because it's obvious it doesn't have a body from the rest of the sentence. It's almost

687
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,680
 like they got paid by the word and they wanted that. They get paid a penny every word. They wanted that extra three cents.

688
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:43,680
 Because they did not need the term without a body because of what comes after this. We're moving the wood around. We go back to the

689
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:55,680
 sentence. "Some hikers report a strange apparition of face without a body stitched into the headrest of a brown leather chair."

690
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:09,680
 Okay, so now you see why... First off, first off, that's not... First off, let's be clear. That's not true. That never has happened

691
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:17,680
 in the history of the world. At no point has ever anyone moved a log, seen a pile of rotting wood, began moving the rotting wood

692
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:26,680
 and found a brown leather chair. That part is untrue, totally. Secondly, removing the wood and then seeing a human face

693
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,680
 stitched into a brown leather chair. Without a body, by the way, because that would just be someone sitting in a chair.

694
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:41,680
 What is the point of this apparition? What is the point of being a ghost if people have to remove garbage to find you?

695
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:50,680
 That's not really even a ghost. That is... Okay, here's the thing. Let's play our game. This is either completely made up. It is completely made up.

696
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:59,680
 But let's say that the story is true. Let's figure out what it is. If you were a ghost, if you were a ghost, you would be like

697
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,680
 "Woo, floating around." Maybe you're trapped in a particular location, but unless this guy died in a lazy boy factory

698
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:16,680
 and he possessed the body of a brown leather chair, there is no way also, let's talk about this too, there is no way that a brown leather chair

699
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:23,680
 would survive more than a few nights under a pile of rotting wood in the middle of a forest. It would be completely trashed.

700
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:32,680
 So, you're like, "Taste this neither here nor there. We're talking about ghosts." My point is that you're a ghost. Are you really going to be a ghost under garbage?

701
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,680
 Like, wouldn't that be the most ridiculous place to just be a ghost?

702
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:45,680
 Two, let's say that it's my worst nightmare. Let's say that a man was magically transformed into a lawn chair. Or a leather chair.

703
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,680
 A big old recliner. And I hate, I've talked about that, I hate stories where people are transformed into stuff against their will.

704
00:48:52,680 --> 00:49:01,680
 So this guy is turned into a brown leather chair. The thing that scares me about that is that you're transformed into something and you're just sitting there

705
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,680
 and you're observing the world around you. Like, that locked-in disease doesn't really scare me as much because you're still like a human.

706
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:15,680
 But like, if you had locked-in disease and you were an ottoman or you were like a lazy boy, that terrifies me.

707
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,680
 So he's trapped in the form of a recliner. I'm assuming it's a recliner. In the middle of nowhere.

708
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:28,680
 But, and then he could like watch the birds fly around and be like, "Oh, I wish I could pet those birds. I wish I was fast enough to catch a bird to pet it."

709
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:34,680
 It doesn't scare me if you're covered, again, if you're covered in garbage, because then you don't know what's going on in the outside world.

710
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:40,680
 You can't influence it anyways. You're just a leather chair covered in garbage. You're just a leather chair covered in garbage.

711
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,680
 So you are a garbage ghost. That might be the worst ghost. That might be the worst ghost we've ever covered.

712
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:55,680
 Now, I'm sure someone could email me and show me a worst ghost, but being a ghost in the middle of nowhere, that's spooky actually.

713
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,680
 Little girl ghost walking around with a doll can be spooky, but at least she's mobile.

714
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:07,680
 I wish she can like follow you and when you're in your tent a little like, you see the zipper move up a little bit and you see like a little eye poke out.

715
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:16,680
 Like look out from underneath the flap. And you first you just think, "Oh, maybe that was a deer. Maybe a deer got super close and evolved thumbs and undid the zipper."

716
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:24,680
 But you would like brush it off and then in the middle of the night you'd be on your cell phone late at night and the blue glow would be filling up the tent.

717
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,680
 And you would think you see like the outline of something outside your tent. You're like, "Ah, the deer's back."

718
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,680
 But then you realize it's like only four feet tall and happen to be carrying a two foot tall version of itself.

719
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:43,680
 And then in the morning you wake up and your own kid is missing and there's a doll that looks exactly like your kid.

720
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,680
 You're like, "Ah, it sucks. What are we going to do with this dumb doll?" That's scary.

721
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:56,680
 I mean, obviously that involves child protection, but any part of that, the little girl looking in your tent or seeing something run by your tent.

722
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,680
 Obviously your child being replaced by a doll. All that stuff's scary.

723
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,680
 Now you're camping in the middle of the woods and 50 feet away from you is a pile of garbage.

724
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:13,680
 And the wind blows and you think you see something outside your tent and you look and it's just a pile of garbage 50 feet away.

725
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,680
 No big deal. You're like, "I should have probably picked a different camping spot." But whatever.

726
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,680
 And then later on the night they're kind of on your phone flipping around and you think you see something move outside but you're wrong.

727
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:30,680
 You're just tired. You're just saying stuff. And then next morning you wake up and you pack all your gear up and leave.

728
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,680
 And your kid's totally fine. You're like, "There's not a little brown leather chair with your kid's face on it."

729
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,680
 You're like, "No, this sucks." You just leave with your kid.

730
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,680
 There's a pile of garbage that nobody ever looks in.

731
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,680
 What a hiker. Let me just say this too and I'm sorry, I might be being a dead orange.

732
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,680
 What a hiker. It's like, "Hmm, what a beautiful nature romp." I love nature.

733
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:57,680
 Ooh, pile of garbage. Let me start rooting through this until they find a brown leather chair with a human, not a body.

734
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,680
 A face without a body stitched into the headrest of a brown leather chair.

735
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:09,680
 That is our tour of spooky, spooky little asterisks next to those.

736
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,680
 Ghosts, asterisks next to that one as well. Of California.

737
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:21,680
 Now, I want to end this episode with, again, a thank you to you guys for all your support and all your love.

738
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:32,680
 I find it so bizarre that less... it's a little... the show started in June of 2018.

739
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:39,680
 So we're a little over a year later. And I've been to the ER before and I've had issues where I've had to go there

740
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,680
 and I've sat in that room for an hour or two or more while I'm getting tests done and things like that.

741
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,680
 And then they come back and say, "Oh, it's just an anxiety attack." Or, "Ah, you know, your ankle's not broken."

742
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,680
 But never have I sat in that hospital and been able to laugh at all of the great comments

743
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,680
 and feel very proud of all the support you guys have given me.

744
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,680
 This show's really changed my life. Like, I was thinking about that. I was like, "This is really awesome.

745
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,680
 Like, this is a community of people." And I really want to make sure that you guys know how much you mean to me.

746
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:21,680
 You guys really do mean a lot to me. And that's why I wanted to get this episode out. Not feeling 100% still,

747
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,680
 but I wanted to get this episode out for you guys just to acknowledge how much you guys mean to me.

748
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,680
 The show's really changed my life. And I'll end it with this.

749
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,680
 I almost didn't do the podcast. We've talked about this a couple of times. Like, I was a writer before this,

750
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,680
 and I had some other projects before this. And I just kind of fell into this one day.

751
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,680
 And I implore you guys to find those projects that are going to change your lives as well.

752
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,680
 You may fail a couple of times. I failed a couple of times in other projects.

753
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,680
 But find that thing that will change your life. That sounds like a big goal.

754
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:05,680
 And you may not know what it is at first, but find that thing so a year later, when you're feeling down and you're not feeling good,

755
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:12,680
 you have that community around you. And to let you guys know that you guys do have this community around you as well.

756
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,680
 But, um, yeah, find that thing if you can.

757
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,680
 Because it's weird. I mean, again, my life has radically changed since I started doing this show.

758
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,680
 I really, really appreciate all you guys, all your support, all your love, all your jokes.

759
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,680
 But it also wasn't Veronica the Honenthal had nothing to do with this. It's totally fine.

760
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,680
