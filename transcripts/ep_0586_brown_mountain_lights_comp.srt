1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
 What happens when a gang of hooligans show up at your house?

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,620
 They're each wearing an inverted turkey.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,500
 Then we take a look at the story of a man who followed a blue orb into a cave.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,460
 God on a spaceship flew to Venus.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,760
 Sounds like a normal UFO story, probably just a tall tale.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,340
 At least that's what it seemed like until the government tried to erase

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,580
 every trace of his existence. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,240
 [Music]

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,200
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,280
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover here. So first off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Bri.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,800
 Bri, surfing in. She's flooded Dead Rabbit Command. That's okay. We're wearing trunks today. She's surfing in.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,340
 Bri, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you can't support the Patreon,

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,160
 I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show. That really really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 So Bri is strapping down her surfboard to the top of the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,360
 We are headed out to...

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,360
 [Mimicking the sound of the car]

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,200
 Uh oh, wait. Hey Bri, Bri. Stop the car. Stop the car. I'm getting a news report. I'm getting a breaking news report.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,720
 Bri, forget where we were going. We are headed out to Maine.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
 [Mimicking the sound of the car]

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,500
 Jason Jalopy's driving down the road and I turn to you and I go, "Okay, breaking news is in, guys."

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,460
 I recently got this report from

23
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:41,820
 DarkOutpost.com. Dark Outpost, you all know, is the most reputable news source with the word "dark" in the title.

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,220
 And this is breaking news, guys. I didn't expect to cover this so soon.

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,100
 50,000 Chinese troops have invaded the United States. Yeah, I'm getting that. That is correct.

26
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,860
 50,000 troops have invaded the United States. Apparently they've poured in over the Canadian border.

27
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,420
 No one communist, Justin Trudeau, has now become part of China. Apparently according to this report,

28
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,720
 I'm getting another breaking news from DarkOutpost.com.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,260
 All 50,000... All of them. All 50,000 Chinese invaders have been destroyed.

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,820
 Clap. Everyone clap for the struggle. Not you, Bri. You have to drive the Jason Jalopy.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,600
 She's like, "Oh, I want to clap." You can celebrate in your heart.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,900
 Apparently according to DarkOutpost.com,

33
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,420
 50,000 Chinese troops invaded the United States. They were all in Maine. All of them. They don't know how to do an army.

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,740
 Apparently they just invade one state at a time like they're playing risk. They all invaded Maine and

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,940
 the good old United States just blew them up. Which is how wars normally act, but they dropped so many bombs on these Chinese troops

36
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,060
 that it actually was on the Richter scale. You see, I know you guys all heard about that huge earthquake in Maine.

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,740
 It was only 3.0. That's nothing to us West Coasters. But to people in Maine, it's the end of the world.

38
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,900
 That's equal to 50,000 troops invading your country. That wasn't an earthquake. That's what everyone wants you to believe.

39
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,880
 That's what that geology industrial complex wants you to believe. No.

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,860
 That was actually bombs being dropped on the invading Chinese forces of the United States.

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,160
 So thank you very much, gentlemen, for doing your service.

42
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,680
 DarkOutpost.com. Thank you for bringing that to our attention. Want to give a special shout out to Dr. Hair.

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,400
 He's the one who showed me Dark Outpost. And then, oddly enough, while I was researching this event,

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,500
 I got a message from Andrew Clark 117 on Instagram. Wanted to talk about this fighter jet that went down over Michigan lately.

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,380
 Some conspiracy theories about that. That it was carrying nukes. That it was up to no good.

46
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,620
 Who knows? But Dark Outpost knows that that was actually the Chinese

47
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,040
 retaliating. You see, once 50,000 Chinese troops got blown up, the government's like, "Hmm,

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,740
 let's just blow up one of their planes." And then we're even.

49
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,860
 So one plane got shot down and then a bunch of bombs that nobody saw dropped.

50
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,480
 Killed a bunch of troops. Apparently, I've also heard, and I think Andrew was the one who turned me on to this,

51
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,340
 but I'm not for sure. I think supposedly the 50,000 Chinese troops were in an underground military base and the bombs went off in there.

52
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,020
 Which, again, not a good tactic.

53
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,980
 Not to put all 50,000. It's like in the Dark Knight Rises when every cop in Gotham went into the sewers at the same time.

54
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,000
 And then a guy just padlocked the gate shut and they were down there for like five months.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,900
 That was the Chinese battle plan. But it doesn't matter. We know now that

56
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:37,260
 World War 3 is well on its way to being over. United States will win. Justin Trudeau is quaking in his maple-filled boots.

57
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,260
 We will keep you updated. So let's get back to our regular story.

58
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,600
 So, Bre is taking us out to the...

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,460
 *imitates breaking news report*

60
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:53,940
 Oh, we're getting another breaking news report. Who's this? I'm getting this over the airwaves. Bre, just keep going. Just keep driving here.

61
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
 I'm... I... I... Okay, I'm...

62
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:03,020
 Apparently, according to the reputable news source DarkOutpost.com... This is a real website.

63
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,220
 I'm not making this up. I'm not making any of these stories up.

64
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:14,700
 DarkOutpost.com, the number one news site named after a straight-to-video sci-fi movie from the 90s,

65
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,700
 DarkOutpost.com has revealed for the first time ever, guys, sit down.

66
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:27,380
 See if you are... if you normally stand while you're listening to this podcast, sit down. According to DarkOutpost.com,

67
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,940
 No one child trafficker.

68
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,500
 This is the only thing she's known for. Nothing else. No one child trafficker. Mother Teresa!

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,100
 The famous nun who worked in India to help the poor. No, and she's not remembered for that.

70
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,180
 If you think of her like that, you're just a blue-pilled fool. No.

71
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,380
 DarkOutpost.com reveals that no one child trafficker. Mother Teresa is actually

72
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,980
 Anthony Fauci's mom.

73
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,140
 Mother Teresa... No one child trafficker. Mother Teresa.

74
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,020
 Saint Mother Teresa is Anthony Fauci's mom. You need proof? Fine. You want to ask for proof? Fine.

75
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:12,140
 Just go to their website and you will clearly see a photo of Anthony Fauci and Mother Teresa next to each other.

76
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,820
 Have you ever taken a photo with someone who was not your mother?

77
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,660
 I didn't think so. And don't you feel dumb now for asking that question? You want more proof?

78
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,580
 I will take a photo of Anthony Fauci and a photo of Mother Teresa, and I will put them right next to each other.

79
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,420
 They both have eyes and noses.

80
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,140
 Guys, I can't just keep feeding you red pills here, man. You gotta do the research yourself, bro.

81
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,580
 You gotta look this stuff up yourself. But we all know now that

82
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,180
 Mother Teresa... No one child... You can't leave that part out. I keep just wanting to refer to her as Mother Teresa.

83
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,160
 No one child trafficker Mother Teresa is actually Anthony Fauci's mom.

84
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:00,820
 But even if that was not true, it's not true. But Dark Outpost knows more than I do. But even if it was true, who cares, right?

85
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,420
 I mean, he has to have a mom. Anthony Fauci didn't hatch from a coronavirus-filled egg.

86
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,420
 He was a normal biological human. He has a mother. So...

87
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:18,260
 I don't know. But anyways, if his mother is Mother Teresa, then that's a huge news story, according to DarkOutpost.com.

88
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,140
 He does have... has to have a mother.

89
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,740
 But anyway, no one child trafficker. She also... there's a photo of her Mother Teresa standing with Hillary Clinton.

90
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,700
 So guys, right there. No one child trafficker.

91
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,420
 No one person who eats babies. Come on, guys. I can't do all the work for you.

92
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,780
 Here's a photo of two world leaders at their prime meeting each other.

93
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,060
 The only way that would happen is if Mother Teresa had a truck full of kids to give to Hillary Clinton.

94
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,660
 There's no other reason why world leaders would meet each other for a photo op.

95
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:53,940
 But I don't know why I'm editorializing so much DarkOutpost.com. Again, a real website. Not a parody. Not a parody website.

96
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,020
 I've looked all over. This is not... this is not the Onion of Conspiracy Theorists websites.

97
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,660
 Which is funny, because on one hand that would be really cool, and on the other hand, you couldn't tell the difference.

98
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:12,140
 If I made an Onion Par... if I made Conspiracy Theory Parity website, it would be a matter of weeks before those started become legitimate conspiracy theories.

99
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,540
 That's not what this is. It's clever. That would be. That's not what this is.

100
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:23,340
 50,000 Chinese troops have already been destroyed in the United States. We'll see what other tricks Trudeau has up his sleeves.

101
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,060
 And then, what was the other one? Oh yeah, Anthony Fauci is Mother Teresa's son.

102
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,740
 No one ch- Why do I feel like I'm blue-pilled myself?

103
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,380
 No one... it's like I'm going out of my way to get my YouTube channel destroyed.

104
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,740
 Mother Teresa... no one... dang it, see? It's... No one child trafficker.

105
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,860
 Mother Teresa... if you think I'm exaggerating when I keep saying that, this is the headline to that story.

106
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,380
 Child trafficker Mother Teresa was Anthony Fauci's mother.

107
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,900
 So it's not like I'm even editorializing by what they put in the article.

108
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,580
 And the article mostly is about how they don't like Mother Teresa.

109
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,260
 The first two paragraphs are like, "Oh, it's Anthony Fauci's mom. Here's a photo of them."

110
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,820
 They did take a photo. He was a much younger man.

111
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,060
 You know how sons are often younger than their mothers? That's curious.

112
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,660
 Very, very suspicious.

113
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,220
 And then the rest of it goes on about how they don't like Mother Teresa.

114
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,860
 Mother Teresa is a fine person. I guess I was re-

115
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,020
 Because I had to do research. You guys know how I do this.

116
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,780
 No matter how ridiculous the conspiracy theory is, I do research.

117
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,380
 Apparently, Christopher Hitchens made a video about how sucky she was.

118
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,260
 You know she was trying to get people to become Catholic?

119
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,500
 Yeah, that's kind of what Catholics do. That's kind of what nuns do.

120
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,380
 They go, "They want to convert people." And they're like, "Oh, that's horrible."

121
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,580
 You know that she ended up taking a bunch of money and sending it to the Vatican?

122
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,700
 I was like, "Yeah, that's kind of how churches work."

123
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,220
 So I don't know. I don't know. I have a lot of respect for Mother Teresa.

124
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,740
 But maybe that's just my blue-pilled, boomer blood.

125
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,180
 I got to be more like Dark Outpost.

126
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,580
 But anyways, Brie, I know you've been drifting here doing donuts and stuff in the dirt.

127
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,700
 We are finally headed out to where we were actually going to go.

128
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,340
 And that is...

129
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,660
 Okay, guys, we're going to have to save that first story for another episode

130
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,220
 because I'm getting another Breaking News update from DarkOutpost.com.

131
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,380
 The DOP is what us old-timers who found this website two days ago call it,

132
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,540
 the DOP, the Dark Outpost.

133
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,100
 Guys, let us once again journey into the bowels of the Dark Outpost.

134
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,860
 We got this other Breaking News update.

135
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,940
 You thought the other two were Breaking News, right?

136
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,460
 World War III, that's about as breaking news as you can get. That was nothing.

137
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,460
 Anthony Fauci is known child trafficker Mother Teresa's son.

138
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,780
 I don't even... Even if that was true, it's not news. It's just kind of weird.

139
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,580
 But this, guys, this, I'm getting a report I have.

140
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,980
 Okay, there is photographic evidence of this.

141
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,060
 This is not a Photoshop.

142
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,220
 Well, to be fair, it's two separate photos laid on top of each other.

143
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,100
 But I can tell you this, the photos that these photos were taken from were real.

144
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,780
 Yes, they were merged into a new image, but the photos themselves used to be real.

145
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,340
 And if we can't consider that as evidence, then what can we consider as evidence?

146
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,340
 Ladies and gentlemen, George Soros, the bane of all conspiracy theorists.

147
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:21,100
 George Soros himself, George Soros, has been caught in Philadelphia interfering with the election.

148
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:27,500
 Oh my, oh dude, we just assigned those electors and here is clearly a photograph

149
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,940
 of George Soros being escorted out by police officers after committing,

150
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,860
 these are what he's charged with, wire fraud, identity theft.

151
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,620
 Whose identity is he stealing? Henry Kissinger's?

152
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,020
 He's like, no, no, I'm the other really, really old guy who wants to take over the world.

153
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,260
 We have wire fraud, identity theft, aiding and abetting.

154
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,860
 That's when he locked it so like Henry Kissinger can fill out a bunch more votes.

155
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,740
 He's like, don't look over there, look over here, aiding and abetting and damage to computers.

156
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,500
 The internet has been so on George Soros' case, he's actually even smashing laptops.

157
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,900
 I don't know if that part's true, I guess I can make up any story here.

158
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,900
 But actually, I have to, there's a correction here.

159
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,980
 I'm getting another news bulletin from darkoutpost.com.

160
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,740
 The good old DOP there telling me that I'm wrong, it wasn't not, George Soros was not at the Philadelphia

161
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,300
 voting place, the polling place with handful of ballots.

162
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,580
 No, it's much more since, I'm getting this, it's much more sensational than that.

163
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:36,460
 Here's the actual headline from, here's the actual headline from darkoutpost.com.

164
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:44,620
 George Soros' clone arrested in Philadelphia for election interference, so it wasn't even George Soros.

165
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,820
 Apparently, it wasn't a lookalike either, apparently George Soros died.

166
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,060
 But he owned Snopes.

167
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:56,380
 The Snope that's listed in the article has the George Soros owned Snopes.

168
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,220
 Snopes says no, George Soros is still alive, but he actually did die.

169
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,220
 So every George Soros we see from here on out is actually a clone.

170
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,260
 They believe that he's made multiple clones of himself.

171
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,220
 All a snoke, and he's going to continue to pull the strings around the world.

172
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:19,580
 Somehow, a billionaire who's trying to create a utopia, his version of a utopia,

173
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,740
 also has to go to the local polling booth.

174
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,980
 One of the most recognizable billionaires in the world,

175
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,500
 he has to break into the polling booth and be like, oh no, my name is Henry Kissinger.

176
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,260
 They're like, Kissinger, Soros, it doesn't matter.

177
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,580
 You've already voted like 10 times this election.

178
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,380
 He's like, no, no, that was my cousin, George Soros,

179
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,940
 who's been pulling these strings all over the world apparently.

180
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,220
 He's like, if you want to get something done, you got to do it yourself.

181
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,660
 So he sends a clone.

182
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,420
 Actually doesn't even do it himself.

183
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,820
 He sends a clone out to get busted.

184
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,380
 But if you want to see photographic proof, you can see a photo of George Soros,

185
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,460
 and then a photo of police merged together.

186
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,140
 And then for some weird reason, a photo of a wig.

187
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:03,260
 I really thought this website was a parody.

188
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,700
 Is it so over the top?

189
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,660
 But there's a photo of a wig placed on George Soros' head.

190
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,580
 So it's like a disguise, I guess?

191
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,860
 But again, he's like an 80 year old billionaire who's plastered all over the internet.

192
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,700
 So you're not going to get one past us, George Soros.

193
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,740
 We totally know that was you, or your clone, one of the two.

194
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,460
 But anyways, there's multiple George Soros clones out there.

195
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,180
 I'll say this.

196
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,700
 If anyone has enough money to clone people,

197
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,180
 it's probably George Soros, Bill Gates, and things like that.

198
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,980
 But if you're going to clone someone and put your consciousness in it,

199
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,060
 would you clone an 80 year old man?

200
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,380
 You're an 80 year old man, and you die, and then you're like,

201
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,580
 "Oh, but I'll live forever. I'll live till the heat does in the universe."

202
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,780
 And nothing but the corpses of elderly men.

203
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,620
 No, he'd be like a 20 year old dude.

204
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,260
 He'd be like a young George Soros.

205
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
 He's like, "Call me Georgie."

206
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,940
 He's walking around, he's trolling.

207
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,580
 He's meeting up all the conspiracy theorists who talked to Ash.

208
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,380
 As I'm recording this podcast, he kicks down my door.

209
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,340
 But you know, I don't know why I keep making these jokes.

210
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,380
 I don't know. Dark Outpost obviously knows something I don't.

211
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,660
 So be on the lookout.

212
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,300
 If you happen to be at work tomorrow,

213
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,460
 and you work at a restaurant, and you look in the dishwasher,

214
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,180
 you're like, "That guy kind of looks like George Soros."

215
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,900
 And then you look over, and you see one of the waiters walk by.

216
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,620
 "Looks like George Soros. Everyone's George Soros.

217
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,820
 Every customer is George Soros."

218
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,340
 You heard it here first, guys.

219
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:32,380
 George Soros cloned himself and sent one of his clones to fill out 10 ballots.

220
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,380
 How much election interfering can a single person do?

221
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,980
 I mean, sure, if it was organized, you could move tens of thousands, 100,000 ballots.

222
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,420
 But unless...

223
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,620
 Maybe that's the trick ending.

224
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,700
 Maybe the cops throw him in the back of the cop car,

225
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,900
 and they're like, "You're gonna take him away?"

226
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,980
 And the guy goes, "Yeah, I'll do it."

227
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,580
 And they're like, "Thanks, Officer Jorge."

228
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,020
 And then he looks at George Soros and he's driving the car away.

229
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,900
 Who knows?

230
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,340
 But obviously I don't.

231
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,060
 Dark Outpost is the one who revealed all that to me.

232
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,300
 This website's been bookmarked, by the way.

233
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,580
 And I honestly wish I could go more into detail with these crazy conspiracy theories,

234
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,380
 but that's it.

235
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,900
 Like, each article's maybe only three or four paragraphs long.

236
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,820
 And I did look up more of them.

237
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,740
 Oddly enough, there's not a lot of proof that George Soros is calling himself online.

238
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,780
 I did look, though.

239
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,620
 But I have this website bookmarked.

240
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,660
 We might be getting more updates in future episodes.

241
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,380
 Thank you very much, Dr. Hare, for sending this one over.

242
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,340
 It provided me with a lot of entertainment.

243
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,660
 But we have a real story to cover.

244
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,740
 The Inverted's Turkeys is a real story.

245
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,260
 I'll cover that one later.

246
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,020
 But right now, Bree, we're done joyriding in the Jace and Jalopy.

247
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,220
 Let's call in that Carbentercopter.

248
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,820
 We are headed out to Mount Brown, North Carolina.

249
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:47,100
 Carbentercopter is leaving behind Philly of a mount of George Soros clones,

250
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,340
 or climbing after us like World War Z.

251
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,220
 But, Bree, take us out to North Carolina.

252
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,540
 Specifically, we're headed to Mount Brown.

253
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,180
 Mount Brown, it was a location in X-Files.

254
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,820
 It's fairly well known in the conspiracy community.

255
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,100
 It's a paranormal community.

256
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,340
 For what's known as the Brown Mountain Lights.

257
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,220
 I remember reading about these things when I was a child.

258
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,780
 There are mysterious lights that float around the mountain.

259
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,100
 It happens on a semi-regular basis.

260
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,220
 It's not super rare, but it's not like you can say you're watching it.

261
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,940
 Cherokee tribes in the area had mentioned it back before the Europeans came.

262
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,700
 And then, even later on, people are still saying they saw these lights.

263
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,260
 Scientists, it's become such a phenomenon

264
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,420
 that scientists have actually gone out to try to study it.

265
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,860
 I remember when I was a kid,

266
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,620
 the first answer they gave was,

267
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,500
 "It's the headlights of trains coming through the mountains."

268
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,380
 It's kind of a flippant answer, right?

269
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,340
 Headlights of cars.

270
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,380
 And of course, your first thing is,

271
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,100
 "So, you're telling me the Cherokees had a really good train system?"

272
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,620
 Oh, no, no, no, we don't know if they're saying that could be retcon or anything like that.

273
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,300
 But, well, you're seeing is lights.

274
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,580
 And then I guess what happened, there was a huge flood at some point

275
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,820
 in like the 60s, the 70s.

276
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,060
 There's a huge flood, and it knocked out a bridge,

277
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,140
 and there were no trains or cars coming down that pass for quite a while.

278
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,020
 It was like six weeks, and the lights continued.

279
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,900
 But even now, scientists go, "Aye, you know, no, it's just old hillbillies telling stories."

280
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,220
 Which, to be fair, it could be.

281
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,860
 But again, it was on an episode of the X-Files.

282
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,620
 It was that really good one, too.

283
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,900
 I'm gonna open this dive, Pepsi.

284
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,420
 It was that really good episode of X-Files where they got the mold in them,

285
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,140
 and they started hallucinating like future lives.

286
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,660
 It's a really creepy episode.

287
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,220
 That was one of those episodes that disturbed me.

288
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,100
 Because they don't like reality breaking like that.

289
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,740
 But anyways, you should check that episode out.

290
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,940
 I'll put it in the show notes.

291
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,700
 Brie, go ahead and land this helicopter in town, little town nearby.

292
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,620
 We're gonna meet Ralph Layle.

293
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,940
 The year is 1961, and Ralph was a furniture salesman by trade,

294
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,980
 but he also was an amateur paranormal investigator.

295
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,940
 He was one of us, guys.

296
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,980
 He was one of us.

297
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,820
 And he'd heard about these lights in the mountain.

298
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,700
 He wanted to check them out.

299
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,460
 So he began going up into the mountain when he had time.

300
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,940
 He spent several nights up there on and off.

301
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,820
 And then one night,

302
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,980
 he sees one of these orbs.

303
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,460
 Now, most of the people are seeing them in the sky.

304
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,820
 It's very UFO-ish.

305
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,580
 But the one he's seeing is fairly close.

306
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,100
 He could actually able to kind of make out the dimensions of it, the size.

307
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,740
 He said it was a 10 by 12 sphere.

308
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,820
 And as he's standing there and he's looking at this thing hovering,

309
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,140
 I don't know, 50 yards in front of him,

310
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,180
 he says it feels like it's scanning him.

311
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,820
 He can almost feel its energy on his body.

312
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,020
 And then

313
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:39,340
 it leaves him and begins to hover through the floors.

314
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,140
 Now, this is what he was up there for.

315
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,060
 He was up there to investigate this phenomenon.

316
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,900
 Very brave man to do this part, though.

317
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,180
 Most people would be like,

318
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,300
 "Okay, it's investigated.

319
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,420
 It's here. It's real."

320
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,220
 They go back home.

321
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,540
 He begins to follow the orb through the forest.

322
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,180
 Follows the orb to a cave.

323
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,420
 He's walking through the spooky cave.

324
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,260
 It might have been not been super spooky.

325
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,620
 There might have been stuffed animals,

326
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,980
 which would actually make it more spooky.

327
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,980
 But he's walking through the cave.

328
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,820
 And he sees the orb float in front of him.

329
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,740
 And then he sees the cave kind of dead end,

330
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,420
 where a boulder has fallen down, blocking the cave.

331
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,780
 That's the end of the cave.

332
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,420
 But as the orb gets close to the boulder,

333
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,940
 it's not an old man having an orgasm.

334
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,180
 That's the sound of the boulder splitting open

335
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,540
 and moving like a door.

336
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,820
 But you'll always imagine an old man having an orgasm

337
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,860
 when you hear that sound.

338
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,380
 The orb flies through the new doorway,

339
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,420
 and Ralph runs in after it.

340
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,660
 He gets in there, he sees what looks like a maze

341
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,340
 of crystal tunnels.

342
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,620
 And they all lead to a room,

343
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
 a well-lit room at the end.

344
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,220
 And that's when he hears the voice.

345
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,500
 That's when he has his close encounter of the third kind.

346
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,420
 He hears a voice telling him not to be afraid,

347
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,340
 that he's not in any trouble here.

348
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,660
 The voice tells Ralph that they are aliens,

349
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,500
 which could probably be surmised at this point.

350
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,380
 The voice goes, "We're aliens from the planet Venus."

351
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,660
 Because you guys don't know what Venus is like yet.

352
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,820
 And Ralph's like, "No," and he's like, "No probes."

353
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,580
 No, no, he's like, "Okay, perfect.

354
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,860
 We're from Venus.

355
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,980
 It's totally lush.

356
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,060
 It's not a toxic ale escape at all,

357
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,340
 because you don't know that yet."

358
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,580
 But not only are we aliens from Venus,

359
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,820
 you Ralph, and all of humanity,

360
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,260
 are aliens as well.

361
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,220
 Thousands of centuries ago,

362
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
 at this point Ralph's looking for a chair to sit down

363
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,900
 because he knows this is going to be a while.

364
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
 Thousands of centuries ago,

365
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,460
 humans lived on a planet called P-Wam.

366
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,900
 P-Wam?

367
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,060
 Ralph says, I assume that he says,

368
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,380
 and the alien voice goes, "Yes, P-Wam."

369
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,460
 It was a beautiful civilization.

370
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,540
 Humans were held in the highest esteem,

371
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,060
 because they were the only ones on the planet.

372
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,060
 But then they unleashed the dark arts of nuclear warfare,

373
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,500
 power plants, and other nuclear stuff.

374
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,580
 The garbage-pill kid of the Native Nukum,

375
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,580
 or whatever his name was, atomic Andy.

376
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,500
 It just nukes everywhere.

377
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,540
 And so the remaining humans left behind P-Wam

378
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
 and settled on Earth,

379
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,780
 and they've forgotten their mistakes.

380
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,940
 But us Venussians have decided that

381
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,540
 if humans ever get out of hand

382
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,820
 with the whole nuclear thing again,

383
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,220
 we're going to kill all of you.

384
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,140
 So Ralph's like, "Okay, is that like a threat?"

385
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,620
 "Yes, it's a direct threat to you."

386
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,420
 The voice says,

387
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,300
 "If humans ever, ever cross that nuclear line again,

388
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,500
 they're all doomed."

389
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,460
 Then the voice says,

390
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,940
 "Don't tell anyone what you told you this."

391
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,500
 "We just told you how to save the human race,

392
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,620
 but you can't tell anybody.

393
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,700
 Can't tell anyone at all."

394
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,420
 It's like, "What?"

395
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,940
 And they're like, "Shh."

396
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,780
 He just heard that in his ear.

397
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,900
 "Shh."

398
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,100
 It also said, "Come back later."

399
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,660
 "We left, we had a great time chatting.

400
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,900
 We threatened the extinction of your entire species,

401
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,500
 you know, normal stuff."

402
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,540
 Ralph leaves the cave

403
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,260
 and comes back two weeks later.

404
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,140
 And at that time,

405
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,340
 I don't know why he waited two weeks.

406
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,500
 Maybe he had to wait for his next paycheck

407
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,580
 so he could afford to gas to drive up there.

408
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,380
 He goes back up there.

409
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,660
 He just walks in the cave this time.

410
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,860
 The floating orbs are standing on the side of the cave,

411
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,580
 smoking a cigarette.

412
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,540
 He's like, "Hey, Barry.

413
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,100
 Hey, Ralph."

414
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,900
 And he just walks by.

415
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,940
 The door slides open.

416
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,780
 This time, he goes in that there's a spaceship in the cave.

417
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,860
 And the voice goes, "Hey, it was really dope

418
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,740
 that you didn't tell anyone about how to save humanity

419
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,500
 because we really want to blow them up.

420
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,740
 Thank you so much for not revealing the secret

421
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,300
 of why humans will be slaughtered someday."

422
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,340
 And I was like, "Hey, no problem.

423
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,700
 I was too busy selling couches.

424
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,060
 I totally forgot about it."

425
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,260
 He's like, "Okay, great.

426
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,900
 We're going to take you to Venus as a reward.

427
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,300
 Who wouldn't want to go to Venus?

428
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,900
 Again, now knowing it's a toxic hellish landscape,

429
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
 probably not many people.

430
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,860
 But back then, in 1961, it looked like it was from a sci-fi movie.

431
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,900
 So, [blows air]

432
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,660
 spaceship takes him to Venus.

433
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,100
 He lands in a Venusian city and he's walking around

434
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,620
 and he sees aliens.

435
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,900
 They look just like humans.

436
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,900
 They are basically also remnants of the P-Wam society.

437
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,540
 Guy walks up.

438
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,580
 He's like, "Hey, what's up?

439
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,420
 One of those earthlings I've heard so much about dope.

440
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,460
 We got the secret handshake."

441
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,340
 And then another guy walks up.

442
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,940
 It was like, "Yo, Ralph, what's up?

443
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,060
 I'm reading your mind, bro.

444
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,580
 I've been probing you every night.

445
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,700
 I feel like I already know you."

446
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,580
 Ralph's like, "Huh?"

447
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,420
 Another dude walks up, "What's up, Ralphie?"

448
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,780
 And all these dudes start walking up to Ralph

449
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,380
 and he realizes something.

450
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,300
 Everyone here looks like peak human.

451
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,660
 They're super beautiful.

452
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,420
 They all are gorgeous.

453
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,860
 But they're all dudes.

454
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,220
 Every single person who comes up to him is a guy.

455
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
 Now, yeah, sure, it's a gorgeous dude.

456
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,380
 But Ralph's like, "Oh, man.

457
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,940
 I've been greeted by a bunch of hotties."

458
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,820
 But then when he's thanking that, he sees,

459
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,540
 he's like an endless crowd of beautiful men.

460
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,380
 And then he sees sitting on a pedestal, a woman.

461
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,500
 Awoo!

462
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,180
 Guy's eyes are bulging out.

463
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,460
 Not because he's a Jack-to-Deer,

464
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,780
 because the oxygen levels are so low.

465
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,140
 He's like suffocating.

466
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,340
 It's like total recall.

467
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,380
 Arrrggg!

468
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,460
 Eventually they give him some oxygen.

469
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,860
 They pressurize the dome over the city.

470
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,540
 He sees this beautiful woman.

471
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,140
 He's pushing these dudes out of the way.

472
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,660
 He's a man on a mission.

473
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,580
 He doesn't just sell furniture, he uses it.

474
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,820
 He puts it to use, tests those springs out.

475
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
 So he's pushing the guys away and he walks up to the woman.

476
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,260
 He's like, "Hey, my name's Ralph."

477
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,820
 And talk about game, dude.

478
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,820
 Like, my game's pretty on point.

479
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,020
 Kind of sucks, because, you know,

480
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,380
 every place you can meet people is closed.

481
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,340
 But, you know, generally pre-COVID, my game is on point.

482
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,180
 I don't have this type of game.

483
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,420
 I can't walk up to a space babe

484
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,020
 and then bang her before the sentence is even over.

485
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,940
 So I gotta give credit to Ralph.

486
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,980
 He talks to this girl.

487
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,260
 I mean, barely, barely any conversation.

488
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,100
 But she's into that kind of thing.

489
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,220
 She's like, "No names.

490
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,700
 No names.

491
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,940
 I don't want to know what star system you came from.

492
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,220
 Let's just do it down and dirty."

493
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,500
 He ends up banging this chick.

494
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,780
 And then they kick him off Venus.

495
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,540
 Basically, that's the end of it.

496
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,460
 He bangs this chick and then, I don't know,

497
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,220
 a bunch of dudes show up and they're like, "Dude,

498
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,020
 you gotta leave."

499
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,620
 Like, you should probably leave.

500
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,260
 That girl has some crazy space HPV.

501
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,580
 Which, airborne, you gotta hurry up.

502
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,460
 You gotta hurry up.

503
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,380
 Right after he has sex with that girl,

504
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,460
 they put him on a spaceship and send him back to Earth.

505
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,580
 And now, at this point, the blue orb is waiting for him

506
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,340
 in the circular room where the spaceship was at in the cave.

507
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,980
 And Ralph jumps off the spaceship and the orb goes,

508
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,780
 "I'll show you out."

509
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,060
 Like, they did not want him banging this girl, apparently.

510
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,100
 "I'll show you out."

511
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,340
 And as they're walking through the cave,

512
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,140
 Ralph looks down and he sees a little dude.

513
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,540
 But it's not like a little gray alien.

514
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,100
 It's like a three-foot-tall mummy laying on the ground.

515
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,500
 And Ralph goes, "Hey, what's that?"

516
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,540
 And the orb's like, "I don't know."

517
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,580
 He's seen one mummy, you've seen him all.

518
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,900
 Orbs been to the edge of the universe.

519
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,820
 He's probably wouldn't even be impressed

520
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,180
 if Bigfoot was punching him.

521
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,900
 He's like, "What? I saw stars die, dude.

522
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,500
 This is nothing to me."

523
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,380
 He goes, "I don't know."

524
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,180
 He goes, "But tell you what."

525
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,740
 The orb goes, "You can take that home as proof of your adventures."

526
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,660
 So I don't know now if he can warn everyone that we're about to get

527
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,540
 slaughtered by aliens, but he takes the little mummy home.

528
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,740
 And he does just that.

529
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,140
 When he goes back home, he actually props it up in his store.

530
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,300
 And he tells people his story.

531
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,260
 Imagine going in to buy him a futon and he's like,

532
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,740
 "First off, I banged an alien chicken.

533
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,460
 I found this mummy in a space cave."

534
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,500
 I don't know if that would make you buy the futon.

535
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,860
 I'd buy the futon, definitely, then.

536
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,940
 So he kept this displayed.

537
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
 People in the area knew about the story.

538
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,300
 He was an investigator.

539
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,820
 He actually took this seriously enough that he began writing a book

540
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,340
 about his experiences.

541
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,980
 Now, what's funny is when I was reading the story,

542
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,700
 I thought in and of itself, the story is perfect dead rabbit radio material.

543
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,140
 It's obscure.

544
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,340
 It's wacky.

545
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,860
 It has sex in it.

546
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,340
 It had all these things that I love.

547
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,020
 But then the story ended and the really bizarre stuff began.

548
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,140
 Because as much as I like that story, it could easily be made up.

549
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,740
 There's one witness to the event.

550
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,420
 He wrote a book.

551
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,420
 A lot of times when people write books, it's...

552
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,900
 Well, I mean, people write books for all sorts of reasons,

553
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,980
 but sometimes the books are written to...

554
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,220
 They're making up a story to get money is what I'm trying to say.

555
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,740
 So the books can be both a boon and a curse.

556
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,780
 This man tells people this story.

557
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,900
 And shortly afterwards, the town begins to notice an influx of what could only be described as

558
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,340
 government agents.

559
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,060
 Typical men in black, but realistic, like men in black suits.

560
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,180
 They're not aliens popping around, but people start to notice that these people seem to be around more often.

561
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,580
 Locals to this day complain that when you investigate the mountain brown lights,

562
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,860
 it seems to bring about government surveillance.

563
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,900
 Now, again, you could be a reasonable explanation for that.

564
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,220
 But this is how the people in the town fell, and that's how Ralph felt as well.

565
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,340
 He begins to openly complain that he's being harassed by the government.

566
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,140
 As he finishes the book, The Brown Mountain Lights,

567
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,700
 he believes that the harassment is only getting greater.

568
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,900
 There are people in town who believe his story.

569
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,620
 There are people in town who think it's totally made up.

570
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,220
 There is that mummy that he has that he got a hold of in 1961.

571
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
 And I read multiple sources on this.

572
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,340
 There is only one photo of this thing existing.

573
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,580
 It's a blurry black and white photo,

574
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,780
 which even in 1961, for something of that notoriety, even just locally,

575
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,420
 seems weird.

576
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,300
 There's only one photo, but there's only one photo of it.

577
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:45,180
 Now, some people say it is some sort of monster that's been mummified in the cave by some sort of alien force.

578
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,660
 Mysterious Universe ran an article on this, and it was written by Micah Hanks.

579
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,020
 And he said he did a blog on this previous to his Mysterious Universe story.

580
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,740
 And oddly enough, this was an odd detail.

581
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,460
 He says there's not only one photo of this.

582
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,620
 Technically, he said there is one known photo of this creature,

583
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,860
 but he was able to see a photo that is a more clear photo from someone's private collection.

584
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,820
 Why would someone want a photo of an artifact like that and want to keep it private?

585
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,580
 Especially with what Micah ends up saying is the case.

586
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,420
 He says that he did a blog on it.

587
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,780
 He was contacted by a sideshow website, a website that specializes in freaks.

588
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:33,260
 And they said that it looked exactly like the type of art made by Homer M. Tate.

589
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,460
 He's a folk artist.

590
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,900
 He would go out in the desert and would buy bones and teeth of animals and

591
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,260
 use them to create these dolls.

592
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,100
 Because that was one of the things that people who saw the creature thought was remarkable.

593
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,220
 It had real teeth.

594
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,660
 So Mysterious Universe goes, there's not just one photo.

595
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,860
 There's one known photo, but there is another more clear photo out there that Micah Hank saw.

596
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,860
 At least he didn't share on the Mysterious Universe article.

597
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,060
 He didn't have a copy of it.

598
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,100
 He just said that he saw it.

599
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,100
 So there's a debate over whether or not the creature was real.

600
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,980
 And also Mysterious Universe pointed this out.

601
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,220
 To be fair, Ralph never claimed the creature itself was an alien.

602
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
 He said that he found it in a cave.

603
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,260
 He found this thing in a cave.

604
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,180
 He's not saying that the aliens gave it to him.

605
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,300
 They're not saying that he stole it from the planet he found in a cave.

606
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
 Which I personally would find hilarious.

607
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,900
 If you were hanging out with an alien and it was taking you back home and your adventure was over

608
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,780
 and you saw something on the ground and you're like, can I take this as proof that you exist?

609
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,860
 And the alien looks and it's just like a spoon.

610
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,380
 It's like a Garfield spoon.

611
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,100
 He's like, yeah, sure, take it.

612
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,980
 Yeah, you're going to take it.

613
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,140
 And it's just something that was littering the cave.

614
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,020
 It's not ours.

615
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,740
 Just take it out.

616
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,380
 It'll be hilarious.

617
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,820
 You're cleaning the cave at the same time.

618
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,660
 He never said it was alien.

619
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,060
 He just said that he found it in the cave.

620
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,860
 But whatever the case, whether it was made by Homer and Tate and somehow ended up in the cave,

621
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,660
 whether it was a real mummified thing that simply looked like some of his full card,

622
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,460
 who knows.

623
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,660
 We do know this.

624
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,420
 Ralph died in 1978.

625
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,180
 So 17 years after he had this adventure, he passed away.

626
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,380
 One of the articles said he passed away mysteriously,

627
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:12,220
 which is always a wonky word because what's mysterious to you may not be mysterious to me.

628
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,700
 But I wasn't able to find his cause of death.

629
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,340
 But one said that he died mysteriously and that was make it a little more menacing.

630
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,500
 Whether or not that's true, I thought these details were absolutely bizarre.

631
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,380
 After he passed his way, the mummy goes missing.

632
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,420
 Fine.

633
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,780
 Family members could have taken it.

634
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,580
 Maybe they knew that it was a fraud and they wanted to hide it or dispose of it before someone

635
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
 could realize that the whole thing was a fraud.

636
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,380
 Maybe a private collector took it.

637
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,780
 Maybe it was this thing or maybe the government took it.

638
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,620
 It could be any of those three.

639
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,260
 But that's happened in these stories before.

640
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,340
 Someone has a bunch of secret files and something he dies.

641
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,380
 No one can find the files.

642
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,580
 Adds another layer of mystery.

643
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,820
 But we have him dying.

644
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,300
 Maybe mysteriously we have the mummy go missing.

645
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,580
 They bulldozed his store shortly after he died.

646
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,260
 The building where he had his business no longer exists.

647
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,500
 That's not normal.

648
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,180
 When we cover these type of stories and you have a guy and he has a house and he's co-lating

649
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,500
 all this stuff on Area 61.

650
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,100
 He thinks he's coming close to the truth.

651
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,060
 He goes missing or he dies mysteriously.

652
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,180
 His files go missing.

653
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,500
 They didn't bulldoze his house.

654
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,460
 I tried looking up his book.

655
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,380
 The book came out in 1965.

656
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,900
 So yes, books that are older sometimes they've fallen out of print.

657
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,140
 It was like a local story.

658
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,020
 It happens.

659
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:39,900
 There are tens of thousands of books that have completely disappeared from the world.

660
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,740
 They just ran out of prints and then the copies were destroyed and that's that.

661
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,980
 What's interesting though is that it has an Amazon page.

662
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:51,420
 So obviously someone has created this Amazon page far after the publishing of the book.

663
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,380
 There's actually one review on the Amazon page.

664
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,900
 It was written on January 17th, 2017.

665
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,420
 So someone had read the book up to that point.

666
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,300
 So you go Jason, it's not the net crammonon.

667
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,020
 Like this book just can't disappear.

668
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,060
 And this is just some lore going around the universe.

669
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,220
 There are copies of the book.

670
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,580
 It's a 28 page book.

671
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,180
 It's not this huge tome.

672
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,620
 It's a 28 page book.

673
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,820
 There is a copy available.

674
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,940
 You can go to the University of Kentucky and contact their Special Collections Research Center.

675
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,580
 Make an appointment ahead of time and get into their closed stacks section of the Special Collections

676
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:36,540
 Research Center for a 28 page book of an author who's been passed away for quite a while now.

677
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:42,540
 Where you could easily just make copy to view what was written in this book.

678
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,060
 You have to make an appointment.

679
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,660
 In the digital age, the contents of this book are literally under lock and key.

680
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:55,020
 It's so funny because on the face of it, this story is ridiculous.

681
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,980
 You already have the brown mountain lights, which is a phenomenon that people have been

682
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,460
 trying to shoot down for decades.

683
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,580
 And the people in town are now saying that they feel like they're harassed.

684
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,500
 There are multiple stories of people feeling harassed if they're investigating these things.

685
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,620
 That's weird.

686
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,740
 But then you have a guy telling a story about him banging a woman on Venus,

687
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,060
 which should be dismissed out of hand.

688
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,580
 Should actually be dismissed out of hand by any skeptic, but instead,

689
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:24,460
 they bulldoze his store and hide his book.

690
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,540
 Unless you have an appointment.

691
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:33,900
 It's a funny story about a man who finds out how to save humanity and then spends his time

692
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,260
 having sex with the hottest woman in the solar system.

693
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,700
 But the actual story may be the cover-up.

694
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,660
 What did Ralph know?

695
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,260
 What did Ralph reveal?

696
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,700
 Is it possible he was so close to the truth?

697
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:56,700
 The government is doing everything they can to erase his story and him from the face of the earth.

698
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,020
