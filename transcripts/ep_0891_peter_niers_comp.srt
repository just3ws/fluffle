1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 Can you get so high you can predict your own destruction?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,560
 Then we travel back to the 1500s to take a look at a satanic serial killer who cut a

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,440
 bloody swath across Europe.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,400
 Is it possible that this madman actually had access to black magic that turned him into

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,640
 an unstoppable killing machine today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:37,320
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,440

 You sure are cool.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,000
 I guess you can't say he's not.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 It's in his name.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
 Flix you're going to be our captain, our pilot of this episode.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,280

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,000

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,500
 Now Flix let's go ahead and we're going to start off by tossing you the keys to the Dead

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
 Rabbit Durgible.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,600
 We're headed all the way out to Calabasas, California.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:52,600
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:00,120
 So this man, he's 53 years old, begins to experiment with ayahuasca, which is a very,

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,280
 very powerful hallucinogenic.

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,360
 They've used it in shamanic journeys for centuries and now it's the brand new craze.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,080
 If you can get a hold of some, you can do it yourself.

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,680
 You're supposed to have like a shaman there to help guide you, but you can just take it

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,120
 yourself if you're famous enough, if you have enough money, you can just have the ayahuasca

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,160
 delivery service show up and be like, "Mmm, I'm going to drink this all by myself.

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,760
 What could possibly go wrong?"

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
 Now this man said, "Listen, I've done ayahuasca up to 15 times.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:38,920
 I'm experienced with it, but there was one time that I had such a hellish experience.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,400
 It changed me."

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,720
 This man, he says that it takes about 45 minutes for the ayahuasca to kick in.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,200
 So he's famous, right?

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,720
 He's wealthy, he has stuff to do.

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,120
 He goes, "You drink the ayahuasca and it's 44 minutes.

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,320
 It hasn't kicked in yet.

42
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,720
 Maybe I need more."

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,120
 So this guy basically doubled toast and might have tripled toast because he kept waiting

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
 for it to kick in.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
 He's like, "Oh, 44 minutes and 30 seconds.

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,080
 I'm still not high.

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,800
 Time for another sip of this ayahuasca."

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,520
 After the ayahuasca kicked in, because eventually it will, right?

49
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,760
 He's sitting in his mansion that he bought with the money that he earned coming up from

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,000
 the bottom, coming up from nothing.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,840
 Everything this man has, he earned it.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,520
 He spent his entire life working towards this goal.

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,640
 Working to be rich enough to take ayahuasca in a Calabasas, California mansion.

54
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,400
 He's sitting in his mansion and what happens is he starts to see his money floating through

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
 the house.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,880
 He goes, "Wait a second.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,280
 Money's not supposed to do that.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,320
 He's watching hundreds of dollars and thousands of dollars and then millions of dollars just

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,000
 fly through the house like a tornado and it's just disappearing."

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,480
 He's trying to grab as many bills as he can, but each time he grabs one, it just completely

61
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,240
 fades away and he's watching all of his wealth vanish.

62
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,320
 And then the mansion around him begins to fade from view.

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:23,080
 Now he is standing in a vacant lot and his career disappears as well.

64
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,840
 I don't know how he visualized that.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,920
 I don't know if he saw a newspaper and it's like, "This guy sucks!"

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,200
 But he starts to realize that his entire career, his wealth and his fame has just evaporated.

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,520
 He's standing there with nothing and he built it.

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,160
 This wasn't a guy who was given anything.

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,320
 He built an empire and he watched it disappear in front of him.

70
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,760
 He said that while he's sitting there in this state of utter loss, utter devastation, he's

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,520
 hallucinating that he's lost everything, his daughter walks into the room in real life.

72
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
 Not in the vision because there is no room in the vision.

73
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,880
 The mansion's gone.

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
 She walks into the room in real life.

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
 I don't know what this guy was doing.

76
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
 I was in the living room or something like that.

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,160
 He's watching sports and he's like, "You know what?

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
 It's half time.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,760
 It's time to take a psychedelic trip to the world beyond."

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,200
 His daughter walks in and snaps him out of it.

81
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,600
 "Dad, dad!"

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,880
 And he said, "I could hear her calling for me and I stopped caring about everything

83
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
 that I had lost.

84
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,640
 I stopped caring about my career.

85
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,440
 All I wanted to do was to get back to my family."

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,640
 And then he had a really interesting quote to wrap this up.

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,520
 "When I came out of it, I realized that anything that happens in my life, I can handle it.

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,720
 I can handle any person I lose.

89
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,000
 I can handle anything that goes wrong in my life.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
 I can handle anything in my marriage.

91
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,080
 I can handle anything that this life has to offer me."

92
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:06,520
 That man was Will Smith like a year or two before his career disintegrated on Oscar night.

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,080
 "Will Smith about four months ago did an interview."

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,840
 I don't know when he actually did the drugs, but about four months ago, Will Smith was

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,880
 on David Letterman's Netflix show, "My Next Guest Needs No Introduction."

96
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,600
 It was just recently released, but it was recorded months before the Oscar night.

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,440
 So the Iowa Oscar journey, I don't think it happened right before the taping.

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,160
 He woke up and he's like, "Oh wait, I gotta get down to the show."

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
 So it had happened previous to this.

100
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,760
 So him watching his entire career disappear and losing all of his money and his home and

101
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,920
 everything like that.

102
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
 Was it a prediction?

103
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,800
 Like it's really, really interesting.

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,240
 When he took the Iowa Oscar, did it basically show him the future?

105
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,600
 Because Will Smith is on the skids.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
 He's had like two or three movies canceled because of this.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,840
 He's banned from the Academy Awards for 10 years and I know what all of us are thinking.

108
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
 Who cares, right?

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,480
 We don't go to the Academy Awards, but his name is Mudd at this point.

110
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,400
 What happens is he really pissed off a lot of, not just Chris Rock, right?

111
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,520
 Chris Rock just rolled with it and got 10 more years of material from it.

112
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,760
 The powerful people in Hollywood who take the Academy Awards super, super seriously,

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,400
 it was spinning on them.

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,600
 And I guarantee that for a long time when Will Smith goes out for a role, someone's gonna

115
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,520
 get a phone call from some dude that we've never known, right?

116
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,320
 Some producer who has a lot of power and he's gonna be like, "Don't hire him."

117
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,640
 That's gonna go on for a long time.

118
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,280
 It's possible that Will Smith never makes another movie.

119
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,400
 That hidden network within Hollywood, they've shut him out.

120
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,280
 And all because he slapped a guy on camera.

121
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
 That was really it.

122
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,880
 He slapped a guy on camera at their most prestigious ceremony.

123
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,240
 So did the Iowa Oscar trip actually predict that his career was going to disappear?

124
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,600
 Because that's really what's happening.

125
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 It's interesting as we can always go, "Well, he's a millionaire."

126
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,680
 But we don't know people's standard of living.

127
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,360
 Like if you are a millionaire and you live in a mansion and you have all these fancy

128
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,440
 cars, you're assuming you're gonna keep making millions of dollars each year.

129
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,160
 If someone just says that they earn $20 million a year, they may spend $40 million a year.

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
 Right?

131
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
 On credit and all this other stuff.

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,640
 Because they assume I'm gonna be in the business for another 10, 15, 20 years.

133
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,360
 Will Smith has been in the business since he was like 16.

134
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,400
 So why would he assume at 53?

135
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,480
 He was going to not make any money anymore.

136
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,960
 And he said before, that was his worst fear, was going back to poverty.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,360
 That's where he came from.

138
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,840
 And he built this empire and then he slapped a dude and he spit in the face of the powerful

139
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,560
 establishment of Hollywood.

140
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,720
 It humiliated them.

141
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,040
 And he has shut out.

142
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,000
 And the Iowa Oscar thing, like did the Iowa Oscar predict that this was gonna happen?

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,880
 Or did the Iowa Oscar, this journey, prepare him for it?

144
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,600
 Like was there no way to prevent what was going to happen?

145
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,040
 Like the stars were going to align in just the way that Will Smith was gonna walk up

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,400
 and slap Chris Rock.

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,680
 And the Iowa Oscar journey was to say you are going to lose your career very soon and

148
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,400
 this is what it's gonna feel like and you better be prepared for it.

149
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,960
 Or, so it could have predicted something that couldn't be changed.

150
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,240
 You could have predicted something and tried to help him psychologically deal with it because

151
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,760
 it couldn't be changed.

152
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,800
 Or was the Iowa Oscar there to prevent it?

153
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
 Not just predict, but prevent.

154
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,680
 Was it showing him that you are at risk of losing everything?

155
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,720
 And when he comes out and says I can handle any person I lose, I can handle anything that

156
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,840
 goes wrong in my life, I can handle anything in my marriage, I can handle anything that

157
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,960
 this life has to offer me.

158
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 Will Smith, I love you, I love your work, but I don't know if that's true.

159
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:04,800
 Like you can say that, but Chris Rock made a joke about your wife and you couldn't handle

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,920
 it.

161
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,360
 Like the Iowa Oscar journey was incomplete.

162
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,760
 Because I do believe, I don't do psychedelics at all.

163
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,400
 Because my grasp of reality is so tenuous already that I don't do anything that messes

164
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
 with my bill.

165
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,600
 I don't drink either.

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,400
 Like I drink maybe two or three times a year.

167
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,720
 I don't do drugs because they affect my sense of reality way too much.

168
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,440
 I don't do psychedelics, but I do believe that they can open up pathways for you to

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
 see things.

170
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
 I'm not encouraging the use of psychedelics either.

171
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 I don't want someone to go chase and set it.

172
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,320
 I'm gonna eat all these mushrooms and drink all this Iowa Oscar.

173
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,080
 Maybe the journey wasn't complete.

174
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,760
 Maybe there was another lesson he had to learn and when his daughter came in she interrupted

175
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,640
 that spiritual journey.

176
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,960
 I feel bad for the guy.

177
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
 I feel bad for the guy.

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,120
 I think he was pushed to the limit and he went up and slapped his dude, but his career

179
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
 is over.

180
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,200
 Although I will say this, America always loves a good comeback story.

181
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
 So I'm hoping in the next five to ten years he has some great role.

182
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,280
 He comes back.

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,960
 He steals America's heart again.

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
 Will Smith is on top.

185
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,000
 I think that's what will happen.

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,680
 But he has to go the next five to ten years without making the money he used to.

187
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,120
 Did the Iowa Oscar try to prevent that from happening or did it try to prepare him for

188
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
 the inevitable?

189
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,960
 And was there another lesson he needed to learn?

190
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,760
 But his spiritual journey was interrupted.

191
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,480
 I can handle anything this life has to offer me, but if it's someone insulting someone

192
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,560
 you love, you know, I'm not saying that if someone's trash talking to someone you love,

193
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,960
 you should let him get away with it, but it's a fascinating story.

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,560
 It's a fascinating story and I hope it ends well for Will and his family.

195
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 Flix is cool.

196
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,400
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbenter Copter.

197
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,520
 We're leaving behind Calabasas, California.

198
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,680
 We are headed all the way out to the Palatinate.

199
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:54,680
 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-du

200
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:17,080
 Flix is cool.

201
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,880
 He was a monstrous fiend.

202
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,700
 Other people just, he was a sick serial killer.

203
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,120
 Some people say the story's mostly true.

204
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
 Some people say there's a lot of folk tales in it, a lot of fables.

205
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,940
 But really the difference between the true version and the fables is how many hundreds

206
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,160
 of people did he murder?

207
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,800
 Did he murder 200?

208
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,480
 Did he murder 300?

209
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,680
 Whatever the number historians want to agree on, it's a lot.

210
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,480
 And I gotta give a thanks to Fabio.

211
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,120
 He's the person who sent the story over, always sending over fantastic stuff.

212
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,760
 Fabio, a long time listener of Dead Rabbit Radio.

213
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,520
 I appreciate it very, very much.

214
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,200
 Back in the 1500s, this is so fascinating.

215
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,280
 You talk about like a subculture, right?

216
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,680
 You had robbers.

217
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
 Robbers have been around since the beginning of time.

218
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,400
 But when villages started to become towns.

219
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,840
 When you started to have people really, really protect the things that they love, their family

220
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,400
 and their gold.

221
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,840
 It wasn't enough for a single robber to jump out with a dagger.

222
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,200
 I mean that might work in a big city, 'cause there's a lot of other places you can hide.

223
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,640
 You can assassinate and creed up a wall, then jump in a pile of hay and no one will see

224
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,680
 you.

225
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,600
 But for the most part, you would do some of that, but for the most part you got better

226
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
 odds if you attacked people in a group.

227
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 And that makes sense.

228
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,400
 I mean today we have the gang, right?

229
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,480
 You can get mugged by a person, but it's far more easy to have three people go into a

230
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,760
 liquor store than just one.

231
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,040
 But because the penalty for theft, for robbery was death, if you got caught, you knew you

232
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,360
 were going to die.

233
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
 They killed indiscriminately.

234
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,280
 If they stole your stuff, it's not like nowadays when someone comes up to you and is like, "Give

235
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
 me your chains."

236
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,560
 You give them your chains, give them your wallet, they didn't ask for the wallet, you

237
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,880
 just made a complaint.

238
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,360
 And then they'll hopefully leave you alone, right?

239
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,280
 Most of the time they're just going to take your stuff and leave, 'cause they're a robber,

240
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,760
 they're a stick-up man, they're not a murderer.

241
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
 And the penalty for robbery is what, a couple years, if you get caught, might even be a

242
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,160
 misdemeanor if you plead down to something.

243
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,920
 But if the death penalty is on the table, if you're going to die, you're going to kill

244
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
 any witnesses.

245
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,320
 And all these groups of marauding robbers would wailay stagecoaches, any travelers in

246
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
 between cities.

247
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,800
 These were the most dangerous places.

248
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,360
 And what's interesting is in this time period, shepherds were basically considered a step

249
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
 above a robber.

250
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,160
 I wouldn't even say barely a step, they were right next to them.

251
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,880
 People hated shepherds because they believed, and rightfully so, this happened a lot, the

252
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:02,920
 shepherds would migrate from area to area, and they were out by themselves, and they

253
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,880
 would know the lay of the land.

254
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,640
 So in between the villages, in between the cities, the shepherds would know all of the

255
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,800
 secret passages, all of the back roads, all of the little goalies you could run down.

256
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,880
 And so basically, if you were a shepherd, you were basically considered a criminal.

257
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,800
 Like people knew that there had to be shepherds out there, but it didn't help, there's a lot

258
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,800
 of these robbers who disguise themselves as shepherds, or they would be shepherds on

259
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
 the times they're not robbing.

260
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,040
 Like in between big jobs, they'd just be, they'd go back to their sheep, the sheep were

261
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,720
 like, oh, we were wondering when we were coming back.

262
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,640
 It's like, yeah, yeah, I'm here, I love you guys.

263
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,200
 And then he sees like a stagecoach going down the road, and he's like, oh, sorry guys, I

264
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
 gotta go to the store to get some cigarettes.

265
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,320
 They're like, not again.

266
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,120
 There's this quote from a novel in 1554 talking about shepherds.

267
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,880
 This is how they thought of them, quote, "Far from civilized society and alone with the

268
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,000
 animals, he has time to think over his misdeeds.

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,040
 Members of such a group were unsurprising suspects."

270
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,640
 Unquote.

271
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,080
 So the story of Peter Nearest takes place during this reign of criminals, just these mobs

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,000
 that would waylay travelers, and do these huge heists, and then they would break up into

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,840
 smaller groups and then travel around, they'd get their sheep together, they'd ride them

274
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,560
 around like little ponies, and then they would go to the next job.

275
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,800
 And then if they heard, hey, the king's moving all this gold through this area, they would

276
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,360
 start to group up again.

277
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,120
 So you might be facing down 30 of these guys taking, and we see parallels to this, like

278
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,720
 the train robbers in the American West and the pirates, right?

279
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,520
 You have these huge, you needed a group of pirates.

280
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,240
 You're gonna have one guy on a pirate ship, it wouldn't work.

281
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,840
 But you have these gangs, but the story of Peter Nearest, the reason why it stands out,

282
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:57,960
 is that he is also associated with the darkest of dark magics.

283
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,160
 Peter Nearest was more than just a standard robber/serial killer.

284
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,120
 He was a cannibal, and he was a master of magic.

285
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,360
 And this is where people go, "Okay, the fables, the historians are like, we don't know how

286
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
 much of this is true."

287
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,640
 Like as a historian, I'm not officially saying he's a magician, but a lot of people claimed

288
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,160
 that he did have powers.

289
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,240
 And it's interesting when we look at his career.

290
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,020
 He was active for quite a long time, quite a few years, but in 1577 he was caught along

291
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,920
 with other members of this gang.

292
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,280
 And he was caught, he was tortured, and he confessed to killing 75 people.

293
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,120
 But he escaped.

294
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
 He got out of jail.

295
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
 The rest of his gang was caught, they were all executed, but he got out.

296
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,840
 And that is really, like obviously people already thought this guy had access to some

297
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,640
 ritual magic, because they took him long enough to catch him this first time.

298
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,960
 But escaping from a jail when he was definitely under heavy guard, they knew who this guy

299
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:07,880
 was, made people really think the stories of his powers might not be exaggerated.

300
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,960
 One of the stories that does seem pretty folkloric is that he and his gang had a meeting with

301
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,760
 the devil himself.

302
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,000
 They called upon the devil and said, "Hey, we're those shepherds that have been killing

303
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 all those people.

304
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 You love our work?"

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,020
 And the devil was like, "Ah, the shepherd thing's a little boring, but I love the murders."

306
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,800
 And the devil gave his blessing to Peter Neers.

307
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 And this is dope.

308
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,920
 I didn't know devils did this stuff.

309
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,120
 I didn't know Satan did this stuff.

310
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,840
 Apparently not only did he give his blessing to Peter Neers, he gave him a monthly paycheck.

311
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,800
 Which my question immediately is, how much?

312
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,160
 Like it's the devil, right?

313
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
 Any amount would be way too low.

314
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,440
 He has access to all the riches.

315
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,360
 If he was giving him $10,000 a month, I'd still be like, "Come on, devil.

316
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
 Come on.

317
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,440
 You're like a little bit more, a little bit more, buddy."

318
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,120
 So he always had money on him.

319
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,600
 And that was actually, there was a few things that you could always know that you had Peter

320
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,480
 Neers in your company.

321
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,040
 Because people were looking for this guy.

322
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
 Right?

323
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
 He's killing a bunch of people.

324
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
 He'd been arrested.

325
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,560
 They had descriptions of him from survivors and they had descriptions of him when he was

326
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
 arrested.

327
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,880
 And he was described as being a very old man who had a long scar down his chin.

328
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,560
 He had two crooked fingers.

329
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,160
 And he always had money on him.

330
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,440
 Which is where I think part of the devil's allowance is coming from, right?

331
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,000
 A thief, you would imagine.

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
 The reason why you're a thief is because you need money.

333
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
 It would be odd that a thief would always have money on him.

334
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,640
 But that was one of the call signs of Peter Neers.

335
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,360
 He always had money on him.

336
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,680
 He also, they say, he also, he always had the money on him.

337
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,440
 He also had two loaded pistols hidden in his pants.

338
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,640
 And he carried around a huge two-handed sword.

339
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,760
 So you would think, "This guy, you should be really easy to pick this guy out of him."

340
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
 Right?

341
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,040
 He's the guy who can't walk right because he's afraid he's going to blow his kneecaps

342
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
 off.

343
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,400
 He's constantly carrying around this giant sword like it's out of a video game.

344
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,240
 But apparently, despite this stuff, he has pockets full of gold like Scrooge McDuck,

345
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,000
 two loaded pistols, and this giant sword, he was a master of disguise.

346
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,120
 Now, some people say it was the magic that did it.

347
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,040
 Some people say that he could turn into a rock.

348
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,200
 He could turn into a log.

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,520
 If you were pursuing him, you'd go into a forest and he'd be gone.

350
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,360
 And if they had only looked down, they would have seen a hollowed out log with a human

351
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,080
 face on it going, "Hehehehehe."

352
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,520
 And then it's full of gold and there's two pistols lying next to it, and a giant sword

353
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,080
 sticking through it.

354
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
 He could turn into a rock.

355
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 He could turn into a log.

356
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,600
 He could turn into a cat or a dog or other popular things of his shapeshifting abilities.

357
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,480
 What historians believe is they actually believe that he wasn't a shapeshifter because normal

358
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,280
 historians don't believe in that stuff.

359
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,760
 They believe he was a master of disguise.

360
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,640
 They believe that the-- because he had mentors, right?

361
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,400
 He wasn't the first guy to do any of this stuff.

362
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,280
 There were people doing this long before him and he was joining these gangs and he was

363
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,560
 learning from other people.

364
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,560
 They believe that his mentors taught him how to disguise himself.

365
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,280
 And they believe-- and this would actually work.

366
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
 This would totally work.

367
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,680
 He would disguise himself as either a foot soldier, just a dude walking around in armor.

368
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,960
 I don't know if it was like a suit of armor, but you know what I mean?

369
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,240
 He would dress like just a common soldier who would totally just fit in.

370
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,520
 He wouldn't fit in today, right?

371
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,720
 If you saw a guy walking on the street in chain mail, you're like, "Uh, I think I'm

372
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
 gonna call the cops."

373
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,440
 But back then, it wouldn't be odd.

374
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,480
 You'd just think it was a foot soldier or a mercenary passing through, especially if

375
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
 you were in a big city.

376
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
 You wouldn't think anything of it.

377
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,520
 The other disguise that he would often use, and this one's genius, he would be a leprosy

378
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,040
 victim, which people would just stay away from him.

379
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,560
 People would just stay away from him.

380
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,600
 So that would explain why people thought he was a master of disguise.

381
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,680
 He actually could just disappear.

382
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,920
 They don't explain how leprosy victims walk around with a giant two-handed sword and not

383
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:17,040
 getting any attention, but apparently it worked, because he was unstoppable.

384
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,080
 And because they were these whispered rumors of cannibalism and his connection to dark magic,

385
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,360
 they started to believe that his powers must be coming from somewhere.

386
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
 Not just the devil.

387
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,800
 He must be doing something really despicable, because they're coming across these crime

388
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,480
 scenes and people are just destroyed.

389
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,600
 People aren't just killed, they're ravaged, they're mutilated.

390
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,320
 So the stories start to pop up that Peter Neers must have access to some unholy objects.

391
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,920
 We did an episode a long time ago about the Hand of Glorial, but that episode on the show

392
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,000
 notes was an early one.

393
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,080
 It was one of these old, thief techniques where you would take a human hand and you'd

394
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,360
 have to prepare it in some way, and you would light the fingers one by one, and everyone

395
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,520
 in the house would fall asleep and then you could just burgle the house and be in and

396
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,720
 out and no one would ever know.

397
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,880
 That was a really cool episode, although that one on the show notes.

398
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,000
 So people knew about relics like that, but they didn't know if that's what Peter Neers

399
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 was using.

400
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,800
 Some people believed that that was it, but it turns out his artifact was far more terrifying.

401
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:34,920
 In 1581, in Newmark, which is modern day Bavaria, Germany, our protagonist, Peter Neers, is

402
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,960
 staying at an inn called the Bells.

403
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,800
 He's there for a couple days and no one knows it's him, right?

404
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,400
 There's posters of him all over town, but no one knows it's him, his master disguise.

405
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,920
 He's at the inn for a couple days and he goes, "You know what?

406
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,720
 I've been here a couple days in this town.

407
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,520
 It's time for a bath."

408
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,040
 There's not a bath in his room because it's old timey stuff, so he had to go to the public

409
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,120
 bath and he's walking out there and he's like, "I'm gonna be completely naked, so I don't

410
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,360
 know what type of disguise I'm wearing, but I think I'll be fine.

411
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,720
 I don't think anyone's gonna catch me."

412
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,120
 Well, he gets in there and yeah, you can't wear disguise.

413
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,960
 You can't be a soldier or a leprosy victim in a public bath.

414
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,440
 I guess you could have a leprosy, but I don't think they'd let you in.

415
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,120
 So he's in there and people start to talk.

416
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
 It's crazy.

417
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,280
 Before photographs or anything, you just went off of a drawing.

418
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,080
 People started saying, "I think that's Peter Neers.

419
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,640
 I think that's Peter Neers."

420
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,960
 At this point, he had been active for 15 years.

421
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,520
 People have been looking for this guy.

422
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,240
 So two people snuck out of the bath house undetected and they found out what inn he was

423
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
 staying in.

424
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
 You know, it's a small town.

425
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,120
 A stranger shows up with a two-handed sword.

426
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,720
 Everyone's gonna know what inn he's at.

427
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,480
 They asked what inn he's at and they go see the innkeeper and they said, "Hey, you know

428
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,360
 anything about that weirdo who just came in and you're in a couple days ago?"

429
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,720
 He was smelly for one.

430
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,000
 He had an added bath in a couple days and innkeeper goes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,520
 That guy, he actually gave me this bag for safekeeping."

432
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,560
 And the two people are like, "Dude, we gotta look in this bag.

433
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:16,880
 It's either full of cotton or tulips or it'll be proof that Peter Neers is at the public

434
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 bath house."

435
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:31,440
 So they take the bag and they open it up and what they find is a bag of fetus hearts and

436
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
 hands.

437
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,960
 I don't know why adding the hands on makes it even worse.

438
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,560
 It would be bad enough if it was just a bag full of fetuses, right?

439
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
 Sorry, Flix is cool.

440
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,960
 It's like throwing up in the corner.

441
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,680
 Sorry, you're on this episode.

442
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,920
 Someone had a bag of fetuses.

443
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
 That would be pretty bad.

444
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,640
 I wouldn't be like, "Well, at least it's not the hearts.

445
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
 It's just babies.

446
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,560
 It's just little fetuses in there."

447
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,520
 You open up the bag and there was a bunch of fetuses in there.

448
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,400
 You'd still call them the cops.

449
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,120
 But fetus hearts is awful and then the hands is just kind of gross because you'd recognize

450
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 those.

451
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,240
 I don't know if I'd recognize a little fetus heart, right?

452
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,000
 They look in the bag and they're like, "Uh, we expect to find two guns and a bunch of

453
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 gold.

454
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,480
 We didn't expect to find a bag of baby hearts."

455
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,800
 So they go to the constable and they're like, "Just believe us.

456
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,160
 We're going to tell you a story.

457
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
 Just believe what we're saying.

458
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
 Don't look in the bag."

459
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,760
 And the constable's like, "I kind of got to look in the bag."

460
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,400
 And they're like, "Uh, you're not going to want to look in the bag."

461
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,440
 But anyway, so the constable rounds up a bunch of people.

462
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,880
 They go into the bath house and they arrest them.

463
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,800
 And he is then tortured for quite a while and he ends up confess...

464
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,680
 People don't know if this number is accurate.

465
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,040
 This is what he confessed to under torture.

466
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,120
 People say a lot of stuff under torture.

467
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,920
 He confessed to 544 murders.

468
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,360
 Those are the ones he admitted, which either means he exaggerated it or he did way more

469
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,880
 than that and he was too embarrassed to talk about those ones.

470
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,160
 544 murders.

471
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,760
 I mean, nowadays obviously that's still an astounding number, but back then there were

472
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,840
 villages that didn't have 544 people living in them.

473
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,520
 Insane.

474
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:17,880
 So like all good medieval stories, this one ends with a good old fashioned torture.

475
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
 Day one.

476
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,680
 I'm just going to shut the podcast off.

477
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,680
 I'm just going to shut it off after the fetus hearts.

478
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,240
 Is he really going to read out the tortures?

479
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
 Day one.

480
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,000
 It was September 13th, 1581.

481
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Day one.

482
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 They...

483
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,040
 Here, and I'm going to say this too, people always get so pissed off.

484
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,280
 I get like angry emails and YouTube comments when I say this.

485
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,400
 I think this is exaggerated.

486
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,680
 This is what news reports said at the time in like wood carvings, but I think it was

487
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 propaganda.

488
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,280
 I did an episode about a guy who was strapped down to a hot burning throne and his skin

489
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,880
 was pulled off inch by inch and I was like, "That's impossible.

490
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
 That's fake.

491
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 Here's why it's fake."

492
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,400
 But people were like, "No, you're fake.

493
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
 You're fake.

494
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,440
 Don't say the torture's not real."

495
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,840
 I don't know who's defending the torture.

496
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,320
 I don't know who wants it to be real.

497
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,640
 I'm pretty sure it's fake.

498
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
 So let's take a look at this.

499
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
 Day one.

500
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
 His flesh is torn from his body.

501
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 Not all of it.

502
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 Just some of it, right?

503
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,080
 They got another two days to do.

504
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,800
 There's three days of tortures.

505
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 Day one.

506
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,360
 They tore some flesh from his body and they poured heated oil on his wounds.

507
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
 Okay.

508
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,520
 I'm not saying okay, but that's okay.

509
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 He's like, "Boring.

510
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,040
 When's the real torture start?"

511
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,520
 I'm saying you could survive that.

512
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,840
 That's torture.

513
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,240
 So that was the first day, right?

514
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,520
 And I don't think they did it for all day.

515
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,120
 They probably took him an hour to do that.

516
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,960
 They pulled off some skin, poured some oil on him, and then the executioner's like, "When's

517
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
 lunch?"

518
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
 Then it's day two.

519
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,800
 So like, what did they just send him back to the cell?

520
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,480
 He's like, "Ow, ow, ow, ow.

521
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,640
 I have this hot oil on my skin."

522
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,920
 Day two.

523
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,560
 Total de-escalation, right?

524
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
 Day one.

525
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,640
 They tear his skin off and pour hot oil on his skin.

526
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,240
 Day two.

527
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,800
 They take his feet, which are still attached to him, and they put heated oil on him.

528
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,640
 They're like, rubbing it on.

529
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,920
 I imagine it's like that red spicy oil from like a Thai restaurant.

530
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,160
 He's all, "Yummy, yummy, yummy.

531
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,440
 I am a cannibal after all.

532
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
 Mm-mm-mm.

533
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,960
 I'm gonna eat them feet."

534
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,840
 They held his feet over hot coals, not even a fire.

535
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,480
 They couldn't even afford like, logs and stuff for this.

536
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,600
 They held his feet over hot coals and his feet roasted, 'cause he had like, on the hot

537
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,000
 oil and then they held it over hot coals.

538
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,600
 Here's my question against all your torture aficionados.

539
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,920
 One, who was holding his feet over the hot coals?

540
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
 They're getting burned up too.

541
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
 They accidentally spilled some heated oil on their hand.

542
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,320
 They're like, "Oh, I hope I don't get cooked."

543
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,000
 They're like, "Hey, can you hold his other foot?"

544
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,760
 You're like, "No."

545
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,480
 Like someone has to be holding him over the hot coals.

546
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,920
 Two, why didn't they use a fire?

547
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,200
 Why is it just hot coals?

548
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
 Three, he's a cannibal.

549
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,280
 This is super delicious to him.

550
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
 He's loving it.

551
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,320
 Even though it's painful, like all those little cartoon wavy lines are coming up, the

552
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,280
 scents coming up from his feet.

553
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
 Mm-mm-mm.

554
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
 Day three.

555
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,600
 I was so disappointed in day three, 'cause I had to look up something that I always

556
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,680
 thought was real and it's not, well, it's real, but day three, they drag him to the

557
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,000
 place of execution, which at that point, I mean, he can't feel anything really.

558
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,080
 He's been all burned up and stuff like that, but they're like, "Oh, it's gonna be all dirty."

559
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,680
 They drag him to the place of execution and he is broken on the wheel.

560
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,840
 So I always thought, I see pictures of this, right?

561
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:27,000
 It's a giant wheel and I always thought that they tied you to the wheel and then I thought

562
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,960
 this, I mean, if you said broken on the wheel, you tie someone on a wheel and then you roll

563
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
 it down a hill.

564
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
 They're like, "Wee!

565
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
 Ouch!

566
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
 Wee!

567
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
 Ouch!

568
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
 Wee!"

569
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
 Ouch!

570
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
 And they're getting crushed.

571
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
 Kids are like, "Oh, Ma, can I murder someone so I can be broken on the wheel?"

572
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
 Not today, Johnny.

573
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,360
 But I imagined, shocker of shocks, that the wheel did a wheel-like motion to kill you.

574
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,080
 You know what it means to be broken on a wheel?

575
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,240
 This is so stupid.

576
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,000
 When you are broken on the wheel, this is what they did to Peter Neers.

577
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,880
 They dragged him across the dirty city to his place of execution, tied him to the ground,

578
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 and then dropped the wheel on him.

579
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
 That's what they do.

580
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,080
 They pick a wheel up, a giant wheel, and they drop it on him.

581
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,040
 And then they pick it back up and then they drop it on him.

582
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,080
 And then they pick it back up and they drop it on him.

583
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
 What?

584
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,840
 You can do that with anyone who doesn't have to use a wheel.

585
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,320
 You can use a bat or a sledgehammer or something or a boot.

586
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,040
 Why build a giant wheel if it's not going to do a wheel-like thing?

587
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,880
 I guess eventually, sometimes, if your bones are all busted up and you're still alive,

588
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,200
 they'll pick up your body.

589
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,800
 And then they'll like thread your arms into the wheel.

590
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,200
 So like your arms all busted up.

591
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,000
 People are like, "Dude, you're doing this podcast for no one at this point."

592
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,400
 Your arms are all busted up and they'll thread it through the wheel so you'll be hanging there

593
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,000
 from the wheel and then guess what?

594
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 They beat you up.

595
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,760
 They beat you up, they beat you up as you're there and then you die.

596
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,560
 At no point could I find hilarious death.

597
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,120
 At no point could I find someone being tied to a wheel and then it rolling down a hill.

598
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,560
 Maybe at some point people are getting tied to water wheels and they were drowning and

599
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,280
 then getting a little bit of air and drowning and get a little bit of air.

600
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,240
 I'm not saying I want advancement in torture technology, but if you're going to call something

601
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,720
 broken on the wheel, it should do a wheel thing.

602
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
 So very disappointed.

603
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
 He's not disappointed.

604
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,520
 He's dying very slowly.

605
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,000
 They dropped this wheel on him 42 times and he still lived.

606
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,600
 Shows how inefficient dropping a wheel on someone is.

607
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,880
 He was eventually quartered by horses and he died.

608
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,500
 That's the story of Peter Nears, probably one of the most prolific serial killers in history.

609
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,040
 The reason why we don't really classify him as a serial killer because it was a side job.

610
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,120
 His main thing was robbing people.

611
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,400
 The killing was just to cover up the robbery.

612
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,520
 That normally doesn't get classified as a serial killer.

613
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,040
 Back then that term didn't exist, but on a paranormal aspect, let's wrap the episode

614
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
 up like this.

615
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,560
 I find it so fascinating that we spend so much time pressuring the Air Force and the Pentagon

616
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,760
 for information about UFOs.

617
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,400
 But we never stop to ask police officers and FBI agents about their encounters with the

618
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,880
 paranormal in the field.

619
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 Never.

620
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,560
 I'm sure there are beat police officers working the streets and FBI agents investigating crimes

621
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,360
 and they come to something that they cannot believe.

622
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,240
 It's so unbelievable they can't even put it in their report because they would get laughed

623
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,600
 out of a job.

624
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,360
 Same reason why pilots weren't talking about UFOs for 50, 60, 70 years.

625
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,640
 It's still a lot.

626
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,120
 Don't do it today.

627
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:53,600
 So if you had a police officer chasing down a thief, the thief runs around the corner,

628
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,440
 the officer runs around the corner and the thief is gone.

629
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,600
 He's going to assume the thief just got away, right?

630
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,840
 He's going to call in backup, maybe call in a helicopter depending on the severity of

631
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,280
 it and how much of a risk this guy is to the community.

632
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,560
 But what if an officer actually saw a suspect vanish from him right in front of him?

633
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
 Disappear.

634
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,320
 Turn invisible.

635
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,480
 Because this thief had access to a bag of black magic.

636
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,400
 A bag of fetus hearts.

637
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,360
 I'm not sure what you're doing with that part.

638
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,320
 This magic, if it's real, it's not like it would have worked up until the 1500s and then

639
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,120
 someone goes, "Ah, it doesn't work anymore."

640
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,000
 If it worked up to the 1500s, it would work today.

641
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,840
 And these secrets would still be taught in thieves' guilds.

642
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,000
 These would be passed down in prisons from an old criminal to a younger one who has time

643
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,600
 to get out.

644
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,040
 These dark secrets could be still used today.

645
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,960
 Invisibility spells, shape-shifting spells.

646
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:06,040
 Deals with the devil not for fame and fortune, but to be their ally on earth.

647
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:11,360
 To spread chaos for material gain.

648
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,040
 We don't know how to call these beans forth or we don't know specifically what ingredients

649
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,920
 need to go in this bag or we don't know the incantation to turn into a rock or a log or

650
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,240
 a cat.

651
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,320
 But someone does.

652
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,920
 And secrets like that would be passed down over the generations.

653
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:39,280
 If these spells worked in the 1500, as disgusting as they are a bag of fetus hearts, if that

654
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,680
 worked back in the 1500s, it would work today.

655
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,840
 And if a police officer was chasing a suspect and that suspect notices that the cop is about

656
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:58,040
 to get him and he reaches into a little pouch and then suddenly he's gone.

657
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,560
 A white in front of the officer completely disappears.

658
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,080
 That would 100% go unreported.

659
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:12,720
 The officer would never put that in a police statement, he would just say, "I lost him."

660
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,280
 And so there could be these tools still out there.

661
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,720
 There could be a crime wave, and we've covered a lot of stuff like this, a crime wave using

662
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:28,440
 black magic to get away from law enforcement.

663
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,080
 Just because it's an old timey tale doesn't mean every element of it is false.

664
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,480
 In fact, the opposite's true.

665
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:44,120
 If it worked back then, it would work today.

666
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,160
 And we would never know it.

667
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,040
 It would never be revealed to us.

668
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,800
 There may someday be disclosure about the UFO phenomenon, but there will never be disclosure

669
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,880
 about the way that dark forces interact with our daily life.

670
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,040
 It's not a light in the sky.

671
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,040
 It's a broken car window or a gun in your face.

672
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:15,440
 A crime wave fueled by black magic.

673
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:22,360
 A crime wave that continues from generation to generation to generation.

674
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,680
 The criminals may change, but the crimes don't.

675
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,080
 Murder is what the devil demands.

676
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:41,040
 And murder is what the devil gets.

677
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,480
