1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 A pop singer in Malaysia finds more success practicing black magic.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,840
 And then we take a look at a story that I've actually hinted about quite a few times,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,840
 but have never spoken about publicly. Today I will tell you the time that I fought a witch

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,920
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:29,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,720
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Remember,

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,680
 we're going to do a live episode, a live Thanksgiving episode. It's going to be 12 p.m. Pacific Standard

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,760
 Time. So grab your turkey or your tofu or nothing. Maybe you're fasting that day, I don't know.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,240
 And come and join us for a live episode. I don't know if I'm going to do an episode on Friday.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,080
 The live episodes kind of drain me, plus all the, you know, turkey and everything,

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,280
 but definitely we're going to have that episode come out on Thursday. We're going to have all these

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,920
 other episodes coming out as well as normal. We'll see what's going on with the Friday episode.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
 But while I'm trying to figure out what to do with that, let me introduce some of our legacy

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,160
 patreons, Corio and Nicole. Corio and Nicole, they're coming in. They're doing summer shots.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,040
 They're doing like a Cirque du Soleil routine. They're doing flips and stuff. And they land.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,280
 They have machinilias hearts. Hi, Cori. Hi, Nicole. Thank you for supporting the show.

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,840
 You guys are going to be our captains, our pilots this episode. If you can't support the Patreon,

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,920
 I totally get it. Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,960
 So Nicole, let's go ahead and put you in the Dead Rabbit Durgible. Corio is going to be your

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,320
 first mate. He has a cute little skipper uniform, mom. Look at that. That's so adorable. We are

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:46,080
 flying out to Malaysia. Specifically, we're headed out to Kampong, Paris. That's in Ulu Dong.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:55,840
 And Ulu Dong is in Rabu Paeng. And all of those places are in Malaysia. So there, I'm just pointing

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,680
 down. I know exactly where it's at, don't you? I'm pointing down right at the region we're going to

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:08,480
 land at. Nicole brings that Durgible down. We're all walking around in like clothes because you're

25
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,320
 not allowed to be naked in Malaysia. We're walking around in clothes. It's a sunny day. We're taking

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:19,040
 pictures. We're just tourists. And we see a poster on the side of a building and it is for Malaysia's

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,320
 top pop star, Mona Fande. But we notice that the poster is a little frayed. And the reason why the

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:34,960
 poster is sun-dried flaking off is because this is an older poster. You see, Mona wasn't one of Malaysia's

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,040
 top pop stars. However, she tried. She self-produced an album. She was able to do a couple performances

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,720
 on TV shows. But her career never really took off. So she went to the next best thing. Because power

31
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 is what Mona craved, really. It wasn't about putting forth her art, but being recognized,

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,640
 being known, being somebody. And if you can't be a powerful person yourself, you need to be the power

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,280
 behind the powerful people. This story is really interesting. I'm actually surprised it's not more

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,440
 popular because some of the themes are going to be talking about. You'll find very familiar with

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,160
 conspiracy theories going on to this very day. Mona leaves behind her pop music career and she

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:27,120
 becomes what's known as a Bomo. A Bomo is the Malaysian equivalent of a shaman or a witch doctor

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,480
 or a spiritual healer. But they were also known, some of them at least, to not just grind up a

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
 couple herbs and put them in your teeth. They let you know they don't spike your teeth. They're like,

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,800
 "Ha ha ha, now you're cured of all your diseases." And you didn't even know I was behind it.

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,200
 That you pay them money. You pay them money. They give you herbs, you know little trinkets. This will

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:54,400
 help you find your lost love. A little GPS. It's a GPS tracker you put on your love. But also she

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,160
 was doing a little bit of that black magic. A little bit of the dark arts. Now it wasn't so much

43
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,920
 that she was placing curses on other people, but she was telling people that she could, for lack of

44
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
 a better term, make their wishes come true. Now, she didn't have a little shack in the middle of a

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,640
 swamp. She wasn't sitting on some dusty street corner reading poems. Her clientele very quickly

46
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:24,320
 became the rich and the powerful of Malaysia. Heads of state, high-level government associates.

47
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,920
 The rich and the powerful begin to visit her to get a little bit of that sweet, sweet magic.

48
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,520
 She was weaving all over the country. Is she actually casting spells that are helping these

49
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,240
 people out? They believed it. And then we have Maslon Idiris enter the scene. He's an up-and-coming

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,360
 politician. He's just getting his foot wet in the super corrupt swamp known as politics.

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,720
 And he hears of Mona. He knows her reputation, so he visits her to see if he can get some magical

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,400
 assistance. She says, "Come on by my house. We'll take care of it." Now it's not free. It's going

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,520
 to cost you 2.5 million ring-its. And he's all gold. That sounds like a lot. And when you run the

54
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,800
 conversion factor, it's actually a ton of money. It's $609,000 in U.S. dollars to get this done.

55
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,040
 She must have had a very well-established reputation. You're not dropping $25 at the local

56
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,600
 fortune tellers. If you're dropping $600,000, hopefully you've seen results. Hopefully you're

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,800
 not the first sucker in on this scheme. But he pays it. He writes off some land deeds for her

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:43,040
 and gives her some cash. July 18th, 1993. Maslon goes to her house and there he sees Mona, along

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:50,000
 with her husband, Mode, and their assistant, Jirami. And Maslon goes, "Okay, so I want the power that I

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,720
 know you can grant me. I want to be a very successful politician." She goes, "That's simple enough. Very,

61
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,640
 very simple spell, honestly. I need you to lay down on the floor." So he lays down on the floor.

62
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,160
 She goes, "I need you to close your eyes." Closes his eyes. He hears the shuffling of feet

63
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,400
 around him. The carpet moving under his body every time someone steps closer. And then she says,

64
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:26,080
 wait for it. You'll soon feel money falling from heaven onto your face. We don't really know what

65
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:35,600
 Maslon's thought process is, because there's only a brief second between her saying that and an axe

66
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,320
 coming down and severing his head. Jirami was standing there waiting for the signal and when

67
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:51,280
 she gave it, decapitated Maslon. They chopped up the body, disposed of it in a shack nearby their

68
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,760
 house for some bizarre reason. This is where the plan started going sideways when they murdered

69
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,960
 a person, basically. But this is when it really starts going sideways. They chop up the body,

70
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,760
 hide it in a little shack nearby Mona's residence, and then take the money and just go about their

71
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,680
 lives. Mona actually goes and gets a facelift. She goes and buys a new car. I think it was a jaguar.

72
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,360
 Live in large. Live in large with that dead man's money. But you see, Maslon had actually been missing

73
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,560
 since July 2nd. People were already wondering what was going on with him, because they saw him pull

74
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,440
 out a large amount of cash from his bank account and then disappeared. He was still alive until

75
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,760
 the 18th, but he didn't have any communication with the public. I don't know if he was wearing an

76
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,960
 invisible man suit. He borrowed all the money. He's like, "Oh yeah, I want to get one of those cool

77
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,880
 suits that's on that movie." He didn't do that. He unfortunately got his head chopped off, but

78
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,160
 it's interesting he was missing for 16 days before he was actually murdered. The cops were already

79
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,520
 looking for him. But through a weird series of events, and it didn't actually say it in any of

80
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,800
 the articles I read, the police ended up narrowing their sights on Jirami, the assistant. And he broke

81
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,000
 very quickly. Said where the body was, said what was going on. The cops go and arrest Mona. You'd

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 wonder if she was surprised when cops walked into her house, but she did just have facelifts.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
 So you wouldn't be able to tell. She's like, "Oh my god!" Her face is totally frozen place,

84
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,960
 not a good facelift. They all get taken, hold into court. The trial starts, and Mona is smiling

85
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,640
 throughout the trial. That's a lot of times when you read these articles, they'll talk about how

86
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,400
 she was smiling. She seemed so content. She was on trial for murder. Some people say that it was

87
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,480
 because she finally got the fame that she had wanted. She would call the people at the courthouse,

88
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,600
 and the photographer's taking a picture, her fans. That's why she always had a smile on her face.

89
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,040
 I think part of it, again, has to do with the shoddy facelift, but it could also just be the fame.

90
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,960
 All three are found guilty. And all three are sentenced to hang. In Malaysia, before you're

91
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:02,000
 executed, you get to... This sounds like torture. This sounds absolutely awful. A day or two before

92
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,640
 your sentence to death, you get to spend eight hours with your family. You're like, "Jason,

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,840
 that's awesome! That's what Thanksgiving's all about!" Yeah, it is, but imagine like you having

94
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,520
 to hang out with someone who's gonna die in a day. I mean, I guess you're like, "Jason, you're super

95
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,960
 heartless!" But it's like you go and you hang out with your relative and she's like, "Hey, everyone,

96
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,680
 yeah, I murdered that guy. There's no axes lying around right. You're like looking around making

97
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
 sure there's no sharp weapons." First, and here's the thing. One, it seems torturous because you

98
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,600
 know this is the last time, you know for a fact this is the last time you're gonna see someone.

99
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
 Two, eight hours is a long time. Imagine if you were just like a cousin who like kind the new Aunt

100
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,760
 Mona and you're like, "Oh man, did I bring a Game Boy? Did I bring a Game Boy?" Were they invented

101
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,360
 in 1993 as Mona's like, "I'm gonna miss you guys so much." So little dude's like, "I'm so bored."

102
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,840
 He's all drawn stuff. Eight hours is a long time to spend with somebody. Anyone, whether or not

103
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,160
 they're going to die, seems like torture for both people. Psychological torture for the person who's

104
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,080
 going to die and then actual torture for all the nephews and nieces who'd rather be at home than

105
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,360
 be here in this prison. She tells them though, she says this comment quite a few times apparently,

106
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:28,000
 "I will never die. I will never die." But on November 1st, 2001, they bring a last meal

107
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,880
 to these three defendants. Now, Mona and her husband said, "We don't want to eat anything. We don't

108
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,920
 want a last meal. We're gonna sit here in contemplation as we move on from one existence to the next."

109
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,600
 So on another thing that would probably be considered torture, the prison officials go,

110
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
 "Oh, you want to have like this spiritual awakening before you die and all that stuff,

111
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,840
 but by law we have to give you a last meal. So here's a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken."

112
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,560
 How can you be like on the spiritual path? You're sitting in a cell, you know you're gonna die in

113
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,480
 a few hours. You're trying to cleanse your body of all impurities. Someone puts KFC in front of you.

114
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,840
 Tell me you don't eat that KFC. Tell me you do not. You're like, "Okay, I'll just take a bite.

115
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,000
 My last bite and then you're all hard. You just started eating it. You're pouring it into a horse

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,400
 trough." Sucking on the bones. How could you? That is so, I mean, I don't care about them. Hopefully

117
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,800
 that their spiritual existence thing, I don't care how peacefully they went to death. They were

118
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,200
 murderers. But I just think that's so funny. Like I imagine like a monk wanting to be like,

119
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,400
 "No, I will go to the afterlife the same way I came and no earthly possessions on me or in me."

120
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,080
 And they're like, "Here's some mashed potatoes and gravy straight from Kentucky Fried Chicken

121
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,680
 and a biscuit." And they're like, "Ahhh. How can you resist Kentucky Fried Chicken?"

122
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,520
 We don't know. The reporters, there's no article saying they chow down. And as they were being

123
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 led to the gallows, they're like, "Finger licking good. It's the worst advertisement for KFC ever."

124
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,680
 But anyways, they do get taken to the gallows. She was completely calm. They put the rope around

125
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,920
 her neck or the noose to be specific. Kick the switch. And they all die.

126
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,440
 That's the story of Mona Fande. It's a very, very interesting one because like I said earlier,

127
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,720
 it has all the hallmarks of what we think about when we think about modern conspiracy theories.

128
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,000
 Satanic magic and sacrifice being connected to the rich and the powerful, the music industry.

129
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,200
 Like I'm actually surprised this story isn't trotted out more often. When people talk about

130
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,720
 Katy Perry is doing whatever she does nowadays and making music still. But Katy Perry, I remember

131
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,880
 early on, it was like Dark Horse was her, like making some Satanic bargain. Rihanna's Queen of

132
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,960
 the Illuminati. We see this stuff all the time, these conspiracy theories. And here we have someone

133
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,640
 who started off as a pop singer, became a Boma, but actually was also doing the, Boma is supposed

134
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,600
 to be like a healer, but it can really, it's a catchall term. She was using her powers to guarantee

135
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,640
 other people political power for money. So I'm surprised that this story doesn't get brought

136
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,560
 up more because it really ties into a lot of that stuff. The entertainment world, magic,

137
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,640
 and secret societies. People at the top using magic. So on that level, I find this story really

138
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,400
 fascinating. But what I find is even more bizarre about this story is why did she kill him?

139
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,080
 She, I mean, she had been doing this for a while. She had already had access to these

140
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,160
 powerful people. Why would she choose to kill this guy? She could have just taken his money,

141
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,640
 promised him power. If it didn't come about, she goes, "Oh, the fates, the fates were wrong.

142
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,600
 The fates, they didn't get the message. Maybe if he gave me a little more money,

143
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,080
 I could pay the fates phone bill and give him a call." You know, that's what these charlatans

144
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,640
 always do. So why did they murder him? Because they'd been doing this for a while and they hadn't

145
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,640
 murdered any of their other clients. Let's put on a conspiracy cap here for a second. I think

146
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,440
 she murdered him because someone else had a request for an even more powerful spell.

147
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,760
 One that would require the blood of a gullible, willing instrument. And so to make that spell

148
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:25,680
 work for someone else who paid her far more money, she had to execute Mazlan, a dark magic

149
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,560
 blood spell. It doesn't make sense why she killed him when she had tons of other clients. If she had

150
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,520
 one client and it was him and he almost found out and she chopped his head off, we've covered stories

151
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,160
 like that before. The jig is up. I'm going to get found out. I better kill this person before

152
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,800
 my fraud gets exposed. But she'd been doing this. He was one of a hundred customers. But if someone

153
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,960
 more powerful than him with more money said, "I need this to happen," and she goes, "The only way

154
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,960
 for that spell to happen is for blood to be spilled." He says, "Money is no object." But she goes,

155
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,640
 "Jason, that's the case. What was the point of the magic?" She got killed. None of the money's

156
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,600
 going to help. She got killed anyways in the end. When she is sitting there and she's telling people,

157
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,760
 "I will never die. I will never die." There's two ways to read that. One, she has finally become

158
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,200
 famous. Her name will always be remembered in Malaysian culture. Maybe not. Maybe she's not

159
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,000
 a mythological figure, but you know what I mean? That is a name, especially if you are into true

160
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,720
 crime. You would have never known who Mona Fande was had this not happened. So you could say that.

161
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,880
 That's why she was saying, "I will never die." But the other reason why, we could take it as a literal

162
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:47,680
 thing, she may not be able to die. She may have that level of power. So is Mona Fande immortal?

163
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,120
 Because here we are talking about her on a podcast 17 years after this murder. Or is she immortal?

164
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,760
 Because she crafted a ritual. The only requirement would be human blood. And she found not only the

165
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,960
 perfect victim, but she also found someone with enough money to give her a facelift for her new

166
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,120
 life. Not like her facelift. I'm sure that after the hanging, the facelift was ruined. But you

167
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,080
 know what I'm saying. So that is a good segue to move on to our next story. So Cole, let's go

168
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,320
 ahead and put you in that carbonar copter. We got Danielle sitting there as your co-pilot. She got

169
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,720
 the little headset on, little aviator goggles. You don't have a headset or goggles. Bugs keep hitting

170
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,120
 you in the eyes. Let's leave behind Malaysia. We are headed out to Sacramento, California.

171
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,760
 It's funny, I actually, Weisel Horn on YouTube just the other day said, "Hey man, are you ever

172
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,960
 going to tell a story about you fighting the witch?" A couple of you guys have reminded me of doing that

173
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:52,080
 story over the years. Over the two years I've been doing this show, I'm going to try to make

174
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,880
 it so this doesn't run so long. But there's a little bit of backstory to it. We're going to land

175
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,880
 there. We're back in time. It's about 2008, 2007, 2008, something like that. At the time I was living

176
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,880
 with my friend, Kara. We were both staying at her cousin Matt's house. And it was basically my,

177
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,160
 I was the nanny to her son. Like she worked, she had a full-time job as a nurse. I didn't have a job

178
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,080
 at the time. And she's like, "Hey, I need someone to take care of my son when I'm not at work. And I

179
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,320
 know you're a total hard nose when it comes to homework." And stuff like that. And he has a hard

180
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,200
 time doing his homework. So I need someone to basically break the bat. Like I need some, literally

181
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,360
 I didn't walk around the bat. I mean, like just like, that was a Bain reference. She needed someone

182
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,360
 to, she goes, "He never does his homework. I need someone who's going to be totally on him about

183
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,480
 his homework." And I was. He's great. He just turned 18 the other day. Yeah, no, I was pretty hard on

184
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
 him. I might actually make up extra homework for him. If he didn't do his homework fast enough,

185
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,960
 I'm like, "Tick tock, buddy. You're not wasting my time. I'm staying up late to watch Dexter anyways.

186
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,040
 It's you who's sitting in the living room with no television on." I go, "If you get your homework

187
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,800
 done, you can play video games until you go to bed. But otherwise, you're doing your homework

188
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,280
 until you're basically falling asleep on the table, bro. That's just the way it goes." It took

189
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,800
 about a week and he caught on real quick. I had no give in me when it came to that. But anyways,

190
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,720
 they're all really cool. They're all doing well. Liam, Matt, and Kara. Now, I was staying there.

191
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,840
 And I was a layabout, right? I wasn't telling kids, "Do the homework." I was sleeping on the couch,

192
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,640
 right? I love sleeping on couches. So that's kind of my job. If you got a couch, I'll swing on over.

193
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,880
 Cole, Daniela, you got a couch. I'm there. Sleeping on couches. And the reason why that's

194
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,760
 important, it's not really important in the grand scheme of things. But I would sleep on the couch

195
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:44,400
 a lot, even though I had my own room. Now, Kara's dad was a really nice guy. And he was dating.

196
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,280
 See, here's the thing. This is really interesting. I remember this detail now. I had not met his

197
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,560
 girlfriend. But Kara's dad, I would see every once in a while. He wasn't in Sacramento area. He

198
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,320
 lived somewhere else and he would visit every once in a while. And I remember him talking about

199
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,680
 his girlfriend was a witch. And he's a really nice guy. I don't want to sound like I'm not going to

200
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,600
 murder anything like that. But the way he talked about her being a witch, I was always kind of like,

201
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,400
 are you bragging? Like, that seems like such a bizarre thing to brag about. Oh, my wife's a

202
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,880
 train conductor. Who cares? Who cares? That's how I feel about witches. They're about as cool as

203
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,680
 train conductors. I'll tell you the story when I beat up a train conductor. I'm sitting there.

204
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,480
 And he would be like, oh, my girlfriend's a witch. And I'd be like, yeah, okay, I fought demons.

205
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,880
 Like, I didn't actually say that. But you know, I'm like, that doesn't really impress me, whatever.

206
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,880
 But again, he's a super nice guy. I'm not trying to knock him. And so she was coming up. The girlfriend

207
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,920
 was coming up. And I was sleeping on the couch. And they were doing some renovations in the house

208
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,600
 or something like that. So Kara's dad and the girlfriend were coming. We'll just call the girlfriend

209
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,000
 Samantha. I don't remember. We have Samantha come in. And I remember I was sleeping on the couch.

210
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,600
 And I woke up. Like something woke me up. It also, it was noon. It was super late in the day. But I

211
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:13,840
 remember something woke me up. And the only way I can describe it, I wake up and Samantha's in there

212
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,240
 with Kara's dad. They're in the kitchen. They're looking at the lighting. Even though we had no

213
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,640
 interaction with each other, we haven't even said a word to each other yet. It was as if

214
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,000
 there were two magnets in the room, completely repelling each other. It was a very, very weird

215
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,880
 feeling. I felt like I extended out to fill half the room. And something else was pushing against

216
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,000
 that. Like you could feel the whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, between us. Now I had not

217
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
 said anything. Now I have a pretty good read on people. I can tell if someone's going to steal

218
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
 money from me. I can tell if someone's going to stab me in the face. Those are just things that you

219
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,120
 have to do to survive in bad neighborhoods, right? Or you don't make it. But this was different. This

220
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
 wasn't me like hanging out with dudes because I'm hung out with dudes who do stab people. And I know

221
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
 they're not going to stab me, so I'm totally fine with it. I would prefer they don't stab. I would

222
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,600
 prefer they don't stab anybody. But you know what I mean? It's not just the fact that they've beat

223
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 people up violently. That's whatever. They shouldn't, but they've done it or they will do it. It

224
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,520
 does involve me. So I don't feel I'm in danger. But this I didn't necessarily feel I was in danger,

225
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,520
 but you could feel that. I remember it. I remember it instinctively. I had not said a word to this

226
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,520
 woman. She would have had to have been in her 40s. Now I would have been back in 2008. I don't know.

227
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,560
 I can't do math right now. What is that? 12 years? 12 years ago? So I would have been like

228
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,000
 early 30s. She was definitely, she might have been older than that. She might have been late 40s.

229
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,040
 Very attractive woman. But I can feel that energy just like repellent. I felt like I was taking up

230
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,240
 a ton of the room. And maybe I always take up a ton of the room. Maybe I always have this

231
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,200
 giant energy bubble around me. But for the first time I met something of equal strength that was

232
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:09,680
 pushing back against it. And I can almost guarantee she felt the same thing because she hated my guts.

233
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:18,400
 Absolutely hated my guts. She didn't say it, but I could tell. Absolute disgust disdain.

234
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,240
 Now at first she was there for a couple of days. They wouldn't stay there, but they would spend a

235
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,480
 long time there. They'd spend like eight hours the day there working on stuff. And I'm sitting on the

236
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,760
 couch. This is my place, dude. I'm living here. I heard through the grapevine. I don't remember if

237
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,080
 Kara told me. I think she might have think the Samantha maid have told Kara's dad and the

238
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
 Kara's dad told me, but I heard it through the grapevine. And again, this is after a good two

239
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,320
 or three days of me realizing she hates my guts. We've maybe said hello to each other. I'm sure

240
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,800
 we did that. But apparently, and I don't remember, it's funny because I can't say for sure that Kara

241
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,240
 told me this or how I got this information, but she didn't like the fact that I slept on the couch

242
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,000
 and that I wasn't helping put in lights. And I was like, one, do you know how dangerous I am

243
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,640
 around any sort of electricity? That's just a disaster waiting to happen. Two, isn't my house

244
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,160
 homey? Like, yeah, sure. I'm like living with other people. And I got this awesome friend, Matt,

245
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,240
 who's letting me stay there. But I've been there for months, right? I'm taking care of the house.

246
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,640
 I'm taking care of the kid. I was paying rent too, now that I think about it. Wait, was I paying rent?

247
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,000
 I don't remember. It doesn't matter. I was paying rent in the love I gave to that family, but I

248
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,800
 might have been paying actual cash. I don't remember. My point is, is that whether or not I'm laying on

249
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,360
 the couch, this is my place. I'm part of this family. You're the interloper. But she thought I

250
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,840
 should be up and about. Now you're thinking, Jason, is this just the story about a woman who

251
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 says she's a witch who thinks you're lazy? No, it's not. Because I don't think that's the reason

252
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,760
 why she didn't like me. I think she couldn't place why she didn't like me. I think she disliked me

253
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,160
 because of that that energy pushing up against. And maybe I was a little more astute that I could

254
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,400
 figure out, because I figured out very, very quickly, there's something wrong with this lady.

255
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,160
 Like this dude may have been talking, she was a witch and all this stuff. And I thought she was

256
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,320
 grinding up herbs, she was chopping people's heads off in Malaysia. I don't know. Whatever she's doing,

257
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,520
 she's putting off some serious voltage. She's putting off some serious energy. And I think she

258
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,240
 probably felt the same thing. She actually tried to get me kicked out. At the very least, she didn't

259
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,560
 want me there when they were working. Now again, if someone was just laying on a couch, I'm not

260
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,840
 pearl from Blade, I was doing other things. But if you came over to someone's house at noon,

261
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,280
 they were sleeping on the couch. Okay, why do you want to get someone removed from that? Or the

262
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:51,280
 very, I remember there was like, should I leave while she's here? And I was like, hell no, I'm not

263
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,600
 leaving while someone who's coming here to put in light bulbs. Put in light bulbs, right?

264
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,840
 No, I'm not leaving. I had no opinion about her in the beginning. I thought it was kind of funny

265
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,760
 that this guy was bragging about dating a witch. I've met a ton of witches in my life. There's

266
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,160
 nothing to brag about. When she entered the room, I could tell there was something really off about

267
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,520
 her. I don't know if she was meaning to exude that much energy, or if she didn't have control,

268
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,920
 or if it was just a natural thing. Who knows? I didn't know I had that type of sphere around

269
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,520
 me until something pushed up against it. But I had enough, dude. I'm just sick and tired of her,

270
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,880
 dude. I was like, no, done. And I remember one day I'm sitting there, Kara was home. I think Liam

271
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,760
 was there too, running around in his PJs or whatever a year old's do. He's like, yippee. How do you do

272
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,200
 what he's on? And Samantha and the dad were out grocery shopping, or picking up more light bulbs.

273
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,560
 I don't know. At this point, it was like been a week. And I knew that I felt unwelcome in the

274
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,600
 place. I had been living there for like a year. I felt unwelcome there. I didn't care. Like, I

275
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,080
 didn't actually feel unwelcome, but people were trying to make me be unwelcome. Her. Samantha was

276
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,160
 trying to make me not feel comfortable there. Whatever, bro. But anyways, they're out picking

277
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,920
 up light bulbs and stuff, buying stuff. And I remember I was sitting there and Kara goes,

278
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,720
 so what's your take on her? And I was like, well, you know, she probably actually does have some

279
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,120
 sort of, we had talked about it before this, but I was like, I think she probably does have some

280
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:30,640
 sort of power. Not anything to be concerned about. But whatever it is, it's not what you would call

281
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,840
 like a white witch. It's not a good power. And then I go, you know what? Let's salt the place.

282
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,720
 Kara's like, what? I go, you got a lot of salt? She's like, yeah, yeah, she cooks. Kara is an

283
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,880
 amazing chef. I go, let's salt the front door. And that'll tell us everything we need to know.

284
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,120
 Now that's an old folk tale. Evil can't cross salt. A lot of times you'll have rituals that

285
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,280
 involve circles of salt to protection. I actually made a joke about it a couple of episodes ago.

286
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,120
 I go, how can a demon that's existed since before time began not be able to cross sodium?

287
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,320
 Like he existed before sodium even existed. So why would that protect him?

288
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,960
 But I'm like, dude, as a joke, right? And as a test, we'll just salt the front door. We're going

289
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:24,400
 to put salt underneath the doormat outside. We will leave the back door unsalted. So let's see

290
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,000
 what happens. And Kara is doing it. We're having fun, right? We're having fun. And Kara goes,

291
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,080
 so she'd done it. And she didn't really believe in ghosts or anything like that. She was just bored.

292
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,760
 She was just totally bored. She goes, so Jason, what's your hypothesis? What do you think's going

293
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,320
 to happen? And I said, well, there's going to be one or two things that are going to happen. One,

294
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,440
 she's just going to walk into the house. And that's going to mean one of two things. One,

295
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,360
 the salt doesn't work. It's just an old folk tale. Or two, she's not actually a dark witch.

296
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,240
 There's just some sort of weird personality glitch between me and her. Maybe she has something

297
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,880
 against couches. Maybe her dad got swallowed up by a lazy boy recliner. I don't know.

298
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,240
 That's one possibility. The other possibility is she can't come in the front door for whatever

299
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,640
 reason. She can't come in the front door. She'll walk all the way into the backyard, open the little

300
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,720
 gate, walk through the sliding glass door. And Kara's like, that's impossible. I go, it is.

301
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,640
 It is. But maybe like that'll happen. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe she'll pull out her

302
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,200
 broom and fly over the house. But in my mind, I'm thinking, this is pretty funny, right? By the way,

303
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:39,200
 this is super funny. I'm actually salting a witch. So I'm sitting in my recliner and Kara's messing

304
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,360
 around in the kitchen. She's trying to cook something. She's like, dang it. Where's all my salt?

305
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,240
 She's scraping it off the front door. The car pulls up. Kara runs through the window and looks

306
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,480
 out the window. And I'm sitting in my recliner. Because here's the thing. If I had gotten up

307
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,480
 and looked out the window, they would have known something was up right in pretty much every part

308
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,000
 of the story I'm sitting down. They're like, Jason's on two legs. Uh oh. Something must be going on

309
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,480
 in that house. I'm sitting down. Kara's kind of in the kitchen. She's looking out the window a bit.

310
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,200
 And she goes, they pulled up. And I'm just, okay. And then what? And she goes, they're just standing

311
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,360
 there. They're just standing there in the driveway. And like a couple minutes pass.

312
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,080
 And then the dad walks in. At this point, Kara's not looking out the window anymore. She's not that

313
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,800
 much of a stalker. The dad walks in and Kara's curious. She goes, hey, where's Samantha? And

314
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,800
 the dad goes, she doesn't want to come in the house. And the dad walks by. He doesn't see me

315
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,040
 and Kara look at each other like, what in the world? Now, obviously I couldn't chime in here.

316
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,680
 That would make it even more suspicious. But Kara asks her dad, she goes, why won't she come in the

317
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:52,720
 house? And the dad goes, we pull up into the driveway. And for whatever reason, she just flipped

318
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,600
 out and started to fight with me. So now I got a dad and he walks back outside and we're like, what

319
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:08,160
 in the world is going on? Five minutes pass. Dad comes back in with more supplies. I don't know

320
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,560
 what's up with that woman. Oh, I don't know why she just acts up sometimes. Being Kara looking at each

321
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:25,840
 other. Dad walks back outside. Another five, maybe 10 minutes pass. The dad walks in and then Samantha

322
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:35,920
 enters the house. Looking pissed, looking drained. I never saw her again. Now I'm not saying she

323
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,240
 disappeared. I'm not saying she turned him a pillow result and Kara used her to cook more food. She

324
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,080
 never came back to the house. I never saw her again. Now there's a couple different things we can look

325
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,240
 at with this story. One, she saw the salt. That was my first thing when I was telling Kara when the

326
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,080
 dad was walking in and out. I go, maybe she saw the salt. Because that is something you put salt to

327
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,080
 keep evil out. If you left a home where you know somebody doesn't like you, or I really started

328
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,800
 off having no opinion about her, I began to dislike her because I could tell how much she disliked me.

329
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,160
 And then you saw salt outside the door and you were all into that magic stuff. You would know

330
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,880
 what that salt signified. So my first thing was I go, maybe she saw the salt and that's why she's mad

331
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,880
 at your dad. Because it would be the equivalent of a hate crime versus a witch, right? And you'll

332
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,200
 try to dunk them in their sleep. We got more information about the fight. It really was

333
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,960
 over nothing. The dad could never understand why she flipped out. And when I say in the driveway,

334
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,840
 it would have been maybe five feet from the door. They were having this argument right out there.

335
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,560
 He said she just got mad over nothing. It was nothing. So she could have said, dude, look at what

336
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,080
 your stupid kids did. They salted the door. And because they think I'm an evil witch, I'll show them.

337
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,360
 Starts electrocuting us. So one, she could have seen the salt and she got offended by that,

338
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,440
 but it doesn't sound like it because she never brought that up. Two, the salt actually repelled

339
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:15,520
 her, but she didn't know what was going on. It might have been the first time she was ever salted.

340
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,160
 Just like this was the first time I had ever encountered anyone. I don't like to give myself

341
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,480
 superpowers. I think anything that I can do, you can do as far as like seeing, like I've talked

342
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
 about seeing demons and stuff like that, seeing ghosts. I think anyone can do that. I think everyone

343
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,200
 probably has a psychic bubble around them like that. I don't know how big mine is in comparison

344
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,760
 to other people, but that was the first time I'd ever felt, and I'm a people person. I talked to

345
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,320
 thousands of people throughout my life. That was the first time I'd ever met someone who

346
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,120
 pushed against my, I mean, again, it was, it was like a good 10 feet. I could feel energy

347
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,840
 pushing 10 feet away from me. Like my barrier was that far ahead of me and I could feel that

348
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,640
 reverse polarity against them. I'm thinking, this is my hypothesis, is that it's not like

349
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,120
 you get to the door and go, "I can't cross the salt." Her aura bubble, her psychic bubble,

350
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,720
 was touching against the salt and she felt it repelling her and she couldn't figure out why.

351
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:23,760
 I'm thinking she probably is a witch, but she's not an adept one. That's my guess. That's 100%

352
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,920
 my guess. It seemed like it was very raw energy coming from her, but she wasn't able to tell what

353
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,040
 was going on. Again, I will flex on her on this to the point where I woke up, whatever was in

354
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:42,880
 that room, I woke up to her being 8, 10 feet away and I could feel her energy. Like it, and I knew

355
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,480
 immediately what it was. It's that person. I wasn't going, "What? Who? Is there any ghosts around?"

356
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,200
 Like I knew immediately this person is pushing against me and I'm wondering if she, that's what

357
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,560
 was happening. As she got closer to the door, she felt uneasy and she couldn't figure out why she

358
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:09,200
 felt uneasy. She felt more than uneasy. She felt unwelcome and so she flips out. She can't understand

359
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,520
 what's going on. Your brain gets reset too. When we get anxious and when we freak out, we're really

360
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,560
 reverting to a childlike state when we're scared of the dark, but now we're adults and we're scared

361
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,920
 of losing our house. Which is fine. You can be scared of losing your house, but that anxious state,

362
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,320
 we go back to being a child. As a child, you lash out. You lash out at your loved ones, even though

363
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,840
 it's not their fault. That's what she's doing. Her energy is pushing up against this. And the reason

364
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,920
 why she was eventually able to come into the house is because the dad had come in so many times

365
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:48,640
 and while he was stepping on that floor mat, he was breaking the salt. He was moving it enough

366
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,560
 that there was enough of a gap in it for her to come into that house. But when she came into that

367
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,400
 house, she looked pissed. She looked tired. She looked like she was just done with everything.

368
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,400
 She never came back. She never came back. At least I never saw her again. Maybe I was out

369
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,080
 shopping or doing something and she's snuck in. She's pouring salt everywhere and I'm like

370
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:17,280
 walking through because that's really the catch to this thing. The hypothesis was that she was

371
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:26,960
 a dark witch. She couldn't cross the salt. If it keeps her out, then she's evil. We did it as a lark.

372
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,640
 We thought it would be funny. In the back of my mind, I'm thinking it might work, but probably not.

373
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:42,080
 Again, how can sodium keep out this person? But it did. At least for 15 minutes. And it

374
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,080
 exploded her emotions. But she couldn't figure out why. It wouldn't happen to a good witch.

375
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,360
 It wouldn't happen to a muggle. It wouldn't happen to one of those guys. But it would happen to a

376
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:01,840
 practitioner of the dark arts. Salt keeps them at bay. At least for a little while. At least until

377
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:09,280
 the line is broken. So that's that story of me fighting the witch. Listen, I hope that she's

378
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,560
 doing well. I hope she hasn't been consumed by an army of goblins or a demon hasn't taken her over.

379
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,000
 I hope everything is going well. Unless that's what she wants, right? She's a consenting adult.

380
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,240
 Maybe she loves to be eaten by goblins. I hope everything works out for her. I obviously don't

381
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:29,680
 mean her any ill will. I can't say the same that she feels towards me again. She started it. She

382
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,960
 started it, but I wish her the best. Maybe she was able to harness her power and get rid of that evil

383
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:43,680
 part of it. I don't know. Maybe she goes on nationwide tours now and talks about the time

384
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,080
 that a guy slept on the couch. She does tours for people. It's like, is your husband on the couch

385
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,800
 all day long? This is how I got rid of him. She didn't. So you basically wasted your money. But

386
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,600
 you know what I mean? I wish her the best. I'm not going to say, oh no, she's super spooky and

387
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,440
 she's hiding in her closet with an axe. I hope she's doing well. And I hope she's able to harness

388
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,920
 that energy and put it towards good use. I hope everything is working out for her. Because if

389
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,320
 it's not, well, you know the old saying, there's more salt in the world than witches.

390
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,480
 That's actually not an old saying, but that's actually sounds really dope. That's a new saying.

391
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,720
 There's more salt in the world than witches, which means good will always triumph over darkness.
