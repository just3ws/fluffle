 A young man's journey into the jungle to find some guava
 Turns in to a close encounter of the ferned kind get it cuz ferns jungles
 That might have been a bit of a stretch
 But then the next story we're gonna look at if you didn't like that one. Don't worry. There's another one coming
 A young woman goes missing
 Unfortunately things like this happen
 Quite often but when her mysterious disappearance is linked to a haunted lighthouse
 All bets are off today on dead rapper radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of dead rapper radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Let's go ahead and move on with our first topic now
 Let's go ahead. You know, we don't really have a jungle terrain vehicle. We did till I got blown up the carboner copter
 But but we're just gonna have to hack and slash our way through the jungle here because what we're doing is we are going to
 South America
 specifically we are headed down to Brazil so
 You're hacking and slashing. I'm just walking behind you because you know, I'll let you do all the grunt work
 You're the one who wants to hear these stories hacking and slashing through the jungle all to help fight
 Cougars or mountain lions. No, no, what do they call the jaguars?
 Yeah, I'll fight those while you're hacking and slashing through and as we're going through the jungles of Brazil
 We also go back in time to the year
 1978 I was two years old when this story took place. So imagine me as a two-year-old baby
 sitting watching
 What was on in 1978?
 Watching threes a company
 Actually wasn't allowed to watch that show not just as a baby
 That was one of the many shows that was banned in my house growing up
 We weren't allowed to watch threes company, which it wasn't that funny. Anyways, I didn't care
 And I don't remember what else probably because they were banned
 But I remember there's a lot of stuff we couldn't watch nor how to crude was what my dad said that shows too crude
 Oddly enough Meredith children. We got to watch that. I think my dad was more relaxed
 But I'm that show came out anyways. So it's 1978
 And as we're in the jungle we're basically cutting a parallel pep
 We're basically stalking this kid really because we don't want to interact with them
 We don't want to interfere with what's about to happen. There's a young man. His name is Luis Carlos Sara 16 year old boy
 He's walking through the jungle and he's in the jungle specifically to go pick up some guava
 Which actually sounds pretty dope
 Imagine and we kind of covered this the Amazon is actually man-made. It was made as like a giant supermarket by the natives
 hundreds or thousands of years ago
 There's something compelling about being able to just be like, you know, what do you want for lunch?
 I don't know a couple pears and just walk out and grab pears like I've never lived and I don't people on farm
 And basically I've just explained like farm life, but I've never been like that. I've always been like, oh man
 I want some guava, which I don't I've never even eaten guava, but let's say like oh, I want an apple
 I have to walk to a store to get an apple or walk to a farmer's market to get an apple
 I've never just been able to walk out to a tree pick an apple off a tree and eat it
 I've never ever ever experienced that at all
 Super bizarre now that I say that out loud, but I've never experienced that never walked up to a chicken shook it to an egg
 Pop out and ate the egg have never done any of that stuff
 So but anyways, he's able to Luis was able to go in he's looking for guava now. It's noon. The hot sun is overhead
 beating down on his body
 I don't know why he's paused like that. It was weird
 Anyways, it's beating down on him and he's just going about his day and then all of a sudden he hears a
 And it was louder than that. I was just trying to make a sound effect a dramatic sound effect
 It was a loud bang, but I didn't want to blow your eardrums out loud bang
 So imagine that clap with the bang on top of it times 20 because what it's loud enough that
 Gets his attention. He's in the jungle if he's not paying attention to all the predators lurking around him
 He's dead. He's constantly having to turn around so he never has his back to a giant jungle cat
 This noise is loud enough to make him go up. I don't care about what's in the jungle
 What's overhead because this loud sound came from overhead? He looks up and he says he says he sees something that is
 Brighter than the Sun. It's a light brighter than the Sun now. It's interesting because
 What he is seeing he doesn't know what it is, but we do we traveled back in time so we know the future
 What he's seen as a UFO and then there is there's a couple interesting things about this right off of that one
 broad daylight like broad broad daylight and to
 At noon when the Sun's directly overhead to see something brighter than the Sun
 Right above you almost seems impossible
 Because you're already bathed in light and for something to be lighter than the light you're in
 I guess if you're like outside in the day and someone strapped like flashes a strobe light in front of you
 That's technically brighter than the Sun
 But it just seems such a it seems so bizarre to have that be like I was looked up at the Sun
 But then I saw something actually brighter than the Sun right above me
 And then that wasn't bad enough if he wasn't his mind wasn't reeling by like how was this possible?
 He starts to be pushed down. He said that he described it as if two strong hands
 were holding his shoulders and
 Slowly like pushing him to the ground
 Pushing him down and he couldn't resist it and it finally gets him all the way to the ground
 And now he's laying flat completely paralyzed and looking up at this super bright light
 Now at this point you're thinking what could be work like what's gonna happen now?
 Like what's gonna happen to this poor kid? He's been blinded. He's been paralyzed
 Jungle cats are putting on their bibs getting ready to eat him, but then he slowly starts to lift off off the ground
 Starts to levitate over the jungle floor and begins flying up into the craft now
 That sounds kind of cool because you think like you'd be Superman and stuff
 But it's not cool if you can't control it like Superman is only cool because he controls where he flies
 If he had all his normal powers, but flex Luther decided where he went
 He wouldn't be that cool and that was this dude this guy was Superman with no self-control
 He ends up flying into the UFO like a big window opened up
 He flies into the window he's actually terrified at this point. There's no dramatic music playing
 Oh, I think Superman came out this year actually didn't come out like 77 78
 Anyway, super not superman the boy
 flies into the UFO
 Defeats Brainiac the boy flies into the UFO and he's sitting there. He's not sitting there. He's actually a prisoner
 He's still paralyzed. He says that he sees these three figures in metallic suits
 Walking around the inside of the UFO can't understand what they're saying and interestingly enough. They also have visors
 So he can't see their face
 He can't really see anything. They're basically wearing armor and he can't understand what they're saying
 So none of this telepathy none of this universal translators
 He is their prisoner and they don't want him to know what they're saying now
 I know right now you think of Jason you don't cover a lot of UFO stuff and there's a reason why I don't cover a lot of UFO stuff
 It's not because I don't believe it. It's because most of it is I looked up in the sky
 I saw light I couldn't identify it flew away or I looked up in the sky this little hover ship appeared and then flew away
 I like this stuff where people are meeting stuff and abductions are always cool
 But usually abductions are just like I got abducted they stuck something up my butthole and then I went home
 And I'm like, yeah, this story is
 Has an interesting connection to a story that I've covered in the past
 And I want to see if you guys can catch it and I'll explain it if you didn't but I'm not just gonna end the episode
 Anyways, so he gets he's talking to these eight. He's not talking to him again
 He's just trapped these metal armored aliens are walking around they take
 So and they're walking around the UFO is continues to fly and then he
 flies like again being levitated flies back off like the little doctor table in the UFO
 back out the window and as he's floating down what he sees is a giant
 stone like a giant flat stone on the ground
 surrounded by grass in all directions
 So he's no longer nowhere near where he left
 He has no idea where he's at and as he's being lowered onto this rock this big giant slab
 This flat slab he looks up. He sees the night sky, but the night sky is just black
 There is no stars whatsoever in the sky. So he's able to see this UFO hovering above them
 It's the traditional disc shaped type UFO flying out the window. He sees below him the grass and the rock slab
 He sees above him just pitch black no stars. No nothing and
 He lands on the rock slab
 He lands on the slab and the figures are standing back over him and they have this ball this tree
 they it's described as a transparent ball full of strange liquid and they force the whole ball into his mouth and
 He wakes up. He's on the jungle floor
 completely paralyzed
 Now he can't move and he can't really talk. He's just laying on the jungle floor
 He's crying out for help. He can't move and finally a fisherman just walking by
 Andy Griffith and his son are walking through the jungle and they see the 16 year old boy laying on the ground
 He's like help me. I'll use the only word I know in Spanish
 Agua Agua and I learned that from Sesame Street. So anyways to give him some water and he's like no no no water
 I need help and you know they pick him up. I don't know what I'm saying. They it's only one fisherman
 I love it when my fictional jokes end up becoming part of the story just one person one fisherman
 There was no sun there. There was no barney fife either one fisherman just one picks him up takes the boy to the hospital
 Three days this kid had been missing
 He went out to go get the guava and three days later they find him on the jungle floor
 The family thought he was gone. They had no idea where this kid went three days had gone missing in that period of time
 He was floating around hanging out on rocks in the middle of nowhere
 And for 10 days he was completely catatonic
 He just sat there in bed paralyzed. He couldn't talk
 Well, he could he could say Agua but I mean like he could he could kind of be like
 I don't know what the type stuff but he couldn't move and he couldn't really communicate. He sat there for 10 days
 And what the doctors noticed they noticed a couple odd things one his hair
 Was gone and first they thought it was shaved off. But as they were looking at it closer
 They realized it was burned off because he actually had burn marks along the tops of his ears
 And four of his teeth had been broken shattered
 And they think that it was fairly recent because they were still blood on his teeth like they were still fresh blood
 So it was like he was a recent wound. Maybe the fisherman dropped him a couple times as he was carrying him
 but
 Eventually after 10 days the kid louise snaps out of it and tells the story of what happened now
 Of course, some people believed in and some people didn't it kind of became this big brouhaha in the area and stuff like that
 And it's just become a story that's kind of disappeared into ufology except for one detail
 I did an episode a while back about a bigfoot being an interdimensional creature
 And in this episode and in this story there was a hiker who was walking through the woods
 He was walking through the woods. He walked through a portal which he didn't know was there and ended up in a
 dense jungle area
 Where there was a bigfoot type creature that was about to attack him from behind. He says I just saw the hand
 I heard a voice go gotcha
 And this hand reached towards him and then he stepped back out of the portal
 But in that portal world where he went it was bright daylight during
 When he was walking through the forest and then he walks through the portal and it's nighttime in this jungle
 He said one of the most alien things about the whole thing was he looked up at the sky. It was pitch black
 with no stars
 Interesting detail and that's why I wanted to cover this story of louise
 One I thought is an interesting story because he's like it has kind of these hallmarks of
 Alien objections, but has that extra detail
 He was also teleported to some weird dimension where there was just a flat rock and grass
 Going as far as the eye can see
 There's I mean it could have taken him to kansas, but that kansas has stars kansas does have a moon like
 It's almost like that jungle world of the bigfoot creature and now this world that these aliens travel to are some sort of
 Void some sort of nexus place where you can kind of filter in and out of
 And then both having the same detail of
 A black sky with no stars to me that is chilling
 That too, I mean, I know there's like light pollution and stuff like that
 So sometimes you don't see all the stars, but you see some of them
 You know that they're there
 But to exist in a world that's just a pitch black sky with no stars to me is is
 Hellish it's so that is so alien to the human experience
 So yeah, I mean that's just a creepy detail shared between two stories on different continents two
 Unrelated stories involving unrelated creatures told by people who have never ever met each other
 And these two stories have never been connected before this podcast
 These are the these are the little pieces of what I believe are evidence
 That some of this stuff
 Is factual
 Sure, two people can make up the exact same detail on accident
 or
 These people survive to tell their stories of this alien world
 That's accessible from earth
 It's not millions of light years away. You can get to it here through a portal through a craft
 But one thing's for sure
 It doesn't sound like a place that is hospitable to humans
 It sounds like a place we should do anything to avoid
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here now our next story is
 It's quite chilling. This is a weird one and this one's still ongoing
 The bulk of it has taken place, but there's still search efforts going on
 We're going to Connecticut the state that never sleeps. It's may 17th 2018
 So a little over a year ago this happened
 A little over a year ago this happened
 Headed out to Connecticut
 So in Connecticut
 There's a lot of people but we're gonna we're gonna look at two people in particular. So fia mackenna 21 year old model slash masseuse
 And her friend spencer mugford is 20 years old and he was a sailing instructor
 And he did like charter fishing boat stuff
 So he was a strong swimmer. He knew how his way around a boat
 They were good friends and they used to date and then they broke up and she got together with her ex
 This is all important, but not just being a gossip. I'm like, oh, did you know spencer and so fia broke up?
 I'm not trying to be a gossip. They're friends
 And she has a boyfriend and he's just chilling. So on may 27th
 They say, hey, you know, let's go on a boat ride. Let's go on a boat ride
 So they end up taking and I'm a little I don't know if technically if they stole this boat or if he had permission
 But they ended up taking a boat
 From the university of connecticut's boatyard. Can you imagine having such a rich school that your school has like a boatyard?
 I was lucky when I went to college. I was lucky if I could find a parking spot and now these oh
 Oh, puffy. Did you bring your boat today? Like who has a boat? Who has a boat section of their college?
 anyways
 That was my rant
 So it's just phenomenal. Are there colleges that I
 I could understand a boating college having a boat. I'm not saying like nautical school
 I'm like, why you guys have boats? But this is university of connecticut
 This is where people go to get like degrees in english and welding and stuff like that. They have a boat section
 It's just so bizarre to me. Is there like a public university that has like a helicopter section or they just have like 10
 helicopters hanging out
 anyways, so
 The soffia and spencer go and they take a boat from the university of connecticut's
 Bizarre boatyard
 So they take one of these boats and they're headed off to a place called the new london ledge lighthouse new london ledge lighthouse
 Now the new london ledge lighthouse is an interesting thing. It's basically a stone pier
 In the middle of the bay and there's a lighthouse built on top of it. It's not an island
 It's not like connected to the land which is what would make an island, but it's not like a natural island
 It's just a stone a giant stone pier with a giant lighthouse. It's not just like a stick with a candle on it
 It's like a fully functional
 Lighthouse that people used to live in and then it went automated back like in 1987
 But a giant lighthouse like you imagine a us lighthouse sticking on a big concrete man-made island in the middle of this bay
 Now like all good crimes. This is why i'm a little i don't think he had permission to take the boat
 But i could be wrong in that detail, but she began snapchatting the journey
 So early that morning like around probably like 1 30 or something like that
 she post a snapchat of
 Spencer
 rowing the boat
 rowing the boat to the lighthouse
 And then at 2 a.m. There is a snapchat photo of her
 of sofia
 standing in front of a no trespassing sign at the lighthouse kind of sticking her tongue out
 Very playful photo
 2 a.m. That photo was taken posted a snapchat
 The next day sofia's boyfriend can't get a hold of her
 And he's calling around and she's not picking up her phone. He can't figure it out
 He ends up calling sofia's mom and saying hey, do you happen to know where sofia is and she's like i
 Don't you don't know and they kind of have that
 Normal conversation that starts off kind of like oh, yeah, yeah, but you can it starts to get panicked over time
 Sofia's mom goes okay. Well, you know, i'll see if i can get a hold of her at that point
 Earlier that morning
 Sofia's sister a little sister had gotten the mother's phone. It was playing with it
 So the mother didn't immediately see when she woke up that there were several missed calls seven missed calls from an unknown number on her cell phone
 But when she starts looking for sofia she she does get her cell phone
 And that is when she sees those seven missed calls from an unknown number. She calls the number back
 It goes to spencer's voicemail
 First phone call was made at 2 o 6 a.m. So six minutes after the photo was taken
 Then 2 o 7 a.m
 Three calls at 2 o 8 a.m
 In the final call from 2 o 9 a.m. So the mother didn't have spencer's phone number in her phone
 That's why it was coming up unknown but sofia would know the mother's phone
 So she was calling from spencer's phone and it would make sense because at 2 a.m
 Her phone that was posting the snapchat video was in the hands of spencer
 So spencer has her phone takes the photo six minutes later
 Spenser's phone is making phone calls to sofia's mother. So that chain of events makes sense
 But they start this search the police begin searching for sofia is the first person who's reported missing
 Eventually spencer is noticed that he's not there as well
 And they're looking for him as well everyone's thinking the worst
 As the as people are do you know where sofia is do you know where sofia is people go? Oh, you know, but look on our snapchat
 This show she was on a boat
 Late last night so they then see the photo of her standing in front of the no trespassing sign and people go
 She went to the lighthouse like her and spencer must have taken the boat because they can even see in the video of the boat
 They see the lights in the background so they can figure out where the boat was headed
 And then there's a photo of her standing in front of this lighthouse
 Sign no trespassing people recognize that because it's not a super popular tourist destination
 But people do go there for a reason and we'll get to that in a second. So
 The police go there and there's no one there. No one on this man-made island. This lighthouse. It's empty
 It's been automated since 1987. So they have to start thinking what could have happened to these two people
 His shirt spencer's shirt is tied around a mooring pole
 At the lighthouse so where they would tie the boats down to morum
 So where they would like throw it tied the boats down basically to keep them from flowing away
 They found his shirt tied around one end of that. So that was like one clue that they had
 48 hours after these two go missing so very shortly on they find the boat washed up
 On a shore it just basically
 crashed up somewhere
 There were no
 Footprints leading from the boat like across the
 Cross the sand there was no footprints like leading off somewhere. So they go the boat must have been abandoned
 So they start working with this theory. They go, okay, here's our theory
 They got to the they did get the lighthouse. We have photographic proof of that
 He tied the boat down with his shirt
 And they got up on the island and at that point the at some point the
 Shirt started to get untied and the boat
 got washed away
 And he jumped in the water after it, but he was probably really tired
 From you know, the well rowing out there
 He jumped in the water after it and she may have jumped in the water after him
 We're going to find the bodies because they're they are not on the island. They checked everywhere
 This is the reason why people knew to go there people
 Recognize the area because the lighthouse has a reputation for being haunted
 It is a place where people go to like meet ghosts ghost hunter shows have gone there
 Paranormal investigators have gone there and if you can take a boat from your college or you just have an own a boat
 You can go there too. It's not restricted property as far as well
 I guess there's a no trespassing sign
 But you know like teen is they're going to jump the fence and go into a graveyard anyway
 So I mean you can go there you can well physically go there, but they go there to go ghost hunting
 It's a spooky place in the middle of nowhere
 So that's their working theory and they actually start to realize that that is most likely what happened
 Because two weeks later they find spencer's body
 Floating in the water
 So they go okay, so this is what this is what happened like yes
 He tied the boat down
 And it started to break away and he jumped in to save the boat and she must have jumped in after him and they're done
 And and what's odd it was very odd
 It was they found his body on the day they were having his memorial service on the day of his memorial service
 they find his body so
 That does answer that question of what happened to him, but people are still trying to figure out what happened to sofia now
 Now I guess tying down a boat with your
 Jacket like I would think well, that's them. Why don't you just use a rope?
 But I mean i'm not a nautical person. I'm not a sailor. I guess is the term i'm supposed to use
 I guess a tie is a tie and this guy he wasn't some drunk frat boy like this is what he did for a living
 So he didn't just like loop it around the boat a couple times and then jump upon this pier like he tied it down
 The way you would moor a boat to a harb to appear
 He's doing nautical knots is what i'm saying. He wasn't just all doing it all loosey goosey like he had it dialed in
 But he unmoored it did get unmoored and it did float away. They know that
 He jumped in they're assuming that because his body was found in the river the question still is where is sofia
 People are going whoa, whoa, whoa if she jumped in the water after him
 How did she make the phone calls like did she make those seven phone calls and then jump in the water to find him?
 Please they're like we don't know
 And and the mother was like there's no she wasn't a confident swimmer
 There is no way she would jump into the water in the pitch dark
 Trying to find someone who's a better swimmer than her she he she go the mother says she just want to do that
 Two other men died
 In the harbor that day two other men died just from because it's like memorial day weekend
 So two other men died in boating accidents that they fell off their boats got drunk got hit by a boat whatever
 Both of those bodies have been found as well
 So we can we can presume that four people fell into the water that weekend
 Spencer, sofia, and then these two other men three of those people were found which is giving more credence to the
 Theory that she did not fall into the water because if she had fallen into the water she would have been found by now
 So people are thinking maybe she was stuck on that island and another boat came and kidnapped her
 Maybe she was stuck on that island and someone killed her serial killer or just a regular killer
 maybe they were being followed the whole time
 And someone untied the boat and there was a struggle and they throw Spencer in the water and they throw her on a boat and stuff like that
 Those are all very very chilling
 Things and I don't want to make light of this young woman's disappearance or the tragedy of spencer's death or anything like that
 I'm not trying to do that at all. However, there is an interesting
 paranormal note to all of this
 Like I said, it's a renowned place
 For ghost hunting, but not just that it's not just that
 This place was hated by the people who worked there. So from it was built in 1909
 And that was when the big pier was built and then they were building the lighthouse on top of it
 And then in 1987 the coast guard went fully automated. So now it's just a computer system that runs it
 Now the legend goes that at some point in the early times of this lighthouse in operation
 There was a guy some people say his name is john some people say his name is Ernie really depends on who you're talking to so
 Not super credible to begin with here, but some interesting
 Similarities so there was this guy his wife cheated on him
 So he jumped he climbed to the top of the lighthouse one night and jumped off and just
 All over the rocks
 And at that point people were like well, we got to get a new lighthouse keeper
 So they send someone else there, but what happens is lighthouse keepers who are working there
 Keep complaining about doors getting unlocked
 Of bed sheets kind of flying off their bed
 You'd make a cup make a cup of tea it fall down
 Normal poltergeist stuff stuff that is quite annoying
 So, you know, you can deal with it. You can you know, you wake up you wake up and your bedroom door is open
 Which has happened to me quite a few times. It's because the wind is blowing through my apartment
 It's still creepy like when I wake up. I know why my bedroom door got pushed open. It's still very unsettling
 Imagine that on a rock in the middle of a stormy night and you're the only person in a spooky spooky lighthouse
 How much more terrifying that would be
 But this ghost also had another trick up its sleeve
 What would happen was people who would be working in the lighthouse
 Would go to leave and their boat would be floating in the harbor
 No matter how hard they tied these boats down
 Sometimes they'd get untied and float away
 Super creepy detail
 I remember when I was because I had looked at the Sophia stuff
 I was researching that and then I started researching the haunted past of this thing
 And just as like they're like the ghost does this the ghost does this the ghost unties boats the ghost does this and I was like, what?
 So this ghost is known for untying boats
 made by
 Like nautical knots again. They're not just doing a little like cheap shoelace knots. They know how to tie a boat down
 They go out their boat is floating away. They have to call for help
 That coupled with the fact that this ghost
 killed himself over
 his wife cheating on him
 And you have this spirit sitting there in the night
 And a young man and a young woman show up at a pier
 A young woman who and I'm not I'm not trying to cast any judgments on this person
 But you have a woman and a man on a pier that's haunted by a ghost who killed himself because his wife left him
 And this woman and this man on this pier used to be lovers
 But she left him for her ex-boyfriend. She got back together with her ex-boyfriend
 It's like this paranormal psychic pot
 Just bubbling forward as you have this perfect storm of elements at 2 a.m
 on this pitch black island
 Is is Sophia somehow still there?
 And again, this sounds totally insensitive, but is Sophia somehow still there?
 Will they not find her?
 Has she been
 We talked about other dimensions portals in just the last segment
 Is she caught somewhere between
 our reality
 and Ernie's reality
 Is she trapped there?
 By a spirit so bent on vengeance
 That when the perfect victim
 Just dropped on his doorstep
 All he had to do
 Was untie a boat
 And let it sail off
 Spencer jumps in
 She's frantically calling her mom
 on Spencer's phone
 In the dark
 Two in the morning
 No one's picking up
 Why did she stop placing those phone calls?
 Did the battery die?
 And then she's trapped surrounded by pitch blackness
 And the sound of the sea around her
 Did something force her to stop making those calls?
 Somebody or something
 No evidence of what happened to her has been found
 No clothing, no blood
 Nothing
 But there is one little piece of evidence to the story of Ernie
 Before the lighthouse went automated back in 87
 The last lighthouse keeper wrote in a log
 Rock of slow torture
 Ernie's domain
 Hell on earth
 May new London ledges light shine on forever because I'm through
 I will watch it from afar while I'm drinking a brew
 You got to wonder if that lighthouse keeper still lives out there
 But now safely snuggled on the coastline of Connecticut
 And if every so often he looks out and sees that lighthouse in the middle of the water
 remembers the horrific experience calling it the rock of slow torture Ernie's domain
 What did that lighthouse keeper see and experience to write those words into that log?
 It wasn't his journal, it was the log for the lighthouse
 What could he have possibly experienced over the course of his job there that would make him call it
 Rock of slow torture
 Who knows?
 But the frightening thing is
 Someone else may be experiencing that same thing
 Right now
