1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 If someone threw a brick at your pet donkey, would you help?

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,040
 Not throw the bricks, would you help your donkeys, what I'm saying?

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,800
 But what if by helping the donkey, you became a donkey yourself?

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,280
 And then we meet a man reaching out for help online, a man who's inches away from becoming

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,640
 a maniac.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,320
 And then finally we take a look at a bizarre new conspiracy.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,560
 Is it possible that video games should be far more advanced than they already are?

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,360
 But the powers that be are preventing them.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,960
 Because if video games reach their true potential, it could destroy the world.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:53,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,480
 You guys heard the intro, we got a bunch of stuff to cover.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,320
 So we're gonna get started right away.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,080
 First off, let's go ahead and give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, walking

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,800
 into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,160
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Peter Newhart.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
 Yay!

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
 Woohoo!

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,240
 He's walking on and he's actually riding a donkey in because he heard the intro.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,960
 He had it planned, he brought his own donkey from home.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
 BYOD.

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you guys don't have a donkey, that's fine

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 too.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,960
 Just help spread the word about the show, that really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,200
 Let your friends and family know that this is where you go to hear absolutely bizarre

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
 and unsettling news.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,040
 Peter, go ahead and hop off that donkey.

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,800
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,960
 We're gonna live the donkey, he can come with us, I don't think he's gonna want to.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,840
 For this first story though, take the Dead Rabbit Durgible out of Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,000
 We are headed all the way out to San Antonio, Texas.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,320
 Peter as you're flying the Dead Rabbit Durgible, go ahead and hit that time travel button.

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,720
 Everything gets sepia toned and now we're in old cowboy clothes, it got the boots on

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,400
 and the big old cowboy hats.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,720
 This is like the 1800s, it's a pretty, pretty big time period, it's somewhere between

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,680
 1801 and 1899, but in this time period in San Antonio, Texas, there was a little family

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,600
 living by this bog.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,000
 So you have a mom and a dad, a boy and a girl, and there's this bridge over this creek.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,840
 Nowadays we have a name for it, but back then it was just called that bridge, it was that

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,520
 bridge to the left of you when you left the house.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,040
 This family was doing totally fine being a family, but one day this wealthy guy shows

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,200
 up outside their house and he's like, "Hey, what's up bog people, bog people in your unnamed

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
 bridge?"

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,520
 They're like, "It'll be named someday, just trust me."

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,360
 He's like, "Whatever, you guys are too poor to even afford a name on your bridge."

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,160
 And this rich guy would always come, he'd go out of his way, it's like outside of town,

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,800
 he's all bored sitting at home in his mansion.

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,880
 He's like, "I'm bored, I'll go make fun of the bog people."

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,720
 So he goes over there and he's harassing this family all the time.

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,240
 And then one day he's walking by and the family's donkey bites him.

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,240
 He's like, "Ah, dude, that totally sucks.

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,160
 I'm going to show you what's what, donkey."

55
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,960
 And he starts beating the donkey up.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,240
 Now here's the thing, right?

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,440
 I know people were probably sturdier, heartier people in the 1800s.

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,000
 There is no scenario that I can ever think of that would involve me turning to a donkey

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,200
 and go, "Why you wise guy?"

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
 And punching him.

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,360
 He starts beating up this animal.

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,200
 I just imagine Popeye just going at this donkey's lips, right?

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,320
 Well the family sees this, the family sees this very wealthy man who's been bullying the

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,520
 family beating up their donkey.

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,800
 So they run outside and they start throwing bricks and rocks at the rich dude and he's

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 like, "Ah."

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,920
 And the rich guy is running away.

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 He goes, "I'll be back.

69
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
 I'll be back to get my revenge."

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,520
 And he runs off and people are like, "What do you mean revenge?"

71
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,440
 You're the one beating up this innocent donkey.

72
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
 Like it should just be over, right?

73
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
 Animal nips at you.

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,800
 You punch the animal.

75
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
 That's it.

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,720
 Don't tell the ASPCA I just said that.

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
 But you know what I mean?

78
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,720
 Slap it, knock it, punch it, bop it.

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,480
 You're doing a little rhythm game with it and it's done.

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,280
 Dude, the rich guy, he goes back home and he gets a posse.

81
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,080
 He goes, "We got to show these bog people what's what."

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,400
 So Jimmy Joe, you get to get these beating up their horses.

83
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,040
 He's like, "I'm strengthening him.

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
 I'm getting a lot ready for the fight."

85
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
 They're like, "Stop it, dude."

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,240
 Jimmy Joe, Tony, Michael, we're all going to ride out to the Bogman's house and we're

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,680
 going to lay siege because they wouldn't let me beat their donkey to death.

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,040
 And they're like, "Whatever, boss.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,800
 It's just another Tuesday for this gang."

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,280
 So they ride out to the bog people's house and little mom and dad are sleeping in the

91
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,920
 bog house, little boy, little girl sleeping in the bog house that they had the donkey

92
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 keep watch.

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,360
 He's on the roof, little pair of binoculars.

94
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,320
 While the house is peaceful and everyone's sleeping, this rich dude and his buddies burn

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,200
 it to the ground.

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,560
 Quite the escalation, really.

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
 I got to say quite the escalation.

98
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,560
 They burn it to the ground and what happens is as the family is burning to death, the

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
 donkey runs away.

100
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 He's like, "Oh, I fell asleep during the watch."

101
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,920
 The father dies, the two kids die, but the mother runs out of the house on fire.

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,520
 The other three, I guess, just out of a smoke inhalation or something like that.

103
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,840
 She runs out of the house on fire and the rich dude and his gang see this woman run out and

104
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,800
 as she's on fire, her hands begin to melt, like her fingers melt off and all that's left

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,240
 is her like nubby nubs and her palm.

106
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,600
 And the guys are like, "Ew, that's super gross.

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,640
 Obviously, this woman's dying and running you."

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,880
 But they go, "Dude, it looks like her hands have melted into donkey hooves and then the

109
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,440
 fire is melting her face and her skin is going bleh and it's getting all sluffy.

110
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,640
 It's like pouring oatmeal on a wall."

111
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,960
 It's just kind of coming off and they're like, "Oh, her hands look like donkey hooves, but

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,280
 look how her skin is melting off of her face.

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,640
 It looks like she's a donkey now."

114
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,720
 And I don't know what these guys were thinking.

115
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,560
 I don't know if they've never seen a donkey before, but as this woman runs out of the

116
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,120
 house and she's burning to death and she's melting, her skin sags like a donkey's head

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,560
 and her hands melt into the shape of donkey hooves and they run away.

118
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 So they run away.

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
 They don't help her.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
 They don't help her.

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
 Today, this bridge now has a name.

122
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,720
 It's called Donkey Lady Bridge.

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,160
 And it's, you know where Elm Creek, you know where Elm Creek is?

124
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,560
 Someone's living in this house right now.

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
 They're like, "Oh, this story happened here.

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,200
 In San Antonio, Texas, there's a creek called Elm Creek.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
 There's a bridge out there and it's called Donkey Lady Bridge.

128
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,840
 And this is supposedly haunted by the donkey lady.

129
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,240
 This is one of those interesting stories where, one, you have the story in and of itself,

130
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:00,640
 and two, very rarely, it does happen, but it's rare, where somebody who is completely innocent

131
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,800
 is cursed.

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720
 So we'll have stories where people get brutally murdered and their ghost continues to act

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 out that thing.

134
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
 And that's one thing.

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,560
 What I'm talking about, when we look at other bridges like Cry Baby Bridge, it's haunted

136
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,560
 by the guy who slaughtered his family then hung himself on the bridge.

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,800
 That's such a popular legend.

138
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,920
 We've actually covered it, but that legend is all over the world.

139
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,080
 We have Cry Baby Bridges.

140
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
 You have stories like that.

141
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,840
 You have stories about the billow-wack monster, the research scientist who was working on

142
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,320
 something and he's trying to make a human ram hybrid and like a horn of ram blew up

143
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,160
 in his face and he became that.

144
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,200
 These stories usually involve these people who haunt these legends, the circus freak

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,520
 that broke out of the train crash.

146
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,880
 I'll put all these episodes in the show notes, but generally it's a monster who's haunting

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,160
 this area, usually a bridge, that it was a monster or a human doing monstrous things.

148
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,440
 This one we have a, the only reason why she continues to haunt the area to this day is

149
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,920
 the fact that she got burned alive.

150
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,640
 She was not the bad guy at any point in the story.

151
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,080
 I guess if you're the rich kid you're like, "And kids!"

152
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,160
 Then guess what?

153
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,920
 All I did was punch their donkey a few times in the brain and someone threw a brick at

154
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 me.

155
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,040
 So she was cursed forever, but very rarely do innocent people become the monster that

156
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,200
 wanders the woods.

157
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
 Ghosts?

158
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
 Yes.

159
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
 Murder victims?

160
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
 Yes.

161
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
 La Lorna?

162
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
 Whatever her name is, Laoyna?

163
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,160
 I can't pronounce her right, but the wailing woman of the Mexican legend, she murdered

164
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,520
 her kids to get with a dude.

165
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,840
 And that's why she's cursed.

166
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,440
 She didn't live a happy life and worked three jobs to send her kids to college and then

167
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,680
 lived to the age of 88 surrounded by her loved ones.

168
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,920
 And now she's cursed to wander the world screaming.

169
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,680
 Generally the people in this position are evil in life.

170
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,320
 And it's a moral story.

171
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,520
 This is really creepy because this woman's only sin was loving her family so much to

172
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,480
 sleep in the same house with them when it was set on fire and defending her donkey.

173
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 Really really.

174
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,160
 That story adds a different creepiness to it.

175
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,560
 The moral of it is no matter how good you are in life you could still become one of these

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
 monstrosities.

177
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,120
 To this day people go out to this bridge and if you yell out "donkey lady" three times

178
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
 supposedly she jumps up onto the bridge and stuff like that.

179
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,240
 I mean this is one of those stories that would be easy to test.

180
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,880
 You can go do it for yourself and if you don't see her then it's the legend accurate.

181
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
 But still really cool.

182
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,680
 It'd be fun ghost hunt if anyone's in that area to go do.

183
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,880
 If you want to see a woman who looks like a donkey.

184
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,000
 And I'm wondering too how this story was crafted.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,040
 Was there someone with severe facial scarring burns in the area and the legend just grew

186
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
 from there.

187
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
 We've covered stories like that.

188
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,720
 Put those in the show notes where there was someone with a disfigured face and then the

189
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
 story of the bandage man came out of that but it was based on a real non-supernatural

190
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
 person.

191
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,680
 So who knows.

192
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,720
 Was there someone really burnt to death in this area?

193
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,480
 Was there someone who was disfigured in this area?

194
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
 Who knows.

195
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
 But a creepy story nonetheless no matter what you do no matter how good you are on earth

196
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,760
 even if you are saving animals you may still be cursed to walk it forever scaring teenagers

197
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
 when they yell out your name.

198
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,480
 Peter let's go ahead and break out the keys for a new vehicle I just invented.

199
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,440
 Since we're in a swamp of bog I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the hair

200
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
 hydrofoil.

201
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,520
 We're leaving behind this bog in San Antonio.

202
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,760
 We're headed all the way out to some dude's bedroom.

203
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
 [Horror sound]

204
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,920
 Well so we'll see if that vehicle ever comes out.

205
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,200
 People are looking up what's a hydrofoil.

206
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,520
 The only reason I know what it is because there was a GI Joe toy made out of it.

207
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,920
 Maybe it'll be the hair hovercraft next time.

208
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
 I don't know.

209
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,840
 Peter thanks for driving us to this dude's bedroom.

210
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,360
 This is a post online so we don't really have a name or location for this.

211
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,480
 This guy definitely doesn't want to give that information out.

212
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,280
 But it was interesting I was on the internet the other day and all the links are in the

213
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,200
 show notes so I was on the internet I was on a fitness website.

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,280
 Fitness board the other day right?

215
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,760
 And there was this guy and he had some questions about personal health and he has a concern

216
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,680
 he thinks he's watching too much pornography so we're sitting in his next bedroom he's

217
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,640
 questioning whether or not he's a porn addict and we're just kind of sitting back on his

218
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,600
 bed I'm sitting in recliner you're sitting on his bed you're like oh man he's sitting

219
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,960
 there and he goes listen I'm 30 years old and I just have some questions that are going

220
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:24,840
 on I masturbate five times a day and I've been doing that since the age of 10 and he's

221
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,120
 talking about that he's wondering if that is healthy he's wondering if that is healthy

222
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,520
 but he's wondering if that's healthy because a lot of times people don't talk about this

223
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,480
 stuff with their peers or with their mentors and things like that their coach or their

224
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,880
 minister or anything like that who an adult who can answer that question and go oh yeah

225
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,480
 no that's totally normal.

226
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,960
 So he's asking this question online he goes is that normal right I masturbate five times

227
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,280
 a day and I've done so since the age of 10 and then he goes quote I use large amounts

228
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:58,640
 of high quality curated hardcore pornography and he's wondering should I keep doing that

229
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,360
 should I keep doing this he goes I've thought about going cold turkey on it but just giving

230
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,120
 up the porn altogether but I don't have a girlfriend right now and he asked the question

231
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,580
 am I at risk of becoming a rapist if I try to stop as in you know stop watching the

232
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,360
 porn and he asked the question will my penis shrivel up and will I develop erectile dysfunction

233
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,800
 without the porn it was really interesting because a lot of people responded to this

234
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,520
 right away and they're like first off a lot of it was yeah dude that's pretty normal like

235
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,520
 don't worry about too much masturbation you're the one sitting on his bed you're like a Jason

236
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,320
 please can I get up I'm like uh-uh you're stuck people are kind of answering his questions

237
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,160
 say no it's totally normal as long as you're not like hurting your body as far as the masturbation

238
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,760
 goes don't worry about that but people did have a concern they were kind of making fun

239
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,160
 of this collection of highly curated pornography and he they're kind of the people who are

240
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,680
 responding to this are kind of concerned with this thing am I at risk of becoming a rapist

241
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,440
 if I try to stop if I stop watching this porn am I going to become a rapist and this is

242
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
 where it becomes really telling again this guy's approaching with a very honest personal

243
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
 question about his health and because he doesn't really probably have anyone else to talk to

244
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,000
 about this thing and the original poster will call him Tony I don't know if that's his real

245
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,400
 name but he goes I want to say when I talk about highly curated hardcore pornography

246
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,600
 I want to be really specific I prefer pornography where the women look like they're not enjoying

247
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:33,120
 it people are like wait what wait so basically you you are afraid you might become a rapist

248
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,160
 and you're watching porn where women you prefer porn where it looks like women are not enjoying

249
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,920
 it which is a roundabout way of saying you're watching porn of women who are getting raped

250
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,080
 he goes on to say listen I tried giving up porn before but what happened was when I went cold

251
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,560
 turkey like he had mentioned before he said his penis began to shrink and almost disappeared

252
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,320
 completely it's super interesting because again this was on a fitness board we're talking about

253
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,000
 personal health and we're talking about these real issues and now we're starting to see that this

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,720
 person Tony has that's important your penis doesn't shrink if you stop masturbating if you

255
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,280
 stop watching porn I mean it'll get bigger if you do those two things temporarily but it doesn't

256
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,000
 shrink permanently so at this point you feel like you're kind of talking to someone who one

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,880
 who watches a lot of pornography two prefers pornography where the women aren't enjoying it

258
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,640
 he's afraid he might rape women if he stops watching pornography and now he has the delusion

259
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:43,360
 that if he stops watching pornography his penis will disappear it's gone from a interesting

260
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,600
 and very normal question that people are shy to asking to I'm concerned about this person's well-being

261
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,880
 he then straight up says because people start saying you know because you're responding to other

262
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,280
 stuff where people are saying porn doesn't stop rape that's an old myth he goes no it does actually

263
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:11,280
 because for him he said quote porn does help stop rape as it's much easier to jack off to rape porn

264
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:18,640
 than to go out and do it and really we get to the end of it when he's been talking about this like

265
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,680
 remember this started should I stop watching pornography will it be okay fellow health nuts

266
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,200
 out there what happens now he's saying that it's just easier for me to watch rape porn than it

267
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,640
 is for me to rape women and the last post he left on this page was quote if a woman says no

268
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,400
 you know this is gonna you know this is just gonna be downhill from here so he goes on to say

269
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,360
 this quote if a woman says no then I can just masturbate to porn but if she says no and I'm

270
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:57,680
 not masturbating currently there's a real problem unquote I always think it's interesting we cover

271
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,160
 true crime on the show and obviously we encounter true crime all the time whether or not it's on a

272
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,720
 podcast or in the news or hopefully not in your own life but I always find it interesting when we

273
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:18,000
 can encounter true crime before it happens right this is a man who in short order right in short

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,680
 order goes from having a health issue and saying I don't know if I masturbate too much I don't know

275
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,640
 if I'm too over sexualized to I need to watch rape porn and I need to masturbate frequently because

276
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:38,320
 if I don't and I'm with a woman and she says no I'm going to rape her terrifying terrifying like

277
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,560
 this is the true crime story before the headline this is the true crime story before your loved one

278
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,280
 comes to you and goes you gotta help me something horrible happened to me last night very very

279
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,640
 creepy creepy encounter with somebody online and and yeah that's out there like obviously

280
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:06,960
 we hope this guy gets help I don't think the help is for him to continue to watching highly curated

281
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,320
 collections of pornography he obviously needs some therapy and the fact that he's imagining his

282
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:18,320
 penis shrinking and almost disappearing that is again that's not that's not how it works

283
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,560
 we've covered a lot of stories about people's penis is shrinking it's a mental epidemic over

284
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,240
 in Africa we've covered a ton of stories on that and um but it is a delusion but he's in the

285
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,680
 throes of this delusion he's addicted to hardcore rape pornography and he's trying to stop it and

286
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,360
 he's going if I stop it for too long I'm gonna rape somebody creepy very very terrifying story

287
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,680
 and hopefully that is the end of it right Peter let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the

288
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,840
 carpenter copter we're gonna leave behind this young man's bedroom and we are headed all the

289
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:03,360
 way out to sony headquarters in japan talk about a shift change talk about a mood change

290
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,920
 this is a conspiracy theory that I actually came up with a long time ago um I'm a I don't really

291
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,520
 talk about it much on the show I'm sure long time listeners have picked up on it people in my personal

292
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:20,880
 life I'm a huge video game guy I used to work and then come home and play video games until

293
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,320
 I had to go to bed it's I love video games I just don't have time to play them anymore and there's

294
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,520
 another reason why I don't play video games as much either they're not good anymore they're not good

295
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,920
 anymore but I'll explain why I'm not saying that as a boomer the video game industry is stagnant

296
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,880
 and I'm not talking about stagnant from a business perspective I'm gonna let me go ahead and get

297
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,800
 get started with this I believe that this is my thesis video games should be way more advanced

298
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:01,600
 than they are something or someone is holding them back on purpose this is what I mean

299
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:09,120
 Nintendo comes out right regular old Nintendo comes out I started off I had the Atari 2600

300
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,280
 back like an 87 and I had to sell that and to save a bunch of money to buy the Nintendo but

301
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,720
 it was worth it the difference between the games between the Atari 2600 and the games for the Nintendo

302
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,520
 groundbreaking one they they were in color right you could actually see what was going on it just

303
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,200
 wasn't a little pixel ET guy I had that game it wasn't that bad I had ET for the 2600 I had the

304
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
 Spider-Man game for Colecovision had all this stuff right many have Mario Brothers and you have

305
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,360
 the Legend of Zelda you have this big map this world where there's puzzles and you can get lost

306
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,480
 and then you move to the Super Nintendo I remember when the Super Nintendo came out we got it like

307
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,040
 within the first couple months of it coming out and I remember staying up all night and playing

308
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,040
 pilot wings pilot wings was a brand new game with mode seven so for the first time you had

309
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,640
 simulated 3d things would get start off smaller and get bigger as you were coming towards them

310
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,840
 you had games like pilot wings you had games like star fox you had games that you could not

311
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,600
 have done on the Nintendo it wouldn't have worked and this continues on when you have the N64 you

312
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,840
 have golden eye which a golden eye a shooter like that was something you would have never seen on a

313
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,080
 console before right you had it on the pc you had it like doom but golden eye opened that up to a

314
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,200
 brand new market now you could have a relatively cheap system not having this huge home computer

315
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480
 you could play a game like golden eye you had multiplayer you had first person shooter you

316
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,440
 had these realistic 3d environments then you moved to the ps2 and I know I'm jumping a bunch of systems

317
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,760
 there's Dreamcast and things like that but you guys will see why I'm doing this you had the ps2

318
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:55,200
 and I believe that the ps2 was the end of video game advancements it was this was the top of the

319
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,200
 line video game system because the ps2 was the last time you had video games you could not have

320
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,840
 had on any other system you had games like grand theft auto 3 an open world game you could argue

321
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:15,680
 zelda was open world it was technically go wherever but when you first played grand theft auto 3

322
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,720
 if you were of age nowadays it's a super old game but I remember I remember the very first time I

323
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,680
 played grand theft auto 3 and I realized I could do whatever I wanted I killed a cop and I ran around

324
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,920
 and I went into the warehouse district and I climbed the ladder and I sat on a rooftop and watched the

325
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:37,120
 sunset as the stars faded away not the stars in the sky the wanted stars it was a video game experience

326
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,960
 that I had never had before I was at my friend josh mohrmeyer's house I was playing it you started

327
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,400
 having super artistic games like shadow of the colossus fatal frame resident evil 4 this was

328
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,760
 this generation of games where you're like this game's amazing this game's amazing on so many

329
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,560
 different levels you could have a game like red faction where it's destructible environments and

330
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,440
 open world that was the red faction sequel I think it was but you had all of this stuff and this is

331
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:14,800
 my argument from the ps2 to now any game made on the ps5 other than graphical updates you could

332
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,440
 have had on the ps2 there has not been a major advancement in the gaming industry since the

333
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:30,400
 ps2 why I'm talking strictly about gameplay in fact graphics in a lot of ways are getting worse

334
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,280
 or they like to call it retro but grand theft I when I was playing grand theft auto 5 it was

335
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,200
 grand theft auto 3 just the graphics are better now there is better voice acting and the the

336
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,040
 it's the same game though the graphics are different so here's my problem why haven't

337
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:57,920
 games advanced in gameplay the only real advancement we've made since the ps2 era is battle royale

338
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,120
 games and all those are is grand theft auto 3 with multiple players it is an open world game

339
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,240
 battle royale games are from open world games that are spin offs they're from day z they're from h1z

340
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,080
 one they're from minecraft so even that entire genre really could have been replicated on the

341
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:26,080
 ps2 the games themselves stopped advancing multiplayer component sure it has this little

342
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,560
 widget or that little widget sure dlc sure but the games themselves the actual mechanics is what

343
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,560
 i'm talking about have not advanced since the ps2 why I was sitting in the chair I was prepping

344
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,360
 this story earlier today and I thought well Jason let's play devil's advocate maybe it's because

345
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,000
 there's no other way to go as I'm sitting in my chair I came up with two ideas one you have a video

346
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,600
 game that is tied into your real life so as you're playing the video game let's say it's a fatal frame

347
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,160
 type game you're investigating this mystery your phone rings in real life you're getting emails

348
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,720
 while you're playing the game from somebody going like don't go in there don't go in there

349
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,320
 and you're having to do it like you're solving a real life mystery and it's accessing your email

350
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,600
 in your phones and you're going to say I want to play a game with that it doesn't matter whether

351
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,200
 you want to play it I'm saying that would be a brand new genre of game imagine this imagine this

352
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,800
 you have a world building game that is updated automatically based on the news in the world

353
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,640
 you're playing a game and then all of a sudden the coronavirus comes so the game you have games

354
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,400
 that leech into the real life that would be groundbreaking why isn't anyone doing this

355
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,960
 that would be groundbreaking stuff the biggest game that's coming out right now is the guy

356
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,160
 player unknowns who came up with player knowns battleground he's now building the biggest map

357
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,120
 ever with trees that when you chop down they don't grow back you have to plan a city grown back

358
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,200
 that's ambitious right they talked about doing that with the fable game back on the xbox though

359
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,640
 why aren't games getting better is far they're just getting graphical updates I feel like I'm

360
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,280
 just ranting so I'm going to wrap this up real quick but that's my question the actual games we

361
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,800
 play could have been done back then you could not have what the ps2 you cannot have done a game that

362
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:19,200
 accesses all the technology in your home in the real world back then you cannot play a game that

363
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,760
 is constantly updating itself because it's connected to the largest repository of human

364
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,360
 knowledge in existence i.e. the internet and the gameplay could actually change in the game let's

365
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,120
 say you are building a world building game and you all of a sudden it there's russia invades

366
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,760
 ukraine and now it's a first-person shooter because you happen to be based in ukraine or whatever

367
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,440
 I'm able to just come up with ideas sitting in a chair with a belly full of chicken fried steak okay

368
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,960
 and I'm not even the smartest guy on this I'm a hobbyist and I don't even get to play video games

369
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,880
 as much who stop this is my theory I think someone is stopping these games from being developed

370
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,880
 I don't think it's a lack of artistry in the industry I don't think it's a lack of drive of

371
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,720
 trying to push to find the next thing I think this is my conspiracy theory that there is

372
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,800
 a group or a movement to prevent video games from getting too advanced because imagine if we

373
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,360
 did have a video game that tied into every aspect of your life like that I'm not talking about VR

374
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,240
 and you know to be fair VR the gameplay is different because your perspective is different but

375
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,280
 you're just swinging a sword and chopping people up it's still those four or five or ten genres

376
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,240
 whatever and even then VR has been around since the 90s too my conspiracy theory is somebody is

377
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,640
 stopping the development of video games from getting too advanced the question is why you can

378
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,480
 look at stuff like this the only thing I can think of is one we always hear stories about Iraq

379
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,440
 was like running some of their missile launchers with like 20 ps4s or whatever it was like they

380
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,000
 were everything north Korea was doing that the processing power of the normal video game system

381
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,200
 is so advanced now that you string enough of them together you can use it as a weapons platform

382
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,560
 it could be that they don't want super advanced technology in the hands of consumers that's possible

383
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:17,120
 it could be that there is a there is a level there is a final level not not figurative but

384
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,200
 video games can only get so advanced there could actually be a ceiling to that I don't I don't buy

385
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,400
 that though I don't buy that though because you could have stopped at mode seven you could have

386
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,760
 stopped at rotoscoping mortal combat stuff and you would never get to the cell shading animation

387
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,080
 that we have today but again that's just graphical stuff I don't want to get tied up in the graphics

388
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,480
 because I know a lot of people are going to point out graphical advances it looks more realistic

389
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,800
 I'm not talking about that it doesn't feel realistic at this point why why don't we have video games

390
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:54,080
 that blow our mind I think that there is a there is a real problem with having this is what my

391
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:01,040
 conspiracy theory is to to keep pushing the boundary and to keep inventing brand new types of games

392
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,320
 to do that you have to push the limits of the technology you have to build games before the

393
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,640
 technology has really been invented you have to craft the game and go I hope someone can build

394
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,960
 something to run this which they've kind of done with like crisis but again a lot of that was

395
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,040
 graphical updates I know I'm probably lost a bunch of listeners because I'm in the weeds of the nerd

396
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:25,120
 stuff but I think somebody is keeping video games from getting to advance and I think the

397
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,200
 reason why is that you would have to have such advanced hardware and the consumers would eat

398
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,160
 it up they'd pay for a brand new gaming experience I've gotten bored of all my first person shooters

399
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:40,240
 and all my platformers and all my simulation games and stuff like that a brand new experience could

400
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:49,040
 melt our brains I mean video games right now are already being built as just dopamine machines

401
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,120
 right they're constantly giving you a door fence or every little prize you get every

402
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,200
 time you break into a house and you find that brand new purple weapon that you think is going to

403
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,080
 win you the game in fortnight you get a little ping it's tacking into our hunting gathering aspect

404
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,120
 that's why fortnight's so popular it's both things that humans love to do hunt and gather

405
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,440
 and and that's a lobotomized a bunch of people to be fair I'm one of them when I play fortnight I

406
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:22,560
 really play fortnight but if a new game came out that is perfectly in tuned brand new genre

407
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,560
 perfectly in tune to the human psyche it could turn anyone who plays in it into a vegetable all

408
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:35,680
 they want to do is to play this game because it is so novel that humans are novel seeking creatures

409
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,520
 and you invent a game that is so novel it's so new you never would have thought that it could

410
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,600
 even have happened which is what grand theft auto 3 felt like you go this is something I'd see in a

411
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,560
 movie this huge city I can just walk around and all these people walking around with me

412
00:29:50,560 --> 00:30:00,160
 so that could be why it would just be too too good the other reason I have is for the longest time

413
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,320
 humans have been trying to create artificial intelligence we can go back to the stories of

414
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,600
 the golem being able to craft something humans being able to craft a life form stories of

415
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,160
 homunculi and things like that Pinocchio all the way up to AI trying to build robots and it is always

416
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,440
 this vast gulf there's always this thing that will never be able to do it will never be able to do

417
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,960
 it but I think it may be something that we may not be able to do consciously but I would bet money

418
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,600
 that we could do it accidentally I think if you really really tried you got the smartest people

419
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,800
 together and they're trying to figure out AI they can't get that spark of life right you're

420
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:51,120
 almost overthinking it but if you had 32 million consoles worldwide of this super complex computer

421
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,680
 it was built to be a toy and it's running these games that are unimaginable to us today

422
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,160
 could the spark of life happen in one of those it's the difference between a scientist getting

423
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,720
 a pool of primordial ooze and occasionally shooting electrical shocks in it and trying to

424
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,600
 figure out the right frequency and the right portion of the pool and what temperature the pool

425
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,360
 of ooze should be and doing all these tests and it never working and then on some other planet

426
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,440
 on the edge of cosmos a lightning strikes hits a primordial ooze and life begins

427
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,280
 I think it would happen easier on accident than it could on purpose because on purpose we're just

428
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,520
 adding too much of that human element error and doubt and fear will we get it wrong so maybe

429
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,440
 that's it maybe there is a group of people who know that if the technology does become too advanced

430
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,880
 it's going to spell the doom of humanity either through some sort of accidental AI awakening

431
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,320
 or just the dumbing down of humans and I'm not trash talking video games I love video games they

432
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,680
 are endorphin machines but I do enjoy them I'm not saying that if you play a video game you're

433
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,280
 dumb or anything like that but I'm what I am saying is if video games became more and more

434
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:08,160
 advanced if every generation of system if the ps3 played games you can never imagine on the ps2

435
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:14,480
 because the ps2 was playing games you could have never imagined on the n64 and if the ps4 was playing

436
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,080
 games you never could imagine on the ps3 and so on at this point we would be at a level of video

437
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:28,240
 games that would be incomprehensible to the people who played the nintendo a world where we are

438
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:36,000
 enslaved to entertainment really doesn't sound that bad to me a world where we work just enough

439
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 to pay our bills so we can go home and play this amazing virtual experience to me that doesn't sound

440
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:51,280
 so bad but for the growth of humanity you couldn't have an entire planet doing that and I think the

441
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,840
 people who don't play video games is because they haven't found the right video game for them

442
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:03,680
 they haven't found the right video game that speaks to them that is specifically tailored to them

443
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,560
 they could be a businessman making millions of dollars a year or a plumber a little plumber not

444
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,320
 mario right and they could go I don't like video games and you could go well you haven't played

445
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,080
 the right one and then they play they're like I don't like open world games I don't like first

446
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,840
 person shooters I don't like platformers and they just stop playing video games made them pick up a

447
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,200
 car driving one and they're like oh I kind of like cars but imagine if the games were getting so

448
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,760
 advanced that eventually there was a game genre for every single type of person a video game designed

449
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,000
 for everyone I feel like I'm ranting at this point and I almost don't have a way to wrap up the

450
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,280
 episode this is how conversations tend to go with me in real life but I honestly do feel

451
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:50,240
 that video games are not advancing not because they can't but because they won't someone or something

452
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,880
 is actually preventing video games for from becoming as advanced as they can be right now let alone 10

453
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,440
 20 years from now right now video games should be more advanced but someone has their foot on the

454
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,280
 break on purpose because they believe whether they're right or wrong they believe if video games

455
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:17,600
 become too advanced it could destroy the world is this conspiracy theory true who knows but

456
