1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
 A mysterious waterfall in England may actually give us clues to finally answering the question,

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,240
 is magic real?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,640
 Now we meet an old man whose peaceful retirement has been interrupted by invisible phantoms

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,200
 who live in his attic, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:29,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having not a great day, but I hope you guys are having

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
 a great day.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,440
 I've actually been lying to you the past two episodes and I said I was having a good day.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,240
 I was hoping I could get rid of it, my back is killing me.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,320
 I'm having some really bad back pain, back spasm, and it's so bad I've been having a

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,640
 heating pad on it for so long I burned my back with the heating pad.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,400
 Oh, oh so anyways, yeah sorry for lying to you for the past two days, you know trying

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,720
 to be chipper for you guys, but I'm in a lot of pain, I've got my muscle relaxers, and

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,240
 a bunch of Tylenol and Ibuprofen, I'm just trying to do my thing.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,280
 The only reason I say that is that if I do appear certified, I've been able to be normal

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,160
 Jason the past two episodes, but I'm a little more surly this episode, you'll understand

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,000
 why and if you're a new listener, sorry to drop all that stuff on you, but someone who

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,400
 I never drop on people, you like this subway?

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
 Someone who's always a stand up kind of guy, everyone give it up for our newest Patreon

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,200
 supporter, walking into Dead Rabbit Command, it's Grant Bonnet, whoo, giving him a big round

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,000
 of applause, he's walking in, and he brought a massage table with you, oh perfect, I'm

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,760
 gonna lay down on this massage table, we're gonna do the entire episode at Dead Rabbit

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
 Command.

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,760
 No, Grant, I'm gonna ultashi the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible, we're leaving behind

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,400
 Dead Rabbit Command, we're headed all the way out to Jolly Old England.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:01,440
 Grant, so hopefully you can fly us out on this Dead Rabbit Durgible, we're headed out to

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,800
 Narsboro, that's in North Yorkshire, England, and over in this area there's the River Nid,

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:20,760
 and we're walking down this trail, there's a bear trying to eat one, and by this area,

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,560
 there's this unique feature, it's basically like a little waterfall, so the water, I don't

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,720
 have to describe what a waterfall is, what this place is, is it's known as the Petrifying

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,520
 Well, it's a waterfall, I don't know why they don't call it the Petrifying Waterfall, but

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,880
 anyways, I'm not British, maybe it makes sense, there's a translation error between British

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,000
 English and real English.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,840
 So you have this waterfall and people would be bathing in it, but at a certain point,

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,360
 people figured out something else, so imagine every week you go there and you're like getting

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,640
 all this water on you, you're like, oh yeah, I feel just like so hard, I can't move my

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,320
 arms anymore, but that means it's working.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,480
 And while you're there you go, oh and I forgot, Lil' Lass Alice gave me this teddy bear and

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,600
 she said, take it with you, take it with you to the healing pond, my teddy bear has horrible

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,440
 back pain, and oh, I'll just leave the teddy bear here.

41
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:23,480
 When he comes back next week, the teddy bear is turning a stone, and this well, this waterfall

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,320
 actually does turn things to stone, this is very well known, I'm not making this up,

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,400
 this is not a muscle relaxer induced hallucination, what this is, once they discovered this, people

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,080
 stopped using it as a healing point, but the water is so heavy with minerals that if you

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:50,200
 leave something underneath this waterfall, it will become encrusted in a stone like casing.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,080
 Remember like that chocolate stuff that you put on your ice cream and it, hard shell ice

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,280
 cream, hot chocolate, chocolate, please don't record an episode when you're here, please

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
 don't record an episode when you're this sick, go rest.

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,560
 So you papaled, okay so let me try to explain this, this is totally real, the minerals come

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,080
 off of the waterfall and they infuse like say a bicycle, which is an actual example,

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,600
 someone brought their bicycle there, the bicycle now has a rocky exterior, so now you have

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,000
 a rock covered bicycle, you could also take teddy bears there, and now even I know this

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,960
 isn't making any sense, you can take teddy bears there, most people take teddy bears

54
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,320
 to this fountain, to this waterfall and you let the water drip all over the teddy bear

55
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,520
 and then the teddy bear turns the stone, and people like to use teddy bears because,

56
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,360
 let me back up here, okay so what happens is, oh my god, if this is your first episode,

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,240
 this is your first episode, I promise they're all not like this, go back and listen to yesterday's

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,960
 episode for my remaining listeners, imagine Kentucky Fried Chicken, right, you have a

59
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,400
 chicken and you dip it in flour and 11 herbs and spices and then you put it into the fryer

60
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,320
 and when you pull it out, it's still chicken with crust, the fried crust is on top of it,

61
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,320
 but once you eat the crust, the chicken inside remains chicken, so it's the same thing with

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,760
 this, it's a bicycle that gets 11 herbs and spices, 11 minerals pouring all over it and

63
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,800
 it creates this rocky exterior to it, now if you smash the rocky exterior, the bike is

64
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,400
 still there, the reason why people like to take teddy bears there, because they're porous,

65
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,640
 so both the inside and the outside, it basically becomes a statue instead of a teddy bear,

66
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:43,480
 this is what I think is so interesting about this, magic is real, 100% magic is real, this

67
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,160
 is magical, but you go Jason, no we actually know how this works, it's the minerals, it's

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,400
 very very high mineral content water, it's like rolling over limestone, it's basically,

69
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,720
 when I say that it turns into stone, you can turn a teddy bear into a statue in about 2-3

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,120
 months, it's the same technique how stalactites appear, how it's just those minerals growing,

71
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,160
 growing, growing and then you've got a big spike right over your head, it's the same

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,800
 thing, it does it very quickly, this is magic and you go no no no Jason, that's not magical

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,840
 because we know how to do that, that's science, that's science, but this was magical for hundreds

74
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,600
 and hundreds and hundreds of years, people considered this place magical, first they

75
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,800
 bathed in it and then once they realized it, then it turned things to stone, they stopped

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,680
 bathing in it, and it just started throwing teddy bears in the water, top hats and stuff

77
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,120
 like that, this is magic, this is magic right, you go no Jason, this is science, this is

78
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,640
 actually the definition of science, we know what causes it, it's a highly mineralized

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,360
 water, we know how it works, we can measure it, we can steady it, we can replicate it,

80
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,160
 but magic is, I believe that magic exists and magic is just things that science hasn't

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,640
 been able to figure out yet, the reason why I wanted to tell this story is because I do

82
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,960
 believe that magic exists and I believe that the only thing that separates like the world

83
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,840
 of the paranormal, I use that word all the time because it's a defining word but I believe

84
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,880
 that the paranormal is normal, we just can't explain it scientifically yet, we can't explain

85
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,960
 ghost scientifically or demon scientifically or telekinesis, remote viewing, I believe

86
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,480
 that someday we will be able to, personally I could care less whether or not other people

87
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,720
 believe in it, I'm never trying to prove this stuff but if back, let's say a hundred years

88
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:37,040
 ago someone tried telling you that they had access to all the written works of civilization

89
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,400
 at the touch of a button, in the palm of their hand if someone told you "I have access to

90
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,600
 all of the great writings" and a lot of lousy writings as well and not only that but I can

91
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,880
 instantly communicate with almost anyone on the planet, wherever they're at, you'd call

92
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:02,200
 that person a sorcerer but we all can do that right now, we have access to the internet,

93
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,720
 it's magical, it's magical and it's so interesting because what happens is we create something

94
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,680
 magical and have a scientific reason behind it and go "but this isn't magic, this is

95
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,280
 electrons moving around, this is cables put down that's able to send your voice across

96
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,600
 the planet, the planet!"

97
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,040
 It's not magical, that ghost that's magical, this isn't magical, we have science to prove

98
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:33,120
 this and like the petrifying waterfall, the scientific answer was always there, it was

99
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,520
 always there but until we learned to measure it, we called it magic and the second we were

100
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,520
 able to measure "oh this is how we measure the minerals and water" we go "oh but that's

101
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,400
 not magic, this is science but that other thing over there, that haunted bridge, now

102
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
 that's magic!"

103
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,840
 I honestly think that the paranormal is normal and it is so weird how much magical things

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,840
 we do, I walk to the bank, I don't even walk to the bank, I walk to a robot built into

105
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:11,560
 a wall and say "I want 80 dollars and money appears" that's magical, up until 1980s that

106
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,600
 was insane, you wouldn't ever think that would be possible, I could get money out of

107
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,840
 a brick, I get money out of a piece of plastic put inside a brick wall and if you went back

108
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,400
 500 years they'd be like "that's absolutely impossible, what you're talking about is black

109
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:33,320
 magic" I find stories like this super interesting, I do think that someday we'll look back and

110
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,720
 we'll be like "oh yeah ghosts, no we're totally able to communicate with the afterlife, it's

111
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,680
 normal, we know exactly how this happens because when you die you're actually this frequency

112
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,520
 and you're kind of floating around and we just never knew the right frequency to tune

113
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,800
 into but now we've built these devices, of course you can talk to people after the dead,

114
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,000
 I think that's just going to continue to happen, the paranormal is actually normal, we just

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,040
 don't have the tools to measure it yet and the second we do come up with some, when telepathy,

116
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,000
 if telepathy ever becomes a big thing they'll be like "oh yeah of course telepathy, duh,

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,160
 we just didn't know how to work it, we didn't know how to tune into the brain frequencies"

118
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,600
 we build devices that can look at your bones while your skin's still on them, oh that's

119
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,880
 not magical Jason, that's x-rays bouncing around your body, that's what will happen,

120
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,560
 the answer to faster than light travel, the answer to the law of attraction when we figure

121
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,600
 this stuff out as a society, as a civilization will go "I can't believe it took them so

122
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,240
 long to figure this out" for 500 years they didn't know what was going on with this well

123
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,120
 and then they figured it out that it has this minerals in the water, that's how it'll be

124
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,480
 with a lot of paranormal phenomenon, okay, Grant, I feel so sorry for Grant, Grant's

125
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,800
 in this weird ass episode, Grant let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonic

126
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,960
 copter, we are leaving behind this petrifying waterfall in England, we're headed all the

127
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:01,240
 way out to an old man's house, as we're flying out there I wanted to do a really quick dead

128
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,000
 rabbit recommend real quick, I saw this movie the other day called The Revenant, now not

129
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,360
 that Leonardo DiCaprio one where the bear rapes him, The Revenant is the story, this

130
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,920
 is one of those movies that you put in and you watch and you have no idea how it's going

131
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,840
 to end, at all, and I would say that every time there was an act change from act one

132
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,800
 to two and then two to three, those were shocking, I had no, when I put the movie in, I didn't

133
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,720
 even know what the movie was about, I do this all the time, I watch movies I have no idea

134
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,280
 what they're about, this movie is about a Revenant, a ghoul, basically this guy dies

135
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,160
 in the middle east, he's like in Afghanistan or something, he dies and when his body is

136
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,320
 shipped back to the United States, he comes back to life and he is a ghoul, a vampire,

137
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,840
 a zombie, he actually has won a bunch of awards for best vampire movie and best zombie movie

138
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,200
 because it's really hard to classify it and it is a movie about this guy who comes back

139
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,480
 and he's in the United States and he needs to drink human blood to survive and it's

140
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,360
 a comedy and as the movie progresses, it's actually a pretty funny comedy but as the

141
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,440
 movie progresses, it stops being funny and gets super dark and I have to say it's probably

142
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:23,760
 one of the most realistic vampire movies that I've seen because what's so fascinating about

143
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,400
 it is when he realizes he doesn't know what he is and eventually they have that part where

144
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,880
 they learn the rules like this is what a Revenant is, this is how a Revenant survives, this is

145
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,200
 how you kill a Revenant and none of the rules are right, none of them, they're told all

146
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,600
 this stuff and none of it's right and I thought that's actually how it would be, you would

147
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,320
 go to what you saw in movies and read in books but who's to say any of that's accurate, a

148
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,520
 lot of times in movies or shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Sinister, the rules

149
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,880
 are correct because in this universe this creature existed but in this movie, it's

150
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,480
 in the real world, there's no such thing as a Revenant in the real world so they're going

151
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,960
 off of myths and fables and movies they saw and none of the rules are right so that was

152
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,800
 a really cool detail as the movie was going on and then when the movie ended I watched

153
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,160
 the final scene and I had no clue this is how the movie was going to end, it's one of those

154
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,480
 movies that's such a fun journey and even the plot changes throughout the movie I go

155
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,000
 I guess we're watching this kind of movie now, really really good movie and the fact

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,240
 that it's called the Revenant probably makes it really hard to find but I'll put the trailer

157
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,360
 in the show notes, if you're looking for a cool horror or comedy I mean that's one way

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,160
 you could classify it but it actually moves through different genres throughout the film,

159
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,080
 the Revenant directed by Cary Pryor, really really good movie, Dead Rabbit recommends

160
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,720
 the Revenant.

161
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 Grant go ahead and keep flying this carbonic helicopter, we're flying over this neighborhood

162
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,120
 and you see that little house there, let's land, let's land a couple houses away because

163
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
 we don't want to scare this dude.

164
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,840
 I want to give a shout out to the bro magnan, that was the person who posted this story

165
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,240
 originally or brought it to my attention, I never heard of this story, this is a really

166
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,440
 really good one so thanks for putting that out there.

167
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,240
 So we're at this house and inside lives an elderly man, he's disabled, he's living on

168
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,320
 a fixed income, he's just trying to make ends meet, he's reaching the end of his life and

169
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,480
 that's really the time you want to be the most comfortable, when you're a kid you run

170
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,160
 out and you go on adventures, when you're middle age like myself your back goes out

171
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,000
 and you're stuck at home and then when you're elderly you just kind of want things to end

172
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,240
 peacefully and maybe not even for a while but just for things to work out.

173
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,720
 I hope you can tell him the sound of my voice this story is a little depressing.

174
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,480
 This elderly man, he's been leaving these reviews for amazon products that he's buying,

175
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,080
 he goes by the online handle of Samina, we're just going to call him Sam and he has these

176
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,240
 reviews and all of this is going to be in the show notes, you can look at him, he has

177
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,080
 these reviews, he's written about all these products, he's written around 22 reviews in

178
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:06,000
 total, pretty normal stuff, he reviewed a skillet that he bought, it could cook up to 12 eggs,

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,360
 that's a lot I'm glad that he's Gaston, he has to eat 12 eggs every morning, he's a huge

180
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,640
 fan of the movie The Pelican Brief, huge fan of the movie The Pelican Brief, I don't know

181
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,160
 why I said that twice, just for a fact because he's probably the only fan of that movie,

182
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,520
 my grandma was a huge fan of Primal Fear, my grandma, whenever Richard Geer would appear

183
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:33,400
 in anything, she would basically stop what we were watching and tell us about how good

184
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:39,720
 Primal Fear was, she loved that movie, but anyways on April 14th, 2021 though he left

185
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,320
 the review that's been getting a lot of attention, he left it for a product called Evernary Glass

186
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,520
 Break Alarms, it says anti-theft alarm obviously can also tell if your glass is broken because

187
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,640
 they fall on the ground, you're like oh they're not supposed to be there, someone must have

188
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,520
 broken in sight, they're these very very loud alarms of like 126 decibels, they come in a

189
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,080
 three pack, so if you've ever wanted to deafen people in three rooms this is the way to go,

190
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,880
 and Sam leaves a review for these alarms and he said he's placed them on five of his windows,

191
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,640
 now again it's a three pack so I'm wondering either he's really bad at math or he's bought

192
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,080
 15 of these and put three on each window and you're thinking why wouldn't Eldie, I mean

193
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,560
 obviously you know you should have an alarm system in your house, it's probably a good

194
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,360
 idea, but do you need 15 of them, 15 of them, so he's buying a lot of these things and he

195
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,320
 explains why, he leaves a review, he really likes these alarms, he gave them I think five

196
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,880
 stars, he goes I've tried a lot of alarms in my life, but these are the best, these are

197
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,600
 the best alarms, the other alarms I bought they would get thrown at me, they didn't go

198
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,160
 off, they didn't go off as they were flying through the air, but these alarms no one's

199
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,840
 thrown at me yet, you're like wait, wait, if someone's throwing an alarm at you they're

200
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,280
 already in your house, so when do you just see the guy dressed up in the ski mask and

201
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,760
 he's like I didn't bring a hammer, I didn't bring a weapon with me, but good thing these

202
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,280
 alarms are aerodynamic, how is this guy even breaking into the first place and throwing

203
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:22,520
 these alarms at you, well Sam answers it's the guys, come on, you know the guys, they

204
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,640
 also took my curtain rod once, I was walking around my house and they took a curtain rod

205
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,200
 out of the window and they smashed me in the head with it, those guys did that, they're

206
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:40,000
 like what in the world are you talking about, he says listen man this might sound crazy

207
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,200
 because the police don't believe me, no one believes me, but you'll believe me, I can

208
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,880
 tell, I can tell from that confused look on your face that you'll believe me, they're

209
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,880
 in my attic, they're living up in that crawl space up in my house and every night, every

210
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,760
 day really it seems like I don't even get to enjoy my life here in this house, they

211
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,240
 crawl out of the attic and they steal things from me, it's weird what they steal I understand

212
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,120
 it's really weird, like I have money and you'd think why don't they steal my money, what

213
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,440
 they steal is the little things, they'll steal food which of course people in the attic

214
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:29,240
 have to eat too, I get it, but they steal food, they steal my shoes, clothes, dog collars,

215
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,280
 what are they gonna do, they got a dog up there, see they're doing it just to drive

216
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:43,120
 me insane, but I'm not insane, I'm not insane, but I come home and I notice that these things

217
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,860
 are missing, I don't even know why I say come home, sometimes I go into one room and when

218
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,520
 I come back to my living room my drink is gone, so now I have to go to the fridge to

219
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,000
 get a new drink because the people in the attic stole the drink and I'm thinking I gotta

220
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,320
 keep them from walking around in my house so these ever-nary alarms are the best, they

221
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,820
 can't climb in and out of the windows anymore, I know from that look on your face you're

222
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,200
 wondering are people really invisible, well I guess I shouldn't say they're invisible

223
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,780
 as much as you can't see them, you're like isn't that the same thing, no no no no no

224
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,260
 no see, what happens is they have this clever thing where they will set off an alarm on

225
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,980
 the opposite side of my house and I will go to check out that alarm because I figured

226
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,100
 I finally caught one of these dudes and as I'm walking through the house to get to that

227
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,620
 alarm and shut off that alarm by the time I return to the room I was previously in something

228
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,300
 is gone, I can tell what it is right away for some reason they also like to steal one

229
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:48,240
 of a kind personalized items to myself, so it doesn't, they're not just stealing for

230
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,400
 function they're just stealing to steal and the cops don't believe me, I keep calling

231
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,240
 a place and they don't believe me, they think I'm crazy, they think I'm a crazy old man,

232
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,600
 they won't even come over to my pelican brief viewing party anymore, now I don't understand

233
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:13,700
 why they're doing this to me, I live in a high crime, I live in an area where there are a

234
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:22,420
 lot of drug deals around, I think maybe my house is being used as some drug dealers headquarters

235
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,780
 but I have no proof of that, I don't believe that insane theory what do I look like a madman

236
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,660
 but it's just something I can't think because here's the other thing, they're using advanced

237
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,600
 technology against me, they're using advanced technology against me, one I have fire alarms

238
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,880
 in my house as everyone should and my fire alarms have wifi built into them and they

239
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 are using the wifi in the fire alarms to affect other things in my house and I can't disconnect

240
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,480
 the fire alarms because then I could die in a fire so I just have to deal with it but

241
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,380
 I have to buy things that don't have any other internet activity like I have to disconnect

242
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,660
 my wifi before I go to bed from my computer because otherwise it will be sneaking around

243
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:13,540
 on my computer, they'll be erasing all of my high scores but it's not just that level

244
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,340
 of technology that they use, sometimes let's say their alarm trick doesn't fool me, let's

245
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,180
 say that the alarm goes off on the other side of the house and I say I'm not leaving, I'm

246
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:36,640
 gonna let that alarm play all night long, neighbors be damned, I'm not leaving the room, then

247
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:48,680
 they get mad, not throwing alarms at me mad, no, I'll start to see the stars, I'll be standing

248
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,380
 there in my living room and a million twinkling stars will appear, they'll flood my vision,

249
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:08,140
 they're so bright, I can barely see and then the wavy lines, my vision becomes bright and

250
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,180
 sparkling, the waves crash over my retinas, I can't make sense of anything, the whole

251
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:24,960
 world becomes a blur and they still grab something right out of the room I'm in, they blind me

252
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,840
 and sneak in, if I avoid the alarm trap, if I stay in the room they use advanced technology

253
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,640
 against my brain to blind me so they can run into the room and grab what they want and

254
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:44,000
 sometimes they'll just create holograms in front of me, things that can't exist I see

255
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:55,580
 in my house and the police call me crazy, I'm not crazy, there is someone in the attic,

256
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,460
 so why would they use such advanced technology against me, I know this isn't stuff you can

257
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:09,540
 buy on Amazon, why, I'm just an old man, I'm just an old disabled man, I don't have anything,

258
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,860
 I really don't have anything, why are they using this technology against me, why are

259
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:20,760
 they using this advanced borderline magical technology against me, I'm not crazy, I know

260
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,080
 all of this stuff that I put into this Amazon review which makes me sound like a lunatic

261
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:32,640
 but I'm not, he goes listen I know I'm not crazy because my dogs react to it too, but

262
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,760
 I can't say they're all bad, I guess they are all bad because they're blinding me and

263
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,840
 stealing my stuff but listen I'm on a fixed income, I can't afford to buy stuff and I

264
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:51,940
 remember I went to the store and I bought my dog a new dog collar and they took it and

265
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,820
 I remember I was walking around the house, I don't have any money, I'm pleading to them,

266
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:03,100
 please give me the dog collar back, I cannot go down to buy another one of these, just

267
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:10,020
 please, you can have the food, you can have the shoes, just give me the dog collar back

268
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:18,320
 and sure enough one day I walk into a room in my house and there's a bag sitting there

269
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,640
 and I open up the bag and inside that bag is the dog collar and it was not in a room

270
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,880
 when I bought that dog collar I never took it into that room, I left it in the living

271
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,280
 room let's say and it ended up in the bedroom, I never took it into the bedroom, please,

272
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,540
 members of Amazon reviews, please, realize I'm not insane, there's no other rational

273
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:50,660
 explanation for any of this, nobody believes me, my dogs sensitive, unfortunately dogs

274
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:56,300
 aren't good witnesses in court, the police don't believe me, nobody believes me and this

275
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:04,460
 is completely affecting my well-being, I'm an old man and I'm losing weight rapidly,

276
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:11,760
 I can't sleep, I can't eat, one because I'm so worried, two because they keep stealing

277
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,960
 my food and I don't want to go out and buy more food and then bring it in, put it in

278
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,000
 the fridge and then just to take it anyways, it's not that I just don't want to buy food,

279
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,880
 I don't want to buy anything because they take it but these alarms, these evanery glass

280
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:36,000
 break alarms seem to be stopping them at least from coming in through my windows, I like

281
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,400
 these alarms, five stars, here's a quote from the end of his review, quote, I don't

282
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,960
 know what to do, anyone has any suggestions please share them with me, my window alarms

283
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,560
 work great if their signal frequency isn't disrupted, they are very sensitive and loud,

284
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:03,800
 I highly recommend them for an intruder who doesn't set up camp in your home, best wishes

285
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:11,040
 for all, every detail that I read that was from that review, this review is like 3-4

286
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,720
 paragraphs long, it's huge and Sam lays out the story I just told you, holograms getting

287
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,960
 blinded by these guys, the alarms making them run from room to room, all of this stuff disappearing,

288
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,000
 insane, and the stuff falling on him, the people are thrown, this is one of those stories,

289
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,680
 obviously we're a paranormal podcast so we could easily go down the route, there is a

290
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,480
 poltergeist in his house, there is some sort of interdimensional mob boss living in his

291
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,800
 house, he's like in this reality I fight spider-man, but over here I just annoy an old man in his

292
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,240
 attic, which is all well and good, those are all fun, but this dude I think is suffering

293
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,200
 from some serious mental illness, it's so fascinating isn't it, that when we're reading

294
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,880
 the story his memory could be so shot that he's bringing this stuff home, misplacing

295
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,480
 it and then he assumes the people in the attic are doing that, and then he becomes so nervous

296
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,800
 and so worried about what are they going to steal today that he then is not clearly thinking

297
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,520
 and he's forgetting stuff even more because he's stressed about something else, there's

298
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,960
 also the possibility that his memory could be so shot that he's like oh they're not

299
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,960
 going to steal this, I better hide this and he hides it and then he forgets that he hid

300
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,720
 it, and I'm not even talking about dementia or Alzheimer's, like he's just so worked

301
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:40,640
 up, he's buzzing on such a high frequency that he's stealing his own stuff, you know

302
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,800
 that's one possibility, the other possibility is he does have some sort of mental illness,

303
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,120
 I'm not a psychiatrist, I will go ahead and diagnose this guy, he probably does have some

304
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,040
 sort of mental illness at this point, but it's so fascinating to me how the human brain

305
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:02,000
 works and how it doesn't work, because all of us lose stuff, all of us lose stuff from

306
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,960
 time to time, but this guy's losing his food, I've never misplaced food before, and how

307
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:17,440
 scary that would be, right, like how scary that would be to be elderly, not just elderly,

308
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,160
 you're going to live a fulfilling life, but to be elderly and alone in this house and

309
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,880
 think that this phenomenon is happening, he's not even talking about ghosts, right, he's

310
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,240
 not talking about some sort of paranormal phenomenon, he actually believes that people

311
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,880
 are in his attic and he doesn't specifically say, I was reading from pretty much my notes

312
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,480
 from his Amazon review, he doesn't specifically say, but what I think the implication is,

313
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,680
 is they don't live in his attic all the time, like that's a base that they sneak in and

314
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,720
 out of his house, that's why he has the alarms on the windows to keep them from sneaking

315
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,480
 back in once they've left, I think that's kind of the implication there, but he doesn't

316
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,280
 actually say that, and that would, that's still insane, right, that's still so bizarre

317
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,680
 to think that, but, so it's not like a haunted house is kind of what I'm getting at, like

318
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,480
 most people go, oh no, my house is only haunted at night during the day, the ghost roams the

319
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,000
 neighborhood and haunts the local 7-Eleven, like the house itself is haunted, he's not

320
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,560
 looking at this as a haunting or some sort of interdimensional or aliens or anything

321
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,760
 like this, he thinks it's biological humans that are using his house and have accessed

322
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,520
 all this technology and they're tormenting him, it's like gangstalking home edition,

323
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,520
 right, this is basically the home version, the board game of the gangstalking world,

324
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,680
 where they're actually in his house and he's there, but how terrifying would that be to

325
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,080
 suffer from this type of mental distress, and you're calling the police and you know

326
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,880
 the police dread seeing that phone number pop up, they're like, oh no this guy again,

327
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,120
 because I'm sure he's a kindly old man, right, I'm sure when that officer picks up the phone,

328
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,400
 and he's talking to this guy on the one hand, the officer is reminded of their own grandpa,

329
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,760
 right, their own uncle who was elderly and lived alone, oh yeah, they gotta be nice to

330
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,480
 the old guy, they know what it's like, we're gonna be old someday, and at the same time

331
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,560
 they know he's off his rocker, so you have to balance those two things, you just can't

332
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,760
 keep sending patrol units out there because they remind you of Paw Paw, there's bunch

333
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,560
 of gangland shootings across the street and they're like, well we wanted to go cheer this

334
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:27,800
 dude up, it's scary, but in his world, see, the police just don't care, nobody believes

335
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:34,400
 him, he's reviewing a product on Amazon talking about how much he loves these alarms, and

336
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,840
 he's like, can anyone help me?

337
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,840
 Not knowing that you can't respond to stuff on Amazon, and he probably was checking the

338
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,120
 review a couple times waiting to see someone with some advice and no one was ever able

339
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,520
 to reach out to him.

340
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,480
 Well I guess nobody really cares, old man, old crazy man.

341
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,000
 Time to watch the Pelican Brief again.

342
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,120
 It's weird too because when you look at all the reviews they're all so normal, like I

343
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,800
 almost was expecting this to be an ARG when I first saw it, or just like an obvious proof

344
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,600
 of like just a long term schizophrenia, no, all of the reviews are normal except for this

345
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
 one.

346
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,680
 Which makes it even sadder, right?

347
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,160
 So this guy isn't like completely insane, he may never be completely insane, this may

348
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,920
 be the limit of it, but whatever this mental distress is, it's driving him nuts, it's

349
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,800
 driving him to an early grave, he can't eat, he can't sleep, because he thinks invisible

350
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:40,960
 people or people he can't see, real people, are doing these things to him.

351
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,520
 And then the thing about them giving back the dog collar, what a weird detail, right?

352
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,640
 If this stuff just constantly kept disappearing, then you could say well he must be losing

353
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,000
 it or never bought it in the first place and his memory is just not right, but the fact

354
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,200
 that they brought it back, and again you could say no he put it in the bag and took it in

355
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,920
 another room and forgot about it and all that stuff, but the way he tells it, he loses the

356
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,760
 dog, or the dog collar is stolen, he asks for it back and then it appears in another

357
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,840
 room he wasn't in in the bag, like if that part is true, that does make you start to

358
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,120
 think is there a biological or paranormal answer for this.

359
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,120
 This is one of those stories where the creepier answer is not the paranormal answer, right?

360
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,720
 I mean if it was a ghost doing all this stuff he could get an exorcist, he could move, he

361
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,800
 could do this, he could do that, he could take care of it, right?

362
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,760
 But if it's a man in mental distress and he doesn't have anyone to take care of him or

363
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:43,200
 anyone to tell him hey you need to get this, you need to go see a professional, that's

364
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,400
 way sadder, it's a lot harder to fix.

365
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,800
 I hope this is a ghost story, I really really do hope this is a ghost story, because otherwise

366
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:03,520
 it's the story of an old man dying in his house, but not just dying in his house, he's

367
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:15,400
 dying and he's worried, he's dying and he's fearful, he's dying and he is so alone in

368
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,120
 the world.

369
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:29,440
 In his world the only place he could tell this story was in the review section on Amazon.
