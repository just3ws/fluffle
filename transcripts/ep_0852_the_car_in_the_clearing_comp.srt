1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140
 When a man tries to expose government corruption, he learns very quickly, "Trust no one."

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,420
 And then we meet a young man out for a stroll in the mountains of Georgia.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,060
 He thinks he's going to take a nice leisurely walk and enjoy the view.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,740
 He has no idea what he's about to view is the impossible, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:32,540
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,460
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,900
 I'm your host, Jason Garminer. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,900
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,060
 Let's go ahead and introduce today's Patreon and walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,800
 I don't know why I said that, like it's a toddler or something.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,500
 Come here, come here, come in for today's Patreon supporter.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,180
 Give it up for Owen Kaufman.

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,180
 Woo!

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,580
 Koochie koochie koo!

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,820
 Pinch those cheeks.

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,460
 Owen, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,580
 If you guys will get a booster seat for you.

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,980
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,980
 Just help spread the word about this show that really, really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,180
 Owen Kaufman, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,780
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,700
 We're going to go all the way out to Washington, D.C.

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,660
 [Distorted snoring]

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,420
 Nicely, really flight all the way out there.

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,900
 Owen actually has some of those big old plastic baby keys where the one's flying the Durgible

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,400
 while he's in his playpen.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,140
 I don't know, I keep going hard on this guy.

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,980
 I don't know, maybe it's an actual baby.

29
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,980
 Hope not.

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,820
 Owen, I'm sure you're a big boy.

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,540
 You're a big boy, you are, yes.

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,700
 Owen, go ahead and land this Dead Rabbit Durgible here in Washington, D.C.

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,980
 This story popped up while I was on my break and I've been absolutely fascinated by the

34
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,340
 whole time this is going on.

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,220
 What happened if you guys aren't following the news?

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,300
 There's this U.S. Representative named Madison Cawthorne.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,580
 They say he's the youngest member of Congress ever, like no one's ever been elected at his

38
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,580
 age.

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,020
 He's 26 now, but when he was elected he was the youngest, and we're talking ever, right?

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,020
 Even like in Abraham Lincoln's days they weren't this young.

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,300
 He's a Republican Representative from North Carolina and what's going on is he recently

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:22,300
 did an interview with a podcast called The Warrior Poet Society and what he said on this

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,220
 podcast has turned D.C. into a feeding frenzy.

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,660
 Everyone wants to take a bite out of this dude now.

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,740
 What happened was on The Warrior Poet Society podcast they asked him, "Hey, how much is

46
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,540
 real life D.C. Washington politics like the Kevin Spacey show House of Cards?"

47
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,780
 Which had a bunch of like back dealings and like bribery and stuff like that.

48
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,860
 And Kevin Spacey was in it, so of course it was super gross.

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,100
 And what he says is this in a nutshell, "The sexual perversion in Washington, D.C. would

50
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
 make your head spin."

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,500
 Maybe that's your kink.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 Maybe you love seeing head spin, but the sexual perversion that goes on in Washington, D.C.

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,900
 is out of control.

54
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,420
 Now that in and of itself, no one would be shocked by that statement.

55
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,140
 I don't think anyone would be shocked by that statement because powerful people tend

56
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,900
 to be super gross.

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,540
 You get bored easily, right?

58
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,820
 You can do whatever you want with your money and so you want to start doing stuff that

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,500
 normal people can't.

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,540
 Powerful people tend to be super gross people.

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,140
 And he goes, those are my words, not his, right?

62
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,340
 But he says, "The sexual perversion that goes on in Washington, D.C. is astounding."

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,500
 He said, "Listen, there's been a lot of people I've looked up to in politics.

64
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,340
 I've followed politics all my life and I'm hanging out with these people and I'm actually

65
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
 super young, right?

66
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,180
 Youngest member of Congress ever.

67
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,780
 The average age of these politicians are 60, 70 years old and I'm getting invited to

68
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,340
 orgies."

69
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,660
 And they're super gross, right?

70
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
 That's super gross.

71
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,060
 But not only that, he goes, "There are people out there that have a really strong, don't

72
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
 say no."

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,380
 No, no, that's not, that's the drug dealer saying, "Just say no."

74
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,340
 Just say no is the actual thing.

75
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,340
 Just say no to drugs.

76
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,940
 He goes, "There are people who are always fighting the war on drugs and I've seen them

77
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,180
 do cocaine, a bump of cocaine right in front of me."

78
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,660
 He goes, "This is wild.

79
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,940
 These are people that I've looked up to my entire life, inviting me to orgies and doing

80
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
 cocaine."

81
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,700
 Now, the statement, what's interesting is someone tells me that, I go, "Yeah, I can

82
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,740
 see a bunch of powerful people wanting to bang each other and stuff like that."

83
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,260
 I don't know if they have crutches on each other.

84
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,260
 They're like, "Ooh, that senator from Maryland is so hot."

85
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,860
 I don't know if it's that, I think, but they are having these orgies and they're doing

86
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,100
 this cocaine.

87
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,700
 Maybe at the same time, I assume at the same time, right?

88
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,060
 I actually had a good friend of mine.

89
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
 She went to an orgy.

90
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
 This was years ago.

91
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,140
 She went to an orgy and she told me, "Don't ever go to an orgy.

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
 Don't ever do an orgy, Jason."

93
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,940
 Of course, that has to follow a question.

94
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,440
 Why not?

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,300
 She goes, "This is super interesting.

96
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,220
 She went to an orgy in downtown Sacramento.

97
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,620
 It was like a bar after hours and it was like maybe like 40 people."

98
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,540
 She said, I never thought of this before.

99
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,020
 She said, "The smell."

100
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,140
 She goes within like 10, 20 minutes.

101
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,580
 The smell, the room became so smelly that she wanted to vomit.

102
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,140
 She said it was super disgusting.

103
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,140
 It was so gross.

104
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,420
 She felt so dirty afterwards.

105
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,420
 Super gross.

106
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,060
 Not like the good kind of dirty either.

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,860
 The I've smelled 40 people's bodily fluids trapped in a room.

108
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,260
 Bars aren't the super most clean place to begin with.

109
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,860
 So bars, you have all that smell and then you have 40 people banging each other.

110
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,820
 She said it was super gross.

111
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,500
 Now imagine those were like people in their 20s and 30s in this orgy and now magnifying

112
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,380
 the smell by mumra levels.

113
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,620
 60s, 70s, you're basically just like a desiccated corpse banging each other.

114
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,540
 Now to all of my listeners in their 60s and 70s, I wasn't talking about you.

115
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,180
 You look very young and fit.

116
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,580
 Have you been working out?

117
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,940
 For these dudes in Washington, I don't think I'd want to have sex with a politician to

118
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,220
 begin with, but imagine having an orgy with politicians.

119
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
 Gross.

120
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,740
 So anyways, Madison Cawthorne.

121
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,580
 Madison Cawthorne wasn't going on about how disgusting his fellow senators and representatives

122
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
 were.

123
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,380
 The problem with this statement that he made, again, that's not mind blowing, right?

124
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,620
 I think everyone would go, "Yeah, I imagine there were DC orgies."

125
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
 Or maybe not.

126
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,060
 Maybe you were not as perverted as I am, but a bunch of old people rubbing up against each

127
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,260
 other, their wrinkles, like perfectly matching into other people's wrinkles.

128
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,980
 You complete me.

129
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,740
 Every fold of their skin is perfectly...

130
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,740
 They've become one.

131
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,220
 It's like a ying-yang symbol.

132
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,180
 A ying-yang symbol of wrinkles.

133
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,340
 But nothing good has come out of this for Madison Cawthorne.

134
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
 What happened?

135
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
 This is very interesting.

136
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,140
 So he makes this statement, "Washington goes nuts."

137
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,140
 And here's why.

138
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,940
 A normal person, this totally makes sense to them that this is going on.

139
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,540
 But within Washington, this was a Republican going after other Republicans.

140
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,460
 He doesn't specifically say that, but he goes, "These are people I looked up to all my life,

141
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,580
 inviting me to orgies."

142
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:16,260
 And because he didn't name names, people have been getting phone calls from their constituents

143
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,060
 for the past couple weeks saying, "Are you the one having the orgies?"

144
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,260
 They're like, "No, for the last time I haven't been invited to an orgy."

145
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,220
 As the senators crying, he's like, "Oh, I'm the only person who doesn't get invited to

146
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
 the orgies."

147
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,460
 And every time a constituent calls in to ask, he's reminded of that, "Oh, my secret shame.

148
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,100
 60 people don't want to have sex with me."

149
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,860
 He goes, I was reading all these articles and they're like, basically he accused anonymous

150
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,420
 members of the Republican Party.

151
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,380
 So they've been getting constant calls and letters saying, "Are you part of this orgie

152
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
 underground?"

153
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,300
 And these senators and these representatives have to say, "No, no, I'm not.

154
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
 I'm not.

155
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
 They're having an orgy.

156
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
 They're writing a letter.

157
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
 The handwriting's all bumpy."

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
 They're like trying.

159
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,380
 "You give me at least five seconds of indiscent sentence."

160
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,260
 And then they've said spouses, right?

161
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,300
 These people's wives and husbands have been like, "Hey, this guy said this on this pot

162
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
 because this is huge news going around D.C."

163
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,340
 And it's so funny because politicians are constantly saying stupid stuff, saying just

164
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,820
 stupid nitwit stuff.

165
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,340
 And it doesn't blow up like this.

166
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,700
 CNN actually had a really interesting article by Clint Clizilla and he said, "The reason

167
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,460
 why this is such a big story because politicians always say dumb stuff.

168
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,980
 Politicians are not smart people.

169
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,460
 They want a popularity contest in their neighborhood and they go to D.C.

170
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,580
 That's all it is.

171
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,120
 Politicians are not intelligent people.

172
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,140
 They may know about politics, but other than that, they're dumb as a clay brick in a hot

173
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,220
 summer sun.

174
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,540
 They're idiots.

175
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,260
 So they're constantly saying dumb stuff.

176
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,380
 So why is this guy being singled out?

177
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,420
 It's because he won't name names.

178
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,260
 He's not saying specifically who it is.

179
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,540
 So everyone's a suspect as part of this cocaine-fueled orgy subculture.

180
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,580
 So people have come out and said, "Name names, dude.

181
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,620
 Tell exactly who you're talking about."

182
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,620
 And then other people are like, "Don't name names because here's the problem."

183
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,260
 If he's lying, if he's making the story up and he's pressured to name names, those politicians

184
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,020
 will always be besmirched.

185
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,380
 They'll always be considered part of this orgy thing even if he's just making it up.

186
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,660
 But as long as he doesn't name names than anyone suspects, it's a super weird thing that's

187
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
 going on.

188
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
 This is currently going on.

189
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,220
 He's most likely going to lose his seat.

190
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,300
 I believe that this is most likely true.

191
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,660
 To the point that other senators, the House Representative, the House Minority Leader,

192
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,940
 the Leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, he came forward and goes,

193
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,900
 "Listen, guys, I want to clear the air.

194
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,300
 Madison Cawthorne, talk to me privately.

195
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
 There's no record of this.

196
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,340
 I don't have a recording or no notes."

197
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,380
 But he told me privately he made it all up.

198
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:57,460
 And he said the person he saw doing cocaine was 100 yards away in a parking structure.

199
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,940
 So don't worry, everyone.

200
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,420
 Don't worry news media.

201
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,580
 He made it up.

202
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,500
 And that story ran for about a day or two and then Madison Cawthorne came forward and

203
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,660
 said, "No."

204
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,620
 He said, "Corruption and unethical activities exist in Washington.

205
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,100
 It's an indisputable fact.

206
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,220
 If you don't think that's true, you've not witnessed the swamp."

207
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,580
 Which was an old Trump term about just the grossness and the malaise and the corruption

208
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,140
 of Washington, D.C.

209
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,180
 And then he says this, and this is why I wanted to cover it one, because it really falls into

210
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,660
 that conspiracy realm, right?

211
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,100
 Where a guy is saying this stuff is going on.

212
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,300
 He said it very nonchalantly, and it's really shaken up the political power structure in

213
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
 Washington.

214
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,220
 But then he also says this, and this is something that we see a lot in conspiracy theory culture.

215
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,260
 This is what he tweeted out, quote, "Compromising activities occur because when other people

216
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,420
 can place you in a compromising position, they control you."

217
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,740
 Unquote.

218
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,780
 That has been a trope in conspiracy theories as long as probably governments existed.

219
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,700
 I've heard this for a long time.

220
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
 Don't know how true this is.

221
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,260
 But I've heard that when you get elected, this is super gross, but when you get elected

222
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:16,900
 to a high level of office, they, whoever they are, CIA or foreign intelligence, agency,

223
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,820
 something like that, KGB, whatever, or just the swamp, right?

224
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,300
 Just the inner workings of D.C.

225
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,220
 When you become a high level politician, they say, "This is so gross.

226
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,780
 I don't need to talk about this.

227
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,540
 I have stuff in the podcast."

228
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,780
 They say, "Here is a young child.

229
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
 Have sex with them."

230
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,660
 And you'd be like, "No, that's super gross.

231
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,140
 I'm not going to do that."

232
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,140
 And then they go, "Well, if you're an understanding citizen, that was a test.

233
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
 That was a test."

234
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,780
 What they do is they say, "If you have sex with a kid, now we have evidence that you're

235
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,700
 a big old pervo, so you'll do whatever we say because we'll expose it.

236
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,900
 But if you don't have sex with a kid, we're just going to say it anyways."

237
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,660
 Which I would still be like, "Okay, make it up.

238
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
 I don't care."

239
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,100
 It's not true.

240
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,340
 But I've heard of that as a thing.

241
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,420
 Sometimes they'd knock you out, they'd give you a drink and you'd fall asleep and then

242
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,820
 you'd wake up next to the kid.

243
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,660
 And there'd be people taking pictures and they're like, "Great, we have another senator

244
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,660
 in our pocket.

245
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
 You're going to vote for all this stuff."

246
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,020
 I don't know how true that.

247
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,020
 That sounds like super extreme.

248
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,500
 I don't think you have to go to those extremes.

249
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,100
 You could just be like, "We'll shoot your family if you don't vote for that," which

250
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,220
 is also super extreme too, right?

251
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,380
 But I've heard that.

252
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,100
 That's an old conspiracy theory trope that they come to you and they put you in a compromising

253
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
 position.

254
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,900
 They offer, "Hey, do you want to do this?

255
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,100
 Do you want to steal this gold from Fort Knox?

256
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,060
 Or we're just going to put you in a drawing with the Beagle Boys breaking into Fort Knox,

257
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,060
 stealing gold.

258
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,140
 You can do either one, but we're going to have you in our pocket."

259
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,660
 So this idea of compromising photos, compromising information.

260
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,940
 Because politicians, again, they're nitwits who want to be popular.

261
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,100
 There's always been that old thing.

262
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,660
 Politicians are people too ugly to make it in Hollywood.

263
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,700
 That's an old joke.

264
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,740
 I definitely think they have that need for fame and popularity.

265
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
 Not all of them.

266
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,900
 I'm sure some of them are good.

267
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,220
 But for the most part, I think they've won a popularity contest in their neighborhood

268
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,700
 and now they're in the national stage.

269
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,980
 It would be like if you all of a sudden had a national pulpit, right?

270
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,420
 You could talk about stuff.

271
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,460
 And that's what this Madison Cawthorne is doing.

272
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,900
 But I think most of them instantly get churned into the same hamburger meat that the machine's

273
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,620
 been churning out for the past 250 years.

274
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,060
 And if you go against the grain, if you add a little spice to that meatloaf, they churn

275
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,340
 you a little bit more.

276
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,220
 And then, see nowadays, like Madison Cawthorne, this story would have never gotten out 30

277
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
 years ago.

278
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,180
 It's because this guy's tweeting it and it's going through podcasts and stuff like that.

279
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,900
 This information, they would have just called it in the New York Times and say, "Nope, you're

280
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,260
 not running the article.

281
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,740
 Run a retraction."

282
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,140
 But now you can tweet and do all this stuff.

283
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,140
 So it's out there.

284
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,140
 He's standing by his story.

285
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,740
 The Republicans are getting you ready to primary him.

286
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,780
 He's up for election, I think, in November.

287
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,180
 And his own party is saying, "We are not going to run you as the candidate.

288
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,340
 We're going to run people against you."

289
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,740
 So does that mean that what he's telling is true?

290
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,660
 I mean, in the world of conspiracy theory, he's not saying...

291
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,660
 I just think in the world of human nature, forget conspiracy theory.

292
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,100
 If a bunch of consenting adults have an anorgy, it may be super gross and smelly.

293
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,260
 It's not against the law.

294
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,980
 I hate people who are anti-drug and do drugs themselves, but that happens too.

295
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,100
 Yeah, fascinating.

296
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,700
 Has he exposed the corruption?

297
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,220
 Really, corruption we already knew, right?

298
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,260
 None of this is shocking, but they're coming after this dude hard.

299
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,180
 And as far as the conspiracy lore goes, this is true.

300
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,900
 But let's leave behind this orgy of elderly people.

301
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
 Oh, and...

302
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
 Oh, and confidence.

303
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,700
 Oh, and confidence throwing up in the corner.

304
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,260
 Oh, and let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbon helicopter.

305
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
 Let's get out of here.

306
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,100
 We're leaving behind Washington, D.C.

307
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,220
 We are headed all the way out to Georgia.

308
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,820
 [imitates gunfire]

309
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,180
 I want to get a little meta here for a second, man.

310
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
 I don't...

311
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,620
 Yesterday's episode was really rough, and I think some of you guys, some of the long

312
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,620
 time listeners may have realized I seemed a little bit off my game.

313
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
 Maybe not.

314
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,060
 I judge the show very harshly, you know, when you create something yourself.

315
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,780
 But man, I had a really rough weekend.

316
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,900
 I was getting my stories ready, and I found this awesome story on the Explore.

317
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,340
 They were talking about weird stories that come out of Georgia.

318
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,020
 And I was like, "Oh, that'll be cool.

319
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,700
 I love these threads."

320
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,140
 Packed my computer up, went down to a local coffee shop, and I didn't have the Wi-Fi password.

321
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
 So I was like, "Whatever."

322
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,900
 I had copying pasted this story into my Word document, and I was looking at it from there.

323
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,980
 And I read this awesome story about this chemical plant leak, and there was this psychiatrist

324
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,740
 that worked for the federal government.

325
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,300
 He was sent out to Georgia to meet these guys who got caught in this chemical leak and find

326
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,900
 out why one of them died.

327
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,100
 And it turns out there was a giant wasp with the slug's body.

328
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,900
 And I was like, "Dude, this story's dope."

329
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,020
 And then I got my internet working, and I found out it was totally fake.

330
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,300
 It was so fake.

331
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,740
 I was so mad.

332
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,420
 I spent so much time typing it out, and I was thinking about, "Oh, dude, all the sound

333
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,340
 effects and stuff like that."

334
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,060
 When you shot it, it sounded like nails on a chalkboard and a vasovola playing at the

335
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
 same time.

336
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,180
 You're like, "Oh, I'm so glad you didn't do that sound effects."

337
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:34,260
 But anyway, so I was super excited, and because I couldn't actually view the webpage, because

338
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,580
 the internet didn't work, I was just going off the notes that I copied and pasted.

339
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,700
 At the end of my notes, it said, "Here's a drawing of the wasp monster."

340
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,460
 But I couldn't see what it was, because I didn't have internet.

341
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,300
 And then I got the internet, came back home, got on my wife's picture from a Japanese comic

342
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
 book.

343
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
 I'm like, "Damn it!

344
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,780
 This is totally fake."

345
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,620
 And people kept a-inging them on and be like, "Oh, tell us more stories."

346
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,260
 And then he says, "Yeah, one time, apparently the psychiatrist has had more ghost adventures

347
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,220
 than the brothers from Supernatural.

348
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,820
 He goes, "One time I was in the Okifanoki swamp, and this guy told me about a haunted

349
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,540
 pirate sword, and this kid pulled the sword out of the swamp, and then the ghost possessed

350
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
 them."

351
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,660
 I'm like, "Dad, did it happen, man?

352
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,820
 I was so mad.

353
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:26,420
 I was so mad, because I spent so much time typing up my notes on the slug wasp story,

354
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,660
 and it was really going to be the story I started the season off with."

355
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,140
 And then he's like, "And then one time, I didn't cover this case, but my buddy did."

356
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,140
 I'm like, "Why at this point?

357
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,620
 I was just being a masochist.

358
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,340
 I already was like, 'Oh, man, I wasted so much time typing up that stupid wasp story,

359
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,700
 typing up the notes."

360
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,020
 He goes, "My buddy had a case."

361
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,100
 Apparently this is a thing where the government sends out psychiatrists around the country

362
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,380
 where he went to a swamp or somewhere.

363
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
 He went to a senator's mansion.

364
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,020
 There's an orgy going on.

365
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,660
 He's like, "Excuse me."

366
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,220
 Apparently this senator killed a witch or had some local goons kill a witch.

367
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,140
 This wasn't on a creepypasta page, right?

368
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,820
 These were supposed to be true.

369
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,060
 And the witch was actually like a possum, and then like a possum breaks into their house

370
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
 and has human teeth.

371
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,500
 I was, and so here's the thing.

372
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,900
 Like, the first story was so good, dude.

373
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,660
 I don't ruin it.

374
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,940
 I mean, here's the thing.

375
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,380
 It's so funny because I thought the first story, even though it involved, even though

376
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,860
 it involved, you're like, "Jason, why is a giant wasp with a slug body more believable

377
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:36,260
 than a possum with human teeth and a plate of spaghetti that turned into possum tails?"

378
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
 Here's the thing.

379
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
 This is so interesting.

380
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,700
 If you only, I have a couple really good ghost stories, anecdotes that happened to me,

381
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,540
 and I think it's possible to have more than one good ghost story or more than one good

382
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,060
 paranormal story.

383
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:57,460
 But one of the key ways you can tell if someone's making it up is if all the stories they're

384
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,620
 telling have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

385
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,300
 Because in reality, there's a lot of ghost stories that they go, you ask, "Well, then

386
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 what happened?"

387
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
 They're like, "I don't know."

388
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
 Like, they just went away.

389
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,500
 Like, if something was in my house and I was seeing something standing at the end of the

390
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,540
 hallway and it was in my little girl's room and then the phenomenon stopped.

391
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,780
 That's how a lot of normal ghost stories go.

392
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,100
 It doesn't end with the little girl being possessed, juggling possums, floating around

393
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,500
 with a ghost pirate sword.

394
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,460
 I was so mad.

395
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,460
 When I was recording yesterday's episode, I actually was like, I felt, I sucked because

396
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,900
 I was starting off the season and I felt burned out.

397
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,300
 I felt ripped off.

398
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,580
 I don't cover stuff that I know is fake unless I'm doing it, unless I'm trying to expose

399
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,180
 a fraud or something like that.

400
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,500
 Like, Ed and Lorraine Warren or something doing something like that.

401
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,820
 But oh, I have a sew.

402
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,460
 And I feel like that came across in yesterday's episode.

403
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,980
 But I wanted to highlight the Wasp Slug story because that's where this next story that

404
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,700
 we're going to do is also from that same thread.

405
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,220
 So if you want to know more about the Possum Witch and all that stuff, you can go to the

406
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,340
 link in this episode.

407
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,460
 But this story, I love.

408
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
 This story I love.

409
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,540
 It doesn't involve possums.

410
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,260
 It doesn't involve giant monsters.

411
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,060
 But it's one of those stories that could happen.

412
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:27,820
 And if it is real, it's just something just supernaturally terrifying about it.

413
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,780
 We're in Georgia and there's a kid.

414
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
 His family's from Florida.

415
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,620
 We're going to call him Tyler.

416
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,580
 Tyler here is family's from Florida and they're visiting Georgia.

417
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,940
 They're staying at a cabin in the wilderness.

418
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,980
 There's a mountain nearby.

419
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,020
 And he's there with his mom, his dad and his brother.

420
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 And they go, you know what?

421
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,060
 We're going to go for a nice hike up the mountain.

422
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,620
 And Tyler's like, nah, I'm good.

423
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,900
 And the family's like, OK, we're not going to make you.

424
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,580
 Because that's not the worst thing you can do is make someone go for a hike.

425
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,660
 But 30 minutes pass and Tyler gets bored.

426
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,860
 He's just sitting in the cabin all by himself.

427
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,500
 So he decides to join them.

428
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,700
 He figures, he figures what the risk of me wandering off into the wilderness, having

429
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,460
 no idea what's around.

430
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,180
 I'm not even a local to the area.

431
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,100
 What could possibly go wrong?

432
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,180
 So he decides to go track them down.

433
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,940
 He walks outside of a cabin and behind the cabin, I think it's one of those areas that

434
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,700
 kind of has multiple cabins in it where a lot of people are staying at once.

435
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,100
 There's this wide trail leading off towards the mountain.

436
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,940
 And he journeys off and as he's walking down this trail enjoying just the nature of the

437
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:43,260
 world, birds chirping, leaves rustling, vassuvolas and fingernails and chalkboards playing in

438
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
 the distance.

439
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,140
 He's just walking through the wilderness.

440
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,940
 The path starts to grow smaller as the journey continues.

441
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,180
 And he passes by an old barn sitting there.

442
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
 The wood is rotting.

443
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,340
 The paint has long peeled away.

444
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,100
 Here is reclaiming this structure.

445
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
 He continues walking.

446
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:08,020
 He passes some rusted farm equipment left by farmers long ago.

447
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,180
 He keeps going.

448
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,140
 And the further he's going on this walk, he notices that the trail is getting more and

449
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
 more narrow.

450
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,420
 And now he realizes the forest is silent.

451
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,300
 The only sound he hears is his feet crunching down on the trail.

452
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,740
 There's no birds.

453
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
 There's no bugs.

454
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,740
 He normally don't hear bugs unless it's at night and it's a crack and he's like, I don't

455
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,300
 hear a ladybug.

456
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
 He's walking.

457
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 He doesn't hear any birds.

458
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
 He's walking through the area.

459
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
 It's completely quiet.

460
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,980
 And eventually the path comes to a forested area.

461
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,900
 And the footpath actually passes in between two trees.

462
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,900
 But she finds odd.

463
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,380
 Like why would you put the path through the two trees and now at this point it's becoming

464
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,880
 very, very narrow.

465
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,300
 But he keeps walking.

466
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,780
 He has to squeeze through the trees.

467
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,540
 That's how narrow this path is.

468
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:09,620
 And when he gets through those trees, he notices that there is now a huge open area surrounded

469
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,940
 by the forest.

470
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:20,260
 It's this clearing made of red clay sitting right in the middle of this dense forest.

471
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,460
 And as he enters this, what's the term for it?

472
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,680
 I think Glen has like river in it, right?

473
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,960
 Has like some water in it.

474
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,560
 As he enters this circle, as he enters this circle thing in the forest, there's a term

475
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,400
 for it, prairie.

476
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,480
 As he enters this glade, now I'm just naming stuff.

477
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,400
 As he enters this area, he sees in the middle of it a car.

478
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:52,620
 A Dodge Dart from the 1960s is sitting right in the middle of this patch of land.

479
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,300
 And it's a beauty.

480
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,780
 This car is in pristine condition.

481
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:05,540
 A baby blue paint job that is so shiny, Tyler can actually see the clouds reflected on it.

482
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,900
 The cream colored canvas top is spotless.

483
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,640
 And sitting in the car is a man.

484
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,440
 Now what's really boggling his mind?

485
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
 Seeing cars.

486
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,240
 He's not like, well golly, that's one of the more scarages.

487
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,320
 He knows what a car looks like.

488
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,080
 He can obviously identify like the make and model.

489
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:33,800
 He can't figure out how it got here because he's having to squeeze through trees.

490
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,240
 There's no road to get here and there's a dense forest surrounding this clearing.

491
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,800
 That's the word I was looking for.

492
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 This clearing.

493
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,640
 And he's like, how would you even get the vehicle in here?

494
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
 There's no way.

495
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,620
 I mean, technically you could, but you'd either be knocking over trees or the car wouldn't

496
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,240
 be in perfect condition.

497
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,080
 How did it get here?

498
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,720
 And how did it get here and stay so clean?

499
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,840
 There's another mystery, right?

500
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,000
 There's a guy sitting in the car and he sees this dude sitting in the driver's seat.

501
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,080
 He's dressed in all black.

502
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,120
 He describes it as an old-fashioned type suit.

503
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,560
 All black, wearing sunglasses and the guy's just sitting there in the car.

504
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,160
 And he goes, listen, he may or may not have had a fedora on.

505
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,200
 I don't really remember, but he was definitely dressed to the nines.

506
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,800
 He's walking and he goes, this guy's wearing this old-fashioned suit and this old-fashioned

507
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,320
 car, but we're in the sticks, right?

508
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,400
 This is the boonies.

509
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
 So they don't really keep, they don't get Cosmo here.

510
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
 They don't get GQ.

511
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,160
 They don't really keep over the times.

512
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,440
 That doesn't, his fashion choices in the car don't ring any alarm bells.

513
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,560
 What rings the alarm bells is how do the car get here in the first place, but while he's

514
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,120
 walking by the car, he looks at the man and he smiles and he kind of does a friendly wave.

515
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,520
 And the man in the car looks at Tyler and waves back, flashing a nice little smile as

516
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
 well.

517
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,360
 And Tyler's looking at this car and he's about to compliment it.

518
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,960
 He's looking at this dude, he's looking at this slick car, right?

519
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,000
 And he's about to say, "Man, a nice car.

520
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,480
 How'd you break the laws of physics to get it here?"

521
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,200
 He's about to compliment the car and then all of a sudden there's a rustling of leaves

522
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,520
 behind him.

523
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,400
 Now this is the first sound Tyler has heard in a while.

524
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,000
 The only thing that he's been hearing along this journey is this crunch of the rocks under

525
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
 his own feet.

526
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,600
 It's been silenced the rest of the way, so when he hears the leaves rustling behind him,

527
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,800
 he immediately turns back to see what it could possibly be.

528
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,680
 There's nothing there.

529
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,400
 So he turns back to the car, so he turns back to the man, right?

530
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 He was going to compliment the car.

531
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,200
 He's like, "I was so rudely, rudely interrupted by that noise."

532
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,960
 He turns back to the man.

533
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,200
 The man's gone.

534
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,880
 When I could say the car is gone, I'd be half right.

535
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,760
 Because when he turns back, what he sees is this 1960s Dodge Dart with this baby blue

536
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:15,440
 paint job reflecting the Georgia sunshine and this perfectly clean cream-colored cannabis

537
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,800
 top.

538
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:22,880
 When he turns back, it is a rusted heap.

539
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,000
 The tires long deflated with weeds surrounding this piece of junk.

540
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:37,920
 A few flakes of paint still attached to this heap showing at one time it truly was baby

541
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,920
 blue, but these flecks of paint have been beaten down by the elements.

542
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,080
 The canvas top ripped open the interior of the car beyond saving.

543
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,200
 The entire thing has been trashed.

544
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,760
 This classic car was conquered by the natural elements long ago.

545
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,560
 Tyler standing there in this red clay clearing alone.

546
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,640
 The man is gone.

547
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,240
 The car is junk.

548
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,120
 And he has to make a decision.

549
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,720
 Is he going to poop his pants or pee his pants?

550
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,960
 He's standing there and he goes, "Okay, that was weird.

551
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
 Possibly my imagination.

552
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,840
 I do have a vivid imagination.

553
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,480
 I'm constantly hallucinating cars.

554
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,680
 It could have been my imagination.

555
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,800
 Very very skeptical way of looking at things."

556
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,080
 He goes, "But I have two choices.

557
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,240
 I can go back to the cabin, back the way I came, or I can go forward along this possibly

558
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,920
 cursed path to find my family.

559
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,000
 But it was just my imagination.

560
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,600
 I just imagined all that stuff.

561
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,000
 However, if I go back home, I'm going back to an empty cabin.

562
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,440
 So if something truly supernatural is afoot, then I'm not going to throw my brother in

563
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,680
 front of the demon and go, "Get him, get him."

564
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,400
 So if I go forward, I'm sure to find my family and then I can tell them about this and they

565
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,920
 will probably just tell me I was just hallucinating.

566
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:19,720
 So I'm going to continue my journey forward through the wilderness.

567
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,160
 He sees on the other side of the clearing there is a path squeezing between the trees

568
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
 leading out.

569
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,800
 So he clearly sees that this was the way I came and there is a path leading out of it.

570
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,520
 So I'm going to take that.

571
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,040
 He goes to that path and he continues to walk forward.

572
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:42,520
 He's walking through the forest and once again he is smothered by silence.

573
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,040
 But then sound does emerge.

574
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
 The sound deflies.

575
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:58,240
 And he hears them, but he can't see them.

576
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,040
 Generally if a fly is close enough, do I have to explain this?

577
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,400
 If you can hear it, you can generally see it.

578
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,320
 I don't think I have to go into fly physics.

579
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,800
 He can't see them so it's weird.

580
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,680
 He's hearing these flies and they sound like they're right next to them, but he can't see

581
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,880
 any of them.

582
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,840
 And as he continues to walk, the sound grows louder and louder and louder to the point

583
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:29,960
 that it begins to sound like there's dozens of flies right next to his head.

584
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,960
 He's walking around him and then all of a sudden, he's like, "Please shut off the flies."

585
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,560
 I know what a fly sounds like.

586
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,160
 Okay, okay, you've already taken off your headphones and you're listening to me going

587
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,160
 "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

588
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:55,160
 to the show.

589
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:02,160
 He's walking and then all of a sudden his nostrils are hit with the smell of death.

590
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:10,320
 He smells like right up into his nose, decaying flesh, meat left out in the sun to bubble

591
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,160
 and boil and be torn apart by maggots' mouths.

592
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,240
 That smell, the smell we're all familiar with and every time we walk into an Arby's, he

593
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,760
 smells it and fills up his nostrils.

594
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,760
 He's surrounded by death, but here's the thing.

595
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:33,840
 He can't see anything around him that would make him think this was real.

596
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,280
 He's hearing the buzzing of dozens of flies around him.

597
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,440
 He smells a freshly killed carcass baking in the sun.

598
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,520
 This is enough for him, right?

599
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,240
 He's met his limit of weird stuff for the afternoon.

600
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,680
 He feels like he has to get out of there.

601
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,920
 So he turns and he runs down the trail.

602
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,280
 He runs away from the buzzing of flies and away from the decaying smell.

603
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:09,240
 He runs into the clearing and passes the rusted out car and squeezes between the trees and

604
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,080
 begins to run down the trail.

605
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,720
 He runs past the rusted farm equipment surrounded by tall grass and keeps running.

606
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:24,160
 He runs past the dilapidated barn and keeps running.

607
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:31,120
 And eventually he sees where the trail gets wide and he continues to run and he sees the

608
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:41,200
 cabin that his family had rented out for this vacation and he runs in the front door.

609
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
 His family's there.

610
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,160
 They got back from their mountain trip and he wasn't there.

611
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,560
 They thought it was super weird, right?

612
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,760
 They're a little concerned.

613
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,400
 They're visiting this area.

614
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,040
 One of their kids is missing.

615
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,800
 He runs in and he tells them his experience.

616
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,840
 He goes, "I took the path and da da da da da."

617
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,120
 He's sitting there and he goes, "And dozens of flies."

618
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,280
 He's doing that sound effect around and they're like, "Ahh."

619
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
 He was insistent.

620
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,600
 He goes, "We need to go down that trail."

621
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,800
 I don't know what was going on, but let's just go down that trail tomorrow.

622
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,600
 And the family's like, "Yeah, we're out here to hike.

623
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,200
 Why don't we hike on the edge of the twilight zone as well?"

624
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,960
 Because again, the family's taking a very skeptical approach to this.

625
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,160
 Like, "Yeah, you might have hallucinated the car."

626
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,800
 I don't know if you'd think that nonchalant if your kid was hallucinating.

627
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
 But they go, "Yeah, let's go check it out tomorrow."

628
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,000
 So the next day, they decide to take the hike down this trail.

629
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,280
 Because at the very least, they want to look at this cool car.

630
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,560
 The dad's all sitting in it and it's all super rusty.

631
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,840
 He's like, "Yay, this is the car I always wanted as a kid."

632
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,320
 And the thousands of black widow bites are just a bonus as I was sitting in this rusted

633
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,160
 piece of junk.

634
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,280
 They're walking the trail.

635
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,880
 They go take the trail that's behind the cabin and they walk.

636
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,160
 They continue to walk and they're walking and they end up back at the cabin.

637
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,800
 And Tyler's like, "What happened?

638
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,320
 When I took this trail, it led off to the forest and the barn and all this stuff."

639
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,280
 And the family's like, "Well, there are no turnoffs from this trail."

640
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
 Like, "We took the trail."

641
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,760
 And he goes, "Yeah, there was no turnoffs when I took the trail either, but we didn't

642
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
 see the barn.

643
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
 We didn't see the equipment.

644
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
 We didn't see any of that stuff.

645
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
 Let's do it again."

646
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,720
 The family's like, "Oh, you know, what's the harm?

647
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,480
 We're here to go hiking anyways."

648
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,120
 So they walk on the trail again and sure enough, they end up back at the cabin.

649
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:39,400
 This trail is a massive circle with no turnoffs that always leads back to the cabin.

650
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,960
 Tyler said, "We walked that three times.

651
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,880
 I had to be sure that we weren't missing something.

652
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:52,640
 And every time we took that trail, it never led off into the forest.

653
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,200
 It never passed the barn.

654
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,040
 We never saw the rusted equipment.

655
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,360
 It never led into the forest.

656
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:11,040
 The trail I took the day before was no longer there."

657
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
 Fascinating story.

658
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
 I love this story.

659
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,200
 It doesn't have a wasp with a slug body, but this is one of those...

660
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,040
 These type of stories are so terrifying.

661
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
 You have to think...

662
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,840
 You know what I mean?

663
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,680
 Like, one, the story doesn't have a conclusion.

664
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,880
 There's so many questions.

665
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
 This is one of the stories.

666
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,800
 Like, there's so many questions at the end of it, right?

667
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,280
 What happened to the trail he took in the first place?

668
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,520
 Where did he go?

669
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,160
 Like, just Tyler's journey alone is a whole host of questions.

670
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,600
 But then, who was the man in the car?

671
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,640
 How did the car get there?

672
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,000
 The man didn't seem perplexed or frustrated or anything like that.

673
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,400
 And even if it was a ghost car...

674
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,200
 I mean, remember when I was first reading the story?

675
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,560
 I thought, because when I didn't know how it was going to end, how normal stories are

676
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
 when you read them.

677
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,160
 I thought we were going to find out that there was a car accident in the area, and this was

678
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
 a ghost and a ghost car.

679
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
 No.

680
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,040
 How did the car get there?

681
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,720
 Even in a car accident, it shouldn't have been able to get there.

682
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,960
 Why was the car there?

683
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,140
 Why was the man there?

684
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,600
 What happened to them?

685
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,880
 What was the smell?

686
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,600
 What was the death and the decay just ahead?

687
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,640
 Fascinating story.

688
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
 Fascinating story.

689
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,960
 And terrifying, because again, we cover this all the time, and I don't want to become...

690
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,440
 I don't want to become the missing people podcast.

691
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,800
 I'm sure that would be a hit, but what if he kept walking?

692
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,120
 Would the family have ever known what happened to the son?

693
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,480
 Would it be one of those tragic stories of a family on vacation and a young dude goes

694
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,280
 missing and they can never find any trace of him?

695
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,080
 Because he's not there.

696
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,560
 He's in another location.

697
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:01,200
 He's in another reality or realm.

698
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:09,080
 Imagine if he kept walking, he was smelling his own decaying remains, smelling a future,

699
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:34,080
 and then he's gone.

700
00:37:34,080 --> 00:38:00,040
 Really

701
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:28,200
 be

702
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:49,720
 the

703
00:38:49,720 --> 00:39:08,480
 survival instinct.

704
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,320
 It's an interesting question because those who are brave enough to continue on their journey,

705
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:24,160
 are they strong enough to survive what's waiting for them?

706
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,880
 I think the answer to that is pretty clear.

707
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:35,640
 We have a lot of stories of people mysteriously vanishing in the woods and very, very few of

708
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,080
 them ever return.

709
00:39:41,080 --> 00:40:04,240
 Would you be one of them?

710
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:21,680
 Would you be one of them?

711
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:37,720
 Would you be one of them?
