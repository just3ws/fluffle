00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Today is a different episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 I've talked about conspiracies I've been involved in.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
 I've talked about paranormal events I've been involved in.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 But today we're going to talk about one of my true crime cases.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 It's nothing revolutionary, but I think it'll give you an insight to my past and to how I became who I am today.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I hope you enjoy today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 We're going to dispense with many of our normal things.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I didn't want to take a Patreon or a home for this ride.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Figure it wouldn't be fair.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The undercopter is going to stay grounded. The Jason Jalopy is going to be sitting in the garage.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I want to tell you guys a little story.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 A little story about Old Jason.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Well, I was younger, but Old Jason.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 The Jason that I used to be.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And I think it shows how I became who I am today.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So let me take you back to the early 2000s.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We are in Antelope, California.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Antelope is a suburb of Sacramento and it's really, really far off in the outskirts.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 It actually stood in between a lot of bad areas.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Antelope was mostly a suburban subdivision.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Lots of nice homes, lots of nice families.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 But it bordered against Watt Avenue, which was not a great place to be on.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It was a massive road. It's still there. It didn't disappear. Godzilla didn't eat it. It's still there.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 But I haven't been down that road for quite a long time.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 It's a long road that pretty much takes you all the way from the suburb of Antelope to the city of Sacramento proper, more or less.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It also borders Rio Linda, which is, it's really interesting. The whole area was like a GTA map.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Because basically you had this area that had a lot of like punk kids, which would have been Antelope.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 You had a lot of like punk rocker kids.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 You could get into trouble with your local neighborhood drug dealer selling weed or something like that.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Or some kid just trying to make a name for himself.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And then go three miles in your knee deep in Redneck meth in Rio Linda.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Sorry, Rio Linda. But you know it's true.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 You know it's true in that same area was Dyer's Lane, which was a road that was supposed to be haunted.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I spent many nights driving down Dyer's Lane looking for ghosts.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 That's some weird encounters on that. We'll save that for another episode.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I might have already told those stories actually.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And then when you go about five miles down Watt, you're in gang territory.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Maybe a little more than five miles. But once you hit Omega Court, you didn't want to hit Omega Court.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 It was very interesting. Watt Avenue was this long stretch of road. It was four lanes. It still exists, Jason.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It's a four lane stretch of road that cuts all the way through all these other suburbs.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And there's this little tiny court called Omega Court. Just kind of right off Watt.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Don't go there. Don't go there if you live there. You're totally awesome.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I have a lot of respect for you. I'm glad you're listening to my podcast.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Because hardcore gangbangers lived on Omega Court.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Sacramento was one of those weird towns where depending on which way you turned down any given street,

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 you were either in a totally safe neighborhood or a very, very dangerous neighborhood.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 You have that in Citrus Heights as well. You'd have that in Elk Grove.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And you had that off of Watt Avenue.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So anyways, I used to work at Godfather's Pizza. That doesn't exist anymore.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 At least the one in Antelope doesn't exist anymore.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I used to be a delivery driver for Godfather's Pizza. And I totally loved it.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I could listen to my music all day long.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Yes, I had to deliver pizza in a meth-infested Rialinda.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And I remember one night, it was 10 minutes before we were supposed to close,

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 and we got an order for Omega Court. And I said, "I'm not doing it. I'm not going to Omega Court."

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I want to go to Omega Court. I want to go to Omega Court in the afternoon.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 The sun could literally have a smiling, cartoon face on it. I'm not going there.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 My boss was like, "I'll give you an extra five bucks." And I look at him and I go,

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 "That's not enough. Five bucks? What? That's not enough for me to risk my life."

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And then so the boss, he already had taken the order, so the boss was like, "Fine, you punk. You coward."

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I don't know if he actually called me "coward."

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 He might have used another word that means that, but he delivered it.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And I was like, "Well, I guess he's murdered. I guess I got a promotion. I'm the boss now."

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And he didn't. He came back. Totally fine.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 But still, just the stress alone would have added 10 years to my life that drive to Omega Court.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 The amazing rapper, Holotip, talks about Omega Court, and he's actually from Omega Court.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So anyways, I used to work at Godfather's Pizza. I had quit. I had quit that job.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And then I was working at Circuit City. So this is in the late '90s, early 2000s.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I don't remember the exact year. But I'd just gone off work at Circuit City, and I was dressed up nice.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 A lot of times back then I wore dress shirts and nice slacks, really nice shoes.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 The key is that if you know you're going, it might sound counterintuitive, but if you're going to be in a...

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 That Godfather's Pizza was on the border of an OK neighborhood and then really bad neighborhoods.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 If you're going to go to bad neighborhoods, you actually should dress up.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 You're not going to get hassled by the cops, really, that much.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 And a lot of people think you're a cop. So it's a win-win.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I mean, generally speaking, they could also think that you have a bunch of money,

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 but generally if you see someone walking through a neighborhood at one in the morning and they're dressed really nice

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 and they carry themselves well, people think that guy's a drug dealer, that guy's a cop,

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 or that guy is someone who I'm going to rob. So your mileage may vary on that tactic,

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 but I just got off work from Circuit City, I was all dressed up,

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 and I go to Godfather's Pizza to hang out with my buddies.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Because all my friends work there, because I used to work there as well.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So I walk in, and I'm there for maybe 10 minutes, if that's right.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And I'm like, "Hey guys, what's up?" And my buddy Nick, who I mentioned before on the show, comes into the Godfather's Pizza.

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Now, it's like 8pm. The place is packed. It's 8pm. It's a Friday night.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Nick walks into Godfather's Pizza, and his Godfather's Pizza, this is great advertising for them, by the way.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 This is great product placement for them.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 My boy Nick walks in, and his Godfather's T-shirt is ripped to shreds.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It looks like he was attacked by the birds.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Whether or not he'd do an ad for the Alfred Hitchcock collection, I haven't decided yet, but there's a little bit of an ad.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 So Nick walks in, his shirt's ripped, and I'm laughing at him.

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Because how else are you going to react to a grown man walking into a pizza parlor with his shirt ripped to shreds?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I go, "Dude, what happened to you?" And he goes, "I just got jumped, man!"

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So what happened was right outside Godfather's Pizza?

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 There was this whole stupid thing. There were these two dudes, and Nick was like slept with one of their girlfriends or something like that,

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 and they came at him for retaliation.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Now, you know, this is a small town, small suburb politics. Everyone's sleeping with each other's girlfriends, whatever.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 There's no reason to beat somebody up.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But anyways, this dude, we're going to call him Barney, and I didn't like this guy.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I think this might have been the first time I'd seen him. I'd kind of heard about him. He was just kind of a jerk.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I knew him on the periphery of my friends, like my friends kind of knew this guy, whatever.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I didn't like Barney. I think that's what I named him. I don't remember.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 But Barney brought with him the toughest guy in the area.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And I'm not going to give his name. I know his name. I remember his name.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 But I'm not going to give his name, and you'll learn by the end of the story.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 But we're going to call him Douglas.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Now, Douglas was six foot three. His family had issues with law enforcement.

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 He was a close relative of his was serving life in prison.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And they originally were a really good family. And then that happened.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And the younger brother, Douglas, and it's not his real name, just kind of became a criminal.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Like that wasn't his career path.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 When he went to the school counselor, that was not on his check marks. That was not one of his options.

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But he kind of became a local, he was just kind of a thug, right?

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 He was just kind of a thug.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Now, he was six foot three and he was basically his career counselor should have said,

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 "Oh, I think you should try that thug occupation. I think you have the right attributes to make that work."

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 He was six foot three. I got to keep hammering that home.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And he was just muscle. He was just a big muscle guy.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 So what happened was Nick pulled up. He just got done delivering some pizzas.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 He barely got away with his life because he was delivering pizzas in Rio Linda.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 He gets out of his car and Douglas and who was the other guy? I don't remember his name.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 What did I name the other guy? It doesn't matter. He doesn't matter the story.

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But Douglas gets out of the car and starts threatening Nick.

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Now, Nick is about my height. Nick's about 5'11".

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So there's already that height advantage. Also, he's not an orc.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 But Nick was the best brawler of our crew. Nick was easily the one that had been in the most fights.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He had a reputation for being a very good fighter.

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And while he's fighting Douglas, the fight breaks out and they're just going at it.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And the other dudes just kind of sitting there.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 The other guy didn't really do anything other than inciting the whole thing.

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Douglas at one point as he's punching Nick multiple times, he picks Nick up.

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 This is the strength of this guy. He picks Nick up and slams him on the hood of an innocent bystander's car.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 This is like a strip mall. And it's again a Friday night.

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 There was like a nail salon and like a beauty store and then there was like a liquor store and all that stuff.

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 This fight breaks out in a parking lot and Douglas picks up Nick and slams him into this girl's car.

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So hard, he dented the hood. Like it was like a straight up like butt-sized dent in the hood of this car.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 So Nick comes in and he goes, "I just got jumped."

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Like what? So then myself, I'm the closest one to the door.

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Everyone else, all of our other friends are working there, Godfather Schmitzer.

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 So I go outside. You jump on my friend like, you know, what's going on.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I had to have been in my early 20s. I was trying to remember the timeline.

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I think I was around 22, 23 when this happened. I may have been a little bit younger, but I come out and behind me.

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So I come out of the Godfather Schmitzer and behind me comes a couple of my friends.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Josh and Jason were there. I think Matt and Troy might have been there.

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 So I come out of Godfather Schmitzer first. I got Jason, Josh behind me, and I got some other guys.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And then there was this big kid. This guy was the, he was also six foot three, but he was like 16 years old.

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And I don't remember his name. We'll call him Anthony. He comes out.

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So we're basically three layers deep. I'm in front. And then I got about two or three guys behind me.

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And then there's about two or three guys behind them. And then Anthony, not his real name, is towering over the group from the very back.

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And right when I come outside, right when we form this little formation, because we don't really know what to expect,

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 one of our friends have been jumped. We have to go out and take care of the situation.

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 So when I come out, the first thing I see is Douglas coming towards you.

155
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I only knew this guy by reputation. I know this guy's name from around town,

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 but I didn't know this was who I was going to be dealing with when I walked out of Godfather Schmitzer.

157
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I walk out of Godfather Schmitzer. I got all these people behind me.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Douglas is coming towards me with the, I swear to God, it was the biggest bowie knife I've ever seen in real life.

159
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 It had to have been 12 inches long. The blade. That's not including the handle.

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I mean, his hand was wrapped around it. And this giant bowie knife is coming right at me.

161
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Douglas is bringing this knife towards me, and it's not like it's not in his holster or sheath or whatever.

170
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 It's in his hand and it's pointed at me. It's pointed at my abdomen.

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And he's just, I want to say running towards me, but moving at a faster pace then you would feel comfortable when a man has a foot long blade bowing knife.

172
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And I put my hands up, not like up in the air, like out in front of me, and I go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."

173
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And it's funny because I wasn't panicked. I've been in a lot of situations similar to this.

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 You're not necessarily in panic because if you're panicked, you don't make good decisions.

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And you know, this is something that a lot of people, some people get and some people don't. You can't run away in this situation.

176
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 You can, like right? As an adult, you can, you should, as long as you don't have to worry about the safety of others.

177
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 If you don't grow up in bad neighborhoods, you'd be like, "Okay, Jason, how far did you run when this happened? You can't run."

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Because then everyone in town knows that you're punk. Like, you can't run. You can never show your face in that side of town again.

179
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 People would just, just mug you and go, "Hey, Godfather, speak some voice. How are you doing?" Everyone's mugging me. You can't run.

180
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Douglas is coming at me with the bowing knife. I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."

181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And he gets about probably two feet from me. Remember, the blade, okay, the blade seemed to be a foot long.

182
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 It might have been nine inches. Sorry if I'm exaggerating that. But he was in striking distance. Had he put his arm out straight,

183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 that should be fine. Who knows if I would have a podcast. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And I go, "Dude, put down the knife."

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Very, very calmly. And he didn't know me from anybody. He had no idea who I was. I had my own reputation, but not in, like, not,

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 he was like, he was not, he was not a guy you'd want coming at you with a knife. Most people you want to want coming at you with a knife,

186
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 but he was a different, I was like a troublemaker. I was like pushing over Apple Cards and stuff like that.

187
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I mean, I wasn't a schoolboy, but I also was in running down strip malls with a giant knife.

188
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, and I go, "Dude, put the knife away." And he's sitting there and he looks at me. He doesn't know who I am.

189
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I got all these kids behind me. They were all about, let's say if I was 23, they would have been like 1920. He probably recognizes some of them.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And Nick isn't in that group, which was very, very smart, because had Nick been in that group of people, again, things may have turned out differently.

191
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Douglas has that knife and he's looking at me and he's kind of looking at behind me. And then he takes a step towards me.

192
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And I go, "Whoa, I go, "Dude, you need to put the knife down." And he goes, "That kid, I'm going to try not to cuss, but obviously you can fill in the cuss words here.

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 He's all that kid staring at me, man. That kid staring at me. What am I supposed to do, bro?" And I turn around and that 16-year-old kid,

194
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 who has eight people standing in front of him, is mean-mugging this dude with the knife. He's like scowling and stuff like that.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And I turn around and I look at him and I'm like, "What's your problem?" He didn't know any. He's like a new employee, right?

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 He'd been there for maybe like a month or two. He had no invested interest in this fight. I turn around and I'm like, "Dude, what are you doing?"

197
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And he's like, "Yo, man, what's up to this dude?" And I turn around and I tell my friends, I'm like, "Get him out of here."

198
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 That's why I remember Josh and Jason there. I think they were the ones who grabbed this kid and pulled him into Godfather's Pizza to de-escalate things.

199
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Like, they just dragged this dude in. And I turn back around to Douglas and I go, "He's gone."

200
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And I don't remember who yelled it, but at that point someone went, "The cops!" And coming right around the corner, it's almost in slow motion.

201
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 There's a black and white coming around the corner from where the BP gas station was. I'm turning and I'm looking at the cop.

202
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Now, obviously I'm not doing anything illegal right now. I mean, I guess I am standing in the middle of a fight.

203
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 But the cop cars, and I remember turning in, the cop cars almost coming in slow motion. They weren't running their lights.

204
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And when I look back, so I turn and look at the cops and he's coming around. Maybe he was driving very slowly. Maybe it wasn't in slow motion.

205
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 As I turn around, I look over and I see Douglas. He had run back to his car and he threw the knife underneath his car.

206
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And then he started slowly walking back. At that point, the officer is there. The cop gets out of the car and he goes, "Hey, what's going on? I got to report there was a fight."

207
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Now, this is the key thing. Remember, I'm dressed up. Douglas looks like, you know, he's wearing his whatever, no-fear shirt or whatever was popular back then.

208
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Nick, Nick's clothes are shredded, but he's still inside. And I tell the officer, I go, "People just yelling, officer. People just yelling, fighting over a girl.

209
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 You know how it is." He goes, "I got to call it there was a fight." And I go, "It was just people yelling about a girl."

210
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 The cop's like, "Okay, okay, gets in his car." Now, if I had been dressed and head to toe, no-fear clothing. I had the sleeves cut off the sleeves.

211
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Somehow, it's quantum sleeveless. My hat was on backwards and all that stuff. He probably wanted to believe me.

212
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But because I looked like I just got off work as a salesman, why would I lie?

213
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I go, "It was just people yelling over a girl and nothing. There's no big deal, officer." And he actually looked like he could care less.

214
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 But then, he'd probably just come from a drive-by. It was on his way to a meth bust.

215
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Though, if kids are fighting in the parking lot, he probably just would enjoy a five-minute nap before the next mass casualty event in the area.

216
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 So, he leaves. He leaves. Douglas gets in his car with his buddy. They leave.

217
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And I walk inside and I go up to that dumb kid, that 16-year-old kid, and I go, "What in the world were you thinking out there?"

218
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 What was going through- Oh, dude, I was furious. I go, "What was going through your head?"

219
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 He's like, "Well, I'm not going to let anyone roll up on my homies, blah, blah, blah." And I said, "Listen, dude, you can talk all the trash you want when you're in front of the knife.

220
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 But when I'm in front of the knife, you need to keep your mouth shut." I was furious, because I knew at that point, see, the adrenaline, the incident's gone, the adrenaline's starting to leave.

221
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And I realized how much danger I was. In that moment, you're just kind of thinking second to second.

222
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 But now, I'm starting to think, oh, dude, I almost got skewered. So, my night's blown, right?

223
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Because this isn't how it ends. This is not how these stories ever end. I know what's going to happen next.

224
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So, I order a pizza, I get a soda, and I laugh. I laugh at the fact that Nick got his shirt all ripped up.

225
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And he tells me the fight. He didn't tell me that when he first walked in. He tells me, "This is what happened."

226
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Dude picked me up, dented the girl's car, and I'm thinking, "She must have been the one to call the police."

227
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Because that fight took place right outside of this beauty supply store. I'm going to stay around for a while.

228
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I'm going to order this pizza and drink the soda, because I knew what was going to happen.

229
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 About an hour later, we start getting phone calls to the Godfather's Pizza.

230
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Friends in the neighborhood calling up, "Hey, dude, what happened at Godfather's?"

231
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Yeah, dude, telling the story, and then someone would be like, "Well, dude, Douglas is coming back to take care of that kid."

232
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Douglas is coming back. At midnight, he's going to come back, roll up on that kid.

233
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And you knew that was going to happen. You knew that was going to happen.

234
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 So I'm sitting there, and as my fellow friends, they're getting off their shifts.

235
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 They come, and we're just eating pizza, playing video games, drinking soda and stuff.

236
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Knowing full well at midnight, a man who carries around a giant knife is coming back to take care of this kid for mean mugging him.

237
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 We're sitting there drinking soda. You don't drink alcohol in these situations.

238
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Because you know that you're probably not good if you're an ebriator, drinking soda and pizza and stuff like that.

239
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And I remember, like I said, I knew the guy by reputation, and I remember sitting there, and I think it was Nick who said,

240
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 because we were talking about him, we're like, "Yeah, you know, he's going to like beat the crap out of that kid.

241
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 He's probably going to kill him. That kid is not a scrapper. He's a big guy, but Douglas is the same size, but more muscle,

242
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 and he's fought a ton of people." And Nick was like, "Yeah, actually, I don't know if this story is true,

243
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 but Douglas picked up a car once." I remember I'm drinking my soda, and I go, "What?"

244
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Nick's like, "Yeah, yeah, I picked up a car. I picked up a car once." And I go, "What are you talking about? I picked up a car."

245
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 He goes, "So apparently this car full of girls broke down on Watt Avenue, and he was driving by one night,

246
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 and I don't know if he knew the girls or not. They need to change the tire and the jack didn't work."

247
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I don't know, again, this might just be Urban Legend and Anilope, but their jack didn't work, or it broke in the middle of it,

248
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 so he picked up the back of the car so they could change the tire.

249
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 So I'm like, I'm glad we're fighting Thanos. I thought it was just like, I thought his only superpower was the fact that he had a giant knife,

250
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 but now apparently he can flip cars over. So I go, I'll be right back. I will be right back.

251
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 So I got into my car. Now here's the thing, you live in a bad neighborhood. There were no guns.

252
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Like people had guns, and again, that was like a high level criminal thing. Guns were very, very...

253
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 You could get them in California, but they were... it was so easy to get busted for having a gun.

254
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 You had to have a gun in one spot of your car, and the ammo in the other spot of the car. You couldn't have the ammo in the gun.

255
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So you could have the clip or magazine, whatever it is, gun nuts. You can have the magazine in the... or clip, whatever.

256
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 It doesn't matter. You can have the thing that holds the bullets in your glove compartment and your gun in the trunk,

257
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 or your gun in your glove compartment and the ammo in the trunk.

258
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 So what's the point of that? What am I supposed to do? Throw bullets at them until I can run to the back of the trunk?

259
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 It was just such a hassle to carry a... to own a firearm in California.

260
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You could only get a concealed carry permit if you were like a jeweler, or you were a celebrity,

261
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 or you had reasonable or plausible threats on your life is very, very difficult to do.

262
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 So you ran into people with guns. Usually they were illegally bought and operated.

263
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And they weren't like, "I'm using this for lawful purposes, but I bought it for $300 on the black market."

264
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 So most of the people you ran into carried bats and knives. Occasionally you get a chain.

265
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 A chain? Like apparently they saw some Jackie Chan movie, guys run around the ladder, spinning around on his neck.

266
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I always thought chains were too impractical. You could just someone's like spinning it at you, and then you like, crotty chop it.

267
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Again, assuming you're Thanos, and then it hits their head.

268
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 So I always had bats with me. In California it was very interesting law.

269
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 If you had a bat in your car, you also had to have a ball and a glove.

270
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 A baseball. You can't have a basketball. You'd have to have a ball and a glove, otherwise the bat was considered a deadly weapon in your car.

271
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 If you had a ball and a glove, you're on your way to a Little League game, officer.

272
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 So a lot of times I had bats. I had a broken boat ore.

273
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You know in video games where you use a weapon and then it wears out and then you can't use it anymore?

274
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 That's what happened to my boat ore. I'll tell that story someday. I've actually had that story written on my idea board for like eight months.

275
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 I'll tell you the story about how I used the boat ore until the strength level dropped to zero and it shattered.

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 But I had a boat ore. I had some knives like pocket knives and stuff like that, but I'm never a huge fan of them.

277
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 What I was known for, because here's the thing, the key to winning fights is not getting in fights.

278
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 The key to winning every single fight is to not get in the fight in the first place.

279
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So if you knew a guy in your neighborhood who had a shotgun, you're probably not going to pick a fight with him.

280
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 If the guy with the shotgun knew someone in the neighborhood who had a flamethrower, the guy with the shotgun is not starting the flamethrower fight.

281
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Even though you figure a shotgun is a better weapon than a flamethrower, someone who owns a flamethrower is insane.

282
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Or they're in a World War II movie. Or Elon Musk. I guess he's just the insane guy.

283
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 But if someone came to a street fight with a flamethrower, the fight's over.

284
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 The fight's just over. You're like, "Ah, who do we have? Do we have a sniper rifle or rocket launcher?" No, no. Just give it to the flamethrower guy.

285
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 So one day, like that movie, Frailty, I was walking through my grandpa's garage.

286
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And it was almost like an angel delivered this to me. Because this thing became my trademark.

287
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And I don't think I ever got in another fight. It was almost like a lucky talisman. Or it was just so insane.

288
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Just knowing that I had it in my possession, people were like, "Dude, I don't want to fight Jason."

289
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 So I was in my grandpa's garage one day, and there was like a beam of light shining down on it.

290
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 I found a hay hook.

291
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Now if you don't know what a hay hook is, maybe you've seen I Know What You Did Last Summer.

292
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I actually had the hay hook before that movie came out. I didn't rip them off. They ripped me off.

293
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I remember one night Josh woke me up and goes, "Dude, dude, there's a movie about you."

294
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And that was the first time we were seeing trailers for I Know What You Did Last Summer.

295
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I had this hay hook. So it was basically all, it was just a steel.

296
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 It was like a wooden handle. Everything else was steel, and it was just this sharp hook.

297
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And actually now the thing about it wasn't sharp, and that actually made it a little scarier.

298
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 You could tell that this was an old tool. I mean, it looked terrifying.

299
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And so I took it, and I just stole it from my grandpa, because I was going to put it to good use.

300
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And everyone found out I carried a hay hook. People would be like, "Yo, what's that? What's that in your trunk?"

301
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, this is my hay hook."

302
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 You know, in case something pops off, I'll pull up my hay hook.

303
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And you would think it's such a stupid weapon. And looking back on it, I think even then I realized this.

304
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 It really only has one, like a baseball bat you can use offensively and defensively.

305
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 A boat ore is the same thing. It's so long that you can just push people back with it.

306
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 You can block chains, block ladders, and then you can also conk people with it.

307
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Conk them on the head and little comical stars. Not medical concussions happen.

308
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Baseball bats the same thing. You can use it as an offensive or defensive weapon.

309
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 You can use a bat to open a door or something like that.

310
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe Thanos could.

311
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 But knives, they're only offensive weapons. You can't use a knife to really block anything.

312
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 They're quite scary.

313
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 A hay hook, the guy with the knife versus the guy with the hay hook, in a fight, the guy with the knife will win strategically

314
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 because there's so many ways you can wield it.

315
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 A hay hook can really only be wield in a broad overhand or side motion.

316
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 But if you get hit with it once, you're not going anywhere.

317
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Like people in prison or even real life, you can get stabbed a couple of times and they keep walking down the street

318
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 and then you're like, "Oh man, you're bleeding."

319
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 If you're stabbed in the right or wrong location, depending on how you think about it, you may not even feel it initially.

320
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 The hay hook, you're stuck where I am now.

321
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Like even if I just got your foot, okay, like you're not going anywhere.

322
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 I'm holding onto your foot with this metal hook.

323
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Terrifying weapon. It was a psychological weapon. I never once used it in a fight. Never.

324
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 It was a psychological weapon. I didn't have to use it. The fact that people knew that I possessed this thing

325
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 that looks like it came out of a serial killers collection.

326
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I have no idea where a game from, honestly.

327
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 But the fact that people knew that I had it, people, people, it parted the seas for me as far as people wanting to mess with me.

328
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 My reputation was, "Yeah, I'd fight, but I was also just wanting to hang out and play GoldenEye and stuff like that."

329
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 That was kind of Nick's reputation, too. You fought when you had to.

330
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 But then I had this hay hook, and that was just kind of the end of it.

331
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 People were like, "Well, just let him play GoldenEye as long as he wants. He can pick odd job.

332
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Just let him do what I'm playing the game with the hay hook. I'm hitting all the buttons."

333
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Anyways, so I walk out to my car and I get my hay hook.

334
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And at the same time, this is going to date this episode.

335
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 This is probably the most embarrassing part of the episode.

336
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 The fact that I was walking around with a hay hook. I used to wear a trench coat all the time.

337
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Actually, I can date this story now.

338
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Because I stopped wearing the trench coat after Columbine.

339
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 I was like, "Ugh, okay."

340
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Before I just wore a trench coat because it looked cool, right? It was like Agent Mulder.

341
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I'm wearing a trench coat around me. Sometimes I was much, much younger and much more pudgier.

342
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 But I had this black trench coat I wore everywhere.

343
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And people go, "Oh, he's a goth kid." And stuff like that.

344
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And I wasn't. I just really liked trench coat.

345
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And here's a little fun fact for you.

346
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Did you know that if you have a hay hook attached to your belt and you're wearing a trench coat,

347
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 nobody will ever know? No one will ever know.

348
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I grab my hay hook out of my trunk and I throw on my trench coat.

349
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 And I walk back in to Godfather's Pizza.

350
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And at that point, I just sit back down.

351
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 It's surprisingly comfortable sitting down with a hay hook attached to your clothes.

352
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I sit back down just drinking soda, eating pizza, killing time.

353
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Now, did I think I was going to have to use this hay hook on this dude?

354
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I mean, obviously, you don't want to. It's super unwieldy.

355
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 I know this guy's a better fighter than me.

356
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 I know he has a better weapon than I do.

357
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 But I didn't have anything to do with any of this.

358
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 I was Nick's friend, but I wasn't talking trash to him.

359
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 I wasn't trying to instigate the fight.

360
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 The guy who was messing with him, I got rid of him.

361
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And I had an ace in my hole.

362
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And I knew this. I knew this as I was waiting for midnight.

363
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I knew that I had a car to play.

364
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Now, again, I knew this guy by reputation.

365
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 He was a bit violent and apparently he can pick up cars.

366
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 But he had to have been around like 20 or something like that.

367
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 I knew I had an ace in the hole.

368
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 The number one key, again, to winning fights is not to get in fights.

369
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 And the best way not to get in fights is to be able to talk to people.

370
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 To communicate things with people.

371
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 People are just being insane.

372
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 They're just saying insane things.

373
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Then you have to fight or you call the cops, right?

374
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 But if they're rational people, you can sit down and have a conversation with them.

375
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 The key is knowing whether or not the person is rational

376
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 before they pull out a giant knife.

377
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 It's a little early. It's probably like 1150 or something like that.

378
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 If Douglas is anything, he's a punctual man who wants to murder.

379
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Actually, the word was he wanted to beat this kid up.

380
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 But we all knew he wanted to go behind this donut shop.

381
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 So in this parking lot, you probably pull all this up on Google Maps.

382
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 On the far end of the parking lot, the darkest end of the parking lot.

383
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 I mean, it had to be 300, 400 yards away from Godfather's Pizza.

384
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 There was a donut shop. It was closed. All the lights were out.

385
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 It was basically bordering on this creepy forest going into...

386
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 I don't remember what that part of land was, but it was near Dyer's Lane.

387
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It's not a place that you want to be day or night.

388
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 That's where Douglas wanted the fight to happen.

389
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And we know we're like, "Well, he's going to murder him over there."

390
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Even if he doesn't mean to, he can pick up cars, right?

391
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And he slammed Nick into a car and dented that hood.

392
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And again, I was like, "We got to take care of that, too."

393
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 But Douglas pulls up.

394
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And I don't remember who was in the passenger seat.

395
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 It wasn't the guy who sparked the thing off.

396
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 It was one of his boys, because that's how you go to a fight, right?

397
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 You don't go to a fight alone because you don't want to get jumped.

398
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 You may not want to jump with other people, but you got to have somebody with you.

399
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 So he brought another kid with him.

400
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I assumed the guy was a brawler. I didn't know the guy.

401
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 I never saw him afterwards, but that car pulls up.

402
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 I tell that stupid Anthony kid, "Stay in Godfather's."

403
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Stay in Godfather's.

404
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And I walk out wearing my very cool and fashionable at the time trench coat.

405
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 I've got a little hay hook in my belt loop.

406
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 I walk out to the car.

407
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And Douglas is just sitting there looking straight ahead into Godfather's Pizza.

408
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I walk up to the car. His windows rolled down.

409
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 I go, "Hey, listen, man."

410
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I go, "That kid's an idiot. That kid's an idiot, and he deserves to get his ass kicked."

411
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 I agree.

412
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 But he's 16 years old.

413
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 We were 16 years old once. We thought we were the toughest guy around.

414
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 You got to cut the guy break, dude.

415
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And Douglas, without even really looking at me, goes,

416
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 "I don't care. That kid's got to pay. He's going to get his ass beat."

417
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 That wasn't my ace in the hole.

418
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Then I said this, "Hey, listen, man. When that cop car pulled up,

419
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I saw you throw the knife under your car, and I could have ratted you out.

420
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 I could have told the cop right there what I saw.

421
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And this wouldn't happen. But I didn't.

422
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 I did you a favor. Do me a favor. And leave the kid alone."

423
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 I played my card. I set it right down on the table.

424
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And he sat there. He's staring into Godfather's.

425
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 He's thinking about it.

426
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And then without saying a word, he just nods his head, puts the car in reverse, drives home.

427
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 About a week or two later, so I'm not going to say who this guy's name was,

428
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 because he was making a rude comment to me. I don't want to throw him under the bus.

429
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 He may feel differently now, but maybe like a week later,

430
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 one of the guys who was involved, one of the guys in the group,

431
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 he goes, "Yeah, so you didn't rat out Douglas because you were afraid.

432
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 You were afraid he was going to come after you."

433
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And I remember saying this. I go, "Listen, the last thing that kid needs is to be in prison."

434
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 That's not going to help him at all, because I knew his story.

435
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 I knew that he came from a good family and then a member of the family made a tragic mistake,

436
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 and he was psychologically paying for it.

437
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 He was doing not great stuff out there.

438
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 I mean, he was helping women change their tires on their car, that's good.

439
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 But I remember saying that. I wasn't afraid of it.

440
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Him going to prison would serve nobody any good at all.

441
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 That dude, Douglas, now, last I checked, because I was talking to someone about it a couple of years ago,

442
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 married with kids, has a great job, he moved past it.

443
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 He moved past that time period in his life.

444
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 So I know I made the right call.

445
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And oddly enough, this is why I don't really remember Anthony's name.

446
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 I probably could have remembered it, but that's why I gave him a fake name too.

447
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Oddly enough, three years later, me and Nick were walking through Citrus Heights one night,

448
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 because for some reason I thought the movie theater was open at three in the morning.

449
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 We were inebriated that night. It was like a three-mile walk.

450
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I remember we were walking. We ran into Anthony at this point. He's 19 years old.

451
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 His brain was rotted out on drugs.

452
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 He didn't recognize us. He wanted to fight us.

453
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 And we're like, "Dude, what are you talking about? We know you, dude.

454
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Remember from Godfather?" He's just like, "What are you talking about?"

455
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 I mean, I don't know what drug he was on. I don't want it.

456
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I don't want to be anywhere near it. We had to talk him out.

457
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 He was just nuts. He was nuts.

458
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 He was harsh on our buzz, man.

459
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 We were going to the movies at three in the morning.

460
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 We walked all the way to the friend of the movie theater.

461
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Nick's like, "Why did I let you talk me into this?

462
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Why did you think there would be a movie showing at three in the morning?"

463
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 I'm like, "I don't know, bro."

464
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Anyway, so that kid ended up blowing his brain on drugs.

465
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 I hope he's doing better now. He's kind of gotten lost in the mists of time.

466
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 But Douglas left that life behind.

467
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 It's funny because the end of the story, too.

468
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 I guess I should add this, because it kind of kept referencing it.

469
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 The other part of the story, so we got that situation taken care of.

470
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 This was like a 24-hour time period in my life, in my 20s.

471
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 This situation got taken care of, but now we have something else going on.

472
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 We have a bunch of witnesses who watched this fight break out

473
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 and this girl's car get dented when the infinity gauntlet punched the hood of her car.

474
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 So I go, "Listen, this isn't over."

475
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Because at any point, she could file an insurance claim,

476
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 and then the cops could get involved, and she's going to start giving me witness statements.

477
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 I don't know if it was the next day, because I kind of wanted to just get this taken care of.

478
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 It might have been the day after that, but...

479
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So a 48-hour time period in my life.

480
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Remember, I walked over to the beauty store.

481
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 We knew whose car it was, because we saw her come out and kind of look at the damage.

482
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Walked into the beauty store, and I scribbled down a phone number of a garage that I knew.

483
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Like a mechanic's garage, and I go, "Listen, really sorry about what happened."

484
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 I was just very nice as well for this.

485
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 I go, "Sorry for what happened to your car the other night."

486
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 I was very unfortunate.

487
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Here's a phone number of a garage.

488
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Here's some cash.

489
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 They'll fix it for you, and this is the end of it."

490
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 She's like, "Okay."

491
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Walked out.

492
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 So again, we needed to finalize everything.

493
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 We needed to finalize everything.

494
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Because I didn't need the cops going after Douglas.

495
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 I definitely didn't need the cops going after my boy Nick, right?

496
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Basically, it's a crime to get thrown into someone's car.

497
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 So that is a true crime Jason Carpenter story.

498
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 There's not many that I can actually tell.

499
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Sometimes I'm just like a neighborhood vandal and stuff like that,

500
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 and a lot of times I'll laugh about those privately.

501
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 When I'm up late at night, I'll chuckle to myself.

502
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 They're not really podcast material, because basically it turns me in to Dennis the Menace,

503
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 but like, super villain level pranks.

504
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Like, stuff you're like, "Oh my god, this is terrible."

505
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Maybe you guys would find it funny.

506
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 I don't know.

507
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Every so often I'll bring one up, and Sabine will be like,

508
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "Don't tell that story on the podcast, dude."

509
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 So I'm telling this one instead.

510
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 It was basically a 48-hour period of my life in my 20s

511
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 when I was hanging out with my friends.

512
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And I think the point of this story, other than the fact that I wheeled a hay hook,

513
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 and I fought a super villain, a little asterisk, I fought him with my words, you see.

514
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 And now he's a good guy.

515
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Now he's like a magneto in the new mutants.

516
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 He was a good guy.

517
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 I think it's just an interesting story, and I think that incidents like that,

518
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 when I reflect back on him, make me realize how far I've come,

519
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 because obviously I used to be like a knuckle duster type of guy.

520
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 I went out there assuming I was going to get in a fight when I walked out of that Godfather's beat.

521
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 So I didn't know a knife was going to be drawn on me.

522
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 I didn't know it was Douglas.

523
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 But when I found that out, I didn't run away.

524
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 Again, you can't do that.

525
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 You just kind of had to stand your ground.

526
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 And I think nowadays when trouble comes, I know a bunch of cops in town,

527
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 and I have friends with law enforcement.

528
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 So nowadays when someone messes with me, I'm just like,

529
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 "Oh, okay. Talk to my buddy at the station."

530
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 That's a privilege of getting older.

531
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 When you get older, you start meeting people.

532
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 You start making friends.

533
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 I ended up, it was so weird.

534
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 I used to tell cops, "There's nothing going on here, officer."

535
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 And then as I got older, I had a bunch of buddies who were cops in Sacramento

536
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 and up in Hood River.

537
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 I have a bunch of buddies who are in various levels of law enforcement and things like that.

538
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 So nowadays I don't even have the time.

539
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 I'm just like, "Can you take care of this for me?"

540
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

541
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 So I don't know if there's really a moral, but there is definitely.

542
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 I wanted to tell, because I've told conspiracy stories that involved me,

543
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 and I've told paranormal stories that involved me.

544
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 I wanted to tell a true crime story that involved me,

545
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 that didn't involve me basically pulling cartman level pranks on half a city block,

546
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 because those are the other stories.

547
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 I will tell the boat or story one of these days, because that is another one.

548
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 That was a story where words didn't matter, because when I had that boat or,

549
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 I stood between a bleeding man who was going to die within the next 10 minutes,

550
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 and a vicious, nightmare-inducing creature.

551
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 Totally real.

552
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 It was in the newspaper, and there was a ton of witnesses.

553
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 But I will tell that story on another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

554
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.

555

 Twitter is @DeadRabbitRadio.

 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

558
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

559
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Have a great weekend, guys.
