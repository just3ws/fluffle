1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 creatures from beyond the stars,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 aliens from another world,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 beings outside of our comprehension.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 These things have always puzzled and intrigued mankind.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 But what is their goal?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Some people say they're here to save the Earth.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Some people say they're here to enslave it.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But today we're going to take a look at two encounters

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 involving three different women

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 and a different take on the alien phenomenon.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 That aliens are here to breed with us,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 even if it's against our will,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 [music]

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 and I'm having a great day.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 You know, I'm going to start this episode off

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 with actually a recommendation for another podcast

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 that's normally not a good thing to do.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 But I've listened to another podcast,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 and I really think you guys would dig it.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I really think you guys would love this podcast.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 It's a fictional podcast,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 but it deals with a lot of the stuff

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 that Dead Rabbit Radio talks about.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And it's a radio drama,

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and it's extremely well done.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 You're stepping in,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I'm not getting sponsored by these guys, trust me.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 When I tell you what it is,

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 you guys will be like,

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 "No, there's no way these guys gave you any money."

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 They really have a great way of building a soundscape.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You really feel like you're part of the story.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 The podcast is called Wolverine the Long Night.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And it is, if you took Dead Rabbit Radio,

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 all the stuff we cover, threw it in a blender,

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 and then dropped Wolverine into it.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 It's Twin Peaks Season 3 with Wolverine running around.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It has like lay lines and haunted sacred spots

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 and old Native American legends.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 You have government conspiracies.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 You have true crime.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 You have like corrupt official--

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 not true crime, because it's fictional,

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 but you have like criminal organizations in the town.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 You have eco-terrorists.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You have all of this crazy stuff.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And then Wolverine's just running around,

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 just gutting people the whole time.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And it's the Wolverine I grew up with,

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 because in like in the 80s,

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 he was a merciless murderer.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Like he was an X-Men,

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 but he was constantly killing low-level goons.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And this is him.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 He murders so many people over the course of the story.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I think the story probably has a body count of maybe 70 people.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 That he just guts the whole time.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Not fan fiction.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Wolverine, the Long Night.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I can't--that's season one.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Season one's a self-contained story.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Season two's coming out now.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I can't vouch for that.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But season one, I really--

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 it's a fictional version of the stuff we cover on this show

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 with guts everywhere.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It's great. Check it out.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Okay, let's move on to our podcast.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 We--the both of our stories today are related.

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And they're not--they're not only related in the way that you think that they are.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 It's very, very interesting that it came across both these stories

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 in such a short amount of time.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But let's go ahead.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 It's March 30th, 1988.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 A mother and a daughter.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Mom's name is Carol.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Daughter's name is Helen.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Carol and Helen Thomas.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 They work at the same factory.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 So they meet up.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 This is in Britain.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 They meet up and they take--they walk together.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 That's fun, little mother-daughter activity, hanging out, doing stuff.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 They go through a walk through the alleyway.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Well, not just any alleyway.

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 There's an alleyway they walk through to get to work.

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Broad daylight.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Isn't in the middle of the night. It's not in the middle of the forest.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 That's what makes the story particularly creepy.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Carol and Helen Thomas are on their way to work.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 They're walking through the alleyway.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And they start to hear a loud humming coming from overhead.

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 They see a bright light.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 So, hmm, that's the humming noise.

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 That's not the light noise.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And then, boop, bright light.

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 They feel dizzy and nauseous for just a second.

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And they just continue to walk through the alleyway.

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But now, they don't like blink.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 They don't like--they're walking and then they're simply like mid-step.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 But now, Heather's jacket, her leather jacket, is soaking wet.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 It wasn't raining.

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 The rest of their clothes are bone dry.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 They heard the humming and the--bip, they didn't hear the light.

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 But they saw the light and then they're back in the alleyway just walking.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 But now, her jacket is drenched.

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 They're like, "What the hell just happened?"

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Quite odd.

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 They get to say the least, to say the least.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I'm sure like she's like--I don't know how I would react in that situation.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I would probably also wet my pants.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I mean, like imagine just going about your business and then you turn a corner

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 and part of your body is soaked.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You'd be like, "What? Is there a super-shocker nearby?"

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Did I walk through a low-hanging cloud, a human size, a jacket-sized cloud?

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 What could have possibly happened?

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 They get to work and the guard is like, "Dude, where you guys been, man?

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 You guys are late.

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You guys are--you guys--we're supposed to be here like an hour or two ago."

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And they're like, "What?"

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And he's like, "And you're fired because your jacket is wet."

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 No, they didn't do that.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 But they did think it was weird because they're normally punctual.

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And they're like, "We just left our house."

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And the guy's like, "Oh, just go in there and do whatever you did."

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 That Jason did it right down.

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 They just work at this nondescript factory.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Over the next couple of weeks, they start to get blisters over their body.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 They start to get blisters specifically on their face and their arms.

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Now, that's bad enough because you're like, "What is going on?"

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Like blisters coming out of nowhere is disgusting.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Blisters are disgusting anyways.

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I actually learned a tip if you walk a lot because I walk a lot.

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Where two pairs of socks, because that way you don't get blisters

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 because your foot is the sock.

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I don't know what the science is behind it, but it does work.

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So anyways, they didn't have socks to put over their heads and arms.

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 They're getting blisters everywhere.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 They started to have nosebleeds.

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And grossly enough, even grosser than all that stuff,

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 they started having an unknown substance leak out of their navels.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So at that point, I mean, you figure you're probably rotting.

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 But six years later, they end up running into Tony Dodd,

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 who was a big UFO investigator at the time.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 He wrote a book involving this story called "Alien Investigator."

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So basically himself.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 AI, Alien Investigator.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 That would be a cool magnipi show.

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Like you have him in the Baham-- Never mind, this guy's in England.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 That would be super dreary.

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He couldn't make anything fun in England.

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Anyways, so forget my story, Pitch.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Alien Investigator Tony Dodd.

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 He goes-- That's an interesting story because they always had suspicions about what happened.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 But it didn't really fit to anything they knew of.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Happened in the middle of the day, in the middle of the city, both of them together.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And the only thing they knew was the humming, the light, and a wet jacket.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Oh yeah, and the blisters and the horrible body trauma.

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Tony Dodd has them undergo hypnosis.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And this is what they remember through hypnosis.

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So I know a lot of people kind of poo-poo on hypnosis, and it may--

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I've always seen it as a double-edged sword,

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 where at some points, like, that may be the only way you get that information,

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 but on the other hand, in the hands of--

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 There's a lot of hands in this segment.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 In the wrong hands, it can--

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 In an unscrupulous hypnotist or someone with an agenda, they can definitely do all that stuff.

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Not, like, actually abduct you, but you know what I mean?

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Like, they can put false memories in your head.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 So it's always hard to really know how to take hypnosis stories.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Some of them could be true in getting information we couldn't get otherwise,

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 and then other ones could be totally false and made up because someone has an agenda.

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 But this is the story that came out with Carol and Helen Thomas.

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 When that bright light flashed, they disappeared out of the alleyway.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 They were basically beamed aboard somewhere.

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 They wake up in a totally sterile white room,

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 which is something how you would imagine like a science room or a high-tech room to be.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 They're both frozen on tables.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Carol looks over, she can barely move, she looks over, she sees Helen laying on the table next to her,

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 but she didn't necessarily seem conscious at this point.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And the room was populated by what we know of as gray aliens.

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Three to four feet tall, big old bulbous heads, tiny little skinny bodies, and giant eyeballs.

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Little tiny slip mouth. The classic gray alien figure.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 She said the room had a window, it was like a circular room,

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 and the room had a window all the way around, almost like an observation room.

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 So you could imagine there's probably other aliens outside watching it, other alien medical students.

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And she noticed that there was a wet, net-like material over her legs that was keeping her immobile.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 It was like a wet, netted cloth, is how she described it.

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I don't know what they did to keep her upper body immobilized,

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 but she at least noticed that there was a wet, netted cloth, is how she put it, that kept her immobilized.

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 When the aliens touched her, she said their skin was wet to the touch.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Very amphibian-like. They weren't...

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They always figured that gray aliens were kind of dry, maybe a little flaky, maybe dandruff-like bodies made of dandruff.

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 But apparently in her, I've always liked the reptilians, I'd imagine, would be kind of slimy,

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 but she's saying the grays were actually wet to the touch.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And what she noticed was one of the aliens was really into Helen's leather jacket.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 So the point that he took it off her and began rubbing it all over him, so that was how it got drenched.

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 He was rubbing the jacket all over his face and body, because he was so intrigued by the feel of the leather jacket.

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And that's how it got drenched. Disgusting, absolutely disgusting.

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 He's like, "Ugh!"

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 They probably abduct so many cows that to see a cow in its unnatural form, in its leather form,

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 he's like, "What is this? Oh man, I remember this feeling. I remember the feeling of my first cow abduction."

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Anyways, he's rubbing it on himself. He lived in the memories of his first cow.

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 She notices, Carol notices, it's funny, because all of these, now that I'm looking at my notes,

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 all of these really seem to come from Carol's point of view.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I wonder if Helen just kind of was a dud when it came to the hypnosis, or she just never woke up during the procedure.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But she notices these glass vials being put on their belly buns, her and Helen's belly bun.

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And she said, "I couldn't say for sure what they were doing, but I had a feeling."

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Because they never communicated with me, they never talked to me, or tried to calm me down or nothing like that.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I had a feeling that what they were doing is they were removing our eggs from our body.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Removing our little tiny human eggs through our belly button.

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 She had two final details. One has been reported in other UFO encounters, where there were monitors in the room

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 that were showing footage of violent actions and war movies.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Like war movies like "Saving Private Ryan." But like footage of like actual live leak level footage of people getting their heads blown off during war.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And that has actually, other UFO abductees have seen things like that as well. Seen violent visual images.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Now, some people have said that's to show us that Earth is on a doomed path if we could. I don't think so.

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I think if that detail is true, and if it's not just a side effect of the trauma of being abducted by an alien,

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I think it's probably something more to disorient the viewer. Because people hate watching shocking stuff,

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 especially if they, I know some people are like super edgy and they're into it, but for the most part a normal person doesn't want to watch a bunch of people getting blown up.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 So if they're already trying to mess with your head, that's a good way to do it. It's very clockwork-orange-ian.

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Especially if it's something that brutal. Because it would just be a process, it would be part of the process of breaking down your mind.

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Again, there is another interesting detail. At some point a tall humanoid entered the room, and it's described as what we call a Nordic alien.

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 A Nordic alien is one of the biggies. It's one of the famous alien types. We have the grey aliens, we have the reptilians, which is kind of self-explanatory,

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 and then we have the Nordics, and they are tall humanoid. They're basically tall humans, or blonde-haired blue-eyed aliens.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Now, generally they're considered to be, some people consider them to be the good aliens, and then some people think that they're actually the evil alien.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I mean, who knows if any of this is real, but there's a lot of discussion on who's good and who's not.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 But anyways, at some point the tall humanoid, the tall Nordic wakson, and he's wearing a silver suit.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Again, we've seen that detail quite a lot, like a silver unitard. And on the suit there was an insignia that was a blue bladge with a special emblem on it.

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It was a circle, a triangle, and two wavy lines.

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Now, that's really all the information we get out of this. Nobody can really follow it up because the names Carolyn, Helen, Thomas may not be true.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Tony Dodd in his book said, "Some of these names I've changed for the sake of privacy." So there's really no follow-up to this story.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And it's one of those things like, how would you follow it up? Like, even if you located these people, there's either one of two things going on.

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Probably not. Well, three. One, they're totally freaked out all the time, afraid it's going to happen again.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Two, they've moved on with their lives. Or three, they don't want to talk to you or they've gone missing. I guess that's four.

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That's that. I mean, we really have to go, well, we don't have to, but I mean, Tony Dodd wrote this and you can either accept it as true or not.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But I remember reading it and thinking, "That's an interesting story."

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And then shortly later, it was on the same day because I was reading a bunch of UFO stuff for this episode.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I found another intriguing story along the same vein with a few interesting differences and one very, very interesting similarity.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And these stories are not connected in any way. Even the articles that I read about them weren't like, "Oh, it's like this similar incident."

244
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So I was like stumbling across that stuff and making those connections that really haven't been made before.

245
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Let's go ahead. We are going to walk through an alleyway in Britain, disappear from New York, and we're going to appear in Arizona.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Your clothes are wet, mine aren't. And we're back at the Superstition Mountains. We've been here a lot in this podcast, really.

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 There was the skeleton running around with the light bulb in his shower, the lantern in his chest. We had the camel, the haunted camel.

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 I really like that story. That one is great. I tell that story to people, like on the street. Stop them.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Hey, sir, have you ever heard the story about the, what was that, Colorado Phantasma? Yeah, I really like that story, because it kind of has like a beginning, a middle, and an end.

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 You get all the details and then a little twist at the end.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Anyways, it's March 2000. We're in Arizona Superstition Mountains.

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 There's a young woman named Angie, and we know that's a fake name.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And this is the way this story goes, is that Angie, who's a pseudonym, apparently told her friend, Phyllis Davis, who wrote this up for this UFO website.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 So, there's a little bit more, that might seem a little more iffy, because, well, I guess the same thing is right in the book.

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Get it right. It has the same level of credibility, but okay, let's get it. So, yeah. Let's go ahead and do this.

256
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So, Angie is hiking. She loves hiking up the Superstition Mountains.

257
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So what she enjoys doing, I don't get it, walking up stuff. It's kind of lame.

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Walking down stuff is kind of lame too. Just walk in a normal flat plane.

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Like, what's the point of elevating yourself? Doesn't make any sense.

260
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Anyways, she walks up these mountains and then walks down, and she goes, man, that was a fun day.

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 She walks up, and she also likes to bring home gems.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Little rocks. Little shiny rocks. She likes to take them home and then put them on her mantle.

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Again, it just seems like such a bizarre hobby.

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I'm not a big experience guy. Like, I'm not a big experience hobbyist.

265
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Like, people, in Hood River, there's a big community of like Windsor version stuff like that.

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And I get, I mean, like, yeah, let's go out to the river and like surf a bit, and then we come home.

267
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Like, I don't get that. I think it's because my memory is so shoddy that I could have a wonderful adventure and then just not know.

268
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I know within a year I'm barely going to remember it. I just am not an experience. I don't travel.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I'm just not an experience guy. But anyways, so she is, and I guess she's bringing home rocks, so, you know, that's cool too.

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 There's a nerd. She sees a cave off in the distance, and she goes, oh, I never noticed that cave before.

271
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I'm going to go in that cave, catch some shade. Well, she goes into the cave, she's drinking her water.

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 She sees a shiny, shiny rock on the ground. She bends over to pick it up, and then she's driving home.

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Superstition Mountains are behind her, and she's in her car and she's driving home, and she's like, what happened, dude?

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 What is going on? And she's trying to reconstruct like how she got from the cave into her car, start of it, and drove.

275
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Good couple miles before she gets her memory back. She's like, what in the world just happened?

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 She goes home and she takes a two-hour-long shower, and she goes, I don't know why, but I just felt compelled to just keep scrubbing myself and da-da-da-da-da.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And yeah, I think you kind of can get where this story is going.

278
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 The next couple days she's completely depressed. She won't show up to work. She won't return anyone's phone call.

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 People think there's something wrong with her. There is something wrong with her. They go to her house, and she's just basically laying on her couch.

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 She's like, hey, Angie, you got to do something. She's like, first off, it's not my real name, but secondly, I don't have to do anything.

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 I don't know what's going on. I just feel super crummy, and I can't remember anything.

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 She's telling people, it's up in the mountains, I was finding rocks, and the next thing I was driving my car, and people were like, did you get brain damage or something?

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Did you fall? Because that can happen. You can have like temporary amnesia.

284
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 She starts having all these nightmares. She can't figure stuff out. And finally, someone says, dude, you got to go see somebody.

285
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Now, she ends up going to a hypnotist. Now, I don't know if that was her first course of action. She's like, why can't I remember stuff? I'm going to go to a hypnotist.

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Or if she went to, she went like a route where she went to a doctor who referred her to a psychologist who referred her to a hypnotist and so on and so forth.

287
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 But at this point, people are kind of working on the theory that she may have gotten sexually assaulted or something traumatic happened to her, or she suffered some sort of brain injury, which I think is why you want to go to the doctor first.

288
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Figure out what happened. At the hypnotist, there's a very, very interesting story. Very interesting story, because a lot of it, there's little details in it that are quite believable.

289
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 She goes to the hypnotist and this is the story that comes out. She goes, I was bending over in the cavern to pick up the rock.

290
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And I heard something behind me and I turned around and I saw a man wearing like a reptile mask, like a Halloween type mask of a reptile.

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 And I go, Charlie, is that you? Because she could only imagine that it was a human in a mask. And it's funny because there have been situations I've been in that have been equally shocking.

292
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Not as shocking as what's coming up for her, but I've been in situations that have been shocking. I remember when my car got, and I'm not comparing my car stolen to what happened to her, but I remember when my car got stolen.

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I remember checking my pockets for my car. Did I put it in my pockets? And then I thought, maybe I left it in my apartment.

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And then I go, wait, of course I can't fit a car in my pocket, but you're in shock. I was in absolute shock that my car got stolen right out of my driveway.

295
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 That was the first time that it happened. It happened multiple times after that, but it's the first time that it ever happened. I was like, where did I, is it in my pocket?

296
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And so your brain makes these weird leaps of logic when you're shocked.

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So when she's out in the middle of nowhere all by herself and sees a human, humanoid, with a reptile mask, she's going to assume someone, a friend of hers was trying to pull a prank on her, because she's in shock.

298
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But it doesn't take her long to realize it's not Charlie, and by the way the face is moving, it's not a mask.

299
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 She doesn't remember anything after that until she wakes up in some sort of room.

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 She wakes up and she's held down by what she describes as a gelatinous substance. So the same type of restraint used in the case in England in, I think it was 1988.

301
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 One was a net-like wet cloth. This one's a gelatinous thing, but there's some, they're not held down by any sort of psychic ability or clamps or cages like yesterday's episode.

302
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 There's some sort of substance that really can't be identified on top of them, holding them down.

303
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 So her captors, according to her, were reptilians, and she said they had great greenish skin, so it wasn't like a super green iguana, just had a green hue to their scales.

304
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 It was interesting, she said some of them had big mouths with lots of like folds around their mouth, and some of them had thinner mouths with no folds around their mouth.

305
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And she thought that could be a signifier of how old they were.

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Let me read you this description here for how she described how the aliens were dressed and things like that.

307
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 "Two aliens wore either a gray scarf or a wide ribbon draped over their shoulder. Under the soft-looking ribbons, they wore a white jumpsuit," which we get that a lot, the jumpsuit.

308
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 "A white jumpsuit with an insignia that showed a curved dragon with a seven-point star in the middle of it. The other reptile men wore black uniforms with the same insignia.

309
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 "A tall white skin, so taller than the rest of them, a tall reptilian enters the room who has white scales," comes inside.

310
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 "The tall white-skinned lizard man wore a burnt orange jumpsuit with three insignias on the left side. There was a black inverted triangle, the round dragon with star, and an oval with moving stars on it."

311
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 She felt fascinated by that one. It looked like watching a 3D movie in miniature.

312
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 "On the right side of his uniform wore three black bars on a silver disc. On the left cuff of his sleeve he wore a row of inverted triangles with three lines cutting through it."

313
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 I found that last one the most intriguing because that insignia sounds near identical to the insignia in the 1988 story.

314
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 The 1988 story had a little less detail to it, but she described a blue badge with a triangle and two wavy lines.

315
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And this one, he wore a row of inverted triangles with three lines cutting through it.

316
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Now, you could say there's only so many geometrical shapes that can be out there. Of course, there's going to be some similarities, but the fact that they're wearing badges in the first place are interesting.

317
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I've never really come across that in Alien Abduction stories, where they're actually wearing these insignias. I'm sure that they're out there, but these guys seem to be particularly suited up.

318
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Is the triangle and the two wavy lines and the row of triangles and the three lines are those different ranks within this alien hierarchy?

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Is it an emblem of a scientist? Because remember the humanoid who came in and they can't remember anything past that in 1988, he was wearing this emblem. He was in charge.

320
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And in this story, the white skinned alien reptile walks into the room and he's also wearing this emblem and he's in charge.

321
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And what's interesting is she said, Angie said, she goes, "I could tell that he was more human. He was sympathetic.

322
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I felt like I could communicate with him rather than the other ones." Now, she's obviously pleading to be let go and these reptilians are just kind of moving about, but she goes to the tall white skinned one, seem to be more compassionate.

323
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 She has a vague feeling of what's going to happen because she's strapped down to this table and she's surrounded by all these aliens.

324
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And really, according to her report, she doesn't even really know if she's on a UFO. She's just somewhere.

325
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 But they take off her clothes and now the fear is welling up in her and she's pleading to this lead alien, this tall white skinned reptilian to let her go.

326
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 But in the back of her mind, she has a really bad feeling about what's going on.

327
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And that's when she starts to notice there are these pipes running along the room, like these long pipes that just kind of are on the wall and all the ceiling.

328
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And each pipe has a couple of sacs hanging from it.

329
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And she's looking at it, it catches her attention, she's looking at it and she sees something move in the sac and she goes, "Immediately I was reminded of when my dog was pregnant and super pregnant and the puppies were moving in her belly."

330
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 She goes, "I knew for sure then that something was alive in all of those sacs hanging around me and I know for sure then what they were going to do to me, why I was in this breathing chamber."

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Another alien, like she described him as a tall, not as tall as the big giant leader one, but this tall muscular alien.

332
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And this one has human genitalia. I mean obviously it wasn't like fleshy, it was reptilian, but he had an erect penis and she completely lost it because now she knows it's time, it's do or die time.

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 She begins fighting so hard she starts breaking through the gelatinous ooze that is holding her down to the point that one of the aliens has to break out a stun gun.

334
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And the last thing she remembers is a blue light hitting her in the face and then she's driving down the road.

335
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The person who wrote this up for this UFO website said, "Angie's doing a lot better now. She had a really hard time when she went through the hypnosis, she was having even worse time because now she's really trying to figure out what was going on.

336
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 You'd much rather have fallen down and gotten brain damage, but nowadays she's doing fine. She just has never gone back to the superstition mountains.

337
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 The place that she always went to go and enjoy hiking around and fighting rocks, she never went back there. She doesn't like talking about it, she doesn't even like looking at them.

338
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 A lot of interesting details to these stories. One, you have the similar, you have like a physical item holding them down rather than some sort of stunning device or telepathy or something like that.

339
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 You have the insignias matching or having close enough of a match that if you saw someone with an eagle and two stars on their lapel and you saw someone, another person, with an eagle and two triangles on the lapel, you would go that they're probably related in some way.

340
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 You know, you can see comparisons between even military medals and go, "Oh, these guys must be in the same military range."

341
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 It's not like one guy has a bear, the other guy has a rooster. These ones have the triangles and the wavy lines or the triangles and the straight lines and things like that, which would make me think that those are related in some way.

342
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Both of them involve people who are being abducted for what we believe and for what they believe to be the purpose of interbreeding with humans.

343
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 So we have the insignia matching these stories. If the insignia was on the story about aliens doing crop circles, it would be a little less of a connection.

344
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 We have two people separated by 22 years on two different continents, describing two similar incidents with a similar styled badge.

345
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Two stories of abduction separated by 22 years involving three women. Both involve interbreeding with aliens, both involve doing it against their will.

346
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Both involve a taller alien, both of them involve memory loss.

347
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Flights of fancy, possibly, but it could also point towards a very dark program going on on the planet Earth.

348
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Are human women being abducted and being used to create alien hybrids? That question is as old as sci-fi itself.

349
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 The miracle of life, the fact that women can even give birth is such a miracle on this planet.

350
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And for it to be perverted for some unknown reason, there's thousands of theories of why aliens, if they do this, if any of this is true, why aliens would do this.

351
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Is it an invasion? Do they want an alien hybrid army to infiltrate us? Is it to prepare humanity for the coming climate change?

352
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Is it a way to create superhumans, humans who have special emotional and psychic abilities in to go children, as they're known, to help lead humanity towards a greater future?

353
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And I could go on and on with the theories surrounding alien hybrids. But my personal theory is probably the most frightening.

354
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 I believe if aliens are abducting women, and either through physical sex or removing their eggs, this program to create hybrids, to create a human alien offspring, I think it's being done for the same reason why someone walks up a mountain.

355
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Because it's there. Because they can. Because why not?

356
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 You have the technology at your disposal. You have a species around you that you consider lesser than yourself disposable. Why not?

357
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 The aliens that are around us may be less general MacArthur, may be less Gandhi, and may be more like John Wayne Gacy or Ted Bundy, but just with suits and badges and spaceships.

358
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 We always assign these ideas that they're either these generals in these intergalactic armies, or they're peace-loving aliens ready to bring us to the ninth dimensional level.

359
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 But they may just be an organization made up of "normal people."

360
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Even in the best organization on Earth, there is at least one psychopath. At least one.

361
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 So there may be some grand galactic army out there hoping to rid the world of the evils and bring about the Golden Dawn.

362
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 But that doesn't mean that the tall lizard creature on Earth, currently researching Sector 997 of the Superstition Mountains, doesn't decide to run a test on a lonely hiker drinking a bottle of water.

363
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 A test that doesn't really need to be done, but a test that he wants to do, because it's there. And he can.

364
