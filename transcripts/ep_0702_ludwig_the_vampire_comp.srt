1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A young child watches a strange phenomenon obey traffic laws,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,500
 and we take another look at an old American disaster to find out it's worse than we thought.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we travel to 1890s New York to meet a tiny little man who has a bizarre claim to fame.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 As rowdy alcoholics are being thrown out of bars, this man waits in the darkness

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 to drink the blood from their bodies today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having an awesome weekend.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 This is, uh, supposedly super hot pre-recording this episode too.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I was not waiting until I got 104 outside.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I'm recording this when it is calm 80 degrees.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I'm recording this a couple days earlier before this heatwave melts the planet.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Speaking of melting the planet, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 He's walking into Dead Rabbit Command on a tidal wave of lava.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It's Coda 119. Everyone give a round of applause to Coda 119.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Don't get too close to them. You will die.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 You 100% die. It is that hot with the hot lava.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Coda, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Coda, we got a lot of stuff to cover.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So first off, I'm gonna give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 We are driving on out to Santa Rosa, California.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 [Clapping]

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Coda's driving this little Jason Jalopy down the street.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I found this story online. It was written by user Amherst Doldrums1980.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 We're gonna go ahead and give her the name of Judy.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And if that's your real name, it's just a stab in the dark.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Santa Rosa, California, Judy is a nine-year-old girl at the time.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 She's not a nine-year-old girl writing this, as far as I'm aware.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 She is. She has great grammar.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 But Judy was in Santa Rosa, California at this time.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And she's riding her bike to the Sonoma County Airport.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 She-- Let me back up here.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Back up here, you're like, "What? Is this girl running away or something?"

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Judy in Santa Rosa, California, she likes to ride her bike.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I guess that's her friend because I don't have to go that far back, right?

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Her dad's teaching her how to ride bikes the day your train wheels get taken off.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 That's too far back.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 The reason why she's going to the Sonoma County Airport is because they always have--

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 This actually makes a lot of sense.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 It used to be you could go-- You're like, "Just tell the story."

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 You could go on all these tangents.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 When I was a kid, and I'm sure I'm a little bit older than this person,

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 but not by much. I'm assuming they were born in 1980.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 You could just walk into an airport.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 You could walk up to the departure area of planes and just wave,

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 and people are like, "Oh, that's sweet. Who's that? Is that our nephew?"

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 You're like, "No, I thought that maybe it was your nephew."

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 You're just waving goodbye to random people, and then you're giving them the next slit motion,

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 and then you walk away.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 You could just walk around airports.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 You could hang out at airports. You could go eat the food.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 But you can't do that anymore.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 You were able to do that-- I distinctly remember the day when you could no longer do that.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It was September 11th. They said, "You can't do that anymore.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 We have all these boarding passes and security checkpoints."

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Before, you were just able to kind of walk to wherever.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 So it would make sense back when-- So let's assume this girl was 1980, so it's 1989.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 You would be able to go to the county-- This is my-- Okay.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 The reason why she's going-- You're looking at your watch.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 The reason why she's going to an airport is because it has a fully stocked vending machine.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 They have all the best snacks at Sonoma County Airport.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I could have just said that, what, six minutes ago.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So in Sonoma County Airport, Judy is riding her bicycle there to get some tasty, tasty snacks.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And she's riding down this road. She's done it many, many times.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 She sees a large oval floating.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Just floating there.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And she said it was like a gold ring.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Remember like Sonic the Hedgehog?

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 You know, the-- She said, "I don't know what a gold ring is. I don't have to be some video game nerd."

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 It's like this giant gold ring.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 It almost feels like a portal.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It appears big enough for you to step through.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And it's at a slight angle.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So it's like this golden oval, about human size, at a slight angle.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And it's just floating there.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And she's riding her bike and she sees this thing.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And it begins to move down the street.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And she's watching this oval.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And she realizes something weird is going on.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Other than the floating object that shouldn't exist.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 She said, "This area is like an industrial district."

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 As you get close to the airport, it becomes an industrial district.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And of course, you know, you got planes flying overhead.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 She said, "As this oval, as this floating oval was getting closer."

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And she-- And the reason why I used the ring analogy, you could see through it.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 You could totally see through it.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It wasn't like a portal, like a hole in reality.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 It was a ring that you could see through.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 You could see what was on the other side.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Still our reality.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Just this circular thing.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 She says, "As it moved closer, she realized it made no noise."

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 But it's even weirder than that.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 She said, "As it got closer, it absorbed the noise from the environment around it."

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 So the cars honking, the airplanes flying overhead,

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 the industrial plants doing their thing.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Those sounds got dimmer and dimmer as this thing got closer.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 It was like absorbing the natural sounds of the world.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 This object is floating down the road, and it comes to a stop sign, and it stops.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 There's kind of hovering there for a second.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 She's on her bike.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 She's looking at this thing.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And the sounds of the world seem dull.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And then it turns left and continues going down the road.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Judy says while she's seeing this thing that she had a natural primitive reaction to leave.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 That whatever this was, she shouldn't be here.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 It shouldn't be here.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 But now that it is, she should leave.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 She said her lizard brain really kicked in a gear and made her leave the area.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 She pedals on home, snackless.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 That's the end of the story.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It has some interesting elements to it.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 It takes place in the day, which again, I like those things.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And we've covered a few stories where sound has been manipulated.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I'll put one of them in the show notes personally where I had my voice muffled.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I wasn't some guy who wasn't holding a chloroform rag to my face.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I was speaking in a house.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I was screaming in a house actually, and the person upstairs couldn't hear me.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I always think it's interesting when, because we, this is something we find soulless in.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Right?

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 That if at least, if let's say we all go in a haunted house together, we're on some spook hunt.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And we're looking for ghosts.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And I'm in one room, you're in the other room, and I'm being violently attacked.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 You want to know that you can scream for help and someone can help you.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 You have this element that's absorbing the sound.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 What if something had happened to it?

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And the fact that it's this weird oval shape.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Wait, would you try to jump through it?

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Jason, no.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 No, after all this?

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Absolutely not.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Would you try to jump through it?

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Would you try to walk through a portal?

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 If you saw a portal, this is an interesting question for us because we are pioneers on the frontiers of the spooky, the strange of the mysterious.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I'm also going to assume we're not dummies.

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 But would you step through a portal?

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 It's kind of an interesting thought because if someone said, hey listen, I have this book, if you open it up, if you start reading it, it will drive you mad.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 You'd probably be inclined to look, right?

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 You'd probably be inclined to look.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 But would you step through a portal?

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 They're like, that book you want to read is through this portal.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It's an interesting thing.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Like, would you be willing to do that?

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I keep asking the question like I'm waiting for you to answer before I continue the podcast.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It's just something to think about.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I think, I always look at, I'm a far different researcher now than I used to be.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Nowadays, if someone put a book in front of me and they dusted it off and it's like a thousand year old tome,

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I said this book was written by some mad man and everyone who's read it's ever gone insane, do you want to read it?

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Back in the day, in my 20s, my 30s, I would start reading it while they were doing the introduction.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 They're like, oh come on man, let me build it up.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I'm already, ah, ah, ah.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Nowadays, I'd probably be like, nah, I'm good.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I mean, it's funny.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I think as you get older, you start to weigh risk reward more.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And I think that's not groundbreaking news.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 I think people get older, they go, ah, maybe I won't bicycle without a helmet.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Or maybe I won't start this street fight with just random dude.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 In your 20s and your 30s, you totally do that stuff.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 You're like, Jason, not in your 30s.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Not everyone started fights in their 30s like you did.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 But you know what I mean?

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Nowadays, I would be interested in the book, but I don't know if I would read it.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I don't know if I'd read it.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And so as a young man, I would totally step through a portal.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 100%.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 But as an older man, I'd be like, ah, can I take it home?

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Can I analyze it?

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Can I like throw a yo-yo through it and see if it comes through on the other side with a bunch of slime?

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 But yeah, it's interesting.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I think as you get older, you do become more cautious.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Or am I wrong?

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Would you, if you were 80 years old, I guess you got nothing to lose if you're 80 years old.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 But yeah, I don't know.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I don't think I'd step through a portal.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 But just food for thought.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I personally love portals.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I love portals.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 If they're ever going to do Jason Fanfiction, a portal must be involved.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Kodo 119, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgeable.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 We are leaving behind the Sonoma County Airport.

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 We are headed on out to Cape Canaveral, Florida.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 [Burps]

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 It's a beautiful day.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It's a beautiful morning.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It's January 28th, 1986.

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I'm actually 10 years old in this story.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And I'm walking through school.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You went to school at Cape Canaveral, Florida?

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 No, let's go back to California.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I was 10-year-old boy.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I was walking through school.

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I must have been like in the third or fourth grade or something like that.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And we all knew what today was, right?

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 It was this big day.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It was the day the Challenger Shuttle was going to go into space.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And it was going to have the very first civilian in space, Kristie McCullough, if I remember correctly.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And I remember walking through, where was I?

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Green Oaks at that time?

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I was in Orangeville.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Green Oaks, I'm walking.

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I think recess had just ended.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 We're sitting in the classroom and one of the teachers, our teacher is getting prepared to teach.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And another teacher comes into the room crying and she goes, "It blew up! It blew up!"

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 We're like, "What's the 10-year-old?"

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 We're like, "What? Oh no! Did the world blow up? Did the president blow up?"

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Like, "What blew up?"

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 It was the Challenger Shuttle.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 A Challenger Shuttle we found out later.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Now, there were a lot of classrooms that were watching this live.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 It was the first teacher in space.

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 They were tying it all into this education thing.

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And we weren't watching it live, but apparently I think the teachers were in the teacher's lounge were watching it live.

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 But some classes across America, they'd watch this live.

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I think most of us are familiar about what happened with the Challenger Shuttle, but just a quick overview.

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 It kept getting delayed.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 They'd bring all... This happened a lot when I was a kid.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They'd bring all the camera crews out to watch a shuttle launch and there'd be something wrong.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And all the news networks would complain and say the government was incompetent and they'd be like,

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 "We're going to reschedule it."

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And then they'd reschedule and they'd come back and there's like a pigeon flying by from the west

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 and it should be flying by the east.

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So they shut the whole thing down.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 This happened six times.

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 The media was kind of on Reagan's back about, "Oh, you're so incompetent. You can't even launch a thousands of tons of steel out of Earth's gravity."

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 What type of president are you?

230
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So now it's January 28th.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 They're getting ready to launch this bad boy again.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And the night before, it was super, super cold.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It was like one of the coldest nights on record for Florida.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 They actually called a meeting the night before, the people who developed the O-rings,

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 because basically the shuttle may have all these parts.

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I imagine it's like the Congress, the Senate from Star Wars.

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Because you have to have someone there who built each part.

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 The people who developed the O-rings go, "Don't launch tomorrow. Don't launch tomorrow."

239
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Because it's so cold, we think that's going to make the O-rings not work right.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And people are like, "Dude, there's literally millions of parts on this vehicle.

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 We've got to launch. I'm sure everything's going to be fine, but what happened was it got so cold the night before, the O-rings shrunk a little bit."

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 One minute and 12 seconds into the flight of the Challenger, there was a one millimeter gap in one of these O-rings that allowed superheated fuel to spew out of a tank.

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And the Challenger shuttle exploded in midair. You can watch the footage.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 You see the booster rockets kind of go off in two separate directions.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 We all know that story, but that story's not true.

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And I'm not saying it's not true of that conspiracy theory that the shuttle didn't really blow up and their lookalikes are still out there.

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 That's an old, normy conspiracy theory.

248
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Their lookalikes are like their brothers and sisters.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Like they're like, "This guy says he died." I looked aside, I just had to re-verify it.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 They're like, "This guy died in the Challenger shuttle, but we found a man that looks exactly like him that's around the same age."

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And he even has close to the same name. It's the dude's brother.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So yeah, all those things aren't there. I'm probably going to have the same last name. They're going to look alike.

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But anyways, that's one of those weird conspiracy theories that it was fake because they really didn't want a civilian in space.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I remember the early... because I used to be in conspiracy theories back when I was a kid.

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I remember hearing back when I was probably like 12 that the Challenger shuttle was planned.

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 The explosion was planned, but it was because they didn't want a civilian in space.

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 That was the conspiracy theory. Not that it was fake and they actually went to live real lives.

258
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Those conspiracy theories don't make sense. You'd have to pay the millions and millions of dollars a year to keep their trap shut.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 They could blew it up on purpose so no civilian would ever want to go to outer space.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 You'd have to be trained military because aliens are out there and stuff like that. That was that conspiracy theory.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And I didn't know this. You may have known this and you've already shut off the podcast because I kept saying the Challenger shuttle blew up.

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It didn't blow up. It didn't blow up. This is what I found the other day and I just wanted to share it with you.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 It's just an interesting and tragic piece of news.

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 When you watch this footage, you see an explosion. You see these booster rockets going other directions.

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 You don't see anything else but this giant cloud of smoke.

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 But the Challenger shuttle itself didn't explode. It was the external fuel tank that had this massive explosion.

267
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 This shuttle itself was covered in super heat resistant silicone tiles.

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It was totally protected from the heat of the blast and as far as we can tell, most, if not all, of the people on the shuttle were alive.

269
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Shortly after the explosion.

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 The explosion was so violent that this Challenger shuttle was hit with the force equivalent of 2 million pounds of sudden thrust.

271
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 20 G-forces are pushed upon these astronauts' bodies. They'd been training for 3 G-forces.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And after this explosion happens, the shuttle actually continues to rise for another 20 seconds.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Just the sheer shockwave of this thing continues to propel the Challenger shuttle forward.

274
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 That 20 G's of force wasn't enough to kill them. It wasn't even enough to knock them out. They would have been able to tank it for a bit.

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 They could do it. It would not be comfortable. But they could survive that initial blast.

276
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And as the space shuttle continues to climb for another 20 seconds.

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 After we were able to access parts of the Challenger after it came back down to Earth, we saw that some of the oxygen tanks were turned on.

278
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 So that means people were trying to activate their safety procedures.

279
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And the pilot, we can look at the control panel and see that he was flipping switches and trying to pilot the Challenger shuttle away from the explosion.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 He was doing his best to bring his team back to Earth safely. But that's not what happened.

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 The Challenger shuttle got to 12 miles high in the sky. And they're desperately trying to gain control of the shuttle.

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 On a wing and a prayer, maybe they can land this thing. They're 12 miles up in the air.

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 The fall back to Earth took 2 minutes and 45 seconds.

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 As far as we can tell, they were alive that entire time. It wasn't the explosion that killed them.

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 It was crashing a space shuttle into the Atlantic Ocean.

286
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It's funny. I didn't go looking for this story. I just kind of stumbled across it.

287
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 But I recently covered an episode about a cucumber found underwater. You're like, Jason, that's a weird segue.

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 If you'd listened to the episode, and again, I don't expect people to listen to every episode,

289
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 but I was talking about the cucumber underwater may have been some sort of safety capsule from an alien craft.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 If you haven't listened to the episode, it was the size of a human. It was a cucumber-shaped object and this monster popped out of it.

291
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 A humanoid monster.

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 My theory is that it felt like me. Who knows? But it felt to me that maybe this was some sort of safety, harness or safety mechanism that this alien ship bailed out of.

293
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I didn't have any proof for it. I called it my head cannon.

294
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 But I ended that episode by saying that exploration is such a dangerous thing and we salute the explorers out there.

295
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 You're breaking the bounds of your nation or your planet or your reality. You're trying to find out what's on the other side.

296
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And that was me putting on the conspiracy cap thinking that could have been what was lurking in the waters of Finnish Bay was this alien explorer.

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 But let's bring it back closer to home and realistic. I don't know if that's what that monster was.

298
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 It's just been a monster who loves to hide in cucumbers. But the people who died on the Challenger, they were explorers.

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 They were people who were risking everything to just visit space. They blew up.

300
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And it just showed danger. Exploration is so dangerous. I keep talking about whether or not to walk through a portal do I have that exploratory drive in me.

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 These people jumped inside a vehicle, a man made vehicle and tried to leave the planet and they died.

302
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So yeah, exploration is very, very dangerous. I just thought this was an interesting story.

303
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And it was something that I did not know. I always assumed that the Challenger shuttle blew up.

304
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 It was the fuel tank that blew up. I assumed they died instantly. No.

305
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 They had two minutes and 45 seconds to try to save themselves. It's a story. It's about human tragedy. It's creepy.

306
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And it tied into what we were talking about the other day. How dangerous exploration is.

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Kota 119. Let's go ahead and toss you the key. Kota's all sitting in the corner. It's like, "Man, this is sad. I don't want to go on any more adventures with you."

308
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 "Ah, this next one's good. This next one's not going to be depressing." Assuming you don't mind people being assaulted walking through the streets of New York City.

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Kota 119. I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter Copter. We're leaving behind Cape Canaveral. We are headed out to New York City.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 [Copter Chanting]

311
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And hit that little time travel button because we're going back to the early 1800s.

312
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Carbenter Copter is now sepia tone flying over the city that is New York.

313
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Buildings are a lot shorter back then. Everyone moved real quick. Do you know that's a conspiracy theory that Hans has?

314
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I've never covered that. You know, segue, but you know when you watch old-timey movies, people move really, really fast?

315
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And Hans isn't the only one who's had this conspiracy theory. I'll put it in the show notes, but you know when you watch old-timey movies,

316
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 everything moves super fast because that was just the frame rate of like old film. It was always just super fast.

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 The conspiracy theory is this, is that it has nothing to do with the film rate. When you're watching like a Buster Keaton movie,

318
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 when you're super bored and there's not a new Transformers movie to watch and you're just like, "Ugh!"

319
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 You have literally nothing else to watch. You're like, "Fine, I'll watch this Buster Keaton nonsense."

320
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And you put it in and everyone's going, "Doodle do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

321
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 It's because in the past, people used to move fast. That's what people really acted like back in the day.

322
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Back if you went and you met somebody, if you took a time machine and went back to the 1910s, everyone would be all,

323
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 "Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 "Teddy Roosevelt will be like, 'Poo!' and be like, moving around super fast and then there'd be like a girl in a dress and she'd faint."

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Basically, before 1910, the world moved at binny hill speeds where everything was just super fast.

326
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So the film was actually capturing life. Look at you guys are getting a bonus Hans episode. I didn't think we'd go down this round.

327
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Those old movies were actually capturing what the times were like back then. People wore faster and time is slowing down.

328
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Now if you put a camera up somewhere and someone walks by, there's no "Dun-un-dun-dun-dun-dun."

329
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 They're not doing the little old timey fast movements. The girl from the ring, Samara still keeping with the times.

330
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 She's retro. She's a hipster ghost, but everything else, time is slowing down.

331
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I guess he is kind of coming back. I guess he's been posting on Twitter and stuff like that.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 If you guys are new to the show, I'm sorry, I don't like doing in-jokes and stuff like that.

333
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 If you guys are new to the show, Hans is someone we followed for a long time. He's a conspiracy theorist.

334
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Most famously believes that monkeys aren't real. I'll put that episode in the show notes. We've covered him a couple times on here.

335
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 But Hans believes that. And he is not the only one. It's a very interesting conspiracy theory because it is observational based.

336
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It's an observational based conspiracy theory, which we see a lot of.

337
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But anyways, where were we going with-- oh, tiny vampires. Let's try to get through this tiny vampire story and see where we end up.

338
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 This story actually came to my attention. There's a website called Misfits and Mysteries.

339
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And they have a podcast as well. They've actually put out a ton of content.

340
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 I've only listened to a few other episodes. I can't vouch for everything.

341
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 If any episode's in, they start saying some crazy stuff. Don't hold it against me.

342
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 But Misfits and Mysteries, they put out a podcast if you're looking for another paranormal podcast.

343
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Like I said, I've only listened to a couple episodes. But I got this story from them.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 With additional reporting, I got from gangsannotated.blog.

345
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 They're like, "What? That's kind of a weird combination."

346
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Paranormal website and a gang-related website.

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 But here's why. There's a really interesting story.

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 My name-- well, it's Cason Garbender, but my podcast is Dead Rabbit. Dead Rabbit Radio.

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Dead Rabbit is old Irish gang slang. It means unstoppable or unkillable.

350
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Common vernacular. It was something they used back in the day to go, "Man, that guy sure is a dead rabbit."

351
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 It's Buster Keaton's running around really quick.

352
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 He's like, "Those cops will never catch him."

353
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It means super tough. And in the book, the Gangs of New York, which is a documentation of all of this activity of New York of the time,

354
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 you might have seen the movie by Martin Scorsese.

355
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 It's based on this book by Herbert Ashbury.

356
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 He talks about the gangs in New York, and there's a small passage in this book about Ludwig.

357
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 So bizarre. So bizarre.

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 In this book, Gangs of New York, there is a small passage about Ludwig the Bloodsucker.

359
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 You go, "Well, I saw the movie. There's Bill the Butcher." You know, he has-- it was-- who was that?

360
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Daniel Day-Lewis. Daniel Day-Lewis. He played Bill the Butcher. You know, probably Ludwig the Bloodsucker is just some colorful nickname.

361
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Well, in Herbert Ashbury's book, The Gangs of New York, which is talking about all this gang warfare, there's a little passage about a short dude named Ludwig who was covered in hair.

362
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Now, not like Chewbacca, but just had like a fur patch on his nose and fur coming out of his ears and big, bushy eyebrows and fur all over his head.

363
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It's just a furry looking dude. Not the dog boy furry, but you know, just imagine more of the old man from The Prince's Bride, Billy Crystal furry.

364
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And he would hang outside of bars. And he would just watch people go in and watch people go out.

365
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And they didn't see him. He was hidden in the darkness. He'd stand in there.

366
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And then every so often in the bar, they'd be like, "You! You've drank too much! You! You're getting rowdy! You're getting rowdy! Get this bum out of here!

367
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 '86 this Alki!" And then, you know, the security of the bar would throw out these rowdy drunks and they'd, "Ugh!"

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And they'd stumble out the front door and they'd land in the alleyway and be like, "Ugh! Martha's gonna kill me when she finds out. I spent all of our money."

369
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I got dark. I got dark super fast. That's a real problem. People do that. Oh man, that got dark.

370
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 But anyways, let's bring it back to the world of Ludwig because that unfortunately happens.

371
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 As this man stumbles home, there's a little figure hiding in the alleyway.

372
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Oh man, my wife's gonna kill me. I can't pay her a mortgage this week.

373
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 [Yells]

374
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 The alcoholic didn't say that. That was the sound of Ludwig leaping through the darkness and he would tackle this drunk man and begin sucking the blood from him.

375
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 [Makes a noise]

376
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 "Taste like despair. My favorite." [Makes a noise]

377
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 That's written in a book. That character is in a book. It's a true book. The Gangs of New York was based on anecdotes of the time, news articles of the time.

378
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And in the Gangs of New York, the book, there's this part about Ludwig the Vampire.

379
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 People are like, "What the wh- what the wh- why is this in here? Was this some urban legend going around back then? Like halfway through this book, he's talking about all these historical events."

380
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And he's like, "Oh by the way, there's this tiny vampire who lives in the Bowery who drinks the blood of alcoholics who get thrown out of bars."

381
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Then, after the second Dead Rabbit Riot and the call for Union troops and blah blah blah blah blah blah, people are like, "What the hell is going on, Herbert?"

382
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 People just figured it was an urban legend that had worked its way into this book.

383
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 But the website, Ashbury's The Gangs of New York Annotated, which is gangzanotated.blog, found an article. This is all they do, right?

384
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 They just talk about this book. You think they'd run out of stuff to talk about by now?

385
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 But they're always going to mine it for content. They found an article in a newspaper called The New York Mercury entitled, "A Human Bloodsucker."

386
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 They go, "This is it." I mean, like this would totally explain why Herbert Ashbury is talking about Ludwig the Bloodsucker.

387
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Because this is of the period, this would be the right time, the New York Mercury ran a newspaper article, about Ludwig Hellrifle, a tiny man covered in tufts of hair who was being interviewed by a reporter.

388
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 What had happened was Ludwig was being accused by his wife of attacking her while she was sleeping. He is biting her arms. He's trying to drink her blood.

389
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 This is salacious news. This would be salacious news nowadays. But back then this woman is claiming to the police, "Hey, I need a divorce from a husband. He's trying to drink my blood while I'm sleeping."

390
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 So this is how the story of Ludwig the Bloodsucker begins. And of course reporters want to know what's actually going on with this.

391
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 So a reporter is able to track down Ludwig. They have his name. They find Mr. Hellrifle and they go, "Hey, what's this thing about you trying to drink your wife's blood? You're biting her arms and stuff like that? She's accusing you of that."

392
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And Ludwig asks the reporter, "Do you know my wife, my wife Margarhtha?" You know Margarhtha? Reporters are like, "I don't know of any human by that name."

393
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Ludwig goes, "Okay, good. Because if you don't know my wife, let me tell you what's really going on." So the reporters get ready to take notes. And Ludwig goes, "I don't attack my wife and drink her blood."

394
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 The reporter's writing it down. Ludwig goes, "I do drink blood though." Reporters are like, "Wait, what?" Ludwig's like, "Yes, I do drink human blood."

395
00:29:46,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Let me tell you why. The reporter's getting super scared. He's like, "Oh no, I hope this isn't too spooky." He starts off by saying, "Listen, I'm German and Germans eat blood sausages and they say that's good, right?

396
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 But I drink blood. I mean, they're allowed to eat blood and no one cares. But I drink blood and everyone, ooh, freaks out.

397
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Like, come on man, drinking blood makes me feel so good. You should try it, bro. You should try it. I got some nice, uncongealed blood right here.

398
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 The reporter's like, "No, thank you." He's like, "Good. Because it was congealed, it probably would have made you sick." He goes, "Listen, they call me the blood sucker that's totally mean. I'm going to tell you why I drink this stuff other than the fact that it's super delicious and you should try some someday."

399
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 I was a little kid, because we're talking, this story's taking place like in the mid-1800s. When I was a little kid, I went to the doctor. I was super sick all the time and the doctor diagnosed me with something that's totally made up.

400
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 We know it's totally made up today. But back then, the doctor goes, "Well, I'm sorry, your son Ludwig's not feeling good." He has something called poverty of the blood. Poverty of the blood.

401
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 The parents are like, "What's that?" The doctor goes, "Well, what sounds like he has poor blood? His blood is begging for white blood cells from other people."

402
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 So make him eat as much meat as possible. Apparently, in this time in Germany, meat was a little bit harder to come by. But the doctor's like, "Dude, he has to eat meat. He has to go eat meat."

403
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 So they're feeding little Ludwig a diet of meat. And that's not working, just eating meat. Then they start serving him raw meat. And he's like, "Oh, man. Now I don't have poverty of the blood. I have middle class of the blood."

404
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 But he's still not 100%. So then they start buying him blood from the butcher shop. But I don't even think they're probably going to buy it, right?

405
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 The butcher's like getting ready to throw it down the drain. They're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I have some of that blood?" The butcher's like, "Yes, you sicko. Take it. Take it all."

406
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 He begins drinking animal blood. He gets super healthy. Now he has rich man of the blood. He's drinking this animal blood and everything's going great.

407
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 But when he was at school one day, a kid got a cut on his hand. He's like, "Ow, aw, man. I shouldn't have been running so fast."

408
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Dang time speeding up so much. And he has this blood dripping from his hand. And Ludwig's like, "Mmm."

409
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 The kid's like, "Can you get out of my ear? This isn't an ASMR podcast."

410
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And Ludwig somehow convinces this kid. Like, I don't know what someone would have to say to me. Maybe like a sexy lady, right?

411
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Like, she'd have to be like super sexy. If she has poverty of the sexiness, uh-uh-uh, no sucking on the blood.

412
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 But apparently he's able to convince his classmate, "Hey, dude, why don't you-- Hey, let's play a game, man. You live four square, right? Let's play your hand my mouth."

413
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 What game was that? What game was that? That sounds awful. But somehow Ludwig is able to convince this kid to let him lick the wound.

414
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And he does. And that's when Ludwig realizes that human blood is the tastiest, most energizing blood.

415
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 They didn't even know what energy was back then. They had no concept. But he's like, "Whoa, electrifying. Somebody stop me."

416
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And the kid, he saw it to this day, he's still sucking on that kid's hand. As the reporters interviewing him, there's this other dude.

417
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 This other adult with his hand in Ludwig's mouth. So once he realized human blood was the ticket, he began trying to get that.

418
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 He began trying to get human blood. But you know, it's hard to come by, right? Because it's usually in people who don't want to give it up.

419
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 So he settles for animal blood. And he's telling this whole story to the reporter. And the reporter's like, "What in the world are you talking about?

420
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Your wife's accusing you of drinking her blood while she's sleeping. And he's like, "No, I've never ever," he says, "I've never bitten her arms to get her blood."

421
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 So you're thinking, "Does she just normally bite her arms and that's how he fights?" Because I don't drink my wife's blood while she's sleeping.

422
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And he also says, "I want to set the record straight right now. I have never, ever broken into someone's house and sucked the blood from their feet while they're sleeping."

423
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 The reporter's like, "No one was accusing you of that. You pervert? No one even knew that was a thing. You weren't accused of doing that.

424
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Why did you offer up that information in this interview? I just want to be clear. I have never, ever, ever broken into a house while someone was drunk and asleep and sucked the blood out of their feet.

425
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I have never, well, now I think you did because no one brought that up, but he is very adamant he never did that.

426
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And he goes on to say, "Listen, some people think I would drink the blood from my own veins, but I wouldn't. I just enjoy the taste of blood the same way other people enjoy a glass of wine."

427
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And then the article just kind of ends. That's kind of like the end of the profile piece. The reporter ran out in terror.

428
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 It's an interesting story. Obviously, when we look at old-timey newspapers, a lot of it was made up. A lot of it was made up.

429
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 That's where we see a lot of the stories of giants when you look through these old newspapers and they'll have photos of giants and people go, "Look, there are giants, there are uncovering giants back in the 1800s."

430
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Those stories were made up. And what I find super fascinating from a social aspect today is there are people who don't believe newspapers today.

431
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 They're like, "The New York Times, that's a total rag. The stuff they print is just fake. It's all propaganda."

432
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 But then they'll believe a newspaper written in the 1800s, which was also the same.

433
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 The journalistic industry has always been driven by profit and government interference.

434
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 There's always government interference or private party interference trying to put a point forward.

435
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Newspapers back in the 1800s were no more pure than they are today. They just make stuff up to sell newspapers.

436
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 So this is an interesting story. It could easily just be made up. Not saying that gangs annotated or mysteries and misfits made it up.

437
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 But it could be an old newspaper article that was made up. It could be a modern fake.

438
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 What's interesting about it is that it is also reported in the Gangs of New York. And we do see a difference.

439
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 We have Ludwig the Bloodsucker in Gangs of New York, and then we have Ludwig Heifelreifel or whatever his name was.

440
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Hellreifel. That's not his name either. I mispronounce on that.

441
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 So we have him reported in two instances. We have him reported in this New York Mercury article, and then we have him reported in the Gangs of New York.

442
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 But it's interesting because in Gangs of New York he's a much more sinister character, and that would have most likely taken place after the article.

443
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Where he is no longer just enjoying a nice glass of animal blood and maybe the occasional blood sucking from a sleeping man's toe.

444
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 The character in Gangs of New York he's hiding in alleyways, waiting for drunks who are too inebriated to stumble home.

445
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 He drinks their blood while they're laying in the alleyway.

446
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 A much more sinister character. Possibly one, possibly an urban legend that came out from that article being written in people in the neighborhood knowing about them.

447
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 You better get home before Ludwig gets you. They'd yell to some alkie as he's burping and stumbling his way down the street.

448
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Or it's possible that this character did develop an overriding desire for human blood.

449
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And realized the perfect way to get it was to not have to hunt for it.

450
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 He knew where the blood would be. Knew where he could take it from people who were unconscious.

451
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Not killing them, but just pricking their toes.

452
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 And sucking their alcohol soaked blood, which is twice as delicious, from their dirty feet.

453
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 That's so disgusting. Taking off their socks. Can you imagine how dirty feet were back in the 1800s?

454
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 I bet you old timey feet smelled the worst. Could you imagine smelling a pilgrim's foot?

455
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 You're like, Jason, I never ever thought about that. But now everything's giving. I'm gonna imagine a pilgrim.

456
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 I'm gonna imagine putting my nose right between his toes.

457
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 But yeah, so he's drinking this blood right out of these dude's feet. Or not. Maybe it is all just an urban myth.

458
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Maybe he never existed at all. Maybe he did exist in the news article and then became an urban legend.

459
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Or maybe Ludwig Haifelreifel did lose his wife. He was exposed as a bloodsucker.

460
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 He ended up on the streets himself. And that is where he continued to feed.

461
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 The gang's annotated.blog website did note that they were not able to find any record of Ludwig's death.

462
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Is it possible that the stories of the vampire are true? That drinking human blood can keep you young forever?

463
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 All you gotta do is suck it from the toes of a sleeping alcoholic.
