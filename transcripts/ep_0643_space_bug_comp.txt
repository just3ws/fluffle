 Hillary Clinton fanfiction takes a bizarre turn if you expected it to be normal, then
 you haven't read Hillary Clinton fanfiction before.
 And then we take a look where he didn't even know it existed.
 And then we meet a man who one day is just driving down the road and he's invited to
 take a trip on a UFO by two aliens.
 Who would pass up such an opportunity to visit a technological marvel?
 Well he should have, because this UFO is infected.
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.
 I'm having a great day.
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.
 I released something earlier today about we're no longer uploading on YouTube and I'm not
 going to go into detail with that again.
 Just wanted to bring that up so the end of music gets stuck in your head again.
 It's going to be stuck with you for the rest of the day.
 But if you're not aware yet we're not uploading to YouTube anymore.
 If you have more questions about it I released a little like 13 minute long segment earlier
 the day.
 It was just, I was originally going to talk about it at the beginning of this episode
 which I am doing now.
 It just brought the tone down.
 So it's just probably the last time I'm going to mention it.
 But it is not the last time I'm going to introduce our newest Patreon supporter.
 Sliding into Dead Rabbit Command.
 He's trapped in a sleeping bag.
 I'm really running out of ways.
 Really running out of ways to introduce you guys.
 He's trapped in a sleeping bag.
 It's tied up to his neck.
 It's Nick Buston Guston.
 Everyone give a round of applause to Nick Buston Guston as he struggles valiantly to get out
 of his sleeping bag.
 We're going to unzip it.
 And there he is.
 He's wearing a tuxedo in his sleeping bag.
 And he's wearing that tuxedo for a reason.
 Before we get into that if you guys can't support the Patreon or if you don't have trouble
 getting in that sleeping bag that's fine too.
 Just helps spread the word about the show.
 Really really helps out a lot.
 Now Nick Buston Guston is wearing a tuxedo.
 BING!
 You're wearing a tuxedo now too.
 I'm putting on my tuxedo because we're going to be spies for our first story.
 We're going to have to go undercover.
 And nothing says undercover like a tuxedo.
 Okay James Bond got away with it because he was like infiltrating casinos and stuff
 like that.
 Hopefully a lot of people wear tuxedos where we're going.
 Nick Buston Guston I need you to fire up that Dead Rabbit Durgible.
 As we're headed to Guantanamo Bay.
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
