1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
 Today, we take a look at a series of harassing phone calls that turned into an unsolved mystery.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,460
 And then we take a look at the Back to the Future movies.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,420
 The Power of Love, Trying to Bang Your Mom.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,260
 There's a lot of good things that came out of those movies, but War those movies actually

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,420
 a code trying to warn us about 9/11.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,460
 We'll explore that and more.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,940
 We're just gonna do those two stories, but we'll explore those two stories today on Dead

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,940
 Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:42,820
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,980
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,980
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,220
 I hope you're having a great day too.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,220
 It's snowing.

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,220
 Whatever.

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,340
 I just gotta deal with it at this point.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,820
 However, I do have something to gripe about.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,740
 I watched Love Never Dies.

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,380
 Love Never Dies is the sequel to Phantom of the Opera.

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,500
 I'm not gonna do a whole Dead Rabbit Recommends on Phantom of the Opera, but it is an amazing

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 movie.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,100
 It's directed by Joel Schumacher.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,660
 And Batman and Robin and stuff like that.

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,740
 I don't really think he was trying to go for like a comic book vibe, like super comic

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
 bookie.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,540
 But man, he really hit a home run with Phantom of the Opera, with Gerard Butler as the Phantom.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,540
 It's an amazing story, amazing soundtrack.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,660
 I had knew nothing about it.

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,620
 I was in my mid-20s.

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,700
 I was blazed out of my mind.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,540
 This was back when I smoked weed.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,260
 Absolutely bait.

32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,580
 And I think I had got it from Netflix back when they still did stuff in the mail for

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,140
 whatever reason I had got it.

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,020
 And I put it in.

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,380
 Two minutes later had it turned on the subtitles because the whole thing is singing.

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,380
 And what is it?

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,060
 Two and a half hours later I was sobbing.

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,420
 It was the most beautiful story.

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,500
 And it's a straight up horror movie.

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,700
 It is a gothic horror movie because the Phantom is a lunatic who kidnaps people and murders

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
 people.

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,780
 Blackmail's people doesn't care.

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,380
 Super insane.

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,580
 Basically the ending is, spoiler alert, it's basically Columbine in an opera house.

45
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,140
 He doesn't use guns, but it's a massacre.

46
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,900
 It's a brutal film.

47
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,340
 And he is the love interest.

48
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,700
 Well she has to choose between two guys.

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:31,980
 The noble and kind of boring Raul or the violent psychopath known as the Phantom.

50
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
 Very very interesting movie.

51
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,900
 And then she, then they made a sequel.

52
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,020
 20, 30 years later Andrew Lloyd Webber made a sequel to this movie or to the play.

53
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
 And I'm watching it.

54
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,940
 I'm such a big Phantom of the Opera fan.

55
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
 I've never seen it live.

56
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,260
 I saw the movie multiple times.

57
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,740
 Stoned and sober. That when Love Never Dies came out when it was released at the Broadway

58
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,180
 or it was never played on Broadway.

59
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,380
 But when it was being played at theaters I thought I'll never be able to see it about

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,420
 the soundtrack and sat at home and listen to the soundtrack.

61
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,900
 And I'm like, oh my god, this is not very good at all.

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,940
 Imagine if on after, imagine they did a sequel to Nightmare on Elm Street where after Nancy

63
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,660
 survives the slaughter of all her friends and gets away from Freddy Krueger.

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,460
 And the second one you find out 10 years later they banged and had a baby.

65
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,560
 It's super bizarre.

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,980
 It totally is one of those sequels that you're like this actually retroactively kind of ruins

67
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
 the first one.

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,820
 And even Andrew Lloyd Webber is like, eh, it's just a different story with same characters.

69
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,380
 Even he's saying it's not really a direct sequel.

70
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,700
 Andrew Lloyd Webber, it's weird.

71
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,500
 He's, I think he's brilliant, especially his early stuff.

72
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,580
 But I didn't know this.

73
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,420
 In theater circles he's considered the Michael Bay of musicals.

74
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,260
 He's not very well liked.

75
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,740
 He is a middle class audience guy.

76
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,620
 He gets the middle classes there who go see like rent, no he doesn't do rent.

77
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,180
 They go see Cats and they go see Phantom of the Opera.

78
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,820
 He's the Michael Bay of the theater world.

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,140
 I think he's really good.

80
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,220
 This wasn't very good.

81
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,540
 But Phantom of the Opera is absolutely brilliant.

82
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,060
 I recommend checking it out.

83
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,060
 11 over 10.

84
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,060
 You can take it or leave it.

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,420
 But I'll give Andrew credit.

86
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,620
 Although songs are stuck in my head.

87
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,660
 I just didn't really like the plot.

88
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,660
 Songs are good.

89
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,660
 Can't get them out of my head.

90
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,820
 Anyway, so I think I've spent enough time talking about my obsession with Phantom of

91
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,820
 the Opera.

92
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,100
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,540
 So we're going back.

94
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,740
 Ooh.

95
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,740
 We're going back in time but not in the way that Marty McFly would.

96
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,740
 No.

97
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,980
 We're going back to the year 1980.

98
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
 I was born in '76.

99
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
 So I'm four years old.

100
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
 Imagine me in kindergarten during this story.

101
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,980
 Oh my God.

102
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
 I actually, oh okay.

103
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,940
 This story takes place in Anaheim, California.

104
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,620
 I lived in Anaheim at the time.

105
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,700
 I may actually suspect for this story, little four year old baby Jason.

106
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,100
 But we're going to go back in time.

107
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,300
 We are going to, we don't need the carbon decopter.

108
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
 We're already here.

109
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,300
 We're, oh no.

110
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
 We forgot.

111
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
 We're in Oregon.

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
 I'm not in California.

113
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,260
 So we're just going to go back in time.

114
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,020
 We're going to bar the DeLorean.

115
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,520
 We go back in time.

116
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
 1980, May 28.

117
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,660
 There's a woman named Dorothy Jane Scott.

118
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
 She has three names.

119
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
 That means one of two things.

120
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,020
 She's either a victim or a serial killer.

121
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,340
 Whenever the news reports a middle name, that's usually what happens.

122
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,900
 Dorothy Jane Scott works at a head shop.

123
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,260
 Where they sell pipes and stuff like that.

124
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,860
 Paraffinilia, drug paraffinilia.

125
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,780
 And one of her coworkers, they're having a company meeting.

126
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,780
 And one of her coworkers goes, "Oh God, my leg.

127
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
 Ah."

128
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,780
 And they're like, "What is it?

129
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
 A cramp?

130
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,780
 You need some calcium?

131
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
 You need some milk?"

132
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,780
 He's like, "No, no.

133
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,780
 It's not a cramp.

134
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
 Ah."

135
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
 He got bit by a spider during a company meeting.

136
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,820
 And you know you work for a really crappy company.

137
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,700
 When you're sitting in the back of the company having a meeting or in the front, or just

138
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
 walking through the door and a spider bites you.

139
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,020
 I've never gotten bitten by a bug.

140
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,020
 Ever.

141
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
 Definitely not at work.

142
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,020
 But anyway, so he gets bit by a spider.

143
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
 I don't know why.

144
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,780
 And I don't even know what type of spider.

145
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,500
 Oh, it was a black widow.

146
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,860
 Or as I wrote on my notes, a black widen.

147
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,460
 Anyways, so it's 11 PM.

148
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,780
 Now he's at the hospital.

149
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,740
 Dorothy Jane Scott and her friend and the spider bite victim go to the hospital.

150
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,660
 Now, first protocol when you get bit by a spider is the first thing they do is see if you can

151
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,180
 crawl on walls.

152
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,540
 And if you can't, all the doctors get really disappointed and they're like, "Dang it."

153
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,060
 Let's just treat him for venom then.

154
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,620
 He's not an actual Spider-Man.

155
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,780
 But anyway, so he gets treated for it, but it was his leg.

156
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,100
 He wasn't feeling really good.

157
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,380
 And Dorothy goes, "You know what?

158
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,380
 I'll go get the car.

159
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,580
 I'll go out to the parking lot and get the car.

160
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,580
 I'll come up to the front of the hospital and we'll all get in the car and we'll go

161
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
 home."

162
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
 Everyone's like, "Oh, that's a great idea.

163
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,580
 You know, because my leg got bit.

164
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
 Spider might be nearby."

165
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,980
 So, they don't want to get assaulted again.

166
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,220
 They see Dorothy walk out to the car and then they're chit-chatting the friends in the hospital

167
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,220
 kind of like, "Hey, how's your leg?"

168
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,220
 And he's like, "What do you think?

169
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,220
 I've been in the hospital for my leg."

170
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,820
 She's like, "Oh yeah, I forgot."

171
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,660
 And then they see the car start to drive through the parking lot and then it gets on the road

172
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
 and drives away.

173
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,380
 And they're like, "What?

174
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,380
 That's weird."

175
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,740
 It's almost like when you're watching a zombie movie and the guy's like, "Here, give me the

176
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
 keys.

177
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
 I'll go out and get the car."

178
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
 And then he gets in the car and drives away and the survivors are like, "No.

179
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,860
 That was our last hope."

180
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,820
 But this was real and it involved zombies, just spider.

181
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,220
 A couple hours pass and the friends are still sitting in the hospital and now they're concerned.

182
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,740
 They're like, this was before the era of cell phones.

183
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,260
 They're thinking when they first see her drive away, they're thinking, "Maybe she went to...

184
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,380
 Maybe she saw another spider and got panicked."

185
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,620
 But after two hours they start to think, "Okay, that was really weird.

186
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,420
 It's not like Dorothy to just take off.

187
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,820
 She's supposed to pick us up."

188
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,020
 So they tell hospital security, they're like, "Hey, this is what happened."

189
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,700
 And then they call up her parents and say, "Is Dorothy home?"

190
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
 "I don't know.

191
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,780
 She's not home."

192
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,140
 Because she just left us here stranded at this hospital and we thought that was really

193
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
 weird.

194
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,820
 The next day in an alleyway, her car is found on fire.

195
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,220
 She's not there.

196
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,020
 Cubs automatically begin investigating it and they're thinking, "This is super bizarre."

197
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,220
 You know, they get their first major lead.

198
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,620
 As they just start investigating it, they get word that she had been receiving harassing

199
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,340
 phone calls and they weren't just like, "Show me your boobs."

200
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,660
 They weren't just like creepy pervert phone calls.

201
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,740
 They were phone calls describing what she was wearing, what she had done the previous

202
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
 day.

203
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:23,700
 There were stalker calls and it wasn't again just, "Oh, you look nice in that blouse.

204
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,060
 I saw you touching cantaloupes yesterday."

205
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,420
 This is actually one of the quotes that she had told her friends that the caller had said,

206
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:38,460
 "When I get you alone, I will cut you up into bits so no one will ever find you."

207
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,540
 Click.

208
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,420
 So these are very, very threatening phone calls.

209
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,940
 And this was going on for weeks before she vanished.

210
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,100
 A newspaper starts doing an article.

211
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,060
 Obviously, they're like, "Okay, we're going to cover this story."

212
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,420
 They get a phone call, a very threatening phone call to the newspaper.

213
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,140
 They're like, "It might just be a prank caller because we get those, but we're going to tell

214
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,460
 the police."

215
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,860
 Two weeks after she disappears, her mother gets a phone call.

216
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,500
 Mom picks up the phone.

217
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,300
 I got her.

218
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
 Click.

219
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,380
 Almost every Wednesday, the mom would get a phone call.

220
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,700
 And the phone call wouldn't come if Dorothy's dad was home.

221
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,060
 So whoever was making these phone calls knew when the mom was home alone.

222
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,420
 On a Wednesday, Adelina.

223
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,060
 The phone calls would either say, "Is Dorothy home?"

224
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,140
 Click.

225
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:42,220
 Or, and I don't know the exact quote, but she basically it was, "I have her prisoner.

226
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,940
 I'm holding her prisoner."

227
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,300
 Or, "I murdered her."

228
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,060
 So she would get these different phone calls.

229
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,380
 One teasing her, one saying that she was basically still alive, and then one saying that she was

230
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,660
 murdered.

231
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,780
 One time, one time the phone rang, this went on for quite a while, the phone rang.

232
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,420
 The dad picked up the phone.

233
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,740
 Instead he happened to be home and whoever was making the calls didn't know that.

234
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,980
 Stopped calling.

235
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,660
 Stopped calling the house.

236
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,660
 Game was over.

237
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,260
 He wanted to harass the mom, but once the dad picked up it ended.

238
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,340
 Now obviously the cops were trying to get a trace on the line, but the phone calls were

239
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,060
 so short.

240
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,980
 Four years after she went missing, in the Anaheim Hills, a set of bones are found.

241
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,700
 Cops are like, "Well we gotta identify the body."

242
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,700
 So they do dental records and it comes back as Dorothy's body.

243
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,420
 After the bones are found, ring, ring, ring.

244
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,540
 Mom picks up the phone.

245
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,380
 "I killed her."

246
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
 Click.

247
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,100
 The phone calls started up for a short time and then just petered off.

248
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
 Unsolved mystery.

249
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
 Unsolved mystery.

250
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,340
 No one's ever been arrested for this.

251
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,060
 There's been a few suspects.

252
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,100
 One of them is there was a guy working in an auto shop across the street from the head

253
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
 shop.

254
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,500
 Now to be fair, that's not an official suspect.

255
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,140
 I was doing my research, someone on Reddit was saying, "Well you know there was this

256
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,220
 auto shop next to it and it could have been someone working there."

257
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,140
 But no one was ever arrested for it.

258
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,700
 No one was ever convicted for it.

259
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,980
 Totally unsolved murder.

260
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,980
 It's creepy because that means that guy's still out there.

261
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,380
 And who knows, the next time your phone rings, you could be getting one of those calls.

262
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,820
 I can't imagine getting a call saying, "When I get you alone, I will cut you up into bits

263
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,300
 so no one will ever find you."

264
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,180
 If I got it now, I would automatically assume it was a lark that someone was messing with

265
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,180
 me.

266
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,580
 But just being a normal person moving about the world and getting a phone call like that

267
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,180
 would be quite chilling.

268
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,100
 And then for it to actually come true, creepy.

269
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,060
 So the next story we're going to talk about is a little more lighthearted, a little more

270
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,180
 lighthearted even though it eventually involves the death of 3,000 people.

271
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,820
 But the journey there is more lighthearted because we're going to take a look at a preposterous

272
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,820
 theory called, I'm going to call it Back to the Truth-er.

273
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,700
 Ooh, I just came up with that.

274
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,900
 I'm always so pleased with myself when I come up with stuff like that.

275
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,400
 Back to the Truth-er.

276
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,460
 Did the Back to the Future movies directed by Robert Zemeckis actually predict 9/11?

277
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,220
 And just quick heads up, we're still in Recommends Week or Request Week.

278
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,540
 I don't know what I titled it, but this was actually a request via email through Justin.

279
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,940
 So Justin, thanks for the request.

280
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,180
 Now imagine you're sitting in your living room.

281
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,900
 You're sitting in your living room and you have your VHS copy of Back to the Future.

282
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,300
 And for whatever reason you think, I'm going to watch this tonight.

283
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,540
 I haven't watched it in a while.

284
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,020
 I could watch it on DVD.

285
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,100
 I could watch it online.

286
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,060
 But no, I'm going to put in my VHS copy.

287
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,540
 So little flap closes.

288
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,100
 That's your audibly loud VCR.

289
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,660
 And right when it's getting started, right when it's going to-- you can't wait to hear

290
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,420
 some Huey Lewis in the news.

291
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,100
 You can't wait to indulge in your incest fetish.

292
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,980
 That mom was very, very hot.

293
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,340
 Props to Marty McFly for resisting.

294
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,260
 But anyways, you're getting ready to start it.

295
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
 You got your popcorn.

296
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,060
 You hear a knock at your door.

297
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,340
 You're like, "Oh, no, no, dude.

298
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,620
 I just want to watch my movie.

299
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,300
 I just want to watch my movie."

300
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,940
 And underneath the door, you know, you have a little cap under your door.

301
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,140
 You see these two long arms, kind of like Slenderman style slide under your door.

302
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,940
 Fold up and unlock it from the inside.

303
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
 It's Franz.

304
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,420
 He's showing up quite early in this season.

305
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,980
 Because this is definitely a story that needs a little bit of Franzinian.

306
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,300
 Because it's a lot of just weird facts.

307
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,620
 So Franz just sits down with you on the couch.

308
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,100
 Franz is our resident conspiracy theorist if you're a new listener.

309
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,780
 With audibly long arms.

310
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,860
 He sits on the couch next to you, throws his arm over your shoulder.

311
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,620
 And it's long enough that he can still reach in and get popcorn and put it into your mouth.

312
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,820
 So as you're trying to move your mouth, as he's trying to shove popcorn into your mouth,

313
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,060
 he says, "Ah, back to the future, eh?

314
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,660
 Watching some back to the future?"

315
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
 You're like, "That's a weird voice.

316
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,940
 You don't know I'm going to say, 'Ah, yeah, I know my voice changes from time to time.'"

317
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,500
 Did you know?

318
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,300
 Did you know that Doc Brown and Marty McFly, when they first time traveled, do you know

319
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,540
 where they time traveled from?

320
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,660
 You're like, "I don't know.

321
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
 It's been a while."

322
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,500
 The Twin Pine Mall.

323
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,300
 Sounds familiar?

324
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,260
 What other things are there twins of?

325
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,780
 You're right.

326
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,780
 You're right.

327
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
 Twin Towers.

328
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,020
 You don't even respond to his answer.

329
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,460
 Yeah, yeah, you're right.

330
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,820
 And, here, let me pause it.

331
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
 Give me the remote.

332
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
 Give me the remote.

333
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
 Pauses it.

334
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,100
 What time does it say?

335
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,900
 People really believe this, by the way.

336
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,260
 People actually, there's several videos and resources on all this stuff.

337
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,220
 I should start off by saying that.

338
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,940
 What time are they at the Twin Pine Mall?

339
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,700
 You look at that.

340
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
 You look at it.

341
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
 It's a digital clock.

342
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
 It says 116.

343
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
 You're like, "Oh, it's 116."

344
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,420
 Oh, no, no.

345
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,180
 You have to look at it upside down.

346
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,380
 He gets up and he takes your television set up and sets it on the upside down.

347
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,220
 What time does it say now?

348
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,580
 And you're like, it says 9/11 when you turn it upside down.

349
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,580
 Exactly.

350
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
 9/11.

351
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
 He puts the TV back.

352
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
 Urgh.

353
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
 Sets it back up.

354
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
 Right?

355
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
 You're surprised because it's a CRT TV.

356
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,580
 It's quite heavy.

357
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,980
 Now, let's fast forward a bit.

358
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,500
 So, he has this car that goes back in time.

359
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,860
 Hence the title of the movie.

360
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,860
 And he goes back in time.

361
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,940
 A farmer who lived on that land that would eventually become the mall describes the car

362
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,980
 as an airplane without wings.

363
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
 Sounds familiar?

364
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
 Oh, yeah.

365
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
 Oh, yeah.

366
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,660
 The plane crashing into the Twin Towers.

367
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,340
 I guess that sounds a little familiar.

368
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
 You're right.

369
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
 You're learning.

370
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,740
 You're learning from me.

371
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,540
 I'm glad he's become more like Gollum at this point.

372
00:15:51,540 --> 00:16:00,900
 Now, he gets away from the farmer by crashing into a tree, a pine tree.

373
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:07,460
 So in the future, the mall is named One Pine Mall.

374
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,740
 You're like, oh, yeah, I guess.

375
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
 You see?

376
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
 Proof.

377
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
 Proof.

378
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,380
 That 9/11 was caused.

379
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,900
 Was predicted by Back to the Future.

380
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
 Not Cosmo Back to the Future.

381
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,260
 That's a different conspiracy theory.

382
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,260
 Now, there's other things that people tie into this conspiracy theory.

383
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,580
 One, that Muslims are the bad guys.

384
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:38,260
 That Muslims are the ones who attack Doc Brown and Marty because Doc Brown had them smuggling.

385
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
 Oh, no.

386
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,540
 He got money to get plutonium, that he was going to then sell to the Libyans, and he

387
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,140
 was going to use it for his own time travel device.

388
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,740
 The Libyans show up.

389
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,220
 The Libyan car crashes into a building as they're trying to-- something happens during

390
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
 the shootout.

391
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,700
 The Libyan car crashes into a little building, knocking it down.

392
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,220
 That's proof of 9/11.

393
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,580
 The fact that they were Muslim terrorists is proof of 9/11.

394
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,100
 So that was a weird thing for me because, hey, Franz, I thought that 9/11 was an inside

395
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
 job.

396
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,980
 It was brought down by bombs, and the Muslims had nothing to do with it.

397
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,860
 So why does this movie highlight the fact that they're Muslim?

398
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,700
 Well when most conspiracy theories believe that it was taken down by bombs, and Osama

399
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,900
 Minaloud was completely innocent, Franz just shifts his eyes from side to side and just

400
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,140
 sits there silently.

401
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,940
 You can't have it both way conspiracy theorists.

402
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,800
 You can't point to evidence of Muslim involvement in Back to the Future and then try to convince

403
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,380
 me that the Muslims had nothing to do with it in the event you're trying to reference.

404
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,380
 But that's an odd part of conspiracy theory.

405
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,900
 So Mayor Goldie Wilson was a black guy who was running for mayor in the present.

406
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:49,620
 This slogan "progress is his middle name" you'll remember Obama's very, very famous campaign

407
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,120
 slogan "progress."

408
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,100
 It wasn't that, it was hope.

409
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,180
 But apparently there's some sort of comparison between that.

410
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,740
 Predict the rise of Obama.

411
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,260
 Because whoever thought of a black politician before President Obama is weird, "Did you

412
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
 know?"

413
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
 Franz interrupts us.

414
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,780
 "Did you know this?"

415
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,820
 And there are comparisons of Donald Trump in Back to the Future too.

416
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,140
 Yes, I know that that's actually a really common joke.

417
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,140
 No, no, no.

418
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,540
 It's not a joke.

419
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,780
 Because when the Marty McFly is fired, he looks like Donald Trump too.

420
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
 What?

421
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
 What are you talking about?

422
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
 I don't remember that scene.

423
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,500
 And his fax machine prints out his pink slip?

424
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,860
 Guess what it says on the pink slip.

425
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,860
 Does it say you're fired?

426
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,500
 Mm-hmm, say proof.

427
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,660
 It predicted the future.

428
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,180
 That's what you're missing, Jason.

429
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
 That's what you're missing.

430
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,780
 This movie, it's not just about 9/11.

431
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,020
 It has all these other little things.

432
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,180
 But the most chilling point of all these movies, the Back to the Future trilogy is what I call

433
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,420
 it.

434
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,460
 But so then, yeah, Franz, okay.

435
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,900
 So the nonsense goes on and on.

436
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,140
 There's a lot of little connections between, you can take a little piece out of the movie.

437
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,740
 One of the connections is the Libyans were the people trying to get the plutonium.

438
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,460
 And 25 years after the movie came out was Arab Spring and it started with the Libyans.

439
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,380
 So when you take three movies of any trilogy, you could take the Princess Diary movies and

440
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,420
 isolate single scenes and compare them to world events and get something.

441
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,340
 I mean, you may get something.

442
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,460
 You're a loser in the end because you had to watch a bunch of Princess Diary movies,

443
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,860
 but you can find anything and anything if you look hard enough.

444
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,420
 Now I said yesterday when I was hyping the story up that there was one thing that I found

445
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,980
 that was super, super bizarre.

446
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,820
 It is most likely a coincidence.

447
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,740
 It's almost 100% a coincidence.

448
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,100
 And I don't know if Robert Zemeckis, if Robert Zemeckis did it on purpose, he's a mad genius.

449
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,260
 I think he may have just liked the visual.

450
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:11,980
 And if he did this on purpose, he may be insanely... it would blow my mind if he did this on purpose.

451
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,300
 So the climax of the movie is this, of the first one.

452
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
 They have to...

453
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,700
 See you later, Franz.

454
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,820
 You'll be back shortly.

455
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,140
 I'm sure you'll have another story you can share with us.

456
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,380
 But he walks away.

457
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,580
 His knuckles dragging on the ground.

458
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
 He leaves.

459
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,300
 So there is something that is super bizarre.

460
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,540
 So the climax to Back to the Future is they have to rig a wire from a power line onto

461
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,060
 the clock tower.

462
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,140
 They know precisely when the clock tower is going to be struck by lightning.

463
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,900
 Marty McFly needs to be going 88 miles an hour and hit the cable at the exact moment of

464
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
 the lightning strike.

465
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,220
 He then is allowed to go back to the future, hence the title.

466
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,460
 So they're rigging the wire.

467
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,780
 Doc Brown's rigging the wire.

468
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,020
 Marty's getting his car, banging his mom, something like that.

469
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,500
 I don't remember the details of why he's late or almost late.

470
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,340
 And he shows up and he gives Doc Brown a letter.

471
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,060
 The letter is warning that Doc Brown's going to be killed by a Libyan.

472
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,700
 But Doc Brown goes, "What is this?"

473
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,700
 And Marty McFly goes, "You'll know in 30 years."

474
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,620
 He then gets into the car, gets into the delorean.

475
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,420
 He hits 88 just the right moment.

476
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,060
 The flaming lines appear on the ground.

477
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,620
 And then there's like an autolube shop called Nine Autolube or something.

478
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,700
 So you have a nine on one side of the screen and in the middle of the screen you have these

479
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,900
 two flaming tire tracks.

480
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,140
 So it looks like 9/11.

481
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
 That's utter nonsense.

482
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,820
 That's not what I was hyping up as saying he was a mad genius.

483
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,500
 That's just stupid.

484
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,700
 So 30 years, 30 years after the release of Back to the Future, Robert Zemeckis directed

485
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,220
 another movie called The Wire.

486
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,100
 And it was about a man who, and I didn't come, I don't want to take credit for this.

487
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,660
 This actually, this thing I'm about to tell you, comes from the same source of all the

488
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,220
 other nonsense I've talked about.

489
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,300
 So I don't want to think like I came up with this, but it's quite ingenious.

490
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,740
 So despite all the nonsense of research I had to go through, all the videos I had to

491
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,860
 watch to get to this, I thought this was pretty ingenious.

492
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,220
 So I'm giving the credit to the guy who did this.

493
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,380
 I didn't write his name down because you know, it's just crazy conspiracy theorists.

494
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,820
 But the YouTube links are being in the description.

495
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:22,180
 So 30 years later, from 1985, Robert Zemeckis directed a movie called The Wire.

496
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:30,140
 The movie is about this guy wants to walk a high wire act from one of the twin towers

497
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,100
 to the other twin tower.

498
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,940
 So the plot of the movie is him trying to attach a wire, that's not the whole plot of

499
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,420
 the movie, but the climax or what he wants to do is he wants to attach a wire from one

500
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,020
 tower to the next and then walk across it.

501
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,300
 And you're thinking, okay, that's just a weird coincidence.

502
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,020
 And that is just a weird coincidence.

503
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,060
 They both involve wires that comes out 30 years later.

504
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:56,100
 He is wearing the exact same clothes as Marty McFly in that final scene.

505
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,740
 The exact same clothes.

506
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,320
 The exact same outfit.

507
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,220
 So in that scene and back to the future, when he travels into the future, he comes back.

508
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,660
 He's wearing a black jacket, a burgundy shirt, or a red shirt, and dark jeans.

509
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,260
 So we see him disappear in part one.

510
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,060
 In part two, he comes back into the past.

511
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,340
 He's wearing the black jacket, the red shirt, and the black pant.

512
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,440
 We see him come back at that very moment.

513
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,580
 In The Wire, the guy who is walking the wire from one tower to the other is wearing dark

514
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,060
 jeans, a red shirt, and a black jacket.

515
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,380
 Now again, I'm thinking when I'm watching the clip, the rational part of my brain is

516
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,380
 Lincoln.

517
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,700
 I think Robert D'Amicus just finds out a really dynamic color set.

518
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,580
 I think he finds that he must, he must, those colors, that combination of colors must appeal

519
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,500
 to him, making a human look like a black widow must be a pleasing color set to him.

520
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,120
 But seeing those two scenes back to back the way the YouTube video intercuts them, it does

521
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,740
 look really bizarre.

522
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,140
 And so the implication, and so I'm looking into that, and I'm thinking either Robert D'Amicus

523
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,180
 did this on purpose as some sort of troll, or he just really likes that color palette.

524
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,300
 The YouTuber seems to think that what the story actually is, he goes in quite in detail

525
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
 in this.

526
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,140
 And back to the future, he travels back to the future at the end of that.

527
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:20,820
 He then goes 30 years into the future, not the 1985 future from the 1950s, but he goes

528
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:28,180
 from the 1985 past to the 2015 future, then walks, no joke, walks across the twin towers

529
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,380
 in the movie The Walk, and then travels back in time.

530
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,780
 The YouTuber thinks that Marty McFly is in The Wire.

531
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,180
 So as much as I think that's a really compelling piece of "evidence", I think it's just a

532
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,580
 really really bizarre part of the story that somehow matches up.

533
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,300
 I don't think the character in The Wire is Marty McFly, because I'm pretty sure The Wire

534
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,020
 is based on a true story, and we know what happened to Marty McFly when he traveled after

535
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,140
 because there's a sequel.

536
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,940
 So it's super bizarre because the people who believe this conspiracy theory, they really

537
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,860
 have to leave a bunch of stuff out.

538
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,740
 Like where's all the 9/11 references in the third one?

539
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,740
 Why were the Libyans involved and not Saudi Arabians?

540
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,500
 Which is actually what happened in 9/11.

541
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,860
 And again, according to you, the Muslims had nothing to do with 9/11.

542
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,620
 So it's this weird mishmash of conspiracy theories, but I think these people watched these videos

543
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,140
 where we're watching a VHS copy with Franz at one night, and they started to see these

544
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,820
 scenes, and then they just got rid of everything.

545
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,940
 I don't remember Osama bin Laden trying to sleep with his mom.

546
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:37,660
 Like there's key plot elements in those movies that are not a clue to 9/11 at all.

547
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,780
 So why are you just picking out these little things?

548
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,460
 And you know, that's the thing, that stupid predictive programming thing.

549
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:49,140
 People go, "Well, before the Illuminati can commit a crime, they have to warn us about

550
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
 it.

551
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,340
 I'm gonna do a whole segment on predictive programming, but it's utter nonsense.

552
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,820
 We'll cover that later."

553
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,620
 So that is the story.

554
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,180
 Oh, and this was the thing that I thought was interesting about 9/11, and I could be totally

555
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,620
 off base with this.

556
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,500
 But 9/11 really, really only appeals to two age groups.

557
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,600
 Baby boomers and millennials.

558
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,220
 Baby boomers are like, "Oh my God, my security in my country is broke."

559
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
 It was a tragedy.

560
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
 I'm not saying it wasn't a tragedy.

561
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,700
 It was an absolute tragedy.

562
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,980
 3,000 people lost their lives, thousands and more families devastated from it.

563
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,500
 But the cultural significance of 9/11.

564
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,380
 To millennials, it was their cradle being shaped, and they're like, "Oh my God, this

565
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,580
 is the reality of the world."

566
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,940
 To baby boomers, it was their cradle being shaped, and they're like, "Oh my God, I thought

567
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
 we were safe."

568
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,220
 Gen Xers really don't care.

569
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,220
 Really.

570
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,900
 I looked at the human toll of it, and I'm like, "Oh my God, this is a tragedy.

571
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,100
 It's horrible that that happened."

572
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,260
 But I gotta take my shoes off at the airport.

573
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,620
 To me, it wasn't this huge, significant element.

574
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:52,060
 And generally, when I talk to other people my age, they don't really give it much social

575
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,060
 weight.

576
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,620
 They don't give it a bunch of societal weight.

577
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,900
 We go, "Yeah, they don't make movies like She's All That anymore."

578
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,700
 It did kind of change stuff.

579
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,020
 But I think 9/11 truthers, they tend to either be older or younger.

580
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,780
 Because I just think that people my age are just kind of like, "Eh, it sucked."

581
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,100
 Just like a house burning down sucks, but it wasn't the biggest event of our lives.

582
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,500
 It's kind of weird.

583
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,260
 I think it's just part of that whole Generation X being like, "Eh, the so what generation,

584
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,980
 the why generation, the grown generation, we just don't care."

585
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,460
 Generally, it's older people and younger people who are really looking for this 9/11

586
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,980
 connection truth or stuff.

587
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,380
 The rest of us old timers are like, "Pfft, whatever man.

588
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,500
 If I can live through Kirk Cobain blowing his brains out, nothing else matters."

589
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
 Which is the name of a great Metallica song.

590
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:51,620
 So, but anyways, that is the story of, back to the future, predicting 9/11.

591
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,940
 Did it predict 9/11?

592
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
 No.

593
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,720
 But is there even more bizarre evidence that I couldn't fit into the quote, again, quote

594
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,820
 unquote evidence that I couldn't fit into this episode that you can enjoy yourself by

595
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
 watching these videos?

596
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
 Yes.

597
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,900
 I will admit, the costume thing in the wire and the wire and back to the future and the

598
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,980
 tower and the back to the future and those connections between those two scenes does

599
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:18,220
 seem very, very, very coincidental 30 years later.

600
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,460
 Movie 3, I get it.

601
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,420
 There's a lot of stuff packed into those two scenes.

602
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,540
 And to be fair, if that was the only evidence that was presented to me, I probably would

603
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,780
 have been a little, I still wouldn't have believed it, but I would have been a little

604
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,500
 more forgiving on it.

605
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,340
 But that's the thing with conspiracy theories.

606
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,620
 They overdo their Sunday.

607
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,260
 Sometimes you just need the plain vanilla.

608
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
 You need the one scoop.

609
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
 Blop.

610
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,760
 It's human trafficking.

611
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
 That's what's going on.

612
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,220
 It's human trafficking.

613
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,460
 But then you get the other people like, "No, no, that's boring.

614
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,940
 We got to put on like some satanic chocolate syrup and some sprinkles of reptilians.

615
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,460
 And we got to get this cherry out of the demonic workshop."

616
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,260
 And then eventually the real conspiracy is buried underneath all this nonsense.

617
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,620
 Maybe that's the point.

618
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:11,500
 Maybe the best way to hide a bizarre conspiracy theory is to make it so bizarre, it's unbelievable.
