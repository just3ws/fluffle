1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 One of the one possibly one of the funniest true crime stories have come across recently we're gonna talk about that

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,980
 We're gonna take a look at a time that American frontiersmen

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,960
 politician

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,200
 Shooter of animals Davey Crockett had a run-in with the creature. He couldn't kill and

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,800
 Then we take a look at a bizarre

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,340
 Theory that goes back

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,800
 thousands of years

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,540
 Is it possible that diseases are?

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,040
 Actually supernatural today on Dead Rabbit Radio

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:45,280
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,840
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,320
 Let's go ahead and get started because we got a lot of stuff to cover here

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,840
 First off I want to give a shout out to our newest supporter of the show John from Scar

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,420
 John from the Scar group. Thank you so much. He's the one who's he's done a couple pieces of artwork for the show

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,480
 He's done the colored in Dead Rabbit logo, which you'll see appear a lot

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,480
 He also did the custom artwork for the

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,940
 final episode of the Korea week North Korea week

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,120
 So I wanted to give John from Scar a shout out longtime supporter of the show

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,500
 So you are going to be our carboner copter pilot for today

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,040
 You're gonna be our chauffeur. You're gonna take us wherever we want to go

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,660
 Doesn't matter if you want to go there. You are the one driving us around now

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,620
 Let's go ahead and first off. Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy John. Let's go ahead. Let we're leaving behind Hood River

23
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,400
 We're headed out to Natick, Massachusetts never heard of this town before never

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,080
 I've never even knew it existed right and today I wake up. I've literally just got done reading this story

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,280
 I'm recording this episode extremely early because the story is so hilarious

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,520
 I just got to tell this story for driving out. We're leaving behind Hood River

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,500
 We're going to Natick, Massachusetts. It's August

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,060
 2019 now

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,820
 They do a little bit of a meta here before actually getting the story. Let me tell you what was going on

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,820
 It just woke up probably about two hours ago. I'm doing my reading

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,140
 I do all reading all my articles in the morning stuff like that and I'm

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,700
 drinking my Diet Pepsi

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,140
 half awake

34
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,060
 And I see this headline this couple is suing this this married couple suing some eBay executives

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,380
 For harassment or something like that and I remember looking at being like, ah, you know some lunatic, right couple couple

36
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,860
 Loona I guess I'm some sort of bootlicking corporate shill because I saw the headline and I was like a couple lunatics

37
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,980
 Accusing this company of something they probably didn't commit

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,580
 I'm kind of reading through the article and I'm reading it

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,680
 I'm like, oh these guys probably just looking for a quick payday and then I get about halfway through the article

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,240
 I'm barely awake. Okay, I get half through the article and I start seeing words pop up like prosecutors

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,460
 federal charges

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,420
 Felony and I go whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second. This isn't some lunatic lawsuit

43
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,640
 This isn't some like civil civil lawsuit because this story is absolutely insane

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,520
 So when I was reading and I was like, this can't be true, right? This has to be some people looking for a quick payday

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,340
 Let's rewind back in time and go to August of 2019

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,500
 There's this married couple right they live in a Natick, Massachusetts and they've provoked the ire of eBay

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,520
 The online auction site really the only online auction site and the only one that matters

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,180
 Six former eBay executives have been charged federal crimes

49
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,980
 Now this is all alleged, right? But one of the guys is on the run right now. They can't find them authorities can't find them

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,420
 They're charged with high-level eBay executives. Okay

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,440
 they're charged with conspiracy to commit cyber stalking and

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,060
 Conspiracy to tamper with witnesses and you're like what?

53
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,300
 The two main people involved was James. This is all alleged again James Bogg

54
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,040
 He's the former senior director of safety and security for eBay and then you have David Harville

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,180
 eBay's former director of global security and resiliency again

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,340
 This wasn't a couple people working at the warehouse who were having a crummy day

57
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,460
 These are people who ran their security teams

58
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:24,600
 They also had the you also had the former senior manager of global intelligence and a former senior manager of special operations for eBay's

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,780
 global security team

60
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,940
 Okay, all alleged and that's the lesson I'm gonna say that

61
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,820
 So you have these high-level people who are threatening emails and texts are threatening to crush this lady

62
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,480
 I'm gonna put her down. They're gonna show her what's what

63
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,780
 So listen the reason why they're all former and executives is because eBay is already running internal investigation

64
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,460
 And fired all of these people and said we had nothing to do with this

65
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,340
 We have nothing to do with this other people say it may go a little bit higher against the CEO of eBay actually

66
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,660
 Recently over this over what we're about to get into if these former eBay executives, right?

67
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,860
 high-level

68
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,580
 These people are pulling in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and they want to strike back at this couple

69
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,580
 They want to quote crush this lady

70
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,620
 So this is what they this is what you're paying all this money for for your senior manager of global intelligence

71
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,700
 These are the plans they come up with to harass this couple. They send threatening messages emails text messages

72
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,380
 That's pretty standard, right? They send pizzas. Okay. This should have been an obvious setup, right?

73
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,380
 The pizza parlor is is should have

74
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,460
 They should be responsible for this one at 4 30 in the morning

75
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,780
 Tom and those pizza like obviously that's fake

76
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,180
 No, I don't even know pizza parlors are open at 4 30 in the morning

77
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,900
 But apparently if you have eBay on your side, you can make them open they add this is pretty funny

78
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,220
 They put a ad online

79
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,420
 That said if we're having a yard sale, but if no one is outside force said yard sale just knock on her door

80
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,460
 That's pretty harmless, right? I mean it'd be annoying

81
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,340
 And again the people who I mean who walks up to an empty yard and be like yuck yuck

82
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,140
 I wonder this with this location the yard sale, right?

83
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,420
 Well, better go knock on the door

84
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:20,980
 Yard sales at 4 30 in the morning. They also this is where it starts to get a little more iffy. They put a craigslist ad

85
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:31,420
 Inviting singles couples and swingers to their house to party after 10 p.m. Every night now

86
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:39,020
 That's like trolling 101 and it's quite hilarious to think that you imagine like a boardroom and all these people are sitting there in their

87
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,900
 Suits and their ties and stuff like that. They actually have like a PowerPoint

88
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,300
 They're like, what are we going to do to this couple today?

89
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,300
 And they're like, I don't know how's the Swinger initiative going and they're like go to the next slide

90
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
 They're like according to this five percent of all swingers in Nantik have been to this house

91
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:03,220
 You see now why I thought this was just somebody I was like there's no way that eBay executives that actually be doing this

92
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,060
 I'm reading the article and I'm just kind of glancing over and I'm thinking there's no way that

93
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,580
 There's no way this would be happening, right?

94
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,460
 But then I get further down and the federal government is involved these guys are actually being charged one guy is on the run

95
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:22,940
 But that's not all that's not all because remember who you're messing with bro. You're messing with eBay and

96
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,140
 eBay known for

97
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,140
 Having access to every single thing on the planet

98
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:37,420
 So I mean I could call up and have a bunch of swingers show up at your house, right? I could not gonna but I could

99
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,780
 But eBay has the villain

100
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,100
 Basically has access to every prank in the world

101
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,820
 So this is they started sending this couple stuff

102
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,620
 They get a bloody Halloween pig mask like the mask the saw pig woman thing

103
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,180
 It's like a head, you know, you guys know what a pig woman looks like

104
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,580
 I don't know. Maybe you don't maybe you don't watch horror movies

105
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,660
 I mean sure it wouldn't be fun to get in the mail, but whatever

106
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,860
 Then now you have a holy costume. Thanks eBay. They sent this is cruel

107
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,660
 Married couple sitting there one day you get a book how to survive the death of a spouse

108
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,140
 That's dark but then the line thinks up

109
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,340
 They send them a box of maggots

110
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,740
 You're like already reading this book. They're like, oh, this is kind of creep. They're sending us some threats

111
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,980
 But next to the big mask

112
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,020
 Next day you get a box the box is moving across your table

113
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,580
 Box of maggots box of live spiders. I mean it come on these guys

114
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,380
 This is genius trolling at this point

115
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,920
 This is when some executive at eBay overheard and goes what you're having a bunch of swir show up at your house

116
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,860
 Why don't we send them all the gross stuff we sell on eBay box of maggots box of live spiders?

117
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,580
 Which you know both of those you have to open right to find the maggots in the spiders

118
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,180
 It's not like you just saw a box on it

119
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,140
 It's from spiders or us with a sticker on it caution live spiders inside they open the box up the spiders poured out

120
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,900
 I know that probably triggered some of you guys and I meant to do that

121
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,660
 I meant to do that open a box up bunch of maggots pop out

122
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,420
 One giant maggots rule them all

123
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,580
 This was funny. This is another funny one. I mean they're all kind of funny except for the book they sent a

124
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,660
 They sent them a bunch of porn

125
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,420
 But see that that's one thing you're like, all right. I just got my free porn magazines first time if you'd go

126
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,180
 They still make porn magazines. This is quite quaint. I'm gonna show this to my hipster friends

127
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,340
 They sent porn, but they sent it to their neighbors with their name on it

128
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,280
 Basically it looks like they were ordering the couple was ordering the porn, but it was getting delivered to the wrong address

129
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,740
 That's a nice spin eBay

130
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,180
 Give a plot for that's funny

131
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,620
 That's that porn to the neighbors with their name on it. That's pretty funny. I'm not doing to me, right?

132
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,500
 But still pretty funny and then they sent them a pig

133
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,460
 I just had to record this story like when I got the reading they sent him a pig fetus

134
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,540
 They sent this couple a pig fetus, but

135
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,300
 But the shipper of the pig fetus something sparked in their brain and was like, hmm

136
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,180
 They actually called up the family first. They probably realized it was going to a residential address

137
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,380
 It was probably like for is this the place my uncle lives in that town

138
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,100
 He's got a bunch of porn that he didn't order and it had his neighbors name on it

139
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,780
 They called up the family go did you order a pig fetus?

140
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:50,100
 No, we did not order a pig fetus so they didn't get that so you're asking yourself what in the world could have

141
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,060
 Prompted six there. I don't know if I said this earlier. It's six different eBay executives

142
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:04,100
 Who have been fired and are currently facing charges one is arrested the other ones on the run and for the people born arrested

143
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,940
 But they're facing these charges

144
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,940
 What could have made these eBay executives again last time allegedly?

145
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,580
 Start a campaign of terror

146
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,940
 sending swingers sending a sex perverts to their house

147
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,540
 pizzas maggots

148
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,620
 Live spiders. They're still running around look behind you. There's one ten yards away from you at any given time. They're everywhere

149
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:35,580
 All this stuff attempted attempted pig fetus delivering what could this couple have possibly done to get this

150
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,020
 They wrote a newsletter

151
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,460
 They wrote a newsletter about e-commerce and in the newsletter they talked about eBay

152
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,580
 said eBay sucked and

153
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,900
 Then in the anonymous comments people to be like you're right eBay sucks

154
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,140
 That was it that was it

155
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,500
 That's terrifying right I

156
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:12,980
 100% thought because I read the article obviously backwards the lead was these this couple writes this newsletter and eBay is harassing them

157
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,700
 And I'm thinking that's

158
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,620
 Impossible I remember reading go they're probably just suing them in court because they got a bloody pig mask and it could have you know

159
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,300
 Someone could have been messing with them or whatever. I thought that's

160
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,700
 Impossible and I kept reading the article and I'm thinking I'm half awake and I'm thinking they're firing civil charges against six eBay executives

161
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:39,660
 Saying that they were speaking truth to power and they were getting harassed because a bloody pig mask got sent to their house and

162
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,880
 Then I was that uh-uh

163
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
 nope

164
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:52,220
 They these people are being charged they're facing jail sentence prison sentences

165
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,860
 They've been fired from their job at eBay after an internal investigation

166
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,540
 That's

167
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,300
 Terrifying and and the couple went to the local police and they were like telling the cops that the cops at first were kind of like

168
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,540
 What I was doing like that sounds impossible

169
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,260
 And then finally the detectives really started looking into it

170
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:16,940
 They pushed it really really hard and then they got all the eBay and eBay started investigating and canned all these people that's terrifying, right?

171
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,380
 like I

172
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,260
 It sounds made up, but no and the the police are saying we're not gonna reveal the name of the couple or their blog

173
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,060
 We're not even gonna reveal it was a blog. It was a blog dude

174
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,900
 Like you know what I mean think about that would be the quick think about how much people crap on Michael Bay online all the time

175
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:43,620
 Right and the fact that Michael Bay would even take one one minute out of his time to post a craigslist ad to send

176
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,120
 Swingers to your house sounds ridiculous

177
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:55,580
 But these guys had a targeted campaign against this couple and that's it who had a blog talking about e-commerce and they're like eBay sucks

178
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,580
 Now and here's the thing we don't know because I don't have access to the blog

179
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,820
 I don't know exactly what they said, but I can't admit the most scathing review of eBay the most

180
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,260
 Expose a review of eBay on this blog

181
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,260
 Would not justify that activity right eBay couldn't I

182
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:24,500
 It's boggles my mind because obviously this wasn't a executive having a bad day and goes you stink leaves like a fake phone call

183
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,580
 This was like targeted harassment over time period, right? It takes a while to arrange a big thing to get sent to somebody's house

184
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,060
 Absolutely bizarre terrifying really

185
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,220
 You think I like I'm always coming across gang stalking stuff, and I'm like a gang stalking any gang stalking me

186
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:48,100
 This is usually a bunch of bunch of weirdos, right? And that was my knee-jerk reaction to this one. It's like there's no way

187
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:55,220
 This is true absolutely creepy, and then I think as I'm reading the article people that I piss off all the time

188
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,940
 Like yeah, so anyways that is a bizarre true crime story. It's funny

189
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,580
 It's good that the people are getting justice and it probably make me pause a little bit more

190
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,580
 When I wake up in the morning and I'm reading an article like this or even in the midday because I completely brushed it off

191
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,660
 I was thinking out this can't be true, but they're being dragged in front of federal court

192
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,340
 Really the couple now they may be making the blog still we don't know but the couple now definitely

193
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,140
 Can sue eBay later on get a ton of money?

194
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,960
 I'm sure lawyers are already salivating over that lawsuit and they got a free free box

195
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,360
 It's out of it, right and they made some new friends. It turns out that the real harassment was the swing or friends

196
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,880
 They made along the way

197
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,320
 I think that is the real lesson to learn from this whole thing. So shame on you

198
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 former executives of eBay and possibly other members of the eBay community allegedly

199
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
 But who knows

200
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,120
 Scary though, isn't it dude like all the stuff that's put out there on a daily basis all those negative opinions out there on a daily basis

201
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,040
 I can understand if you're making fun of like a local restaurant and they like get uppity and they're like no you take that down

202
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,200
 And so I mean it's still still despicable like people are allowed to have their opinions and things like that

203
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,960
 But then the restaurant should just be like ah, whatever we have enough good customers

204
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,200
 Or maybe that review is valid or whatever

205
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:21,200
 But that's like a local thing to have eBay actually care what some blog whether or not the blog had 10 readers or 100,000 readers or whatever

206
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,960
 It wouldn't affect their overall business for whatever reason what this person was saying in this blog

207
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
 Was really digging into eBay's skin

208
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,520
 But still

209
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,120
 Live maggots was a bridge too far eBay. I mean again, I got a free bloody pig mask out of it. That's awesome

210
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
 But everything else is pretty gross. Let's go ahead that story took a long time

211
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,040
 I'm editing nothing that story took a little bit longer than I thought so we're gonna save the davi crocket story for tomorrow

212
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,160
 It's quite short, but it's not short enough to really do justice now

213
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,480
 John let's hop in the carpenter copter. We're leaving behind natik

214
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
 Massachusetts and I yes. Yes, you do notice I have a

215
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,720
 Safeway plastic bag in my hand and john's like you're not really that's not what I think it is

216
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,560
 It's all wiggling

217
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,120
 It's a little of both you'll never know when you need

218
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,520
 A handful of maggot spiders we might in the rest of this story who knows so i'm gonna carry this bag around for the rest

219
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
 They have us in we're flying the helicopter

220
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,640
 We're flying it out

221
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,600
 We're leaving behind the united states and we are headed out to

222
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,480
 Thailand

223
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,680
 We're flying over the villages. It's january 2013. We're going to tamban ta seawang in thailand

224
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,560
 so we're walking through this village

225
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,760
 and

226
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,000
 Everything's going normal. It's just normal village life. There's a bunch of dudes singing about stuff some chick wants to read books

227
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,080
 And then this young healthy man falls over dead

228
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,640
 People are like oh what happened that kind of ruined the big chorus we were building up to

229
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
 A couple days later another young healthy man in the village dies

230
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,960
 Over the course of a couple days four men in total die of some respiratory illness

231
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,480
 So they contact a medium doctors can't figure it out

232
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,040
 So they contact a medium

233
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,840
 And she says you have to hang a red shirt outside of your house if you have a young man in your house

234
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,240
 You have to hang a red shirt outside your house that'll keep the ghost from getting them

235
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
 I actually mentioned this on yesterday's episode

236
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:31,440
 Disease goes away young men stop dying five years later in 141 kilometers away. What is that like 200 miles in nakton

237
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,320
 Ratchezma's femi district

238
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,320
 Young man dies respiratory illness. No one can figure it out a couple days later another young man dies

239
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,360
 respiratory illness

240
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
 This is in 2018

241
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,320
 Word gets out of what the cure could be

242
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,680
 Put a red shirt hanging outside your house

243
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,960
 People stop dying now in in the area

244
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,800
 They attribute this to a a widow's curse a widow's ghost. It's basically a

245
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:08,640
 What it what it sounds like a a woman whose husband died when she passes away her spirit is floating around and it's striking down young men

246
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 Is some sort of brutal revenge thing

247
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,040
 And the red shirt or red towel was to wave it away

248
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,080
 But you know, it's probably just is a skeptic. It's probably just

249
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,440
 Coincidence, right? You have a disease that strikes. You have an unknown respiratory illness that strikes and it's already run its course

250
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,640
 The red shirts don't actually change anything

251
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,120
 The disease would have stopped anyways. Let's leave behind tylen. Let's head out to india. This is in 2020

252
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,200
 We meet a man. We meet the swami

253
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
 chakrapani

254
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
 He's the national president of the all india hindu

255
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 maha shabaha

256
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 And he's making this statement. We're standing in this crowd and he's making this statement in india

257
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
 the corona virus

258
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
 Is an avatar

259
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,040
 sent to get revenge for eating animals and everyone in the

260
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,440
 Crowd is clapping everyone in the crowd is clapping and he's like yes

261
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,160
 Yes, it has come down

262
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,000
 to destroy

263
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,840
 the meat eaters

264
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,000
 And it's ravaging the planet. We've gotten out of control. We've lost our way

265
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,080
 We've lost balance with nature. He knows the cure for it

266
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,880
 The president of china must create an idol of the corona

267
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,160
 And seek forgiveness

268
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,040
 All non vegetarian chinese people must pledge to not hurt any innocent creatures

269
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:40,000
 And doing this will make the corona return to its own plane of existence

270
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,960
 We're standing in this crowd and you go well

271
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,200
 The last i checked the could not only chinese people were eating meat

272
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,600
 And last i checked not only chinese people had corona virus and i was i'm like yes

273
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,000
 Yes, but india and china don't really like each other. I want to use these two stories really as a jumping off point

274
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,840
 Do diseases have a super natural origin?

275
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,480
 We talk about demonic possession where a demon can

276
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,760
 Inhabit a human being and cause it to cause chaos destruction work for ebay starts sending out pig fetuses all this stuff

277
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,520
 A demon can possess a body. Why couldn't a demon?

278
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,000
 possess a germ

279
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,840
 Why couldn't a demon possess something smaller than a human body?

280
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,200
 And if the and i'm not disregarding corona virus or any disease whatsoever. I'm not saying i'm not saying anything like that

281
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
 This is a thought experiment

282
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,400
 But if a demon can possess a human and biblically a demon can possess a pig

283
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,240
 That happened when the dude was possessed and jesus was like you get out of that dude and the demons are like uh, uh, uh

284
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,360
 And that's where that famous quote comes from when jesus has how many demons are in you the demon goes

285
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,440
 We are legion for we are many

286
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,760
 And the demons like no that was a cool line

287
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,200
 But get out get out and the demons are like aw and they he

288
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,440
 God puts them in the bodies of pigs like possesses a bunch of pigs with them

289
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,560
 It's like get in there and then the pigs drown themselves

290
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,960
 the demons cause the pigs to drown themselves so

291
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,880
 Biblically demons can possess non-human creatures in fiction and impossible

292
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
 stories that you see

293
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,160
 Demons may be able to possess inanimate objects

294
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,920
 Onto dolls and stuff like that, but you could debate whether or not one those stories are correct at all

295
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,000
 But you though you could have human ghosts inhabit those as well

296
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,040
 I don't know if a human ghost could technically possess a human

297
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,640
 But I should look into that considering that is kind of my job. But can a demon

298
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,800
 possess

299
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 a germ

300
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,440
 It's an interesting question because what that would mean

301
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,960
 What it would mean is that the germ is vulnerable to the same thing that the demon is vulnerable to

302
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,360
 So again in demon lore you can perform an exorcism on a human

303
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,440
 You can put holy water on a human who's possessed by demon and it would drive these things out

304
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,600
 If you are now again, this is gonna sound completely ridiculous, but if you add a a germ

305
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:11,840
 On a slide like a micro microscope slide and you have a dropper of holy water when squirt squirt

306
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,080
 Would the germ react to it now if you have a microscope

307
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,360
 Please do that. Please go get some water and then start getting people to cough on slides

308
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,840
 Maybe you can find ones that are demonically possessed, but wouldn't that be interesting?

309
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,520
 I think it's an interesting thought experiment. Could a demon infect a germ and if it did

310
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:40,560
 Would when humans are possessed again according to demon lore when humans are possessed they become incredibly strong

311
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,720
 They become super smart. They can speak languages. They basically have

312
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,760
 All the intelligence of a demon. So they've been around for tens of thousands of years of centuries tens of thousands of centuries

313
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,800
 They have all the intelligence of the demon. They're physically strong. They can pick people up. They're in the classroom

314
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,560
 Maybe some mild telekinetic powers now that I think about it is actually interesting because

315
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,280
 Demons don't have a lot of powers once they're in a human body

316
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,200
 They can mildly make stuff levitate, but like dematerialization things like that bending spoons

317
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
 It doesn't really work that way. They're pretty limited

318
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,120
 But they definitely do have increased strength and they have the vast intelligence of a demon

319
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,880
 If you put that into a germ you lose it. I mean, I don't not say the germs are going to be able to bench press 10 other germs

320
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,440
 But it may be able to become a more hearty creature

321
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,800
 a creature more immune to

322
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,280
 cures

323
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
 So if we accept that demons can possess people

324
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,200
 Why couldn't demons possess germs and if demons possess germs?

325
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
 or a virus

326
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,680
 What's to stop it from being a virus that is close to being incurable?

327
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,800
 You could have it so that the demon virus that I can't believe

328
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,160
 I'm actually even saying this out loud. You can have it when the demon demon virus when it splits and replicates

329
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,720
 Does it have the full strength of the demon in each little atom?

330
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,680
 Or does the demon get weaker and weaker?

331
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,000
 And the reason why I think it's interesting is because

332
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 We talk so much about healing the body healing the body when it comes to medicine, but even

333
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,240
 Western medicine is coming around with the idea that you also have to heal the mind

334
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,600
 That visualization plays a huge part in healing

335
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,480
 They do say that having visualization when you're sick imagining the cancer cells slowly dying off turning into nothingness

336
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,120
 helps so much

337
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,080
 So when even western medicine and eastern medicine has always been about the spirit the mind as well

338
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,920
 It's not just like here take this you also have to

339
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,160
 Work on your mind your meditation your onefulness to help defeat the disease

340
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,400
 So what if diseases aren't just a biological enemy?

341
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,760
 What if on just a basic level it's not just attacking the body but attacking the mind attacking the soul?

342
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,960
 So to cure them you have to fight them on both levels

343
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:07,440
 And if we accept that then we can push it one step further and say that not only is a life-threatening disease

344
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,840
 Something that attacks the mind and the body but also something that attacks the spirit the soul

345
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,040
 That's the demonic angle to it

346
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,920
 By no means saying stop taking your medicine. I'm by no means at all saying don't go to the doctor when you're sick

347
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,640
 But you can always supplement

348
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,360
 Your healing with healing you can do yourself do what the doctors tell you to do

349
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,120
 But at the same time being mindful

350
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,720
 Meditating visualizing can help a lot as well

351
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,640
 If the world of the supernatural is inhabiting the world of microbes

352
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,600
 The battle to find cures for these diseases that have plagued mankind for centuries and new ones that are popping up today

353
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,560
 Can go on even longer

354
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:02,480
 Because we're not fighting just one enemy. We're not just fighting a biological enemy. We're not simply fighting an enemy of flesh and blood

355
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
 But of spirit

356
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,400
 It's not one that just creeps in our bedroom at night or follows us down a dark road when we're alone, but it inhabits

357
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,200
 amoebas

358
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,040
 turns sniffles

359
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 into respiratory illnesses

360
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,960
 And we could labor for years and years and years in laboratories

361
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,680
 trying to find a cure

362
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,720
 And when we find a cure we find out it only works or barely works or doesn't work

363
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,120
 But maybe the component that is missing isn't

364
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
 Another amino acid

365
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,200
 Maybe the cure that's missing is the right medicine

366
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,520
 and a red flag

367
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
 hanging outside your house

368
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:52,560
