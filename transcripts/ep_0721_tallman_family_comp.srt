1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 Is it possible that the truth for UFOs lies not by looking in the skies, but by visiting the patent office?

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,200
 Let me take a look at the Tallman family.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,800
 A mother, a father, and their three children just trying to enjoy life in the mid-1980s.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,600
 Everything was going swell until they bought a used bunk bed.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,000
 For the next nine months, the family was haunted, taunted, and tormented

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,800
 until they nearly lost their minds. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,500
 [Music]

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,600
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun doing whatever you're doing. You're shopping for used bunk beds.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
 You're like, "Great, this is the episode we're listening to today."

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,900
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy patreons coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,900
 We have Gregory Gorley. Everyone give a round of applause to go to old Gregory.

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,900
 He's walking into Dead Rabbit Command. He's juggling. Remember when I used to do that?

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:12,900
 Remember when everyone got a special intro? Like guys were riding in on pack of germs and clowns and...

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,900
 You do remember that? I'm listening to you. Oh man.

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,900
 Someday I'll do a behind the scenes of why I dropped doing that. But let's just say I almost lost my mind.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,900
 I almost canceled doing the show. I just couldn't do it anymore. But Gregory's walking.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,900
 He's on the feels pad that he was juggling. Gregory's coming into Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,900
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. You guys can't support the Patreon. That's fine too.

21
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,900
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,900
 Gregory, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,900
 We are first headed off to the Patton office somewhere in the United States.

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,900
 Gregory's driving this old timey Jason Jalopy across the highways and byways of the United States.

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,900
 We walk into the Patton office. There's a bunch of people sitting there wearing their glasses flittling with papers.

26
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,900
 They're like, "Hmm, this invention looks delightful." Pass. And they have a little standby match.

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,900
 And this is what goes on in the Patton office. I'm sure it's way less zany.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,900
 And then like, "Dude, what if the Patton office act, dude? This is dope."

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,900
 You're like, "Jason, just do the episode." "No, hold on. Let me do this bit." I just came up with,

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,900
 "What if the Patton office is full of inventions that they didn't pass patents for because they wanted them?"

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,900
 So there's like anti-gravity slides and bouncy tunnels and stuff like that.

32
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,900
 So when they're like, "Hey, Alfred, go deliver this paperwork." They're like putting on, "Okay, the bit's over. Fine."

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,900
 It sounded funnier in my head. Anyways, the point is we're at the Patton office.

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,900
 And there we're gonna meet a man. His name is Jeffrey Shapiro.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
 He's actually a journalist for The Wall Street Journal.

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,900
 They're very fascinating. He's the one who doesn't wear the Patton office. I don't know why that whole introduction.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,900
 I gotta just say I read an article the other day. I read an article the other day from The Wall Street Journal.

38
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
 We're in my Jeffrey Scott Shapiro. There we go.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,900
 Super, super interesting. It's called UFOs, maybe Earthly, and dangerous.

40
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,900
 He's not talking anything about the old time of UFO sightings like Roswell, the ones around Mount Adams.

41
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,900
 He's not talking about Foo Fighters during World War II.

42
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,900
 He's not talking about all of these historical UFO sightings.

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,900
 Roswell, did I say that one already? He's not talking about that one twice.

44
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,900
 What he's talking about is modern day sightings. He's talking about stuff like the Tic Tac,

45
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,900
 the very famous Tic Tac video over the Nimitz battle group.

46
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,900
 We've talked about it several times on the show. Very, very popular UFO sighting.

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,900
 In 2018, the US Navy registered a Patton with the Patton office.

48
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:56,900
 It was to attach laser beams to aircraft, not for the sake of shooting down Thai fighters.

49
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,900
 But this is so interesting.

50
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,900
 It's for the sake of creating decoys.

51
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,900
 Their initial idea was this. We've been fighting heat seeking missiles for decades now.

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,900
 And sure, we can shoot off the chaff. It looks really cool.

53
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,900
 But you know what? You're flying for your life. You don't care how cool it looks.

54
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,900
 Is it effective? And when you shoot off the chaff, when you shoot off those flares,

55
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,900
 it creates another heat signature. Maybe it'll confuse the missile. Maybe it won't.

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,900
 But it won't confuse another pilot. They'll look at it and they'll go, "Ugh, chaff."

57
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,900
 They'll fly their plane around it. But the missile, it might stop the missile.

58
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,900
 But once you release the chaff, you're still going like Mach 4.

59
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,900
 The chaff is way behind you. It's like miles back.

60
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,900
 So they go, "What if we can create a way to create a decoy that moves with the plane?"

61
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,900
 And that's not where they stop. That's not where they stop.

62
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,900
 Because you could just create heat signatures that kind of go along with the plane.

63
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,900
 They're talking about this patent is to create two-dimensional and three-dimensional images

64
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,900
 next to the fighter jet that will fool all the sensors.

65
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
 [whooshing]

66
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,900
 Chicken little, chicken little. This is rooster hen.

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
 Look out, there's a bogey on your tail.

68
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,900
 [whooshing]

69
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
 [whooshing]

70
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,900
 Missile's coming after you. And you go, "Boop."

71
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,900
 And then all of a sudden, like, another jet appears next to you.

72
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
 [whooshing]

73
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,900
 A hologram of another jet flying next to you.

74
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
 And the missile hits the hologram.

75
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,900
 And you're like, "Jason, that might be out of the 722 episodes you've done.

76
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,900
 That might be the most absurd thing you've ever talked about."

77
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
 Well, that's because you didn't read the article.

78
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
 You didn't read the article.

79
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,900
 You can-- Well, I'm not saying you can do that now.

80
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
 But that's what the idea is.

81
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,900
 You would create holographic images of whatever you wanted next to your plane.

82
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
 You could have a bunch of chickens flying there.

83
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
 You could have-- You could have full bunion.

84
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,900
 You could have full bunion sitting on the wing of your plane.

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
 You could have Superman flying there.

86
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,900
 And it would redirect the missile to the hologram.

87
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,900
 Because it's-- What it is, it's something they call laser-induced plasma filaments.

88
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,900
 So you're creating a super hot hologram.

89
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,900
 It's Jessica Rabbit. She's floating next to your plane.

90
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,900
 The point is, is it'll make the missiles go towards the hologram.

91
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,900
 But it's not just a matter of redirecting missiles.

92
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,900
 They're talking about having 3D holograms that will fool all your sensors.

93
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,900
 So instead of just seeing a jet, you see a bunch of birds on the radar.

94
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,900
 Maybe you're looking out the window and you know you're seeing one jet.

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,900
 Well, it's funny, because I have a friend who used to be a fighter pilot.

96
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
 And I keep talking about, like, you're looking out your window

97
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,900
 and you see the other guy waving at you and the other jet.

98
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,900
 He goes, "Listen, fighter pilot engagements are held like miles apart.

99
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,900
 It's not like you see in the--"

100
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,900
 He goes, "In the movies, they have to capture both of them, like, on the same.

101
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
 You have the camera frame and you see the two of them flying to--"

102
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,900
 He goes, "That doesn't happen that way. It doesn't happen that way."

103
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,900
 And all you're never-- If you were videotaping a fighter pilot fight, you would never see--

104
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,900
 I mean, maybe as they're coming towards each other, he goes, "But it's so fast.

105
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
 The distances are so far."

106
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,900
 It's not like World War II was the plane--

107
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,900
 So, what this all leads up to is he's saying this would--

108
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,900
 If this technology is being used today, it would explain so much stuff like the Tic Tac video.

109
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,900
 It would explain so many of these ghosts that we see that are moving in ways that we can't comprehend--

110
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,900
 We can comprehend them. We just-- Our technology doesn't do that.

111
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
 He goes, "I would explain all of that."

112
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,900
 He goes, "It's possible that the Nimitz group, the Tic Tac video, was a double bluff.

113
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,900
 It was that the US military was testing their own--

114
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,900
 I personally believe that the Tic Tac stuff was never supposed to get released.

115
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,900
 I believe-- I said this a long time ago on an episode. I don't remember which one it was, but--

116
00:07:50,900 --> 00:08:01,900
 The fact that the Nimitz battle group had the most sophisticated surveillance apparatus in human history all in one place, this whole battle fleet,

117
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:11,900
 This was the most advanced surveillance equipment, monitoring equipment in the history of the planet Earth, and that's the time that the Tic Tac shows up.

118
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,900
 This little UFO-- I believe it was someone was testing something that day.

119
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,900
 Was it us? Was it another government? But I don't think we were ever supposed to see that video.

120
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,900
 That video got leaked. But I think that that was a test.

121
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,900
 Someone knew that this group was going to be here on this day and they wanted to run this test.

122
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:36,900
 His idea is that yes, it's possible that the US military did some weird double bluff, where they were testing their own equipment against it,

123
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:44,900
 but this would explain why we have these weird monitor readings, why they last for a long time, why people pursue them but can never catch up to them.

124
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,900
 They can do these weird things. Again, he's not saying that it explains all UFO sightings, just these more modern sightings.

125
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,900
 But they are building this. They have a prototype of it in Japan.

126
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,900
 There's a video of it where they're making 3D shapes just sitting in the sky.

127
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,900
 They look like child's toys. The one in Japan looks like a child's toy.

128
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:11,900
 And at first you think they're projecting it on a wall, but they're actually making like a star shape or a triangle shape or a ball just appear in the sky.

129
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,900
 It's very, very rudimentary at this point, but that's the stuff that Japan is showing up.

130
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,900
 Let's look at these quotes. This is from the actual US Navy patent.

131
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:31,900
 "There can be multiple laser systems mounted on the back of the air vehicle with each laser system generating a ghost image, such that there would appear to be multiple air vehicles present."

132
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:46,900
 The patent continues, "The potential applications of this lip flare decoy," and the lip is the laser induced plasma, "flare decoy can be expanded, such as using a helicopter deploying flares to protect a battleship,

133
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:56,900
 or using this method to cover and protect a whole battle group of ships, a military base, or an entire city."

134
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:03,900
 So they're really pushing for this technology to work. It would be the equivalent of a force field without the force.

135
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:12,900
 I guess it's just a field, but it would completely confuse all the sensors. They wouldn't know what the target was, and you can make it look like there were 100 fighter jets overhead.

136
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,900
 Big question is, can you make it look like there's nothing there?

137
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:28,900
 I guess that's stealth technology. I'm like, whoa, I just made a huge breakthrough. I guess that's just stealth technology, but this could explain a lot of these UFO sightings that are being picked up.

138
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,900
 Does it explain the ones where the pilots are seeing the object? If it's advanced enough, it is.

139
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:44,900
 If they can create the ghost image and they can make a 3D image appear flying next to the jet, it's all like really low polygon. It looks like something from Lawnmower Man.

140
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:54,900
 You're like, ah, that's the fake one. But even then, going up the speeds that fighter pilots are traveling at, a low polygon jet is still going to look like a jet.

141
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:02,900
 Very, very interesting story, and if you can make something that looks like a jet, you sure can make something look like a UFO.

142
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:10,900
 And even though we do have a lot of stories of people opening fire on UFOs and chasing UFOs, you're a little more hesitant because you don't know what it is.

143
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,900
 When you see something, you don't know what it is. If you see a US fighter jet and you're a country that hates the United States, you just shoot it.

144
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:27,900
 But if you see this, you see the Jetsons and Elroy driving the vehicle, you're going to wait a little bit longer to pull that trigger.

145
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,900
 Unless you're more of a Flintstones fan and then bombs away, Astro.

146
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,900
 Gregory, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbonercopter. We are leaving behind the Patent Office.

147
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:47,900
 We are heading on out to Hori-Kon, Wisconsin.

148
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:57,900
 It's February 1987, and we're in Hori-Kon, Wisconsin. Specifically, we're on a little street. No one is Larrabee Street.

149
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:04,900
 Now, some of you guys may be old enough to remember that this story was originally on Unsolved Mysteries.

150
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:15,900
 It was actually in the first season. It was like episode 3 or 4. But what's interesting, the whole story is interesting, but what led me to actually dig deeper into this story?

151
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:26,900
 It's lost media now. Sure, you can find it on YouTube, so it's not technically the definition of lost media, but unsolved mysteries on any streaming platform.

152
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:35,900
 This segment is removed from the episode. There's only one way to really get it legally. I mean, at any point, YouTube can pull it, pull this segment.

153
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:43,900
 There's a VHS copy of Unsolved Mysteries. It's like ghost stories. It's like they took some of their best ghost stories and put together this VHS copy.

154
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:52,900
 There, you can hear the story of the Tallman ghost. I'll have a link to the YouTube video and the show notes, but will it get copyright strike? Who knows?

155
00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:01,900
 Because it shouldn't be there. Unsolved Mysteries themselves have removed it from their catalog. You can no longer watch this officially.

156
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:13,900
 We'll get to why in a bit, but let's take a look at the story of the Tallman family right now. You have a family of five. You have Allen and Debbie Tallman, and then they have their three little kids.

157
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:24,900
 You have Danny, their son, and then two unnamed daughters. They're like, "Oh, we'll figure a name out for you later." And actually, when Unsolved Mysteries came to them, they said, "We'll only do the show on these conditions.

158
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:32,900
 One, our faces are completely blacked out. We don't want anyone to know our identity other than our first and last name and the house we used to live in.

159
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,900
 And two, you can't use the names of our children, because we don't want this to affect them growing up. Any more than the horrifying hunting did.

160
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:50,900
 We don't want them to be tracked down by reporters or anything like that." But Allen and Debbie Tallman, and then their three anonymous children, they recently moved into this house on Larrabee Street.

161
00:13:50,900 --> 00:14:00,900
 And while they're moving in, they're getting their furniture together. They have to buy some extra furniture. They buy a used bunk bed at a secondhand shop, and they put it together in their basement.

162
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:08,900
 Everyone's like, "Yay, bunk bed! This is going to be so fun!" That was Allen who said that, and Debbie's like, "Why did I marry the man who talks like a baby?"

163
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:22,900
 May 1987, they decide to move the bunk bed upstairs. I don't know if the kids were sleeping in the basement previous to that, but in May 1987, they're like, "You kids have been really good these past few months. No more sleeping on the floor for you.

164
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:44,900
 Yay! Here's the bunk bed that we've withheld as a punishment." May 1987, they move the bunk bed upstairs. And that night, that very night they move the bunk bed up, their son Danny is sleeping in his bedroom, and all of a sudden his clock radio starts changing channels super fast, and it startles him.

165
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:55,900
 It scares him, he looks, and he actually sees the little bar, the little, remember those old timey radios that you had to manually change the channel? He could see the bar go back and forth.

166
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:03,900
 He runs out of his room, he tells his parents, "Dude, Mom, Dad, there's stuff going on in my room, like the radio's going on and off, and I can see that." And the parents get really upset.

167
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:13,900
 The parents get really upset, and he's older. He's probably like eight or nine at this point. Past all this ghost nonsense, and that gets mad, and he goes, "Listen, we gave you the clock radio because we knew you'd like it.

168
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:26,900
 But if you're going to be doing the shenanigans, we're taking it from you." Which totally reminded me of something my dad would have said. I chuckled when I saw that. And the horrifying stuff that happens later, I also had to chuckle.

169
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:34,900
 So he's like, "I'd rather have the clock radio, I'd rather be able to listen to Debbie Gibson late at night, so fine, Dad, whatever."

170
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:44,900
 Shortly after that, their children, who were normally really healthy, they all start to get sick. The mom, Debbie, said, "We would take at least one of the kids to the doctor a week."

171
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:53,900
 Like, it was just nuts, and they were normally healthy. But again, you're not really thinking at this point. Maybe it's the bunk bed.

172
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,900
 Right? You're not thinking, "I wonder where my kid" all of a sudden has a strep throat, and you're looking around for any items that could be cursed.

173
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:10,900
 They're not even approaching a haunted explanation right now. One day, Alan, he's in the basement, he's painting, because this house they're still settling into, and they're trying to make it their own home.

174
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:21,900
 He's painting in the basement, and all of a sudden, "Honey, it's time for lunch!" Debbie calls out. And Alan puts his paintbrush down and walks upstairs to go eat lunch.

175
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:38,900
 When he comes back downstairs into the basement, the paintbrush was in the paint can, and that's not where he left it. But even more odd, I think this detail actually weirded me out more than anything, and I don't know why.

176
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:50,900
 Because we're getting into some weird stuff. This part stuck out to me the most when he walks downstairs. The paintbrush is in the paint bucket, but it's in there with bristles up.

177
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,900
 The handle is in the paint now.

178
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:03,900
 And you're waiting for it to be all bloody. You're waiting for it to be like, "La la la la la la la." It's on a haunted rocking chair.

179
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:13,900
 No, because that shows that whatever this is, is a jerk. Right? At that point, it's like flinging it across the room. Yeah, that's like a show of power.

180
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:23,900
 When you take a paintbrush, stick it with the handle. I mean, that's Dennis the Menace-esque ghost action. Very creepy. Like, that's sinister.

181
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:34,900
 You're like, "Hey, Sin, it's really not that big of a deal." Well, it is to me. That was it. Okay, I'm gonna say this. If you're getting ready to shut it off, if you're like, "Wait, if that's the creepiest part."

182
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:46,900
 No, no, no, don't shut it off. It gets way creepier than that. To me, that was just unsettling. But it gets more unsettling. But for me, maybe I'm just jaded.

183
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,900
 They're still living in this house. So what are you gonna do? It's not like he's like, "Honey, let's pack it up. My paintbrush is ruined. Let's go."

184
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,900
 She's like, "What?" He's like, "No, just pack up dinner. We're gonna go at a hotel." The two daughters sleep in the same room.

185
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,900
 And one day, the little girl is telling her mom, "Mommy, mommy, you won't believe what happened last night."

186
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:19,900
 And the mom goes, "What happened, little one?" And she goes, "I was in bed, and it was dark. It was nighttime. And I wake up next to my older sister, and it's just me awake.

187
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:34,900
 And I look, and there's, the door is open to the bedroom. And then I look, and behind the door, like the door was open. I looked, mommy, and there was a witch.

188
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:46,900
 There was a witch in my room, mommy. And she had red eyes. They glowed in the dark, like two rubies standing on the precipice of the ebony maw.

189
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:54,900
 And there was fire behind the witch, mom. There was fire behind the witch."

190
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:06,900
 Now, the daughter wasn't that. The daughter, I think, basically came down and goes, "Hey, mom, there's a witch in my room. I woke up. There was a witch. There was a witch standing around the door.

191
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:17,900
 And then I saw fire. And I don't think she was retelling a Robert E. Howard novel. But the point is, is the mom was like, "Okay, that's weird. But again, it's not to the level of haunting.

192
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:26,900
 Because what we have right now is paintbrush, people getting sick, the clock radio, and these are all like months apart, right?

193
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,900
 And then your youngest daughter sees a witch, a witch in her room.

194
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,900
 And she's like, "You know, okay, no more television for you, young lady."

195
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:43,900
 But then, a couple days later, Danny comes to his mom and says, "Mom, you...

196
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,900
 Listen, I know you guys didn't believe me about the clock radio, and I know you guys are tired of taking me to the doctor because I'm always sick.

197
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,900
 But mom, I saw something in my room last night. Mom's like, "What?" He goes, "Okay, this is gonna sound so weird."

198
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,900
 But I saw a witch. I saw like a... how you would imagine a witch to look.

199
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,900
 And she was surrounded by fire.

200
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:16,900
 She was just standing in my room staring at me with these blood red eyes. And the mom is like, "Okay, okay, now this place has to be haunted."

201
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 This is the first time they start thinking ghosts.

202
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:28,900
 At some point, they invite their local pastor over, and the pastor walks in the house and he goes, "This place is evil.

203
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,900
 There's something wrong with this place. I do believe that there's some sort of demonic activity in this house."

204
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,900
 But it's that old trope. You just bought the house.

205
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,900
 You can't... you've signed a mortgage, you've signed on the paperwork. It's gonna take you forever to sell it.

206
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,900
 Maybe something's going on. Maybe there's like some witch. Maybe there's some more fine witch making your children sick.

207
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,900
 Who knows? They're not putting away that the bunk bed has anything to do with it.

208
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,900
 First, they don't think it's a hunting at all. Now they're thinking it's the house somewhere that anything can... so much time has passed.

209
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,900
 So not until they start looking back that they think the bunk bed has anything to do with anything of this.

210
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,900
 Now they're just kind of plagued by normal, quote-unquote "normal" paranormal activity.

211
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,900
 Doors opening and closing, weird noises, ghostly voices crying out from the darkness.

212
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:22,900
 The week before Christmas 1987, Danny is sleeping on the couch. Because why not? Because why not?

213
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:30,900
 There's a fiery witch in your room. Mind as well, just sleep on your couch next to all the Christmas lights and try to get a peaceful sleep.

214
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:39,900
 He wakes up in the middle of the night and sees a horrifying figure just standing there in the darkness.

215
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:46,900
 Now it's really interesting, they don't describe what he looks like on Unsolved Mysteries. They just show the child's reaction.

216
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,900
 Which actually makes it very scary, because they don't show this creature on the show. They don't even describe what it looks like.

217
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:59,900
 There was a book though called "Hunted America" which fills in more of the description. Apparently this is what Danny said that he saw.

218
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,900
 They said it was a human figure, but it was so indistinct you couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman.

219
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:12,900
 There's a standing there, almost like a shadow person, a pitch black figure standing in the darkness.

220
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
 So dark that you can still make the outline of it.

221
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:22,900
 And had glowing red eyes with green pupils just staring at Danny.

222
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:32,900
 And Danny flipped out, he's like "I'm done, I can't do this." Yes, the eyes are very Christmasy, but still. Everything else is unChristmasy.

223
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,900
 He freaks out, he starts crying, the dad comes out of his room and he just loses it.

224
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:44,900
 The dad is like "Come on, you wanna fight? Let's fight! You wanna go, let's go, why don't you pick on someone your own size?"

225
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,900
 Just kind of antagonizing this creature, whatever it is. But I can understand it.

226
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:57,900
 It's really... I don't have kids. Maybe if someone came and started messing with my Deep Space Nine action figures,

227
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,900
 I'd be like "Come on man, you wanna take on someone your own size?" Pulled the guys to throw them around the room.

228
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,900
 I'm like "Stop, stop, fight me, fight me! What did Cisco ever do to you?"

229
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:14,900
 But I'm sure people's love for their children are more than my love for my Deep Space Nine action figures.

230
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,900
 I hope so. Because my heart, they're all super dusty, they're just sitting there.

231
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,900
 But anyways, the point is, is like, I feel for the dude.

232
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:28,900
 He said on the episode of Unsolved Mysteries, he goes "I would go to work and at work I would wonder, is my family dead?

233
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,900
 Am I gonna come home and everyone in the house is murdered or just dead?"

234
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,900
 Like that's not a fun work environment, right? That's not a fun anything environment!

235
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 He was so stressed out about his house. On January 7th, he was working the late shift, so he's gonna get home until like 2 in the morning.

236
00:23:46,900 --> 00:24:09,900
 [Fart noise]

237
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,900
 It's so funny, because I don't know if any of that got picked up on, and I'll edit it out, but there's another episode that happened too.

238
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:25,900
 It sounds like someone's walking around in my closet. Anyone who's seen, this is an aside, and it may get edited out, but anyone who's watching or recording an episode or seen footage,

239
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,900
 my closet is not the smallest closet, it's not the biggest closet either.

240
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,900
 I'm perfectly still for the most part. Sometimes I'll wiggle around in my chair and then Mike will pick that up.

241
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:42,900
 But right there it sounded like someone was walking around in my closet, and what's interesting about that, there is no room to walk when I'm sitting here.

242
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:50,900
 That's happened twice recently. So, I don't know what it could be. See, that was me shifting in my chair, it's a totally different time.

243
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:57,900
 But anyways, that may have not got picked up, we may edit that out, or it may be a sign of something super spooky coming up, we don't know.

244
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,900
 January 7th, Alan gets home from the late shift, the 2 a.m. late shift from work.

245
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,900
 When he pulls his car up, he hears the wind.

246
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,900
 It's almost like he's walking in a wind tunnel, and at the same time he hears a howl.

247
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:22,900
 Now this is like a suburban neighborhood, right? There shouldn't be this stuff going, I mean there can be wind in the suburban neighborhood,

248
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:29,900
 but he knows something's up, and he hears this howl, and he hears the wind, and then he hears, "Come here."

249
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,900
 This is the first haunting really outside the house, he's just in the driveway, and he's kind of perturbed at all the stuff's going on.

250
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:44,900
 He goes in, he looks around the corner of the house, and once he steps around the corner of the house, the wind ends, the howling ends, the voice is gone.

251
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:52,900
 So he goes back into the front of his garage, and he's walking in his house, and all of a sudden the wind and the howling begins again, and he just hears,

252
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:59,900
 "Come here, come here, come here."

253
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:06,900
 Over and over and over again as he's walking towards the front door, and finally he turns around, he gets fed up with whatever this is,

254
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,900
 he turns around, his garage is fully engulfed in flames.

255
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:19,900
 He panics, like what are you doing in this moment? He goes inside, he puts down his lunch pail, he thinks about it for a second,

256
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,900
 he's like, "Wait a second, my garage is on fire, I better do something."

257
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,900
 He goes back outside, the fire is gone.

258
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:33,900
 There's no damage at all to his garage, he's looking around, he doesn't see anything damaged, there never was a fire.

259
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:40,900
 He goes back inside, and he's like, "Okay, that was super annoying, that took some time out of my day, kind of woke me up, it's 2 AM."

260
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:47,900
 He picks up his lunchbox, and as he's walking through his living room, something grabs his lunchbox and hurls it across the living room.

261
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:54,900
 Again, this is a Dennis the Menace level ghost, like he waited for him to pick it up before he threw it.

262
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:03,900
 One night he's sleeping in his daughter's room because they don't feel comfortable, no one feels comfortable, they're probably drawn straws to see who gets to sleep with Dad that night.

263
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
 So the ghost doesn't get them even though he's not immune to it.

264
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:16,900
 One night he's sleeping in his daughter's room, he's on the floor, a mist fills the room, covers him up, and he hears a voice go, "You're dead."

265
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:23,900
 A few nights after that, Alan's like, "Listen, I do have to work, I have to pay for this horrible, horrible house and food for my children."

266
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:33,900
 He asks one of his relatives, he goes, "Hey listen, I know you don't believe in ghosts or anything like that, I know you're total skeptic, would you mind staying at my house, keeping it on my kids while I'm gone?

267
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,900
 You know, be careful, stuff may burst into flames, don't try painting anything."

268
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,900
 The skeptic goes, "Yeah, yeah, totally, I will take care of it."

269
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:51,900
 The skeptic is sleeping in the girl's room, he's on the floor, all of a sudden the entire house is awakened by his horrifying scream.

270
00:27:51,900 --> 00:28:05,900
 Apparently what he saw was while he was sleeping on the floor, he saw the same pitch black figure standing in the girl's bedroom, just staring down at him, with blood red eyes and green glowing pupils.

271
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:14,900
 This figure looked at this formerly skeptical relative and said, "Now, you're involved."

272
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:23,900
 He yelled and ran out of the little girl's room and the mom comes around the corner, she's just woken up from the scream and she asks this dude,

273
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,900
 "Where are the girls?" and he goes, "They're still in the room."

274
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,900
 Like, I just got up and left, I totally left them there, she runs in, grabs the kids and she goes, "That's it, we're moving out, we're done."

275
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,900
 They left the house, they never returned to the house.

276
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:46,900
 The news spread around the city of Hori Khan as a rumor at first, there was a house on Larrabee Street that was horribly haunted, but the rumor grew in strength.

277
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,900
 You begin to have hundreds of cars driving through the neighborhood to get a glimpse of the house.

278
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,900
 Neighbors were insistent, there's nothing going on there.

279
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:03,900
 Sure, I'm living in a different house, but I've never seen anything ghost there, I don't know what's going on, but other people were like trying to break into the house, they were going to fight the demons.

280
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:11,900
 The place we're getting called out constantly, they were catching drunk people hanging out of the house, they were catching drunk people trying to break into the house.

281
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:18,900
 Okay.

282
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
 I keep seeing something out of the corner of my eye.

283
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:28,900
 You know, I'll tell you guys this, you guys are ever going to record a paranormal podcast, don't do it, don't do it in a haunted closet.

284
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:36,900
 The police had to keep coming out to this location because they're getting reports of drunk people in the area, people were getting drunk and being like, "What, I could totally fight a demon, I don't believe in ghosts."

285
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
 Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

286
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
 And they're trying to break into the house.

287
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,900
 At one point, there was a group of people threatening to burn down the house.

288
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:50,900
 What happened was the rumors were becoming more than just, "There's a ghost, there's a haunted bunk bed," things like that.

289
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:58,900
 People started to believe that the house itself was a portal to hell, so you had to destroy the house, burn it down in the middle of this residential neighborhood, burn the house down.

290
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,900
 The police were like, "We can't, we can't keep 24-hour surveillance on this house, we also can't let people burn it down."

291
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,900
 So they contacted the tall men and they said, "We know some reporters who will cover the story very fairly in a non-exploitive way.

292
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,900
 Can you talk to them to clear a bunch of this stuff up?"

293
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
 Because we're having a bunch of reports that aren't true.

294
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,900
 And the tall men family didn't want anything to do with the story, but the police were pleading with them.

295
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
 They said yes.

296
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,900
 And then around the same time, Unsolved Mysteries was starting their first season.

297
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,900
 This was one of the very first episodes they covered was the Tall Men Ghost.

298
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,900
 Unsolved Mysteries came out there and made this arrangement with the family as well.

299
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,900
 It made the house more popular, but it also did solidify the legend.

300
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,900
 So there were no more talks of this haunted house.

301
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,900
 The idea was it was a haunted bunk bed.

302
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,900
 And the Tall Men family said they did remove the bunk bed because they felt responsible.

303
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
 They weren't just going to leave that there.

304
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,900
 And they buried it in a landfill, a private landfill.

305
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,900
 They said no house will ever be put on top of it.

306
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
 It's gone forever.

307
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
 The house itself wasn't haunted.

308
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,900
 The next owners of the house never reported paranormal activity.

309
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,900
 And as far as we know, the Tall Men family has not reported any paranormal activity either.

310
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,900
 It's interesting because the Unsolved Mysteries episode ends with Debbie saying,

311
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
 "Someone asked me, 'Can the haunting follow you?'"

312
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
 And her answer, "I don't know.

313
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,900
 Before this happened, I really didn't know anything about ghosts."

314
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
 She doesn't know the rules.

315
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:40,900
 But they did bury the bunk bed, and that seemed to have ended whatever was happening at this house.

316
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,900
 An interesting end to this story is that to this day, the Tall Men family does not want this story being told.

317
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
 You're like, "Jason, you jerk. Well, hold on."

318
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,900
 The Tall Men family said, "We do not want this segment aired on Unsolved Mysteries.

319
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,900
 We are not going to allow you the rights to show it on your streaming networks."

320
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,900
 Now, when they signed the contract, it was for reruns on television,

321
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,900
 but for streaming, they had to do new contracts.

322
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:13,900
 And the Tall Men family, when contacted, reportedly said, "No. We're done with this story.

323
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,900
 We don't want any more publicity about it. We're absolutely done. You cannot run this on streaming."

324
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,900
 So the only place you can find it right now is on YouTube.

325
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,900
 For now. It could be gone soon.

326
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,900
 So the next time you're in a Goodwill or Thrift Store or a secondhand shop,

327
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,900
 maybe put down that item that catches your eye.

328
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,900
 Maybe just walk past the antique that you feel calling to you.

329
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:45,900
 Sure, you might just want to have a cool chachki in your house, a conversation piece,

330
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,900
 or maybe it's a useful piece of furniture.

331
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:55,900
 But it could be calling out to you not because of any sort of fashion sense or the price is good.

332
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,900
 It could be calling out to you from beyond the depths of hell.

333
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,900
 And if that sounds like an extreme exaggeration,

334
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:13,900
 just ask the Tall Men family if they've ever shopped again at a secondhand store.

335
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,900
