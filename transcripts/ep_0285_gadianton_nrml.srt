1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 A man leaving his house one day has a bizarre encounter with a cloud.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,720
 And then we take a look at the story of the Gattington Portal, a personal favorite of mine.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,280
 Four young college students on their way home from a rodeo tried to take a shortcut.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,840
 But instead, the shortcut takes them out of this world today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:34,320
 [Music]

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,760
 I'm still dealing with the effects of my rolled ankle.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,240
 Woke up today. My toes were numb.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,400
 And they were going numb.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,120
 I let it go on for a couple hours and I was like, "That's not good."

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,000
 So I hobbled up to the doctor office.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,440
 Got checked out by my doctor. My doctor has those eyes.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,200
 She's actually my backup doctor. I have like my main doctor and then there's this backup doctor.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,320
 I see her once in a while.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,520
 I'm sitting there. My little toes, he's all numb.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,640
 And the backup doctor walk. I'm sure she has an official title. Don't remember her name.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,680
 But she walks in the office and she has those wolf eyes, like those penetrating blue eyes.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,400
 And every time I see her, I'm a little speechless. It's so weird.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,680
 She walks in and I feel like a deer that's like walking through the woods.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,240
 And she does this all the time. She kind of, she doesn't say anything.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 She opens, the door opens up. Backup doctor kind of walks into the room.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,920
 She kind of turns around the door and she makes eye contact with me.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,960
 And she's completely silent as she's like moving towards me.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,040
 And then she sits down and she goes, "Hi, I'm wolf woman, the doctor."

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,240
 But for those like five seconds where she walks in silently, she makes eye contact with you.

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,880
 You feel, you, there's just like this primordial fear.

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,680
 She's a good doctor. I'm not knocking her for her supernatural ability to frighten me.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,760
 But anyway, she sat down. She felt that she was like feeling my toes and she checked the pulse

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,480
 and everything like that. And she's, because I was afraid my toes were going to fall off,

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,960
 that I had some circulation issue and she's like, "Nah, nah, you're fine."

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,200
 So there you go. That was a great afternoon.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,760
 And she's like, "You can't do anything for it. You just got to heal."

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,640
 That story had nothing to do with anything we're going to talk about.

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,040
 Let's go ahead. Oh, and one last thing, one last thing.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,480
 Also, we got a new Patreon supporter, Ash Knotts. I know Ash Knotts.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,120
 She's a, I guess I would say friend of mine. I've only met her a couple of times, but she's pretty cool.

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,720
 She's also a director and she also directed me in a short film that should be coming out any day now.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,760
 So when that happens, I'll tell you guys about it.

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,360
 Tell you guys where you can watch it. It'll probably hit the film festival circuit for a while.

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,200
 And then me and the dude who were in the movie, we already planned this.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,520
 I hadn't told Ash and Dan this yet, but we're going to talk about the movie on an episode of

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,800
 Dead or Abba Radio and one of the special episodes because there was a ghost when we were shooting.

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,480
 It was either a ghost or a hobo on the set. Maybe both. Maybe a ghost hobo,

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,480
 but I have a ton of crazy stories from four hours of shooting this short horror film that Ash directed.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,560
 And when the movie comes out, we'll do a special. I'll tell you all about the ghost

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,120
 and how it almost got killed by a spider and almost fell out of a house and all the sorts of stuff.

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 So, but anyways, so thank you, Ash. Thank you to all the Patreon to have supported the show.

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,160
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode now. Let's hop on the Carbentercopter.

51
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,280
 It's been a couple of days we haven't used the Carbentercopter. I can't really walk anyways.

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,440
 Let's hop on the Carbentercopter and I'm going to fly while you work the pedals

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,360
 because my feet hurt. My one foot hurts, but I'm just like a baby at this point.

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,520
 I'm like, oh, I can't move my legs. So I'm flying and you're sitting down and you're,

55
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,040
 I'm assuming there's pedals on a helicopter. I have no idea. I don't think it's actually

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,160
 pedal powered. You're like, oh, upper body workout. But anyways, we're flying all the way back

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:45,480
 to the year 1975. We are going to Long Island, New York, truly near the city that never sleeps.

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,920
 And we land. Your arms are all, your arms are all sore and I'm like, carry me out.

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,760
 Carry me out. So you pick me up and now you're carrying me out of helicopter.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,400
 Like Wolverine and Professor X put me down into a hover chair and now we're like, oh,

61
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,440
 thanks. We're floating around Long Island. We're specifically going to Oyster Bay.

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,360
 And on this day, this is a summer day. There's a science teacher, local science teacher named Tom

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,960
 Deer Cole. I never said that name out loud. Deer Cole. Deer Cole, maybe it doesn't matter.

64
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,720
 Sounds like Steve Erkel. Anyways, so Tom's like, oh, he's all goofy, high suspenders. He walks out.

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,800
 I never didn't even, didn't even think it was anything like that. He walks out of his house,

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,480
 big glasses. He's like, yeah, I can't wait to get to work. I'm going to blow something up.

67
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,800
 He's not a terrorist. He's not a terrorist. He's a science teacher. I should have explained that

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,760
 before him talking about blowing stuff up through like making potions and stuff, not like rigging

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,000
 bombs. He's like, oh, I can't wait to kill all my enemies. So he's not a terrorist. He's a science

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,480
 teacher. He's a high school science teacher. Tom Deer Cole walks out of his house and he's

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,520
 getting in his car. And it's then when he looks up in the sky and he sees like a little black cloud

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,640
 floating there. He's like, well, that's weird. According to my calculations, what accent is

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,600
 that to? That's like hillbilly. He's like, that's weird. According to my calculations, clouds shouldn't

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,200
 do that. And so the clouds kind of float in there and he notices first off, it's a bright sunny day.

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,240
 He sees all the clouds in the sky and he sees this one particular black cloud, but it's much lower

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,400
 than the other clouds in the sky. And then he notices something even more unusual. It's flying

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,600
 against the wind. He's like, that's bizarre. He's flying against the wind. And then it starts to

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,040
 lower towards him. Morning. This is the morning. This isn't at a spooky, spooky night. He's not

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,120
 in a graveyard. He's just walked out of his house and he's watching this black cloud start to lower

80
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,560
 itself towards him. And as it's lowering towards him, he notices it stops being like it originally

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,960
 was like a round globulous shape. So just like this big lumpy cloud. But then it starts to get bigger

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,360
 and change shape. So it's descending and it's getting closer and it's changing shape. And

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,000
 eventually he says, he described it as an abstract curved vapor. So it's basically, it almost seems

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,360
 like it's making some sort of real shape. It's no longer just like a little fluffy cloud with a

85
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,560
 carabare on it. It's like this MC Escher designed the cloud and it's still coming towards him.

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,840
 And then eventually it gets to within spinning distance of him. So it's quite close. And then

87
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,560
 he sees, he pulls out his calculator and he's calculating this. He's like, oh, maybe Laura

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,920
 will love me now that I found this new cloud. I'll name it after her. And he sees the cloud a little

89
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:41,320
 like, he describes it as lips. Like he sees like a little gap appear in the front of the cloud.

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,320
 And it goes, and he's like, it looked like it sucked in. Like I actually saw a little gap up here.

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,920
 And then it looked like it had the reflex of sucking something in. He's afraid now because

92
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,440
 now it's completely unnatural. First you could be like, well, maybe the wind was pressing against

93
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,440
 it and making it small and maybe it was black because it was a tar cloud or whatever. But once

94
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,240
 he saw a little mouth appear and go, eh, you know, there's no explaining that. And there's no

95
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,080
 explaining what happened next. He's standing on the ground, the clouds in the air. And when I said

96
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:19,720
 spinning distance, I was literal because then it goes, and spits water on Tom slipping in it.

97
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:29,880
 And then it just fades away into nothing. So he's drenched. His car is drenched. And he runs inside

98
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,320
 and takes off his wet clothes, puts on some dry clothes, and then puts the wet clothes in a bag,

99
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,880
 gets in his car and drives to his high school science lab. And he starts running tests on his

100
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,400
 clothes. And he is able to tell the pH level from the liquid on his clothes that it's water.

101
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,880
 So it's fit water. I think the first thing, if I was walking down the street and a cloud appeared

102
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,560
 and started following me on the street, I'm walking a little bit faster. I can't even walk

103
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,880
 right now. I'm using my crutch and hobbling the clouds getting closer. I'm like, oh no, not today,

104
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,280
 not today. It's getting closer and closer to me. I'm like, where's my friends who carry me in a

105
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,400
 helicopters? And then it starts spitting on me. My first fear would be like, I'm going to melt or

106
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,640
 turn into a cloud. Like there's, it spilled some sort of chemical on me that's going to have a

107
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,160
 horrible effect. It's not just water, but it was apparently just water. It's considered a cryptid,

108
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,640
 and it's known as the sky spitter. And it's the only time it's ever been seen. Or I guess a more

109
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,520
 app description is it might be the only time someone's ever survived an encounter with this thing.

110
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,080
 No, it's probably the only time it's ever been seen. There's a, I mean, I don't know how it could

111
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 kill you unless you were in the Arctic and you're like, I'm all bundled up. Don't have to worry about

112
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,040
 anything. And then then clouds start spitting on you and you freeze to death. But I think that

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,960
 this is one of the stories that either he made it up completely, somebody else made it up,

114
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,280
 which having the last name, the oracle, might be a little bit of a clue that it's made up. I never

115
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,360
 said that name out loud until I was reading it. Either he made it up, someone else made it up,

116
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,760
 or it's true. Those are, with these type of stories, those are really where you're at. And

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,520
 it's really hard to kind of debunk that. I mean, it defeats all logic that a cloud could spit on

118
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,320
 somebody. But I mean, you know, where do things have happened? I think if you believe in stuff like

119
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,760
 ghosts and bigfoot and aliens, a cloud, a cloud chasing someone, spitting on him. But it would

120
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,040
 be interesting to find out, like, is there a phenomenon that he could have mistaken it for?

121
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,960
 That's always, I guess, the fourth thing that the event actually happened, but it didn't,

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,840
 it wasn't the phenomenon he thought it was. Maybe he doesn't know it, but he's a real-life

123
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,920
 Charlie Brown character whenever he gets sad, a little dark cloud appears over his head.

124
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,280
 Maybe he's a toon. We don't know these things. All we know is that one day Tom Deerkel walked out

125
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,240
 of his house and got spit on by a cloud. I wonder if we ever wash those clothes. I wonder if they're

126
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,280
 like sitting behind like a glass frame in his house. Oh, moldy. They're all super moldy. They're

127
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,160
 like 30, 40 years. Actually, they're older than me. They'd be 43 years old now, just 43 years old,

128
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,480
 a black mold growing on these things. He's like sitting on my lap, grandkids, and I'll tell you

129
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,720
 about the time that a cloud spit on me. And they're like, "No, grandpa. No, not again." He's like,

130
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,480
 "Smell it. Smell the black mold. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story." He's married to Laura.

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,080
 We finally got together. Our next story is a personal favorite of mine. It's a story. I think

132
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,920
 I heard it on Mysterious Universe a long time ago. I actually really, really like this story.

133
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,160
 Let's go ahead and hop back in the carbonar copter and we're flying around. You carry me back in

134
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,640
 the carbonar copter. We're looking out for clouds. We have cloud bursting. Actually, no, that makes

135
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,960
 more clouds, doesn't it? We're flying around. We're trying to avoid clouds. The little black

136
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,520
 clouds are chasing us. We outmaneuver them. We're actually going back in time a little bit further.

137
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 We're going back to the year 1972. So, the clouds are shaking their fists at us as we disappear

138
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:57,560
 into the time portal. We'll spit you next time. So, we're back in time now. It's 1972. We're going

139
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,600
 to Utah. Welcome to Utah, the big square state. And it's flat. And there's a bunch of Latter-day

140
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,280
 Saints there. I actually heard that they're going by the name Mormon now. They're just like, "I give

141
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,080
 up." When I was a kid, it was an insult called Mormons Mormons. They went by Latter-day Saints

142
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,920
 and nowadays they're just like, "Whatever. That's the term that sticks around." We're flying our

143
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,560
 helicopter through Utah. And we are going, "You know what? I'm going to kick back in this one.

144
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,240
 I'm going to shrink myself down to a little dude. I'm going to squeeze into the back seat of this car."

145
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,720
 What? What am I talking about? Okay. Okay. No.

146
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,640
 Okay. I'm going to be just watching this whole thing. I'm going to place you in the driver's seat

147
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,480
 of the car. I'm not going to fit in the back seat. No matter how much I shrink, my leg's still going

148
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:57,400
 to hurt. I'm not going on the journey with you on this one. I will, I'll be somewhere. Just

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,640
 imagine that. I make you get in the car, okay? It's what I'm trying to get at. And you are in

150
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,360
 the car with four girls, four young college students. I know some of you, some of you,

151
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,880
 your anxiety is already kicking in, being trapped in a car with four people. But see you later.

152
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,160
 I wave to you from the side of the road and your car takes off. You're driving. I'll have you drive

153
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,440
 down this road. Now the point is, is that this car had four young women in it. And this is where we

154
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,680
 start to kind of run into a bit of problems with the story. I'm not going to address them here and

155
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,960
 there, but I got to get this one out of the way. Sometimes the four girls are named. Sometimes

156
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,480
 they're given fake names and sometimes they're given relationships, like the driver and her sister

157
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,800
 and then the sister's friend and then the friend's cousin or something like that. That varies from

158
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,200
 account to account. But in this version, we're going to just start it off saying it's four unnamed

159
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,680
 girls in the car and you. So you and four unnamed girls, you're like, Hey, what's your name? And

160
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:02,040
 just to look at you, just drive the car. You four girls are driving home from a rodeo.

161
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,440
 If you're like, Jason, I hate rodeos and I don't like being crammed in the cars. Sorry,

162
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,880
 you're driving home from a rodeo. You and these four girls have just had a great time at the rodeo

163
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,960
 coming home. Now you have to get back to college. You guys currently attend Southern Utah University

164
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,320
 and the girls have a dorm mistress dorm master, whatever you're called, who is very, very punctual.

165
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,640
 If you're not home by 10pm, she locks all the doors. You can't get in or out and she hunts them

166
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,120
 one by one with an X, but no, they have to be home by 10pm. Otherwise they'll have to sleep in their

167
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,040
 car or maybe it's your place. So you're driving as fast as you can or as slow as you can and you're

168
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,960
 driving through the Utah battle lands. I think it's the battle of the whole state of battle land.

169
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,800
 It's just one giant hostile desert. It's America's Australia driving through Utah. And as they're

170
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:01,560
 driving by Highway 56, they see a little town of Modena and it's like a tiny, tiny town. It's

171
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,360
 like a one stoplight town, at least it was back then. And the girls make an executive decision.

172
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,920
 There's no way we're going to get home before 10 unless we take a shortcut. So they remembered,

173
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,160
 they heard at least, there's a shortcut if they drive through the Gattington Canyon. Now Gattington

174
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,680
 Canyon is part of it is paved, but some of it you're going to have to do a little off, off-road.

175
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,080
 And I think they're in like a Chevy Nova or a Chevy Impala or something like that. It's a new

176
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,440
 car. It's like 1971, new to them nowadays and piece of junk. But you figure, yes girls, I can get you

177
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,720
 home before 10pm. We will take a shortcut through the Gattington Canyon. And so the car goes off

178
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,800
 onto like a little side street, start driving into the canyon. And after about a half hour of

179
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 driving through this twisting canyon, no moon in the sky, it's completely dark. You see the canyon

180
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,680
 walls on both sides of you and you're like, oh, it's kind of spooky. But I'm sure this is a shortcut,

181
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,120
 right? But after a while, the paved road, it starts to just turn to nothing, cracked asphalt and then

182
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,720
 nothing. And then there's a sheer canyon wall in front of the car. So at this point, the girls

183
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,120
 are like, great, we're never going to get home in time. We're going to have to sleep at your house

184
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,280
 and you're like, yes, we're flan all along. But in reality, the girls are like, great, we're going

185
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,320
 to be stuck when we're not going to be able to get home. We're going to have to sleep in the car.

186
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,240
 So you bust the U-turn and you're coming back through the canyon. And as you're driving through

187
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,200
 the canyon, that's when you start to notice there's a moon in the sky. And you're like, what?

188
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,040
 My high school science teacher, Tom DeErkel told me that moons only appear once a month. Well,

189
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,040
 not like that. They don't show up once a month. But if we can't go from one moon to,

190
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,080
 we can't go from no moon to one moon in a couple hours. And the girls look at you and they're

191
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 like, what are you talking about? You're like, never mind, never mind. And but they also notice

192
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,200
 that it is weird there is a full moon when just earlier there was no moon. And when they come out

193
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,360
 of the canyon, it's no longer like this desert in front of them. There's wheat fields, beautiful,

194
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,320
 beautiful wheat fields shining in the moonlight, I guess being reflected by the moonlight. However

195
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,680
 you want to say. And there's a giant ponderosa pine out in the distance. Now they go and you,

196
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,640
 because you're in this story, go, let's drive to the tree. Maybe we'll find something over there.

197
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,000
 Okay. I mean, these people are driving through canyons trying to find the shortcut. So whatever,

198
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,960
 they think they figure nature will lead them home. They drive towards the ponderosa tree. And

199
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,480
 it's just a tree. I mean, you can see from the distance, I don't know if they expected it to be

200
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,680
 an elevator or like a spaceship, they drive by the tree. And as they're driving by this giant tree,

201
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:44,520
 they see lights down the road. Yes, civilization, let's go there guys. You continue, you just do

202
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,680
 what they say and you're driving on the road and you see lights. It looks like a little roadhouse,

203
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,000
 looks like a little bar restaurant. So you're like, figure we'll get to bite, eat,

204
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,520
 something to drink, talk to these girls for a while, then we'll get back in the car. They're

205
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,960
 not getting home by now anyways. But also you're lost. Actually, that's not what they're thinking.

206
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,600
 They weren't thinking about eating. Back to their regular story, they're like, where are we?

207
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,960
 Where are we? We're surrounded by wheat. They weren't hungry. Sorry, I was imagining my own

208
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,160
 self in the story. They go there because they're like, we're lost. We have to find directions.

209
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,480
 Let's go there and ask someone for directions. And you're like, and get something to eat. And

210
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,720
 you're like, yes, sure, you can get something to eat. Just make it snappy. So apparently Jughead

211
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,480
 is also in this car trying to get hamburgers all the time. He did that, right? Or was that wimpy?

212
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,440
 Anyway, both of them, Jughead and Wimpy are in the car as well. Driving down the road and you get to

213
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,720
 the burger joint and the girl said that they could see this neon sign. They couldn't understand what

214
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,760
 it said. It was all just squiggly. And they're like looking out and they're like, oh, it's just,

215
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,600
 I don't understand that language. Maybe it's some art deco design. But there's much people kind of

216
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,640
 milling about in the parking lot. And there's some bizarre looking cars in the parking lot as well.

217
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,560
 Egg shaped vehicles, three wheels. And so one girl leans her head out the car window and she goes

218
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,400
 to ask someone, hey, do you guys know where we're at? And I'm like, can I get directions? And you're

219
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,320
 like, oh, can I get a number two, please? Diet Coke. But as you're yelling your order out and as

220
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,400
 she's asking for directions, the people in the parking lot turn around and the girl starts screaming

221
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,240
 right in your ear, screaming at the top of her lungs. And then she just starts screaming, go,

222
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,680
 go, go, go, go. And you don't know what it is, but you don't see the people in the parking lot,

223
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,080
 like you physically saw them, but you don't see their faces. Just her screaming in your ear. You

224
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,200
 hit the gas, car takes off. And as the cars flying on the road, the girl who saw them starts

225
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,840
 screaming. And then another girl also looks out the window and sees what's out the window. She

226
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,720
 starts screaming as well. So you're driving on the road and you're like, what'd you see? What'd you

227
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,480
 see? And they're like, just go, go, go. They're not human. They're not human. And you're like,

228
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:04,840
 gulp. This isn't good. Now that is when you hear. And you look in your rear view window,

229
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,280
 and there's four of those egg shaped cars buzzing towards you.

230
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,240
 And they're catching up. Now, you saw the cars were weird looking in the parking lot,

231
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,280
 but you are 100% for sure. These aren't cars at all. Never seen a vehicle like this before.

232
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:33,480
 Going through the desert road. Eggmobiles right after you. You make an executive decision.

233
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,960
 You're like, calm down, hysterical women. Calm down. I'm in charge now.

234
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,040
 Bust a U-turn. I don't know. He might have been going the right way in the original story,

235
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,400
 but in our version, you have to bust a U-turn because I just imagined it going in the wrong

236
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:59,720
 direction. Now you're racing towards the eggmobiles. Eggmobiles. There's a lot of chasing in this

237
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,920
 episode. I didn't plan it this way. Eggmobiles spin out. Now the following you, you made an

238
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,680
 executive decision. You want to get back to the canyon because at least you know that area. So

239
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:19,160
 coming after you and you go into the canyon and the eggmobiles are right behind you. Start.

240
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,280
 It's like trench around. Eggs are flying at you from the top of the canyon walls. Oh no. No.

241
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:31,480
 They go into the canyon and then they come back out of the canyon and the engine dies. It doesn't

242
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:39,960
 explode, but I don't know how to make the sound effect of an engine just going. So it flies up.

243
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,760
 Airbags to play. They didn't have airbags back then. Cars were death traps and three of the tires

244
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,400
 are completely shredded. So you just kind of hobble to a hop and I'm standing there with my crutch

245
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,720
 going. It took you long enough. And they start hobbling and we all have to hobble because the

246
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,080
 car is totally inoperative and it's miles away from Modena. So eventually you have to pick me up.

247
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,040
 You and the four girls have to carry me like I'm an Egyptian prince all the way to Modena

248
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:14,040
 where we call law enforcement. At that point officer Vic Lundquist, officer comes out and goes,

249
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:20,920
 "Hmm, that's weird." So your story of this thing that you told me about, I have some questions

250
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,800
 about it. Shoot. Not literally. Not literally. Cops, I'll grab it and it's gone. Shoot. Shoot. Ask

251
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,040
 your questions. He goes, "Well, it's weird because I only see your car tracks go a short while

252
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,720
 from Modena into the desert but then there's no tire tracks after that." And I noticed that

253
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,120
 other stuff with tire tracks. And I noticed that one of your hubcaps is missing but no officer here

254
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,280
 was ever able to locate your hubcap. Right. And you're like, "Why are you writing down such stupid

255
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,680
 details in your police report?" And Vic Lundquist goes, "Well, because people will be asking these

256
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,280
 questions whether or not the story is true 30 years from now." And then the camera pans up to

257
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,120
 the night sky. There's no moon. Roll credits. That's the story of the Gattington Canyon time portal.

258
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,440
 Now, it's one of my favorite stories but let's go ahead and step back for a second. There are some

259
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,360
 glaring inconsistencies in that story. Let's tear it apart and then put it back together again.

260
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,480
 Because I think there's a reason why this story is popular or it really why it was crafted in first

261
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,800
 place. It's possible the story is true but it has some interest and we'll get to that in a second.

262
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,680
 It's well but it has some interesting weaknesses to it. One, Vic Lundquist has been retconned

263
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:37,240
 to Victoria Lindquist. So some people have said, "Oh, that was just an error. It was actually a

264
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:44,840
 female police officer who came to the scene." So it was never Vic Lundquist. It was Victoria Lindquist.

265
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,240
 And that came about because someone was Google searching to see if there was really a Victor

266
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,360
 Lundquist who lived in Utah at that time and apparently there's someone named Victor Lundquist

267
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:04,520
 and Victoria Lindquist both living in the Utah and the area around that time. So that's a weird

268
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,280
 retcon. I'm kind of attacking these backwards. Two, every version of the story ends with the police

269
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,400
 report saying there's no tire tracks from where the car left highway 65 in the first place.

270
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:23,720
 There was no... Which we can... That one is stupid to begin with because the cars broke down miles away

271
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,600
 from Modena in every version of the story. So if a cop came out and was like chewing a piece of

272
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,640
 wheat and you're like, "Where'd you get that wheat from?" There's no wheat in Utah and he's like,

273
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:39,000
 seriously an alien. He's like, "Ah." Now a new cop. Cop shows up and he's chewing gum and he's watching

274
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,520
 tire tracks and he goes, "That's weird." Tire tracks ended just feet off of the highway and you're like,

275
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,960
 "We just walked five miles. You can go out there and see that our car is there." And the cop would

276
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,160
 be like, "Oh, that mystery solved." Wind blew the tire tracks away. That's such a stupid part of the

277
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,600
 mystery. The hubcap missing. There's a couple other ones that are like tire tracks, like didn't

278
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,560
 appear here and they should have been here. But who cares? There went to an alien portal. I don't

279
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,720
 expect there to be like good year marks perfectly along the road all the way to the alien portal.

280
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:18,120
 The fact that their car broke down near the canyon should be proof that they left the road. It's such

281
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,520
 bizarre detail that comes up in every single story. The moon. There's two versions of the story where

282
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,840
 all the details are the same, but in some of them it was a full moon. They went to a world with no moon.

283
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,480
 And then in the version I told you, which seems to be the most popular one, there's no moon

284
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,600
 and they go to a world with a full moon. Oh, let me tell you about the egg cars as well. A lot of

285
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,840
 people. This story, the earliest posting of this story online was 2006 and apparently it happened

286
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,640
 in 1972. Now, sometimes again, it could be a hoax. Sometimes it could be written in some obscure UFO

287
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,080
 book that was just hanging out at used bookstores for 20, 30 years and someone bought one and read it

288
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,880
 and put it online. That's always possible. That's happened a couple times, like Sam the Sanddown clown

289
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:12,760
 was kind of the same thing. That was an old UFO report. So it's not unusual to have stories show

290
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,560
 up later, but the earliest version of this story that appeared online was from 2006. That website

291
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:24,040
 is down. So 2007 is the earliest verifiable. You can pull up the website and look at it. And that

292
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:31,000
 was 2007. There is a concept car that has an egg shaped design with three wheels on it. And people

293
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,240
 go, whoa, that's the car that the girl saw. That car, that design of that car wasn't released until

294
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:44,200
 2010. So usually when you read articles about the Gattington portal, they always will show this concept

295
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,040
 art. But here's the problem with that. They, yes, there is a car on earth that is made to look like

296
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,440
 an egg with three wheels, but it's not piloted by aliens in a diner. Like that is just a bizarre

297
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,720
 coincidence. It's not showing that they traveled into the future. I don't think unless Utah, if

298
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,960
 it took place in the future enough that Utah has wheat and people have turned into monsters,

299
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,120
 they're not driving around a car that was designed in 2010. Unless that was like a retro

300
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,480
 auto festival where people are like, Hey, let's drive cars from a thousand years ago. If that

301
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,160
 much change has happened, why would they be driving cars designed in 2010? So that detail is just a

302
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:29,000
 weird coincidence. Another thing is like, they have so these versions of these stories have so much

303
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,680
 dialogue where they're like, Becky said, slam it. So I slammed it. And then she's like, look out,

304
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,480
 here comes another one. And then as I turned and I said, Oh, no, here comes another one. The chick

305
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,240
 next to me goes, drive, Becky drive. I think they're all in Becky in this version. There's tons

306
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,480
 of dialogue in this story, but not a single version says what the people look like. They just say

307
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,600
 they're not human. It's like someone wrote a young adult novel and put this all in there.

308
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,240
 One of the most interesting details though, is there's no such place officially named the

309
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,280
 Gattington Canyon. Now it's one of those stories that like I said, I've enjoyed for a long, long

310
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,840
 time, but I never looked into it. And someone else has this website called the debunker files or

311
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,040
 something like that. Then that website made some ridiculous arguments against it as well. Like

312
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,480
 I was like, that's kind of dumb. But one of the stellar pieces I got from it is there is no place

313
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,160
 called the Gattington Canyon in that area because the city of Modena is real. It's a tiny town.

314
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,200
 There's two canyon ranges though. There are two canyon ranges. Officially, none of them are named

315
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,960
 Gattington Canyon. The reason why, and this is really telling about why I think this story exists,

316
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,760
 assuming it's fake, assuming it's fake. The reason why it's known as the Gattington Canyon

317
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,680
 portal, the reason why it's referred to as the Gattington Canyon, is Gattington Canyon is a local

318
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:59,000
 name that the Mormons use for that area. The only time you see reference to that is with this story

319
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,200
 and the story from the Book of Mormon about a dude named Gattington who led an army of thieves

320
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,520
 that were attacking the Nephites, or they were the Nephites. It's this Mormon story. It's this Book

321
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,080
 of Mormon story where before Jesus died and came to America, there was a bunch of people like,

322
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,280
 "Hey, now here, there were a bunch of people hanging out here." But they weren't the Nephites.

323
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,440
 They actually have the Mormon Church actually has an archaeological team dedicated to finding

324
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,400
 proof, physical proof of the Book of Mormon in America because they have these giant war machines.

325
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,080
 They have these ancient empires. It was a super advanced civilization that waged war across America.

326
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,040
 And a lot of times in the Book of Mormon, they ride horses around. There were no horses in America,

327
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,680
 so then it turns out they were riding tapers or something, like big old pigs. But anyways,

328
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,000
 anyways, I just said an episode on the Book of Giants, so I can't really talk trash about

329
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,120
 the Book of Mormon. The only time you hear about Gattington Canyon is in reference to the Book of

330
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:06,120
 Mormon and a group of evil thieves and an army of evil thieves robbing people. And this story.

331
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,920
 So I think this is the origin of this story. I think it is a, I think this is where it came from.

332
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:19,320
 I bet dollar to donuts that this is a urban legend. It's a Mormon urban legend, basically. I think

333
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,080
 it's probably something that was told in youth groups to scare people because this story has a

334
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:31,880
 moral that is not readily recognizable when you first go through it. The moral is,

335
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,520
 do not stay out past curfew. Very, very intro-ed, because when you first hear it,

336
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,360
 I didn't pick up on that. When I first heard it, I was like, oh, that's fascinating. You know,

337
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,400
 go in another dimension. And then you hear it over and over again. But when I become more,

338
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,680
 become more skeptical doing the show, because I just have to read so much of this stuff.

339
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,480
 I'm reading it, I'm thinking, there is a moral to the story, like so many stories we cover. Don't

340
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,320
 play in the water, so, you know, a dolphin might get you. We'll come up with this legend. Don't

341
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,000
 go into the woods, kids, or this guy who makes you walk backwards will get you. Whatever they are.

342
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,320
 This particular one is don't stay late anywhere. Get home before curfew is the moral of the story.

343
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,000
 Then you would have never been chased by these monsters. And I think one of the reasons why I

344
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,680
 think that's clear is that the monster, nobody dies. It's a urban legend you can tell at a youth

345
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,320
 group at a lock-in, a bunch of 13-year-old kids, they're not going to have nightmares. People get

346
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,680
 away. You don't know what the monsters look like, which in reality, if you knew the dialogue of the

347
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,320
 people in the car, and this happened 30 years ago, you would, someone would have said, "Yeah,

348
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,880
 they look like they're pig people," or they had giant eyes, or they looked like clouds wearing

349
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,040
 clothes. It would have been something with it rather than, "We don't know what they look like."

350
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:50,760
 So I think one of my favorite interdimensional stories involving a bunch of young women getting

351
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,520
 sucked into another dimension and having outrun a bunch of aliens, I think also intrigues a bunch

352
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,040
 of 13-year-olds in a locked church late at night, because their youth minister goes,

353
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:07,000
 and then the cops couldn't find tire tracks leading off the road, and the kids are like,

354
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,840
 "Oh no, I want to go home. I want to go home." I think that's the origin of this story.

355
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,720
 But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe my skeptical side is wrong, and I'm tearing apart the truth.

356
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,960
 Someone could tell you the truth, and you could be just as skeptical. Find little holes in it.

357
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,840
 Make them sweat a bit. Very, very possible. I think the interesting thing about this story, too,

358
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,680
 is that you figure it has to happen both ways. If we can slip into their reality, couldn't they

359
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,880
 slip into ours? We talk about UFOs being from other dimensions and things like that, and my ghosts

360
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,920
 may actually be from other dimensions. We're not actually seeing dead people. But if four girls can

361
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,920
 make a wrong turn down the wrong canyon on the wrong night and end up in an alien world, could

362
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,440
 they do the same? Have they done the same? We talk about missing people all the time, and most

363
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,760
 missing people's stories have a rational explanation. But at a certain point, you have to say, "I can't

364
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:12,680
 explain how this person went missing." They just disappeared. So are there stories of young alien

365
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,560
 creatures that look human at first glance? These guys looked like they were human, at least humanoid.

366
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:27,480
 How many times have one of theirs crossed over to our world, turned a corner, appeared in the middle

367
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,000
 of a city, surrounded by monsters, not understanding any of the writing on any of the billboards?

368
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,520
 And if that's happened, and statistically it would have had to happen, if it can happen one

369
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,520
 way it'll happen the other way. Did they get away? Was that young group of aliens from another

370
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:54,920
 dimension driving home from their gloop glorp trying to beat the clock and they got lost in our

371
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,080
 world? Would they have simply been chased off by men in Harleys and a guy in a Toyota pickup truck?

372
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,160
 Or would they have been cut down, blown up, captured and sent to the US military?

373
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,720
 Yeah, probably. And I think that's what would have happened to those young girls as well,

374
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:21,320
 if those egg-shaped vehicles had caught them. The story wouldn't be told in Mormon youth groups.

375
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:30,520
 Their story would only be found in military logs and medical texts in an alien dimension.
