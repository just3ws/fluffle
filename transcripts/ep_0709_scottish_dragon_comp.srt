1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
 Did John McAfee kill himself or was he whacked as so many people seem to claim?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,380
 Then we meet a man who's out in the wilderness waiting for some of his friends to arrive.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,020
 Instead he is greeted with a glowing orb shooting sparks in all directions.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,540
 But the story gets even more bizarre when this hovering egg

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,220
 hatches today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:31,900
 *Music*

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,580
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,040
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got three days left until my vacation.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,540
 That's more for me than for you.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,420
 Um, I have to take a vacation every 50 episodes just to keep the whole noggin joggin the noggin joggin.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,820
 And we're past 50 episodes. I think this is episode 709.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,660
 708. It's a lot of work. This show takes a lot of work.

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,140
 I mean my break, but I got three more episodes to do. Three more episodes are really cool content for you guys.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,780
 I'm telling myself that. Don't give up Jason. Just three more episodes.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,700
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters. Give it up for Medusa Buzzcutt.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,460
 Wooo! Everyone give a round of applause to Medusa. Medusa, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,140
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,460
 And even though I am taking a three week,

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:35,180
 very, very well deserved break. I'm actually traveling going to the tropical country of Medici to help overthrow General DeRevello.

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:44,540
 But um, before now that they know that I'm coming now that they know to send the Bavarian tanks after me, while I'm on vacation,

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,820
 I will have a special on July 18th. We are doing a July 18th Alien Invasion special. That is the day

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,100
 that some dude predicted seven years ago he predicted aliens would invade July 18th. So we're coming up to that.

23
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,260
 So get your strawberry ice cream ready. Subscribe to my YouTube channel because it's going to be a YouTube livestream.

24
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,980
 I don't know exactly what time it's going to be yet because that is I haven't worked those details out, but July 18th Alien Invasion

25
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,180
 special brought to you by a quiet place part two. And if you don't listen to the YouTube, if you don't want to watch it live,

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,540
 that's fine too. I'm actually going to upload the audio to the podcast.

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,780
 So if you guys just want to sit and listen to it at your leisure,

28
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,500
 that is, that works too. So no, you have to listen to it live. After words, the aliens are going to destroy the planet.

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,220
 You want to be with me while that's happening. Medusa Buzzcat, I'm going to give you the keys to a new vehicle.

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,580
 I just invented since I'm going to go on vacation soon. I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carpenter Cruise Ship.

31
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,100
 This is our festive, this is our festive cruise ship.

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,420
 We're all going to be lounging around on decks, sipping my ties, playing shuffleboard while Medusa Buzzcat has an actual job.

33
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,940
 They have to be the captain of this ship. They now control a crew of about 100 people. Guys, kickback, relax.

34
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,700
 Let's take a trip across the ocean. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are heading on out to

35
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
 Barcelona, Spain.

36
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:15,900
 Come up with a sound effect real quick and go, "What noises do cruise ships make?"

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,700
 The sounds of hundreds of elderly people having fun. Or, you know, the horn.

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,100
 You're like, "Oh, that's what that sound was. I thought you were constipated."

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,180
 We pull up in the Carpenter Cruise Ship. I already forgot the name of it. Totally forgot the name of it.

40
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,900
 I'll forget this vehicle exists after this episode. We pull up in the Carpenter Cruise Ship. We disembark in Barcelona, Spain.

41
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,580
 The reason why we're in Barcelona, Spain is because

42
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,740
 I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with this news. John McAfee, rogue outlaw,

43
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,940
 inventor, programmer, businessman.

44
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:58,620
 He's a very hyphenated individual. He's done a lot in his life. John McAfee, who's most famous, I think, for the McAfee antivirus.

45
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,100
 He

46
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,300
 died.

47
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,820
 I think we can at least say that. He died. There's actually, we can.

48
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,620
 There's some people who say that he's not dead, that he's faking the whole thing, but just a quick quick overview.

49
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,020
 John McAfee was in a Spanish prison

50
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,140
 and he was being held for tax evasion, tax charges.

51
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:24,860
 And what had happened is recently he, it was successful. United States was trying to have him extradited to the United States to

52
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,020
 stand trial for tax evasion.

53
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,780
 He's been being held by the Spanish authorities until the stuff could get figured out.

54
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,020
 It was figured out. The U.S. won the extradition battle to actually have him sent over to the United States.

55
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,020
 And then he has found hanging in his cell. He's dead.

56
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,620
 Again, there's some people who say that he's faking the whole thing

57
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,340
 because he definitely had the money to kind of bribe officials and stuff like that.

58
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,660
 There are some people who're saying that he's faking the whole thing, but that's another conspiracy.

59
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,820
 That's another conspiracy. We might look into that if it continues to grow, but right now the big conspiracy theory about John McAfee is

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,300
 did he hang himself

61
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
 or was he whacked?

62
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:12,460
 Was he hung by people who are trying to keep him silent? This is a really fascinating conspiracy theory, but not in the way people think it is.

63
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,980
 This is this is fascinating. Here we go.

64
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:22,300
 John, this is the reason why people think John McAfee didn't kill himself. One, he said is

65
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,940
 late as December of last year. I will never ever ever kill myself.

66
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,900
 And then he got a tattoo on him that says whacked is like the dollar sign and it says whacked and he's like

67
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,020
 if they come after me, it's because I got whacked. It's because I know too much and they're trying to silence me.

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,980
 And then he's found hanging in his cell.

69
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,140
 So the immediate reaction was oh dude, the people who got Epstein also got John McAfee.

70
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,060
 Like he knew too much and they had to silence him. So they hung him

71
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,820
 and he tried warning us. He said he would never ever commit suicide. He had this tattoo called whacked and

72
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,580
 after he died, there's been all of this chatter about a dead man switch with

73
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,620
 dead man switches. Basically, it's kind of what it sounds like. Let's say I have a dead man switch. I might.

74
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:15,660
 I might. I might, but let's say I do have a dead man switch and every week I have to enter a code into my computer.

75
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,260
 But if one week it goes by and I don't enter that code,

76
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,180
 my dead man switch is activated, which in a electronic sense would be

77
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,980
 tons of emails start going out with all sorts of encryption keys to high level

78
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,020
 politicians and high level journalists and things like that.

79
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,740
 So as long as I'm alive, the information that I've gathered that I've told people I will keep secret is secret.

80
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,540
 But once I die and that code goes a week without being entered, all of this information starts flooding out into the

81
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,580
 information place. What is that? I don't know. The information's fair. It gets out. Your secrets get out.

82
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,380
 So after he died, there was a dead man switch that started going off apparently and like one of the codes was

83
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,700
 Epstein, so that kind of brought into it or

84
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,420
 So a lot of people are hanging their hat on that.

85
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,700
 He said he was never going to kill himself and he dies and it looks like it's suicide by hanging.

86
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,180
 And then this dead man switch goes off. But if that story is correct,

87
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,100
 if that if the dead man, so this is what I don't understand about the dead man switch thing,

88
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,180
 he wouldn't be able to activate the dead man switch constantly in jail. Anyways,

89
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,860
 so the dead man switch would have had to have been run by someone on the outside, which could do it

90
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,620
 whether or not a dead man switch works when you die.

91
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,300
 And I guess you could have a dead man switch and someone else hits the button.

92
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,500
 It's not really a dead man switch. It's kind of a live man switch who waits for you to die.

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,340
 But anyway, so all this information and I wanted to report on this earlier. I actually had done a segment on it

94
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,540
 last week and I you're like, really? I didn't hear that part. I edited it out. I took it out before

95
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,660
 I released the episode because we didn't have enough information really. And the dead man switch

96
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,540
 had just been activated. We're just seeing this information drop. And in that segment, I said,

97
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,660
 I really don't think anything's going to come of this. And here we are a week later and the dead

98
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,100
 man switch is still being investigated, but there's been no massive Epstein level bombshells.

99
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,220
 Nothing's really been dropped like that. And that brings me back to my main argument with this.

100
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,700
 I believe that John McAfee killed himself before you shut off the podcast. I have a reason why I

101
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,820
 think he did that that no one else is talking about. And I'm a little I'm a little perturbed that no

102
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,780
 one else is talking about it. But I think that John McAfee killed himself. But let me explain.

103
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:43,100
 Let me explain this and then I'll get to why I think him killing himself is far more interesting

104
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,860
 than the whacked tattoo and the Epstein connection and the dead man switch, which has not revealed any

105
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,060
 major bombshells right now. First thought, this is really sad to say, and I'm not saying this

106
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:02,700
 to be mean or anything like that. But first off, suicide is not it's super interesting. I was doing

107
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,140
 a bunch of research on this for a topic a while ago. Suicide committing suicide is a

108
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:14,700
 it's not something that everybody does. I was always under the impression that any single person

109
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:23,020
 put under enough stress can kill themselves. And that's partially true. But some people are far

110
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,620
 more inclined to kill themselves. We don't know if it's genetic. But we do see that it runs in

111
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,340
 bloodlines. It runs in families. Let's say that someone kills themselves. And then 10 years later,

112
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,820
 their niece kills himself. And then four years later, her brother kills him. You know what I mean?

113
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,380
 Like we'll see it run through bloodlines. There are people who suffer such extreme, extreme events

114
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,060
 that they take their own lives. But like 95% of people who kill themselves are predisposed to

115
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,100
 suicide. I actually think I did do a subject. I'll see if I check their notes. I think I covered it

116
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,780
 more on an episode. But yeah, it is there are people who just predispose to killing themselves.

117
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:07,260
 It's rare. It statistically is rare when someone has no connection to committing suicide,

118
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,300
 suicidal ideation, anything like that. And then event after event after event after event happens

119
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,380
 to them and they kill themselves. That's not the statistics. That's what we see in movies. And that's

120
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,980
 the story that we think is true. 95% of people who kill themselves are actually predisposed to

121
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:32,220
 suicide. His dad killed himself. So when I saw that, I go, well, that that's a huge that is a huge

122
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,820
 I'm not saying that just because I've had a friend whose father killed himself, right?

123
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,540
 I'm not saying that that is the Oh, well, I guess he killed himself then, but that is a signifier.

124
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:49,980
 And you can't deny that you can't deny that because suicide is a we don't know if it is genetic,

125
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,100
 but people are kind of leaning that way. Doesn't mean if someone in your family has killed themselves

126
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,420
 that you are going to kill yourself. Just means there's a higher likelihood of it.

127
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,780
 So we have that, which I did read that and I go, well, that is that is a pretty big thing. But

128
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,780
 the other thing is McAfee was never ever and I've followed McAfee for a while. Like I remember

129
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,700
 he first came out on my radar when he was under under suspicion for murdering his neighbor. He was

130
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,500
 living in Central America, South America. He murdered his neighbor. And I remember following

131
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,900
 that case and he beat it. He was there and never able to prove that he murdered this guy. And he's

132
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:34,540
 always been a almost ran. Like you could almost sense like him and Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos,

133
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,780
 they all want to be this Hank Scorpio type character. If you don't know who that is,

134
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,580
 it's this character from The Simpsons, who's this seems like a super congenial billionaire

135
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,860
 inventor philanthropist, but he's also a supervillain. And it seems like they all kind of saw that

136
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,220
 episode and they kind of patterned their life after Hank Scorpio. But John McAfee always seemed

137
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,940
 like an almost ran in the conspiracy theory community. He people knew who Epstein was

138
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,660
 after his first arrest. Like Epstein, maybe if you were really deep in conspiracy theory and you

139
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,260
 were connected, you knew a lot about him before it came out, before he got connected, all this

140
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,900
 up. But after his first arrest, he was arrested twice. A lot of people don't know that. And he

141
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:22,060
 beat the charges. You have that going on. He was a huge threat, right? He knew about everyone. He

142
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,620
 knew about tons of people who have been named and a lot of people who have not been named.

143
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,380
 A lot of very, very powerful people that have not come out during this whole Epstein Me Too scandal.

144
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,940
 He has all that info. So Epstein was 100% a target. Who would John McAfee know? John McAfee,

145
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,500
 apparently like mingled more with like common gang members and stuff like that. Like apparently he

146
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,260
 was, I read this story that he was dating this woman and the local mob was trying to get her to

147
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,780
 poison him. But she's like, no, I don't want to. She could be making that story up. We don't know.

148
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,900
 He didn't get poisoned. But so he did have like he was probably pushing people's buttons,

149
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,940
 but he was nowhere on the level of an Epstein threat where he's hobnobbing with presidents.

150
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,340
 He's hobnobbing with royalty. He's hobnobbing with Hollywood. John McAfee looked unkempt in

151
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,060
 every single photo I've ever seen him in. So while he may have been a threat to some people,

152
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,300
 him getting extradited to the United States, how are they really going to lean on this guy? Now,

153
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,460
 to be fair, behind the scenes, I said no one really knew in the general community what Epstein

154
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,900
 was up to. Until that first arrest, it's possible that John McAfee was super connected to all these

155
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,420
 world leaders and this stuff would have come out. But we have no hints of that. Even when I'm reading

156
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,620
 this stuff about the Deadman switch, which now it's been a week and we're not seeing these bump

157
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,420
 shows, there is never like, oh and he was tied to this politician and high level politician. I'm

158
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,220
 sure he hobnobbed with some state representatives or something like that. But not for a while,

159
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,260
 the guy always looked dirty. But here is the thing and this is what I find so interesting

160
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,740
 that no one else is talking about, at least that I've seen. The main thing John McAfee is

161
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,300
 knowing about in the conspiracy theory community, we talked about him before on this show, I believe,

162
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:13,340
 is quantum immortality. He very, very famously during an interview with Vice or Vanity Fair or

163
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,820
 somebody when he was in his tropical home, this was years ago, he played Russian roulette with

164
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,540
 a revolver, obviously you don't do it with a bow and arrow, you don't do it with a semi-automatic,

165
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,340
 playing Russian roulette and he's saying, he's going through the spiel about quantum immortality,

166
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,540
 quantum suicide and he goes, there's one bullet in this gun, I will never die, I'm gonna put this

167
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,140
 gun in my head and I'm gonna pull the trigger and the bullet will not go through my brain because I

168
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,980
 cannot exist in a timeline where I don't exist, I will shift to a timeline where I do exist,

169
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,660
 I will continue to exist. Very, very famous interview and the reporter sat there and the

170
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,540
 guy clicked the gun, maybe more than once, I don't remember, but it was to prove that he had no fear

171
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,820
 that he would just slide into another timeline. When he first died, I saw people saying, oh no,

172
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,740
 we're in the worst timeline now, we're in the timeline where John McAfee died and I thought

173
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,100
 that was an interesting comment, but then they didn't continue on the thread, this is what I think

174
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,940
 happened, honestly, this is what I think happened, I think John McAfee killed himself, but in his

175
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:28,300
 mind, he was just sliding to an alternate reality where he wasn't in jail or where the extradition

176
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:34,700
 trial hadn't worked, I think that's what happened, I think that he didn't kill himself out of utter

177
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,860
 despair, he didn't kill himself out of unending torment or pain or anything like that or an

178
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,140
 underlying mental illness or all of those put together, he believes in quantum suicide, he

179
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,740
 believes the fact that if I die in this reality, I'll shift to another reality where things work

180
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:58,460
 out for me. The problem is, is that quantum suicide, quantum immortality, it doesn't,

181
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:06,620
 it's a theory and it does, it's a theory, it's interesting from a sci-fi angle, but it doesn't

182
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,020
 hold any water whatsoever, when I did the episode on it, it was probably about a year or two ago,

183
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,660
 I did this episode, this was my, this is my problem with it, let's say that it, let's say that it

184
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,500
 works, right, that means that no one ever dies, the thought process is, is that you can't perceive a

185
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,460
 reality where you don't exist, so as a concept of quantum immortality, we've all had close

186
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,940
 brushes with death, whoa, I should have died there, but I didn't and it does feel kind of weird and

187
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,420
 we've covered stories like that, like do you die or do you shift to another reality, interesting

188
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:44,540
 theory, the problem is, is that we all get old, we see that around us, we felt our own bodies

189
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:50,060
 getting older, so if you can put a gun to your head, don't do this, but if you put a gun under

190
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:56,220
 your head and you pull the trigger and in this reality, your brain spray all over the wall,

191
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,580
 but you go to a reality where the trigger doesn't pull, where the bullets have dud,

192
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,940
 where the gun turns to cheese in your hands, whatever, interesting theory, but what happens

193
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:14,780
 when you're 95 and you're bedridden and you can't die, you're hooked up to all these devices and

194
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,580
 you have a heart attack and you shift to another reality where you're hooked up to all these devices

195
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,780
 and you're still in this bed and you have a heart attack and you're shifting to another reality where

196
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,100
 you're 95 years old and you're still in this bed and you have another heart attack and you shift

197
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,900
 into this reality, like that would be hell and that it could, you could be like, well,

198
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,940
 I'll just work out, I'm going through all these quantum realities, I'll keep working out, I'll

199
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,500
 be fit, fine, you're 107 and you're in bed hooked up to all these machines, you go, I want, do not

200
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,700
 resuscitate on myself, okay, fine, you're in the ER and they say, well, we can't resuscitate you and

201
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,780
 you die on the operating table, you shift to another reality where you're on that operating table,

202
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,220
 you die on that operating table, like it would just keep happening over and over and over and over

203
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,020
 again, of quantum and let's say that you're 95 and you shift to a reality where you did take

204
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,260
 better care of your body, now you're no longer hooked up to all these machines, you're 95,

205
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,820
 you're sitting at home surrounded by your family, well, guess what, you're still going to turn 96

206
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,020
 soon and this is forever, you're just going to keep getting older and maybe you shift to a reality

207
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,500
 where you're slightly more healthy and you live a little bit longer, but eventually you're just

208
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,340
 going to be skeletal husk, having stroke after stroke after stroke after stroke after stroke

209
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,020
 and shifting each time you do, that's hellish and the idea of quantum immortality, it's interesting

210
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:39,260
 when you're 33 years old and you almost get hit by a car and you go, whoa, I mean, I should have

211
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,220
 died, maybe I died in an alternate reality, that's not an interesting thought when you're begging

212
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,700
 for death, so I personally think John McAfee killed himself on two levels, one he could have just

213
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,180
 been predisposed to suicide and he wanted to go out a legend, now people are always going to be

214
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,340
 talking about him, if he had just died or had an aneurysm or something else that happened to him,

215
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,380
 people would have been like, people would have totally forgotten about him, he is now like

216
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,660
 Forrest Finn, he has etched his name into conspiracy theory content, people will mention

217
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,860
 McAfee next Epstein, conspiracy people will, normal people aren't talking about this, people

218
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,300
 aren't making mugs that say McAfee didn't kill himself, nobody really cares because he wasn't

219
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,660
 as big as a character in real life, I think as he thought he was, but there will be a core

220
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,620
 contingent who will hold McAfee up to Epstein even though I don't think that's true, also why would

221
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:38,780
 you want to be held up to Epstein? He either killed himself because he was unfortunately predisposed

222
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,500
 to suicide and put all these breadcrumbs out saying that he would never kill himself and got

223
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,300
 the tattoo that said whacked and know that well if I kill myself I'll just become famous like

224
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,980
 Epstein became famous because most people didn't know who Epstein was really until

225
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,980
 the controversy over the second arrest and then him killing himself shortly after, or this guy

226
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,740
 said well I believe that if I dial just shift to another reality so I'm just going to hang myself

227
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:10,220
 and shift to the other reality and while that is an interesting theory on a sci-fi level I don't

228
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,780
 think it works in reality, I mean who knows right we don't know what happens after you die but to me

229
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:22,460
 if quantum immortality, quantum suicide is real that is a very very hellish and dark future to

230
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,060
 think you're just going to be perpetually alive and getting older no matter what you do or no

231
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,820
 matter what fate does to you you just shift to another reality where you're slightly more alive

232
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:39,100
 than you were before. John I wish you the best wherever you're at obviously it's tragic that this

233
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,180
 happened see that's the thing even tax evasion charges what he would have done some Wesley

234
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,300
 Snipes time would have done like six years and would have been out the it's an interesting story

235
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,740
 it's a tragic story that it ends I wish him the best wherever he's at if the quantum suicide

236
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,860
 thing works obviously that's the best case scenario he is still somewhere else I guess the best

237
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,340
 case scenario is that he faked his death which we do have to keep that option on the table but

238
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:09,180
 Medusa Buscutt we are leaving behind Barcelona Spain we are headed out to Newton Falls Ohio

239
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,180
 Medusa Buscutt takes us out to Newton Falls on the carbonic after we're specifically headed to

240
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:25,580
 the Ma O'ning river it's a warm summer night in 1972 it's 10 p.m. Terry Osnick is standing at the

241
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,300
 Mahoning River he's there to meet three friends I've never been to this place I very rarely

242
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,740
 leave the state but if you guys are familiar with Newton Falls apparently there's two this

243
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:43,980
 sounds pretty spooky and dope there's two cemeteries and then there's a river and then there's a bridge

244
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,300
 that goes from one cemetery to the other so that's kind of cool right like you can go you can visit

245
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,340
 all these dead people then you're like hey I wonder who died over there and then you walk

246
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,100
 across the bridge but then I would think like the river is good you know go and do and it's water

247
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,300
 stuff and you figure it start eroding everything and then eventually like bodies would be rolling

248
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,980
 down the hill so like that you're like Jason we planted people the Newton Falls the Newton Falls

249
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,060
 people the Newton Falls City Council listen to this podcast all seven of them they're like we

250
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,940
 planned it out a little better than Jason I know you imagine like this spooky spooky cemetery from

251
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,980
 a Bernstein Bear book but no it's not there's like stuff or maybe their eyes are shifting

252
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,060
 side to side they're like uh-oh he knows our secret maybe it's all yeah why would you have a

253
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:35,100
 river going through cemeteries super spooky and let me back up cemeteries aren't normally built on

254
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,740
 whether or not they're spooky or not I don't think the city council of newton falls like we should

255
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,260
 put it here but oh no that's too spooky water has a really big thing with attracting ghosts when you

256
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,940
 look at all sorts of lore all over the world we see water especially running water and ghosts

257
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,820
 highly connected and then bridges too anyways he's there to meet his friends I don't think they're

258
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,980
 gonna hang out there and discuss water erosion tables I think they're just meeting up in the

259
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,980
 middle of nowhere but Terry Oz and Nick is waiting there to meet his three friends and he

260
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,660
 hears his buddies crossing the bridge he looks over at him and he's like waving he's like hey guys

261
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,980
 over here I'm over and I'm over the less spooky cemetery this one all has 50 less ghosts is this

262
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,380
 friends are getting possessed over there no he's looking at his friends they're crossing this bridge

263
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:31,260
 and he sees in the sky a glow he's looking into this glow and inside of this glow in the night

264
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,580
 sky this I have to figure out another word for glow there was I want to say glow of the rest of the

265
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:45,020
 episode he looks up and he sees in the illumination a round shiny ball and it's shooting off sparks

266
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,140
 it's about 30 feet above his friends and he's panicking obviously he's like what no this is

267
00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:00,460
 supposed to be downtown today oh no he's looking at this effinessent we're just gonna start making

268
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,900
 upwards at a certain point but I know this is a real one effinessent orb floating above his friends

269
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,740
 about 30 feet above his friends and he is panicked he doesn't know what to say and he gets this feeling

270
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:18,460
 that it's scanning him as he's standing there in the darkness he feels like it is reading his

271
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:27,260
 soul he said like it knew everything about him in an instant whatever this was could figure out who

272
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,380
 terry ozinek was and terry ozinek was probably trying to figure out who terry ozinek is his entire

273
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,980
 body is enveloped in terror and his friends look this is something you only see in movies right

274
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,820
 you don't think people do this in real life his friends see him shaking his friends see him in pure

275
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,180
 fear and they're like hey terry what's going on and he's like oh i'm gonna oh he doesn't know what

276
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,940
 to say he doesn't know he's run out of words to describe glowing he can't even focus in his brain

277
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,580
 to warn his friends what he's seen so he just takes off running right he just leaves his friends

278
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:11,020
 he goes running in the opposite direction of this bright orb in the sky his friends begin to chase

279
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,100
 after him they still don't know what's going on but they just see their friend had been startled by

280
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:22,060
 something they are they are in two spooky cemeteries on a cursed bridge so they go chasing after him

281
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:27,260
 as he's running away from this and his friends are running behind him terry stop hold up what's

282
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:38,220
 wrong buddy he turns around and the shiny shiny orb is gone it's been replaced by what he can only

283
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:48,620
 describe as a dragon in the shape of the scottish flag it's not flat it's not a rectangle but you

284
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:54,220
 know what i mean like those old classic european type dragons it almost looks like as lion feet and

285
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:02,220
 has like the long neck and he says he sees this dragon in the night sky it's hovering there and

286
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:12,540
 just all around it sparks shooting from its body him and his friends quickly leave the scene

287
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:19,900
 now his friends never saw this thing they left the scene because he left the scene

288
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,900
 and because he was so terrified they knew something was wrong they didn't they thought

289
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,980
 something might have been wrong with him chasing him down make sure he didn't get hurt

290
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,580
 but he told him this story after things calmed down after things calmed down after he's in the

291
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,500
 emergency room and they're giving him all the xanax he's like oh man you guys won't believe what i

292
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,820
 saw in the doctor the doctor's like oh we might want to keep him here for a while he tells them

293
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,260
 that he sees this orb in the sky it gave off a light and then the scottish dragon appeared

294
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:54,460
 and the friends believe him because they know he saw something this story is really interesting to

295
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,820
 me obviously i'm telling on the show and i'm telling boring stuff but it's because the story is so

296
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,260
 visually weird the glowing orb we come across that all the time we come across that so often in UFO

297
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,620
 lore i don't cover it when i look at stories and it's like lights in the sky i don't cover it for a

298
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,220
 couple reasons one it's really hard to just talk about lights in the sky on a podcast unless you

299
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:21,180
 can see it and two it can be anything it's so mundane it can be anything but when you have this

300
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,500
 is what is so interesting about the story i talk about this all the time on the show so i'm not

301
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,980
 going to spend too much time on it but i talk about the lore what we expect from UFO stories what we

302
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,500
 expect from ghost stories sometimes they blur we covered one earlier i think it was late last week

303
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,980
 about four ghosts and an alien breaking into this woman's house weird but it's more than weird but

304
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,580
 sometimes they blur but when you see a glowing object in the sky you assume you're gonna automatically

305
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,580
 your brain is going to catalog it with certain things so you're gonna go that's a UFO so you're

306
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,500
 gonna expect gray aliens you're gonna expect reptilians pleiadians humanoids we've covered

307
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,060
 stories robots and all sorts of stuff but there's a certain you wouldn't expect a leprechaun to jump

308
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:09,020
 out of it and if you're in a haunted house you're expecting to see a very you know maybe get some

309
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,860
 evp recordings temperature drops stuff like that maybe you'll see a full body operation maybe you'll

310
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:21,740
 see some hot victorian babe floating down the hallway you would be terrified i mean that would

311
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:27,820
 terrify you too maybe not the babe but imagine if you're in a haunted house and you're getting no

312
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,540
 evp readings and you walk into a room and there's a gray alien peeking around the corner

313
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:39,660
 like that because it's so unexpected leprechaun jump out of UFO would just be kind of cool

314
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,340
 but being in a haunted house to see an alien in there it's just the image is creepy because

315
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,900
 you can imagine the broke down old haunted house and you see that gray alien in the darkness

316
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:55,740
 it's not supposed to be there this story it starts off with the UFO what was the Scottish dragon

317
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,820
 and then you start to think was it a dragon like because it scanned him did it pick something that

318
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,620
 it thought he would be afraid of did it pick something that he thought he would be in awe of

319
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:14,620
 did it pick something that terry could recognize instead of undulating geometric images folding

320
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:20,860
 upon each other which the brain couldn't process it chose an image that terry could process because

321
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,700
 it scanned him but why would it choose something so awe-inspiring that would instill him with fear

322
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,660
 he said the sparks looked like it was hot metal being stricken at a forge it was just pure raw

323
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:42,220
 fury in the sky and we do have it at a place you know going back to the whole spookiness of the

324
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:49,420
 place two two cemeteries a running river that really is asking for paranormal activity any body

325
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,500
 any moving body of water if you live near a river sorry guys but any moving body of water does seem

326
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:03,260
 to attract this type of entity or this force or creates a gateway for it who knows why so does

327
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,140
 this have something to do with paranormal activity at the graveyard that has something to do with

328
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,940
 extraterrestrial activity is it both is it neither i love this i love stories that leave you questioning

329
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,580
 stories that have such an answer as the alien congress did this and they came down to tell

330
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,580
 us to shut our nukes off yeah i mean i think i've become jaded you're like jason that's

331
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:33,660
 groundbreaking july 18th the aliens might say that i'll be i'll be like oh boring as the aliens

332
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,340
 are coming down they're giving us cures all these diseases i'm not gonna matter their hands i'm like

333
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,900
 do something weird guys do something weird for my podcast you know what i mean like that part of the

334
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:49,260
 like here's the thing and i've said this before when you listen to this podcast this is paranormal

335
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,820
 400 a lot of the stuff out there is 101 or as far as like college classes go you got you do have to

336
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,780
 learn about the mary celeste and the bermuda triangle and basic bigfoot stuff and roswell

337
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,980
 that's all of a good ground game but when i cover stuff on this podcast and i'm not bragging about

338
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,580
 the show this is us this is us as a community i'm not just saying that i do this if you listen to

339
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,580
 this podcast you've graduated past roswell and betty and barney hill you know you learn that stuff

340
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,980
 when you're younger but when you're listening to this podcast we cover the weirdest stuff out there

341
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,660
 and then sometimes it just gets so weird even for us you just kind of got to step back and go

342
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,940
 what is go what is the actual event here what is going on when we cover the alien invasion

343
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,940
 of casablanca where these alien arms these robots show up and start beating up school kids you're

344
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,700
 like what is this but at the same time we know in the lore that aliens like to interact with humans

345
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:50,620
 they like to kidnap humans they have these ships and all of this stuff is appearing in this story

346
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,660
 as bizarre as the story is i'll put it in the show notes it's one of my favorite

347
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:59,580
 things i've covered on this podcast this one doesn't even have that there's no conflict there's no

348
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:06,940
 entity that we can identify it's just a glowing orb and then a giant dragon shooting out sparks

349
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:15,100
 and that's it and the puzzling stories to me the ones where you just go i don't know what that is

350
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,060
 are my favorite they really are my favorite because you just are stuck and you don't have

351
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:29,260
 all the answers you don't have any of the answers you don't even have the questions really just this

352
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,580
 bizarre event that happens and that's what i love about doing this podcast is sharing these type of

353
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:39,020
 stories with you guys so the next time you're looking up into the night sky waiting to see a UFO

354
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:46,300
 or cutting the lock on a long abandoned cemetery gate or simply staying up late in your own house

355
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:54,620
 trying to record an EVP be careful be careful of what you look for you may be thinking you're

356
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:01,580
 going to run into a run-of-the-mill ghost or see an orb in the bright sky but you may come across

357
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:08,620
 something that is beyond all understanding that breaks your brain down into a state of madness

358
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:18,300
 terry took off into the darkness engulfed in fear but he had three friends to chase after him

359
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,740
 to calm him down to keep him safe what happens if you see something you can explain

360
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:31,820
 and every nerve ending in your body panics at the same time you may want to know the truth

361
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:40,140
 you may search the night skies for answers but are you truly prepared to face the madness
