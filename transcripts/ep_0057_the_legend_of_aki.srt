7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,600
 Is Ted Bundy's ghost still haunting us today?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,840
 And they thought he was an urban legend until he asked to feel their muscles.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
 Today on Dead Rapper Radio.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rapper Radio.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,060
 I hope you're having a great day too.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,960
 This is the official start of season two.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
 We're back.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
 Took a little week long break.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
 It was weird coming back.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,260
 You know, I've really only done this show for about two months, but it became such a

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,840
 routine for me.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,360
 So for me not to record for a week, it was odd.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,800
 It was, it took me a while to get back on the mic, but I'm glad that I'm back here.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,000
 Back on my keto diet, that'll actually play a little bit into our next story.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
 But first off, our first story is going to be...

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,640
 Okay, so this story, it took me down some rabbit holes and it made me realize something

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,520
 a lot about just paranormal research in general and the way that we approach these things.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,320
 And this story is going to be, is Ted Bundy's ghost still haunting us?

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,240
 Now I came across this because I was looking for stuff on killer ghosts.

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,160
 And of course, when you type in killer ghosts, I got results for ghosts of serial killers.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
 Oh, that's great.

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,080
 That's actually probably more interesting than ghosts you kill people.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,280
 I came across an article in a website, psychology today is the website.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
 It's a very reputable website.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
 It's not a fringe website.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,680
 It's not a goofy news website like the Daily Star or anything like that.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,200
 Had an interesting article about the ghost of Ted Bundy and it profiles these different

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 stories.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,200
 Now the author of this article wrote a book also called "Blooding Ghosts".

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,600
 It's about supernatural events or ghosts, paranormal events at crime scenes.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,960
 Sounds very fascinating.

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,280
 I've always wondered how much police officers and EMTs and things like that encounter a

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
 ghost.

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,120
 It's probably not a lot, but you figure, these are people who are constantly dealing with

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
 tragic situations.

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
 They're out in remote areas late at night.

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,920
 I've been watching a lot of Twin Peaks lately, but even before Twin Peaks, actually, no,

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,040
 maybe the first Twin Peaks when it was being aired on CBS, it may have given me that idea.

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,080
 But how often do the police and the FBI and EMTs and stuff?

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,240
 What if you were a fireman and you ran into a haunted house?

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
 That actually is a pretty good idea for a movie.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
 Fire ghost.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
 Fahrenheit 450 ghost?

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 I don't know.

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,240
 I'll figure that one out.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,760
 But anyways, so, okay, so I'm off traffic.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
 Okay, Ted Bundy's ghost.

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,960
 So the Psychology Today article, it's an interesting article and it talks about sightings of Ted

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
 Bundy's ghost.

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,080
 Now the first thing is, they talk about, so at the prison where Ted Bundy was executed,

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,000
 there's guard, he's anonymous, he didn't want his name revealed because obviously the guards

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,240
 are going to feel that they are going to be harassed and made fun of and stuff like that.

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,920
 But anyways, as guard said that other guards at the prison have seen Ted Bundy's ghost

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,960
 sitting in the electric chair.

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,200
 This is about 2001 when this story was told.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,360
 But anyways, so, which sounds terrifying, an execution room isn't the most calm place

65
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
 anyways.

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,560
 It's not a place like, oh, I just need to get away from the guys, I want to eat my

67
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,040
 break on by myself and I want to be bugged.

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,560
 I'm going to go in the execution room, eat a sandwich.

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,640
 So he says that in the execution chamber where, I keep wanting to say Bill Cosby, where the

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,000
 execution chamber where Ted Bundy was electrocuted to death, the guards have stated that they

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,680
 have seen his ghost sitting in the electric chair, terrifying.

72
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,360
 And then he turns to them with what is known as a knowing smile.

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,600
 And then he would say, oh no, no, he would say anything then, he would just turn and

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,100
 smile and then disappear.

75
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,480
 But he was also seen in other parts of his, of the prison, specifically his holding cell

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
 on death row.

77
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,600
 And he would say, well, I beat all of you, didn't I?

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,160
 And then he fade away.

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,760
 You know, the terrifying things, I personally think serial killers are very gauche.

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
 I think it's tacky.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,360
 I think it's one of the tackiest crimes possible.

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,640
 I'll do another episode on that.

83
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,560
 But anyways, so this guy is the serial killer, blah, blah, blah.

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
 His ghost is popping around.

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,200
 And it got to the point where the guard said, the warden of the prison said, if anyone ever

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
 repeats this story, you're fired.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
 I'm tired of hearing about Ted Bundy's ghost.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,320
 The Psychology Today article goes on to say that mediums have said that they've channeled

89
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,800
 him, mediums have said, or he's been spotted on the porch of a home that he rented out

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
 in Tallahassee.

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,880
 The Psychology Today actually had a really, even more creepy segment about Ted Bundy's

92
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
 ghost.

93
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,040
 And he went to University of Puget Sound.

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,400
 Puget, Puget, Puget, Puget.

95
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
 I think it's Puget.

96
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,520
 University of, I don't remember how I said it, University of Puget Sound.

97
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,120
 Anyways, the school newspaper there, the Puget Sound Trail, did an article saying that students

98
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,520
 there have seen his ghost so regularly, they actually gave him a nickname, Teddy the Friendly

99
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
 Ghost.

100
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,000
 And the reason why they call him Teddy the Friendly Ghost is because apparently he's

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,040
 quite friendly.

102
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,560
 He will walk young co-eds across campus, which is terrifying, but he can't do anything to

103
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
 him.

104
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,480
 And the co-eds are saying, "Oh, you know, it's just kind of a pleasing presence to have

105
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,000
 somebody there with me."

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,440
 And he's been spotted at parties, like dancing along to parties.

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
 I'm just quoting the article.

108
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,160
 And they ended up doing a Ouija board thing, Ouija ceremony, a Ouija board reading.

109
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,560
 I don't know the exact terminology.

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,280
 But anyways, and the message that came across was, "I cannot touch them, so many to kill,

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,600
 and I cannot touch them.

112
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
 It is my hell."

113
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,120
 That's really creepy.

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,520
 And actually that would be hell for a serial killer to be trapped in a form where all of

115
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,000
 your pert, new bile, young, tasty victims can just walk by you and go, "Oh, Teddy,"

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,880
 and you can't touch him, you can't interact with him.

117
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,600
 That's how he exhibited his power.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,400
 Now he also had a huge obsession with pornography, and he figured being a ghost would actually

119
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,560
 help that, because you could just fly to pornographic sets or just, I guess, hang out in girls'

120
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,280
 rooms really if you're a horny ghost.

121
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
 Here's the thing.

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
 Everything in this article is complete nonsense.

123
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
 Absolutely.

124
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,120
 And I read this article and I thought, "Wow, this is really, really creepy."

125
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,680
 And I had the story ready to go.

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
 I was ready to move on it.

127
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,840
 And something inside of me said, "You know what?

128
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
 Double check this.

129
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
 Double check this story."

130
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,760
 Because something didn't sit right with it.

131
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:06,840
 And what it was specifically was seeing where Bundy was partying with the kids at the school.

132
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,240
 That's really what clued me in that this was a fake story.

133
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,120
 Okay, so this was the actual quote.

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,040
 This is really what's -- and I read this quote multiple times and I thought it was weird,

135
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,640
 but because it was sourced in the psychology today article, I just let it pass and then

136
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,960
 I decided to finally look into it a little bit more.

137
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
 I'm going to read you the quote first.

138
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,360
 The quote is, "And this is from the Puget Sound Trail article."

139
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,560
 Bundy's ghost is not just popular with girls, but with guys as well.

140
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,320
 "He's a crazy guy to party with, especially if there are girls dancing," said junior

141
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,600
 Kyle Verklin at an off-campus party that was shut down for noise complaints and paranormal

142
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
 activity.

143
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,240
 "T Bundy can tear the dance floor up.

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,520
 Something about seeing those girls bump and grind made him go crazy.

145
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
 Things down the best thing I've ever seen at a UPS party."

146
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,680
 I read it the first time.

147
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,600
 I thought it was weird that the party was shut down for paranormal activity.

148
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
 The fact that he was called T Bundy.

149
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,280
 The fact that there was this ghost that said Bundy -- but I let it go.

150
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,240
 I continued to prep this story.

151
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,400
 I came across it again.

152
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,960
 I read that it was reading the article again.

153
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
 I still let it go.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,880
 Before I decided to start recording this, I just needed to check something out.

155
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,280
 It is in the Puget Sound Trail school newspaper in a section called Combat Zone, which is

156
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,600
 surprise surprise, a parody/comedy part of the student newspaper.

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,400
 This is completely made up.

158
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
 This is the part that contained the Ouija board.

159
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
 It never happened.

160
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,360
 They never called him Ted the Friendly Ghost.

161
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,280
 He never walks girls across campus.

162
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:43,920
 He definitely was never bumping and grinding with girls as T Bundy and a party was not

163
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,440
 shut down due to paranormal activity.

164
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,920
 Once I eliminated half the article, I went back to the story of the guard in the prison

165
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
 prison.

166
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,120
 I researched that.

167
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,160
 We never know the name of the guard, which is fine.

168
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,880
 I understand people want to be anonymous, but we never know the name of the reporter

169
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
 who initially told the story to.

170
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,400
 We never know the name of the newspaper that published the article.

171
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,320
 We never know the name of the warden who said you can't talk about Ted Bundy's ghost.

172
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
 There is no sourcing for this.

173
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,040
 And every time I found a reference to the story of the warden, they all linked back

174
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,120
 to the Psychology Today website.

175
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,920
 It's an urban legend that somebody told and the Psychology Today reported it.

176
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,440
 The reason why this is important, the reason why I still wanted to go ahead with the story

177
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,920
 was that as fans of paranormal stuff, I want to believe in this stuff.

178
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
 And I do believe in this stuff.

179
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
 I've had personal experiences.

180
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,120
 I've seen stuff that makes me believe in this stuff.

181
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,920
 So when I come across these articles, and I think when most people who are fans of this

182
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,560
 stuff come across these articles, our willingness to believe overrides our logic sometimes.

183
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 And I think it's important for us to then step back and go, "Let's get a little more

184
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,120
 info on this."

185
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,400
 Just because a legitimate website reports it, doesn't mean it's legitimate.

186
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,560
 But you'll notice this a lot.

187
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,840
 You'll hear an interesting story, and if you start to look into it, you realize that there's

188
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,600
 nothing behind it.

189
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,560
 Typical thing, regular rule in journalism, who, what, when, where, why, how.

190
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,600
 Now I know in paranormal stories, you're never going to get the how or the why unless it's

191
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,240
 provably fake.

192
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,640
 The why is usually money or attention, and the how is wires and a sheet and a flashlight.

193
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,560
 A lot of times people want to rename anonymous, and I get that.

194
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,000
 But we need to have when, we need to have where, we need to have more details.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,560
 I understand the person want to stay anonymous, but who wrote the article initially about

196
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
 this?

197
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,840
 This was a paper in Florida, a newspaper in Florida, a journalist in Florida, who, it's

198
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,560
 made up, and it's frustrating because I want to read these stories, and I want them to

199
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
 have some credibility because I want to believe in this stuff.

200
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,300
 I did find an interesting story related to this, and this kind of shows the other side

201
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,160
 of this argument that I'm making.

202
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,720
 There is a contractor who says that he worked on the house that Ted Money grew up in and

203
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 it's haunted.

204
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,920
 This is this contractor.

205
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,080
 This article is in the News Tribune.

206
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
 It's a Washington paper.

207
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,560
 This contractor is saying, "I went to this house.

208
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,960
 My name is Casey Clopton.

209
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
 I was the contractor.

210
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,960
 This started in September of the year 2017, fairly recent.

211
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,120
 We're seeing things like drawers being opened, when they shouldn't have been open.

212
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,240
 Electronic devices failing, finding messages like leave and help me written in the sawdust

213
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
 on the ground.

214
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,680
 This is a young girl over, and she doesn't want to be there.

215
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
 Other people have stopped by.

216
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
 They didn't want to be there."

217
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,560
 He didn't know it was Ted Money's home.

218
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:54,080
 He got two priests to come in to bless the place, and he wrote Bible verses on the walls,

219
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,280
 and then he just finished his job as quickly as he could.

220
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,520
 He said it was both scary and neat, and that's the story.

221
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,880
 Now it's possible, obviously, he's making it up, and it's also possible that he could

222
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,480
 not be making it up, but things like going into a house and your phone dying.

223
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,560
 Sex do die.

224
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,880
 Kids don't want to be places they don't want to be in general.

225
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,680
 Some places just have a creepy vibe, and you could heighten the otherwise normally mundane

226
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,320
 things because they kind of stack on top of each other, and it doesn't mean that it's

227
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
 haunted.

228
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,440
 So there's the possibility it's haunted, the possibility he's making it up, or the possibility

229
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,720
 that it's not haunted, he's not making it up.

230
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,840
 There's just a series of odd coincidences that were happening in order.

231
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,680
 Leave and help me, someone could have wrote that, a ghost could have wrote that, he could

232
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
 be making it up.

233
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,000
 I don't know, but you see the difference in these two articles.

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,800
 One has far more facts about it.

235
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,520
 It's less compelling and less scary.

236
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,360
 It's just the guy saying, "I worked in a haunted house for a couple months, and it was creepy."

237
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,900
 The creepiest thing was I saw Leave written in the sawdust.

238
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,840
 The other one has direct communication with Ted Bundy, and the prison guards interacting

239
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 with Ted Bundy.

240
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:07,800
 Generally as listeners, as readers, we give more weight to people in official positions.

241
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,440
 So a contractor saying he saw a ghost, we weigh differently than if a prison guard said

242
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,200
 that he saw a ghost.

243
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,440
 Same thing if someone sees a UFO versus a pilot sees a UFO, we weigh those things different.

244
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,800
 I'm more apt to believe the Casey Clopton story, the contractor story.

245
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
 Actually, no, let's rephrase it.

246
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,120
 I'm a thousand times more likely to believe that story from that guy that I've never

247
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,400
 met than I am to believe the Psychology Today article because it's provably false.

248
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,000
 But it's funny because I was ready to believe both of them equally, and actually I think

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,760
 I was ready to believe the Psychology Today article more because it was a reputable website.

250
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,120
 So you know, the key thing here is that we as fans of this, as researchers of this, really

251
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,600
 need to do our due diligence.

252
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,600
 We need to be willing to call out things that are fake or we believe are fake.

253
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,840
 There's nothing wrong with that.

254
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,320
 There may be less fun.

255
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,960
 There's always that old saying, you'll never sell a million books about UFOs if you say

256
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,800
 UFOs are fake, and that's true.

257
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,240
 But I think there's enough real UFO stories out there and enough real ghost stories out.

258
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,440
 There are enough real conspiracy stories out there and they might not be as sexy as the

259
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,080
 made up ones, but because they are real and because they have enough to go on that someone

260
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:29,920
 can research them years later, they are far more fascinating than Ted Bundy's ghost dancing

261
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,360
 at a party.

262
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,480
 The next story we're going to do is fascinating to me.

263
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
 I've said this multiple times.

264
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,840
 I'm a big fan of urban legends.

265
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,440
 I'm a big fan of local legends.

266
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:47,160
 This is a story of an urban legend, a man that people in the area thought was fake until

267
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,400
 they met him.

268
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,020
 And more importantly, until he appeared in court.

269
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,120
 So this story takes place in Northwest England in the early 2000s.

270
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,280
 Now when I was growing up, not in Northwest England, but just for an aside, when I was

271
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,160
 growing up, there was an Alameda, which is in the Bay Area, there was a homeless man named

272
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
 Joe Trombone.

273
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,120
 And Joe Trombone was this crazy homeless man who all the teenagers saw.

274
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
 I was too young.

275
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,160
 I was around 11 or 12 at the time.

276
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,240
 They all saw him and what made Joe Trombone interesting is that when you saw him, if

277
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,300
 you said, "Hey, Joe Trombone, bust a rhyme," he would start rapping on the spot, freestyling

278
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,900
 the most insane lyrics possible about all sorts of stuff.

279
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:34,260
 Now, being able to make rhymes, like disorganize rhyming is a sign, is a side effect of schizophrenia

280
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,820
 because you're just the way your brain is wired.

281
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,220
 So if you saw him on the bus, you just say, "Yo, Joe Trombone, you know, drop a flow,"

282
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,220
 and he would just go.

283
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,060
 He would just start rapping.

284
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,400
 Now, I always wanted to meet him, never did.

285
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,680
 He's a local legend.

286
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,040
 So I've always liked those stories of those people in certain areas because you're never

287
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
 going to meet him.

288
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
 You're across the globe.

289
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,440
 And sometimes you never even meet him when you're in this city.

290
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,120
 So in Northwest England, which is a big geographical area, obviously, in the early 2000s, there

291
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,920
 was a guy known in the area as Purple Aki.

292
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,940
 So let's get the meaning of the name out of the way right now.

293
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,780
 Purple Aki came about because he was considered so black, he was purple.

294
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,220
 He was a black dude, and they considered him so black, he was purple.

295
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:30,620
 His real name was Aukenwale Arobike, people in town called him Purple Aki.

296
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,380
 Yes, that's a very, very racist term.

297
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,980
 He's actually not like, when they said that, I was like, "Oh dude, this guy must be like

298
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,980
 super black."

299
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,780
 He looks like Coach from Left 4 Dead 2.

300
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,280
 But I guess in that area where they weren't used to seeing black people, he seemed super

301
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,420
 black.

302
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,500
 And when I'm first reading about him, I'm like, "This guy's kind of a tragic figure.

303
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,980
 He's this big, giant black dude.

304
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,620
 He's six foot five and three hundred and ten pounds.

305
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,300
 He's living in England."

306
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,220
 People are referring to him as Purple Aki.

307
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,520
 As his legend grows, a restaurant started a Purple Teriyaki burger.

308
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,620
 His name, Purple Aki, was used in court documents.

309
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,300
 Nowadays, he's like, "I just want to be left alone, mate.

310
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
 Why you guys?"

311
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,460
 Because people will follow him around with YouTube cameras and be like, "Hey, Purple

312
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
 Aki, Purple Aki."

313
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,260
 He's like, "Hey, I just want to be left alone."

314
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,780
 So your heart kind of goes out for this guy.

315
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,100
 People are saying racist things right to his face.

316
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,300
 People are stalking him.

317
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,780
 Then you just slightly, slightly look into the story, just a little bit more.

318
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,760
 This guy is, all sympathy goes out the window.

319
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,520
 All sympathy for this guy goes out the window.

320
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,400
 No, you shouldn't be calling him that.

321
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,440
 For the rest of the episode, we're going to refer to him as Aki unless I'm specifically

322
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
 quoting something.

323
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,560
 So you shouldn't be referring him as that name, especially in court documents, and that

324
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,640
 comes into play later.

325
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,800
 But anyway, so Aki, his claim to fame was, like I said, he was six foot five.

326
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,520
 He was three hundred and ten pounds.

327
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,840
 He was a bodybuilder.

328
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,760
 What he would do, what he was known for, and what he admits doing is walk

329
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,060
 in up to young fit men, young muscular men, many took care of their bodies and things

330
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
 like that.

331
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,420
 And he would ask, "Oh man, oh mate, look at your muscles, mate.

332
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,660
 Can I feel them?

333
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,820
 Can I feel your muscles?"

334
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,060
 And you'd be like, "Uh..."

335
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,260
 And this guy was so big and so imposing, they'd be like, "Yeah, sure, feel my muscles.

336
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,980
 All right, mate, let me feel them.

337
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
 Oi, strong."

338
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,580
 You then take out measuring tape and measure your muscles.

339
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,900
 And you're like, "Okay, that guy seems a little mentally ill."

340
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,840
 But sometimes he would walk up to someone and go, "All right, mate, can I feel your

341
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 muscles?"

342
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
 And there would be like, "Uh..."

343
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,120
 And he'd be like, "How's your cousin doing?

344
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,040
 I know he goes to that school across the street and I know where you live.

345
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,680
 Can I feel your muscles?"

346
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,600
 He was stalking these guys too.

347
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,880
 He kept detailed records of these men, where they lived, where family members lived, their

348
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,440
 father's place of work, and he would write down the measurements of the guys.

349
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,040
 He had a stalking guide.

350
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,660
 He was in this poor, sad sap who was walking around England.

351
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,820
 You know, just, he was a stalker.

352
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,700
 He was a through and through stalker who used his size and his, first, wait, I just realized

353
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,060
 this, how does a six foot five guy stalk you?

354
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,300
 Does he dress like a bush?

355
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,100
 How hard would it be to spot this giant walking through your front yard?

356
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,540
 But anyways, he stalked people, he threatened people, one family had to go into witness

357
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,740
 protection.

358
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,600
 He actually caught a manslaughter charge because this young man, I think it was like 15 or

359
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,960
 16, was petrified of Aki.

360
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,840
 He had to run with him before, get a run with this guy before, where he felt intimidated

361
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,200
 to let Aki touch his muscles.

362
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,560
 A time later, he was at the train station, Aki showed up.

363
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,960
 The kid terrified of what was going to happen because there was also urban legends that

364
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,240
 he would cut you open or rape you and stuff like that.

365
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,980
 None of that's ever been proven, but he was definitely an intimidating person who stalked

366
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
 people.

367
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,260
 Anyways, this young kid is terrified of Aki.

368
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,460
 He runs across the railroad tracks, steps on a live-walt line, you know, like the third

369
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,700
 rail, electrocuted, dies.

370
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,220
 They arrested Aki for manslaughter.

371
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,940
 He was found guilty.

372
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,500
 The one on appeal for two reasons.

373
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,180
 One was he said, he usually defended himself in court.

374
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,980
 I'm not for sure if he defended himself on this account, but he said all I was doing

375
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,980
 was standing there.

376
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,800
 There was no one else to dispute that.

377
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,200
 All I was doing was standing there.

378
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,060
 And in the court documents, they refer to him as purple Aki.

379
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,200
 So he goes, "This is obviously racism against me."

380
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,840
 They were using a racist slang word.

381
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,040
 The police are using a racist slang word.

382
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,680
 That's why they're coming down on me so much.

383
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,680
 He actually won on appeal, did not get the manslaughter charged, and won 35,000 pounds

384
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,840
 or dollars or 35,000 of some currency for that.

385
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
 That aside, he was in and out of jail.

386
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,340
 He was constantly being arrested for harassment, for grabbing people's muscles, for basically

387
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,260
 like stuff like intimidation.

388
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,500
 So a quick tip about crime in general.

389
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,380
 I'm walking down the street and there is somebody who's much smaller than me and I say, "Nice

390
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,940
 shoes, can I have them?"

391
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,820
 I can be charged with intimidation or theft.

392
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,860
 Because the implication isn't, "Nice shoes, can I buy them off you?"

393
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,460
 The implication is, "Nice shoes, give them to me or I will beat you up."

394
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,980
 That is generally what happens when you're in jail or prison.

395
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,120
 They just go, "Hey, nice shoes, can I have them?

396
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,840
 Hey, do you mind if I eat the rest of your food?"

397
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,120
 You have the option of saying no, but you understand the implications if you say no.

398
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,600
 But your defense would be like, "All I told him is he had nice shoes and he gave them

399
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
 to me."

400
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,000
 That doesn't fly.

401
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,800
 So he could say, "Well, I just walked up and said, 'Can I feel your muscles?'

402
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,360
 And he let me feel his muscles."

403
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,120
 But the other person, the victim, is going to say, "Yeah, because he was a giant and

404
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,800
 I knew his reputation and I knew he was stalking people."

405
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
 So anyways, he's in and out of jail.

406
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,580
 He eventually gets because the court believes that all of this stuff about feeling, "Oh,

407
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,660
 I haven't even gotten to the upside down squat thing."

408
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,500
 So just when you're like, "Oh, he's just feeling muscles.

409
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 He's just measuring muscles.

410
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,340
 Oh, he's just hiding in people's bushes and finding out where their nephew lives."

411
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,340
 There's no big deal, Jason.

412
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,180
 The physical, let's put this, I want you to imagine yourself in this position.

413
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,900
 Whatever physical fitness level you're at.

414
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,220
 Let's put yourself in the streets of Northwest England.

415
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,900
 Aki comes up to you and says, "Hey, I love your muscles.

416
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,700
 Do you want to do an upside down squat?"

417
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,920
 You're like, "What's that?"

418
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,200
 Never heard of that before.

419
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 So normally a squat is you just squat.

420
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,320
 You stand up straight and you sit down in the air.

421
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,000
 That's probably the best way to explain it on a podcast.

422
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,480
 You sit down so your thighs are horizontal to the ground and then you stand back up.

423
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
 Squat basic.

424
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
 Everyone does them.

425
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,400
 Then you have the squats where someone hangs off your back.

426
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,800
 So you get some young hot chick at the gym to wrap her arms and legs around you and you

427
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
 do a squat.

428
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,280
 It adds another 110 pounds to your lift.

429
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,140
 An upside down squat is where Aki climbs on your back.

430
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,060
 So now you have 310 pounds and a six foot five guy on your back, but he's doing it upside

431
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
 down.

432
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:06,380
 So his face is in your butt and his dick is pressed against your neck and you're squatting.

433
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,980
 Whether or not you say, "Ah, these victims, you know, they should just deal with it."

434
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,060
 Some guy feels their muscles, it's no crime.

435
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:17,440
 Even having a dude's giant dick on the back of your neck as you're squatting in public

436
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,640
 because he knows where your nephew lives.

437
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,080
 Anyways, the courts could never prove that he was doing this for sexual gratification,

438
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,960
 which he probably was, but they hit him with a SOPA order.

439
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,520
 SOPA is a sexual offender protection order and they said, "It's basically like a thing.

440
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,160
 You know, we have them in America where we're like, you can't live within 100 yards of a

441
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,280
 school or you can't interact with children."

442
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,580
 This order was a judge said, "You can never, ever touch another man's muscles.

443
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,140
 You can't ask for it and you can't do it."

444
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,180
 And he violated that order multiple times.

445
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,820
 He was going other places, he had the order on him.

446
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,540
 He would feel someone's muscles, they would call the cops, the cops, that's all they need

447
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
 to know.

448
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
 They'd pick him up, throw him in jail.

449
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,700
 Happened multiple times.

450
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,300
 He didn't care.

451
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:10,580
 And then all of it got removed because his defense that this was a racist witch hunt was

452
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,360
 eventually believed the lifetime ban is removed.

453
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,240
 He no longer is able to be arrested on the spot for feeling someone's muscles unless the

454
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,920
 person is truly saying, "No, I was victimized" and stuff like that because the police had

455
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,840
 to use that stupid nickname in the police report.

456
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,160
 He shouldn't have done that.

457
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
 They hadn't.

458
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,840
 He probably would have been in jail for the manslaughter charge.

459
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,360
 He would definitely still have a SOPA order.

460
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,900
 As of today if you are a fit young man walking the streets in Northwest England, there is

461
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,980
 a chance that you will run into Aki and he will ask to feel your muscles.

462
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,580
 And as much as I would like to run into a urban legend, I don't think I could do an

463
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,980
 upside down squat.

464
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,020
 Even with all my keto, I don't think I'm in shape enough for him.

465
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,820
 But however, maybe someday, maybe some, I don't, I'm glad that it's like I'm looking

466
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
 forward to that.

467
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,540
 But no, no.

468
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,100
 So Aki, I don't want to meet you.

469
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,700
 I don't care how fit I am.

470
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,180
 You need to stop doing this stuff.

471
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,420
 Nowadays, there's a lot of YouTube videos of people stalking him and him being like,

472
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
 "Go away, mate, go away.

473
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,540
 I just want to live my life."

474
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,100
 And part of you, like the initial part of you goes, "Wow, they're picking on that guy."

475
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,500
 But then when you remember all of the stuff he's done to other people, you realize this

476
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,700
 is just dessert.

477
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,180
 You can't really stalk people when you're famous in an entire region.

478
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,420
 And he's not going to be left alone.

479
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,900
 He is a meme.

480
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,540
 He went from being an urban legend because people didn't believe he existed.

481
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,580
 The story was so absurd.

482
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,420
 One bodybuilder would tell another bodybuilder and they'd be like, "That's absurd."

483
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,220
 And then they would run into Aki and the legend grew.

484
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,420
 And then eventually when he got arrested, it was proven that this guy actually existed.

485
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,020
 And now people hold up signs at soccer games.

486
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,520
 And like I said, the restaurant has the Purple Teriyaki burger.

487
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
 And he's well known.

488
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,540
 He seeded a documentary on him and he flipped out about that as well.

489
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,220
 So you got your just desserts, bro.

490
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,940
 You got your just desserts and they're loaded for a little carbs and it's totally going

491
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,500
 to ruin your cut.

492
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,100
 But this is what happens when you stalk people and ask to feel their muscles.

493
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,740
 I wonder what would happen if someone who was like not super muscular but was like working

494
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,820
 really hard doing go mad, drinking a gallon of milk a day, is walking with their super

495
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,500
 fit buddy and Aki is like, "I just talked to your buddy."

496
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,120
 I wonder if that would make you like go to the gym and want to hit it more because you

497
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,880
 know what he's doing or would you just be like, "I think I'm good here.

498
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,360
 I think this is the body that I want.

499
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,720
 The body that makes me invisible to a six foot five giant."

500
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,200
