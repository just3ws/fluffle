1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 from Red Bull to Monster.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,800
 There's all sorts of energy drinks out there.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,300
 But there was a time not long ago

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,300
 where people were drinking

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,100
 radioactive materials.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,300
 And then we take a look

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,800
 at two stories of human teleportation.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,600
 Is it possible for someone to start off in one location

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,600
 and end up in another location?

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,700
 Yes, that's possible.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,900
 But is it possible to do

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,700
 in the blink of an eye?

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,500
 [music]

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
 I'm having a great day.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,700
 I hope you're having a great day too.

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,300
 It's actually been a really, really weird day.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,700
 Not paranormal weird, just odd.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,000
 I felt a little off.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,400
 This episode's coming out late

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,500
 and I want to do a few quick notes.

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,800
 One, I did get a bunch of fan art

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,300
 when the Discord server was up.

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,100
 I'm going to start posting that up as well.

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
 I got a couple other things I need to post up.

28
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,600
 Two, for the people who watch the show on YouTube,

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,700
 yes, the clips will be coming back soon.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,100
 It's just I'm getting everything started

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,000
 with this new season.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,200
 I've been posting the whole...

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,400
 It's always a tricky thing.

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,900
 A lot of people like the whole episodes up,

35
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,600
 but I get less new viewers.

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,000
 So we're trying to figure that out.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,300
 I'll figure out something else.

38
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,400
 But let's go ahead and get started

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
 with our first story here.

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,700
 Now, for our first story,

41
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,700
 this was a weird one.

42
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,200
 Now, the first part of it I was fairly familiar with.

43
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,300
 But then I found out this new detail

44
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,600
 and both sides are completely tragic.

45
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,700
 But one thing is human greed.

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,800
 And the other thing is just people generally acting stupidly.

47
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
 But I guess at the time,

48
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,700
 I'm sure he thought it was a grand idea.

49
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,600
 So we're going back to the roaring twenties.

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
 Wow.

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,000
 Actually, no, what would have been more of a roar?

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
 That's why they called it the roaring twenties.

53
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,300
 Cryptids were everywhere.

54
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,500
 But also, you know, I'm sure they had other reasons

55
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,600
 for calling it the roaring.

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
 Why did they call it the roaring twenties?

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,100
 I probably should have looked that up.

58
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,400
 But anyways, has nothing to do with the rest of this episode.

59
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,700
 The first part of the story is there was this issue

60
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,100
 where glow in the dark stuff was all the rage.

61
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,700
 Whenever a new technology comes out,

62
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,700
 everyone is like, hey, I want that.

63
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,200
 And nowadays we're kind of smart enough to go,

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,000
 hey, we've developed this new...

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 They have this new chemical that's hydrophobic

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
 that you can put it on the bottom of a boat

67
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,800
 and it basically water doesn't attach to the boat.

68
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,300
 So they can spray it on the bottom of a boat

69
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,700
 and it makes the boats go super fast through the water.

70
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,900
 And people have thought, you know what?

71
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,500
 I bet you we could put that in cans of food

72
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,700
 and the food would just come out.

73
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,000
 They say a good like 10% of all canned food

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,100
 actually stays in the can.

75
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,300
 It can't come out,

76
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,500
 which is quite frustrating

77
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,700
 when you're trying to eat some Dennis and Chili beans.

78
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,500
 And you can spray this stuff on your clothes

79
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,200
 and you would never get wet.

80
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,700
 You could throw spaghetti on it

81
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,800
 and it would just fall right off.

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,400
 Like any sort of...

83
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
 Well, I get no spaghetti, it's not a liquid,

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 but the sauce is.

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,400
 So it basically closed at no sweat would attach to

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
 so you won't have to worry about bacteria.

87
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,900
 Hydrophobic materials are a godsend.

88
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,200
 And I was reading these articles

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
 about hydrophobic materials and paint

90
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,500
 and I was like, oh, this is awesome.

91
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 This could revolutionize the way I eat Chili beans.

92
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,200
 But they don't know if it's edible.

93
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
 They don't know what the long-term effects of it.

94
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,900
 They, they were talking about it and they're like,

95
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,000
 yes, we could spray it on a boat,

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,700
 but we don't know what the,

97
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,800
 the long-term effect of it in seawater will do.

98
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,100
 We can test it in water,

99
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,400
 but we don't know what's going to happen over months or years

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
 and stuff like that.

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,900
 We have to examine all that stuff.

102
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,800
 Jason, Jason stop eating that can of Chili.

103
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,600
 We have to figure out whether or not it's good in the long term.

104
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,900
 But there was a time they didn't really have that idea.

105
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,500
 And that time is the 1920s,

106
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,300
 where radium had been discovered

107
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,700
 and madam Curie and her husband are kind of messing around with it and stuff.

108
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,200
 And they're like, this seems quite dangerous,

109
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,500
 but this is this new element that we have found.

110
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
 Mineral, gas.

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,400
 You're like, Jason, you really don't know anything about this,

112
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,300
 but hold on, hold on.

113
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,500
 So what the main thing was is it costs things to glow in the dark

114
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,400
 because it's radioactive, right?

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,700
 And it became this huge thing to have glow in the dark items.

116
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,900
 But it's the 1920s.

117
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,300
 So everything is like handmade basically.

118
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,500
 You had assembly lines, but you didn't have robots doing stuff.

119
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,900
 You had people doing stuff.

120
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,700
 And the idea of having a glow in the dark watch today is quite simple.

121
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,100
 Little kids have glow in the dark watches.

122
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,900
 I don't think I've ever seen an adult be like, hey, what time is it?

123
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,200
 Let me go in the closet real quick.

124
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,100
 Like, that's something a little kid has.

125
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,000
 But back then it was this brand new thing to have glow in the dark technologies.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 It was the 1920s.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,900
 They've only had lights for maybe 30 years at this point.

128
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,000
 Well, they had candles, but you know what I mean?

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,600
 So this company started making these watches, these glow in the dark watches.

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,700
 Huge hits.

131
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,000
 Everyone's like, oh, this is amazing.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,600
 Now, to be able to put the, the, the, it's one of those things you don't really think about

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,100
 until I read this article.

134
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,900
 To make the watch glow in the dark, you can't just like throw a bunch of radioactive paint on it

135
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,300
 because then you can't see anything.

136
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,000
 So they hired a bunch of women to paint the numbers on with a paintbrush.

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,100
 So they're holding the paintbrush with their hands.

138
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,400
 They're not wearing like lead gloves.

139
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
 They're not in these huge suits or anything like that.

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,900
 And they're painting the numbers on these watches.

141
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,800
 They dip the paintbrush into the radioactive paint and draw.

142
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,900
 I should say at this point, they really didn't think radioactivity was a bad thing.

143
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,800
 So they're dipping it in and they're painting it and they dip it in and paint it.

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,200
 And in between, I think it was like every two strokes, every two little paint strokes,

145
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,900
 the women were instructed.

146
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,400
 They had to get a really, really fine point on the paintbrush.

147
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
 So they had to put it in their mouth, go lick it, and then draw the number two,

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,700
 draw the number three, draw the number four, draw the number five.

149
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,800
 So they were painting 200 watches a day and side effect, a quick side effect,

150
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,900
 they actually, it was stated several times in these articles that they would then glow in the dark.

151
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,500
 The women started glowing in the dark, which they actually thought was really cool.

152
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,100
 It was this cool side effect of working in this plant where you're ingesting radioactive paint.

153
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,300
 Because again, nobody knew it was a problem.

154
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,000
 Now there's little asterisks at this point because as they're making the watches,

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,200
 Madam Curie's research is starting to say, "This stuff you probably shouldn't eat."

156
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
 We don't know what it is.

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,700
 I mean, we're trying to figure it out.

158
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,800
 We don't know if it's a mineral or a gas or a compound like Jason.

159
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,900
 It's something.

160
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,000
 Don't touch it.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,300
 And the people who ran the watch companies, and this happened at one watch company in particular,

162
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,000
 but other, I believe other companies are doing it as well.

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 People at the watch company were like, "Yeah, yeah, don't let the women know

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,500
 because we're making a ton of money off of these watches."

165
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,400
 They weren't telling the women how dangerous it was.

166
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,000
 The women would go out to nightclubs and they'd glow in the dark at a nightclub.

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Basically like a spooky skeleton.

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,400
 I don't know if their whole skin glowed, but I like to imagine just their bones were glowing through their skin as they're dancing.

169
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
 Anyways, there are also women are also encouraged to use it as makeup.

170
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,700
 You can put a little radioactive paint on your face and when you went out, your face would glow.

171
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,400
 You'd get that unearthly glow.

172
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,000
 Now, obviously, they was very, very like, it wasn't short-lived.

173
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,100
 Well, they were short-lived.

174
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,000
 That was the problem.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,900
 Like it was a fad that lasted for a couple years, but these women and this company started to melt.

176
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,100
 They started to melt.

177
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,900
 It's, this is where the story gets quite horrible.

178
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,100
 So their teeth started to fall out, which imagine having a job

179
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,400
 or just waking up tomorrow and your front teeth fall out.

180
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,100
 You would be horrified.

181
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,500
 You would be, your first thing would be what is happening to me.

182
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,000
 Second thing is I wonder if the tooth fairy still gives money for teeth, even though I'm an adult.

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,200
 But they were starting to melt.

184
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,100
 Their faces were starting to fall off.

185
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,700
 They were start, they're like, chin was getting distended.

186
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,300
 This one woman, she just had this massive tumor underneath her chin.

187
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,200
 All their teeth are falling out.

188
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,300
 Their hair is falling out.

189
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,800
 They went to the doctor to figure out what was going on and the company was trying to run a smoke screen.

190
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
 And they said, oh yeah, all these women have STDs.

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,200
 All of their horrible diseases are due to STDs in the women.

192
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,300
 They're like, what?

193
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,700
 No, we don't.

194
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,600
 They're like, you do go to the club an awful lot.

195
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,800
 And they're like, well, yes, I do, but I don't have an STD.

196
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,900
 At one point, the company actually hired a doctor and came out and talked to one of the assembly line supervisors

197
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,600
 and gave him a clean bill of health.

198
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,400
 He did a whole investigation on this guy.

199
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,200
 What's it called an examination on this guy?

200
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,000
 And said, that should be a clue and said, he's totally fine.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,400
 And the doctor leaves and the press is like, oh, okay.

202
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,500
 So these girls probably are just, you know, hussies.

203
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,600
 And then someone goes, wait a second, isn't that kind of weird?

204
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,700
 The doctor said, let's do an investigation instead of the proper term examination.

205
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,500
 And it turns out the doctor was another employee of that company

206
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,600
 who basically just walked in with a stethoscope and a lab coat and pretended to be a doctor.

207
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,500
 Huge scandal.

208
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,100
 The women actually started to try to sue the company

209
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,100
 because now at this point it's coming out that the radioactive material is killing them

210
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,500
 and the company knew about it.

211
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,200
 And the company, the company's defense strategy was this.

212
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,000
 Let's keep pushing back the trial until all the women are dead.

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,200
 And that was almost successful, but the public outcry basically forced the government to say,

214
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,900
 no, no, no, we got to hold the trial now.

215
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,800
 And the women got compensated.

216
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,000
 They got like, I think it was like $10,000 or something like that, which back then was more money.

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
 And then they got a stipend for the rest of their life,

218
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,200
 but they didn't really live more than three or four years after the trial anyways.

219
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
 And they obviously stopped making the watches.

220
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,400
 And it changed the way that people can sue their companies.

221
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,100
 There were some big laws that came out of that.

222
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,300
 So that is an issue where you go to work and your company is not looking out for you.

223
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,400
 So I have an uncle who fought in Vietnam, like fought in Vietnam.

224
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,100
 He was a helicopter gunner.

225
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,200
 And he said, I remember he ended up being part of that big lawsuit for Agent Orange.

226
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,600
 They had, they were dumping it all over the Viet Cong, all over the jungles.

227
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 It was basically like a huge defoilment, defoilager.

228
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
 It's basically used to melt plants.

229
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,000
 And he goes, yeah, I used to like, we used to like lean up against barrels of it and it's like smoke cigarettes.

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,500
 Like it was, there'd be an open barrel of Agent Orange is sitting there.

231
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 It was this horrible chemical that was made to destroy jungles.

232
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,600
 He breathed in a ton of it.

233
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,500
 He's actually like mentally fine, but he just had a lot of like nerve damage and stuff like that.

234
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,600
 He's had some crazy stories about Vietnam.

235
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,300
 I think everyone in Vietnam has some crazy stories.

236
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,500
 But anyways, whereas, oh, so yeah, when you, when you're with the government or with the company,

237
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,900
 you assume that they're not going to poison you on purpose.

238
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,100
 I had heard the story of the radium girls.

239
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
 That's what they're called.

240
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,700
 I had heard the story about the radium girls before, but what I had found recently,

241
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,000
 and I thought about doing a story on them just because it was so weird.

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 But what I found recently was this, and I'll cover this real quickly.

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,200
 There was this golfer, semi pro golfer named Eben Byers.

244
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,900
 What is semi pro?

245
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,700
 Like, does that mean you don't get paid a lot or does that mean you're about to become pro?

246
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,400
 Do you have to go like amateur semi pro pro or semi pro just where like you play on the weekends,

247
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
 but you play for like serious money?

248
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,600
 Anyways, he was a semi pro golfer named Eben Byers.

249
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,200
 Same time period, 1920s.

250
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,200
 In 1927, Eben was horsing around and he fell and he hurt his arm.

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,100
 Now as a golfer, that's a serious thing.

252
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,400
 You need both of them to golf.

253
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,900
 I think you kind of need both arms to put.

254
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,100
 Do you need- No, you can play ping pong with one arm.

255
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
 I think there's some sports.

256
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,400
 You only need one arm.

257
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
 Soccer.

258
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,400
 But anyways, so he had only had- Wait, he didn't only have one arm.

259
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,100
 That's not what happened.

260
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,400
 He injured his arm and there was this tonic.

261
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,800
 There was like this heel-all tonic, which was also like an energy drink and gave you pep.

262
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,000
 It really got things going.

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 There's actually in the American Journal of Clinical Medicine, they talked about this drink.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It's called Radathor, which is a dope name.

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,100
 Radathor.

266
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,800
 This is the quote- This wasn't just about the drink.

267
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,400
 The doctor wasn't like shilling for Radathor.

268
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,200
 But his quote about radioactivity was, "Radioactivity presents insanity, rouses noble emotions,

269
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,800
 retards old age, and creates a splendid, youthful, joyous life."

270
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,500
 So they thought radiation was the bomb.

271
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,900
 [laughs]

272
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,300
 That was not intended.

273
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,500
 So anyways, they thought radiation was great, right?

274
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,100
 And so there was this little drink called Radathor.

275
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,800
 And there were like even bars like, "Oh, my arm hurts."

276
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,100
 And the doctor goes, "Well, we have this new thing called Radathor.

277
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,800
 You can drink it and it'll give you pep and it will help your arm somehow."

278
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,800
 And also Radathor was believed to cure premature-

279
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
 No, not premature ejaculations.

280
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,500
 What's the other thing people don't like?

281
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,800
 You can't get it up.

282
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 What's that called?

283
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,400
 Impedance.

284
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,100
 Okay, so it was also a thought to cure impudence.

285
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,500
 So he was drinking it and he's like, "Oh, I feel great.

286
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,600
 My arm's totally fine.

287
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,900
 I'm not impudent.

288
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,800
 I wasn't impudent before, but I'm definitely not impudent now and he's drinking it."

289
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,200
 He ended up developing a bit of a habit.

290
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,900
 Now it's not addictive, but he really, really enjoyed the way it made him feel.

291
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:12,700
 He drank three bottles a day for two years of radioactive material.

292
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,500
 I feel great.

293
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,400
 This feels so good.

294
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,000
 But after, you know, two years of that, his teeth start to fall out.

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
 He starts to melt.

296
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,900
 His chin, his lower chin basically just disappears.

297
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,500
 An attorney went to go visit him, not just a regular attorney traveling through town.

298
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,200
 He was a friend of his who was an attorney.

299
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,900
 Went to go visit Eben towards the end and he had this quote,

300
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,300
 "Young in years and mentally alert, he could hardly speak.

301
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,500
 His head was swathed in bandages.

302
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,700
 He had undergone two successful jaw operations and his whole upper jaw,

303
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,900
 accepting two front teeth and most of his lower jaw had been removed."

304
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
 So I have that backwards.

305
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,600
 He said, "Well, how do you have a lower jaw and not an upper jaw?

306
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 The picture made him look like you didn't have a lower jaw.

307
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
 But anyways, the attorney knows more.

308
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,700
 He saw him.

309
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,800
 I just saw a picture.

310
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,500
 All the remaining bone tissue of his body was slowly disintegrating

311
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,600
 and holes were actually forming in his skull.

312
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,500
 When he died, they had to bury him in a lead lined coffin.

313
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,000
 And his body is so radioactive it has a half life of 1600 years.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,100
 And at one point they dug him up to do a test.

315
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,200
 They dug him up like in the 70s or 80s and they tested his bones and they're like,

316
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,100
 "Yep, he's still super, super radioactive."

317
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,300
 The people who dug him up had to wear lead lined suits

318
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,000
 and they just put him back in the lead lined coffin.

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,700
 But they wanted to see and they actually think that he drank more than three bottles a day

320
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,500
 because they're like for him to have this much radioactivity still in him.

321
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 Yeah, drink a lot.

322
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,000
 So yeah, you know, it's funny because I tell people this,

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
 I have a lot of friends who drink energy drinks.

324
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 I'm okay with them, but I have a lot of friends who drink them.

325
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,400
 And I say Red Bull is the only one that is approved by the FDA.

326
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,600
 All the other ones, Monster and whatever the rest of them,

327
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,100
 maybe the Starbucks ones are, but energy drinks in general are considered supplements.

328
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,900
 So they're not regulated by the FDA.

329
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,200
 Red Bull is the only one that's considered a food product.

330
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,500
 So the FDA monitors it.

331
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,200
 Any of the other ones, you really don't know what you're getting in there.

332
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,400
 They'll say, "We'll give you this, we'll give you that."

333
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,800
 But they may end up giving you a lead lined coffin in the end.

334
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 Actually, that's not true.

335
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,200
 I don't think any of them are radioactive, but you know what I mean?

336
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,100
 Like not all of them are healthy out there.

337
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,900

 you will get 10% off your next order.

340
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,500
 That's not true.

341
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,800
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

342
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,000
 Now, our next story, it's so funny because I came across it as a fluke.

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,800
 And I almost feel like that is how everyone has come across it, going back 400 years.

344
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,100
 I'm always looking around for weird stuff, honestly, and sometimes weird stuff finds me.

345
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,000
 I found this article.

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,600
 It's called, "Mysterious Teleportation Case of Major Tudor Pole Remains Unexplained."

347
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,900
 So let's go ahead and hop in the deadrabberdurgible.

348
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,100
 That's her only aircraft available right now.

349
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,400
 And we are going to Sussex, which I believe is in England.

350
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,500
 But we're going there anyways.

351
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 We're going to Sussex.

352
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,100
 We'll fly around England until we find it.

353
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,300
 And we're back in the 60s.

354
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,900
 Now, in the 1960s, Major Poole wrote this book.

355
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,300
 He was like this mystic and he believed in like King Arthur and the Holy Grail and all this stuff,

356
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,800
 which may or may not exist, but he was this mystic guy.

357
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,200
 He wrote books about mysticism and weird events.

358
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 So he's writing this book and he goes, "I, if you believe it or not,

359
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,000
 I, a guy who believes in everything paranormal, happen to have a paranormal event.

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
 What are the odds?"

361
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,000
 And this is his story.

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,300
 One day on a dark rainy night, I had to get home by 6 p.m.

363
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,800
 to get a very important phone call.

364
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,900
 But I was a mile and a half from home.

365
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,300
 There were no taxis, trains or buses.

366
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,600
 And it was raining and I didn't want to get wet.

367
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,100
 And it was 5.55.

368
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,700
 So I began.

369
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,900
 I took one step on my journey home and then in a flash,

370
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,300
 I was standing in the hallway of my house and then the phone rang.

371
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,700
 It was 6 p.m.

372
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,100
 And I was, I read that and I was like, "Hmm, okay."

373
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
 I mean, like, I guess that's interesting.

374
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
 But I have no proof of it.

375
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,500
 It happened to a guy who already believes in this type of stuff.

376
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,800
 It also reminded me of a time where when someone said, "Hey, man,

377
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,200
 I need to make a phone call at noon.

378
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,400
 You had to be at your house at noon."

379
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,900
 So weird.

380
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,400
 It wasn't that long ago, but like having to pull over, use pay phones,

381
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,100
 have a pager like, "Hey, you're getting a phone call at 3 p.m.

382
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,900
 You had to be home."

383
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,800
 So weird.

384
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,700
 That's the weirdest part of that story to me.

385
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,600
 Because I read that and I go, "That's interesting, but when stuff like this happens to people

386
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,600
 who believe in it and there's no verification, there's no witnesses, nothing like that."

387
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
 It's just hard to say.

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
 But in that article at the very beginning, they said,

389
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
 "You know, human teleportation is..."

390
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,300
 I don't want to do that voice though.

391
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,400
 The article said, "You know, human teleportation is possible.

392
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,400
 We look at the story of Gil Perez and then here's the story about Major Tutor Poe.

393
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,200
 And it had all that stuff and then it went into how technology is advancing.

394
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,000
 So stuff can be teleported and so on and so forth.

395
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,500
 And I go, "Who's Gil Perez?"

396
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,300
 I'd never heard that name before.

397
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,000
 Totally stumbled across that.

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
 Interesting story.

399
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,400
 Very, very interesting story.

400
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
 The year is 1593.

401
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,300
 The month is October.

402
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,000
 And the governor of the Philippines, we're in Philippines.

403
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,500
 I guess I should say that.

404
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
 We're in the capital city of Manila.

405
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,100
 The governor of the Philippines decides to start making some moves.

406
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,700
 Starts making some moves on areas.

407
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,600
 There are some locals in a nearby country who want his help.

408
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,100
 And he's like, "Okay, I'm going to do that.

409
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,900
 We'll bring him some supplies and some emeralds and stuff like that."

410
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,400
 But at the same time, I want to go take on these islands.

411
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
 I think they were the spice islands.

412
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,700
 I want to start making some moves.

413
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,000
 I want to start taking some territory.

414
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,100
 And I want to lead it myself.

415
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,800
 This is going to be a glorious battle.

416
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 So the governor and all of his troops and everything move onto these boats.

417
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,300
 And they start floating around.

418
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,400
 And they are beset by Chinese pirates.

419
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,500
 Which honestly would have to be kind of a badass way to die.

420
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,600
 Being attacked by pirates.

421
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,800
 Even if they were like the nowadays like kind of lame Somalian pirates.

422
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,500
 Just pirates.

423
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,600
 I think it's kind of cool.

424
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,400
 Better than like falling down the stairs, right?

425
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,000
 So anyways, the Chinese pirates end up attacking the governor's ship, looting it.

426
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
 Governor gets killed.

427
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,400
 Huge problem.

428
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,100
 I mean, because the governor basically at that time was the leader of the Philippines.

429
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,800
 The Philippines was still controlled by Spain.

430
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
 So it wasn't just like the governor of California getting attacked by pirates.

431
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 Which again, would be kind of cool.

432
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,900
 But it was the country's leader.

433
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,600
 So huge problem obviously.

434
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,900
 That's an understatement.

435
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,900
 Now, there was a guard in Manila named Gil Perez.

436
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,500
 And obviously everyone was pretty tense.

437
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,600
 Because you just had their leader die.

438
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,700
 They're trying to figure out who the next leader is going to be.

439
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,100
 What the next move is going to be is this going to be a big naval thing.

440
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,900
 They're going to have to find the pirates, so on and so forth.

441
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,600
 And Gil Perez is doing double duty guarding the palace of Manila.

442
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,300
 And according to him, he starts to get a little tired.

443
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,100
 He's just standing there.

444
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,900
 He closes his eyes.

445
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,100
 He sways a little bit.

446
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,900
 He opens them.

447
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,500
 And just people are milling about in the city.

448
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:37,100
 And he goes, "Hmm, this isn't the city that I was just standing in."

449
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:44,100
 Around this time, people like, notice there is a dude in full like regal guard clothes

450
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,500
 standing in front of the Viceroy's Palace in Mexico City.

451
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Now, they have their own guards with totally different uniforms.

452
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,800
 And you have this dude standing there in full uniforms.

453
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,500
 I don't know, they didn't say whether or not he had his weapon with him.

454
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,400
 But he definitely was not dressed like the locals.

455
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
 The guards who see him just standing there, they come to talk to him.

456
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,900
 The townspeople, the citizens of Mexico City are like, "What is going on here?"

457
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,400
 And he says, "Whoa, whoa, where am I?"

458
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,900
 I mean, which is so funny because that would be your first question.

459
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,200
 But to everyone around you who knows exactly where you are, that's the stupidest question possible.

460
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,100
 It's knowing that to get there, you have to go there.

461
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
 So if you just show up and you go, "Where am I?"

462
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
 People are gonna be like, "What are you talking about?

463
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
 You're in Mexico City, of course.

464
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,600
 Where we all are.

465
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,500
 Where we were 10 minutes ago, an hour ago, whatever."

466
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
 So he goes, "Where am I?"

467
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,900
 And they go, "You're in Mexico City.

468
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
 Why are you dressed like that?"

469
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,100
 And he goes, "Oh, I'm...

470
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,700
 Don't know. I'm gone for Paris.

471
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,000
 I don't know how to explain this, but I'm from the Philippines."

472
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,100
 And it's funny, the story, one of the interesting things about the story is

473
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,700
 obviously the people in the Philippines and people in Mexico were both Spanish-speaking.

474
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,000
 But anyways, he goes, "Listen, I'm...

475
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,300
 I don't know how to say this, but I'm a palace guard from the Philippines.

476
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,700
 I was in Manila."

477
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
 And they're like, "What? No, no, no, no, no. That's impossible.

478
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
 It's months away by sea travel.

479
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,600
 Even our fastest boats, even our hydrophobic boats,

480
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,500
 cannot get here in the blink of an eye."

481
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,400
 Like, you just appeared.

482
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
 And he's like, "Hey, listen, man. It's a crazy world.

483
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,600
 I don't know what's going on, but you won't believe this.

484
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,700
 Guess what?

485
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,200
 The governor of Manila got killed last night."

486
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,800
 And they're like, "Okay, now this is super weird,

487
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,000
 because not only are you saying that you just magically appeared here from the Philippines,

488
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,300
 you're telling us that the leader of that country is dead."

489
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,100
 And he's like, "Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

490
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,600
 You have any of that horchuk and I have any..."

491
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,200
 They're like, "Silence! You obviously must have come here by witchcraft,

492
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
 because we believe you.

493
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,200
 You definitely don't look like you're from around here.

494
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,800
 You're not wearing clothes like you're from around here.

495
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,100
 We believe you are from the Philippines,

496
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
 and we don't know whether or not the governor is dead.

497
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,900
 We'll figure that out.

498
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,800
 But we believe you and you must be a witch."

499
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,500
 Now again, we're talking about 1593 here.

500
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,000
 So who do they call?

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,400
 They get the inquisitors.

502
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,700
 They're like, "Hello? Pick up the phone."

503
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,200
 And they call up people.

504
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,100
 They're like torturing witches.

505
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,900
 And they're like, "Yeah, yeah, sure. I'll be right out here.

506
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,400
 Let me burn this person."

507
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,900
 And you can imagine that Gil Perez at this point would be like,

508
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,500
 "Ugh, trying to change his story?

509
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 I was on my way to a costume party, you know?

510
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,100
 I didn't come from the Philippines,

511
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,900
 but because the inquisitors are the type of people

512
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,200
 that you don't want to run into,

513
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,200
 bad guys in movies today are named inquisitors."

514
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,700
 But the inquisitors show up,

515
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,800
 and what's so bizarre is that Gil Perez,

516
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,700
 in the accounts, there's a lot of stuff written about this guy,

517
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,400
 and we're going to get into the interesting stuff behind the story.

518
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
 Gil Perez was considered an ideal soldier.

519
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,700
 He would do whatever.

520
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,100
 And like, he was doing double duty at the palace

521
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,700
 because they were having all of these problems.

522
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,100
 So Gil Perez basically and the inquisitors show up,

523
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,500
 and he's told to go to jail, and he's like,

524
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,900
 "Okay, yeah, sure, I'm fine."

525
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,700
 And they're like, "What? You're not going to resist or nothing?"

526
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,200
 He's like, "No, I'll go to jail. You tell me you go to jail, right?"

527
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,800
 "Yeah, I'll go to jail."

528
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,500
 So he goes to jail, and the inquisitors start interviewing him.

529
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,400
 Basically, like, I don't know if tortures are their first thing,

530
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,000
 but the accounts at the time were saying

531
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,100
 this guy was commanded by the devil from the top to the bottom.

532
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,800
 Like, this has to be a supernatural event.

533
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,100
 Again, everyone believed he came from the Philippines.

534
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,600
 It's just a matter of how he got there.

535
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,700
 So the inquisitors are taking the idea

536
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,300
 that he must be teleported by witchcraft.

537
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,900
 And they're talking to him, and over the course of a few months,

538
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,700
 they're like, "This fellow is such a devout Christian

539
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,600
 and such a nice guy that he may have been teleported by the witches,

540
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,700
 but it wasn't of his own accord."

541
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,400
 And he's like, "Well, thank you, Grand Inquisitors."

542
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
 Like, they actually became friends.

543
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,700
 This guy who got teleported 9,000 nautical miles away,

544
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,200
 and people who burn witches for a living,

545
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,400
 like, were pals.

546
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,100
 They're roommates.

547
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,800
 They're all hanging out together afterwards.

548
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,600
 So he basically, at a certain point, they're like,

549
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,900
 "Well, we're not gonna keep him in jail

550
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
 because he obviously isn't a witch,

551
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,500
 but we don't know what to do with him."

552
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,200
 A ram--

553
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,200
 A couple months later, a couple months after Gil Perez

554
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,300
 magically appeared in Mexico City,

555
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,100
 a boat from Manila docked in Acapulco.

556
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,400
 And the people in Mexico were like,

557
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,500
 "Okay, now we'll know what happened."

558
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,100
 'Cause again, no internet,

559
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,000
 no getting home by 6 p.m. to get a phone call.

560
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,700
 You just had to wait till a boat showed up.

561
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,400
 And when the people in the boat got off,

562
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
 they were immediately questioned,

563
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,500
 not by the Inquisitors, but just by investigators,

564
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,700
 and they go,

565
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,900
 "Is the governor of Philippines dead?"

566
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,800
 And they're like, "How did you know that?"

567
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 Yeah, he died back in October.

568
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,000
 They named the date.

569
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 They named the date October 23rd is when the governor died.

570
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,700
 22nd, 23rd, it was like at night.

571
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,400
 And that was the time that Gil Perez had shown up.

572
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,900
 They said, "Yeah, he was killed by Chinese pirates.

573
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,200
 It was horrible. It was awful.

574
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,100
 He was trying to make moves."

575
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,600
 He got shut down.

576
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,900
 And then someone--

577
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,800
 They basically bring some people from the boat to Gil Perez,

578
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,200
 and they're like, "Do you know this guy?"

579
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,700
 And they're like, "Not only--

580
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
 Okay, this is so weird.

581
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,200
 Not only do I know who that is,

582
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,800
 but I saw him outside the palace

583
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,900
 the day after the president was killed."

584
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,400
 So at that point, Gil Perez was like, "Told ya.

585
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,100
 I told ya."

586
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,200
 And they're like, "We believed you. We totally believed you.

587
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
 You don't need to rub it on her face.

588
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,500
 We just needed verification."

589
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,900
 And Gil's like, "Peace.

590
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,400
 Also, Inquisitors suck."

591
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,600
 And he runs. He gets on the boat.

592
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
 No, they did eventually let him go.

593
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,300
 He went back to the Philippines.

594
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,200
 Unsolved case.

595
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,500
 Now, what's weird about it

596
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,800
 is there is an unusual piece of evidence

597
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,500
 to say that this story is 100% true,

598
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,600
 and then an interesting follow-up piece

599
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,900
 that may show how urban legends are created.

600
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,400
 In 1609--

601
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,700
 So that would have been what?

602
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,400
 Maybe 20 years of roughly 20 years

603
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,100
 after the event--

604
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,900
 the story of Gil Perez.

605
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,500
 A real author. This is a real dude.

606
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,600
 His name was Dr. Antonio D. Morga.

607
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,900
 He wrote a book called "Successes of the Philippine Islands."

608
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,500
 It's considered one of the most important early works,

609
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,300
 like historical works on the Spanish control

610
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,200
 and colonization of the Philippines.

611
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
 So a historical book

612
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
 is not put in flimflam stuff.

613
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,100
 And in that book, in 1609,

614
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,400
 there is a reference to the death of the governor of the Philippines.

615
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,300
 And just as a side note,

616
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,000
 it says, you know, it is weird.

617
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,600
 This is a paraphrase, obviously, but

618
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 as an aside, when he's talking about

619
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,100
 the death of the governor of the Philippines,

620
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,900
 he says, "It is odd that Mexico City

621
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,400
 knew of his death the day it happened."

622
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,800
 And it just goes on to the next sentence.

623
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,000
 Just goes on with the rest of the book.

624
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Now, again, they're separated by 9,000 nautical miles.

625
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,300
 They're in the 16th century.

626
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,600
 It would be impossible

627
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,900
 for Mexico City to know

628
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,000
 the death of a governor in the Philippines.

629
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,500
 It'd be impossible.

630
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,200
 And he puts it in there as an aside.

631
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,400
 Now, maybe he lost the bet and they're like,

632
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,100
 "Hey, Antonio, you got to put one fake fact in your book."

633
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,600
 He's like, "Damn it."

634
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,100
 Or that it really happened.

635
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,100
 I think it's interesting because it's so close to the actual story of it.

636
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,400
 And it's also close enough that

637
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
 if you saw that in a book,

638
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,100
 you could verify it with officials in Mexico City.

639
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,700
 If you saw that and you're like, "What? That's not true."

640
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
 And you take a boat over to Mexico City

641
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,900
 and you go, "Hey, is it true you guys knew about the death of the governor the same day?"

642
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,100
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me tell you a story."

643
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,300
 But he puts it in this historical work

644
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,900
 that somehow Mexico City knew of.

645
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,100
 Names the city too, not just Mexico or the Mexican governor or whatever.

646
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,700
 About a hundred years later, there was another book.

647
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,400
 Again, not a fictional book, not a book about the paranormal.

648
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,300
 It was a historical text by a different author.

649
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:06,100
 And in that book is laid out the base work for the story of Gil Perez.

650
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,900
 So when his book is a historical work on the Philippine Islands,

651
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,700
 he goes, "Here's a weird event.

652
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,900
 This is kind of bizarre."

653
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,100
 But there was this dude named Gil Perez.

654
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,600
 He was a guard at the palace and fades off into nothing.

655
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,400
 Just read the article and you imagine the story I just told.

656
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,100
 So again, historical works are talking.

657
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,600
 One just gives a brief mention of the fact that they knew about it.

658
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
 The second historical text a hundred years later,

659
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,300
 fleshes out the story.

660
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:37,700
 The story that I told you is actually a conglomeration of multiple websites.

661
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,700
 Some of the details are very, very clear and the same.

662
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,300
 I think that some of the details may have been fleshed out after that second book those hundred years,

663
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,100
 but it's possible that the first statement was true.

664
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,200
 That somehow Mexico City knew about the death of the governor the same day.

665
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,600
 And then after a hundred years, you started to see the urban legend of Gil Perez develop.

666
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,000
 So when the later book came out, that was the historical text,

667
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,800
 they had more of this quote-unquote information to fill in, but it was just kind of legend.

668
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,300
 It's also possible that the story is true.

669
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,600
 That there was a guard in Manila who teleported to Mexico City

670
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,800
 and was able to spread the good news that the governor was dead.

671
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 People have said alien abduction.

672
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 People have said one of them was a time traveler,

673
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,600
 got trapped in Mexico City and had to come up with a quick cover story.

674
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,300
 I think that's kind of ridiculous.

675
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,200
 Because why would he be wearing- if he was a time traveler from the future, why is he wearing clothes?

676
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
 Oh, oh!

677
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,800
 They said that maybe he was a time traveler from the future

678
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,200
 who's trying to go to Manila so he's dressed up like one of those dudes,

679
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,400
 but accidentally ended up in Mexico City, which in that case, you're not even really-

680
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,500
 you shouldn't be a- that's when the janitor gets access to the time machine

681
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,700
 and you can't even get your countries right.

682
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,600
 I think if it's true, it's something just-

683
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,300
 I don't want to say mundane, but I don't think it's aliens or anything like that.

684
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,700
 I think a guy just kind of teleported.

685
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,400
 I know that's- that's like the opposite of mundane,

686
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,900
 but I just think that it happened.

687
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,500
 I don't think that aliens like picked him up and dropped him off in the wrong city,

688
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
 which was one of the explanations I saw.

689
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,400
 I think maybe he just went, "Yep."

690
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,500
 and appeared somewhere else.

691
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,200
 Now, that's kind of cool.

692
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,600
 Actually, no, let me back it up.

693
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,200
 I think that story is really cool.

694
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,600
 I think it's one of those stories that makes you think about reality and life

695
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,900
 and the weirdness of the world

696
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,900
 and that someday you could just be walking on the street and then you appear somewhere else.

697
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
 I mean, it's frightening though, too.

698
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,300
 Like, it makes you think of like how much we don't know about the world,

699
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,600
 but it's also intensely frightening.

700
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,700
 Obviously, the first thing you go to is missing people.

701
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,100
 Like, people walking through the woods disappear-

702
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,200
 appearing in other parts of the world.

703
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,600
 But then you go, "How come the hiker walking through the woods in Oregon

704
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,800
 doesn't magically appear in a swap meet in Taipei?"

705
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,700
 Or a woman backpacking through Sweden doesn't appear in Mongolia.

706
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,000
 Well, the thing is, is that when you think about it,

707
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,900
 if you can just be standing there and teleport somewhere else,

708
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,600
 Gil Perez was incredibly lucky because most of the world is uncivilized

709
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,400
 and two-thirds of it are underwater.

710
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,800
 Deep, deep underwater.

711
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:25,600
 It's one thing to have a nice, fanciful story that can be kind of backed up on historical documents.

712
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,400
 Of a guard who closed his eyes for a brief second

713
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,900
 and appeared in the middle of a bustling metropolis.

714
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,900
 It's a completely more horrifying story

715
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,800
 that you're sitting in your apartment,

716
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,300
 you're at your workplace,

717
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,800
 you're walking to class,

718
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,800
 and the next thing you know you're in a dark jungle,

719
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,800
 in a foreign land where nobody likes you,

720
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 or 20,000 leagues under the sea.

721
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,300
 Because when it comes to teleportation, it's not where you're from.

722
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,300
 It's where you're going.

723
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,100
