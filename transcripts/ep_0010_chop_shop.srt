1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 The conspiracy between the meteoro- how do you say that?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,500
 Meteoric, meteoric rise of Lady Gaga and her mediocre downfall.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
 We find out the truth behind that.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
 Even though I botched that opening, I think I'm gonna keep going.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
 Mars makes Earth look like a little punk.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 And we look into the odd world of the trans-abled today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Welcome everyone to Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It's once again, it's like 91 degrees.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 It's 11.30 at night and now I know I sound like a whiner because I'm sure people are listening to-

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Actually, I'm looking at the stats. There are people all over the world listening to this show.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I shouldn't say all over the world, but more countries in America.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So that's awesome. Thank you guys and gals.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And I'm sure it's a lot hotter in other places, but man, maybe you have fans.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I don't have fans because I have to record this show.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 So, I was thinking about this today.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I recently, let's say, back in April, I had quit taking nicotine.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And there's a particular reason why.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Now, for one, it's very expensive. That was kind of the prime reason.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But it raises your blood pressure too.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Nicotine is a natural constrictor of your capillaries.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So it raises your blood pressure.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Now, as a 41-year-old man, sometimes that can be difficult.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 If you know what I mean.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Erections.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So, that's funny because when I think about being like, "Oh man, I need some more nicotine. I should start chewing again."

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I'm thinking, "Oh dude, but you know it's not going to be good for you. It's not going to be good for you.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It's going to cause problems."

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It didn't cause problems when I was younger.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I don't think any young man has really an erection issue.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 But I remember once, now I personally have a thing where I don't sleep in public.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I hate sleeping in public. I just feel super vulnerable.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I used to take the bus everywhere.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I used to be out and about a lot.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I hated sleeping in public.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Well, one day I had a doctor's appointment.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It was right across. It was right around the house.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 It was right around the corner from my apartment.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And I had a doctor's appointment. It had something to do with my back.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I really didn't want to go. I was super tired. The appointment was like 9 in the morning.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So, I get up and I'm just like, throwing a shirt.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I was wearing like some sweatpants.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I think I probably just had some flip flops on.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And I walk around the corner. I go sit in this dentist's office.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And I'm just exhausted.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I'm absolutely exhausted. It's 9 in the morning and I'm dead tired.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And so that's what life is generally like when you're 25.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 You're just tired because you're up all night.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So anyways, I fall asleep in the dentist's office.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Which I'm in the doctor's waiting room, which again is something I don't normally do,

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 but I figured I'm in a waiting room.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 What did the problem be?

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Like, really, if someone wants to stab me in the neck, at least I'm in the doctor's office, right?

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 He can patch me up.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So anyways, fall asleep.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Deep sleep. Deep, deep sleep.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And I remember, so I'm sitting in the doctor's waiting room.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 So it's like I have my back to the wall. I'm sitting on this row of chairs.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And when I fall asleep, there's no one else in the waiting room.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 When I wake up, sitting across from me is a woman probably a little bit older than I was at the time.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 She looked like she had seen some of HP Lovecraft's greatest horrors just spread out among the world.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 She looked like she was watching the rape of the universe in front of her.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 The look on her face was completely horrified.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 There was a man sitting next to her who had a kind of a different expression,

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 maybe a little bit mused, a little bit curious to how this event was going to play out.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 So I wake up and I see her face first and I kind of look at the man.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And then for whatever reason, I figured something told me to look down.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Huge boner, huge boner sticking up through, not through the sweatpants,

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 but pressed against the sweatpants.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Now I had the advantage of one being young, two being like morning wood.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 So it's like the super hard thing you get in the morning.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And two, I didn't know what to do in the situation.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I simply just kind of like, pretended that it wasn't there.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I kind of just like sat up straight.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I wasn't trying to like touch it and kind of maneuver it and hide it.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 It just kind of went away on its own, but I mean relatively slowly.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I might have read a magazine or something like that.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I pick up, end up picking up people magazine.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It's like pictures of Brandy Spears, but no, I mean, so what do you do in that situation?

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And here's the thing, you get boners like that when you're young all the time.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And when you're healthy all the time, because you get older and you're not healthy,

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 it's not, it's not, you know, it may not be kicking in.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 You know, you may not be getting those instant boners like you were getting when you were younger.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 So that, and now I do because I quit nicotine.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Like it's actually brought me back to that level.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I'd been chewing and then I switched the nicotine tablets for about 15 years.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Maybe a little bit longer.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And now it's just like, I'm back to normal.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 So I, so take that little story.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I think you guys should, if you're using nicotine, now's probably a good time to stop.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Despite like the money thing and despite the cancer thing and all of that, it just hurts your boner.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And that's the bad thing.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 That's a bad thing.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 That being said, it's super hot in here.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And let's see, I'm trying to think of a segue.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Okay, let's go from the boner, what's boner plus hot equal?

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Lady Gaga.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I mean, to some people, I actually like Lady Gaga when she first came out and that plays a big part in this conspiracy we're going to be talking about.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And the reason why I wanted, people ask me, so what can, you know, because I'm always kind of like, oh, the resistance of light, it's garbage and this conspiracy is garbage.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And people will ask me, you do a conspiracy podcast, so what conspiracies do you actually believe in?

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Do you just poo poo?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 There are conspiracy theories that I believe in.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 This is one of them.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 This is one of them.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Now it may be, you could probably sit and sit me down and show me a bunch of facts and go, what you believe is absolutely flat out not true.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But this is a conspiracy theory that I heard about, you know, a couple years ago and it just tracks incredibly well for me.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I do believe it.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So let's just go ahead and jump in.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So what happened was years and years and years and years ago, I know that's not very specific, but there were two singers, Lena Morgan and Stefani Germano.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Germano.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And they were both trying to get record deals.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 They were actually both had record deals at the time.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 They're both nobodies.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 But Lena Morgan, Lena Morgana was actually the bigger of the two.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And Stefani was kind of like a co-writer, kind of like a backup singer.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And Stefani came from a very, very rich family.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 She went to the same school as Nikki Hilton.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 She kind of had a blessed life and Lena really like struggled growing up.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 She was raised by a single mother and she was finally breaking into show business.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And Lena also had an odd habit.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 She would dance on rooftops, which I mean, I guess in New York City, it's kind of a romantic idea, you know, dancing on a rooftop.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 She's totally free.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 You're like a bird and all of that stuff.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Well, Lena had her songs, she had her look, she had her entire personality.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And Stefani was just kind of a piano player and piano playing musician, kind of like almost like a jewel type.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And Lena was just cranking out these great songs.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 There's videos of her.

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 She just had this really unique look.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And what we started to see was Stefani, Stefani.

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Stefani was kind of starting to crib her style a bit.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Well, what happens is one day, Lena takes a 10 story dive off of a building, dies.

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Some people say she killed herself.

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Some people say that it was an accident.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 She was dancing and she fell off accidentally.

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 But what's interesting, so she is 19 years old, singer-songwriter.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 She has this record deal.

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 She's doing music videos.

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Even if we say she kills herself, the news is kind of swept under the rug.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's not necessarily like banned, but it's not trumpeted.

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Now we see like when young people kill themselves or when these tragic things happen,

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 even if it's kind of a quote-unquote nobody, you still hear about it.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 They're like, so and so, this rising star, this YouTube personality, or this or that.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 You don't have to be super famous because tragedy works well in the news.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 So this 19 year old girl, she either kills herself as she falls off a building on accident.

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It's kind of like a story that people tend to hear about because it's so tragic.

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But it kind of gets swept under the rug.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Her Wikipedia page, which she had one because again, she wasn't like a nobody.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 She was a rising star.

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Her Wikipedia page disappears.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And Lady Gaga is born.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Now Lady Gaga is the stage name for Stefani Germano.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Germanato.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 However it is.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And she took the look.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 She took a lot of the looks of Alina.

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 She took that kind of fashionable attitude, which Stefani hadn't had before.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 But see, that's all to me hearsay.

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I mean, that's all, you know, circumstantial.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And this is circumstantial too, but this is what I find fascinating.

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So Lady Gaga released the album called The Fame.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And it was 10 songs and I'd say, I liked that album.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And I'd say five of them were just like instant classics.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Like five of them you listen to and you're like, well, these are these are great songs.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And like Just Dance is a great song, Paparazzi.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I think Alejandro was on that album.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Poker Face.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 These songs were very, very different than what we were hearing on the radio.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And that's and the fame was just this explosive album.

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It kind of changed, started changing pot music for that time period.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And then Lady Gaga released The Fame Monster, which was only like a five or six song EP.

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And now you buy them as one album.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Now it's called The Fame Monster and it's The Fame and the second EP put onto one album.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But that summer they were released separately because they released The Fame.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 It was such a huge hit.

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They released the EP.

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And I remember reading the interview and they asked Lady Gaga,

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 so why are you just releasing these five or six songs?

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Why aren't you releasing a whole album?

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 If you have these songs ready to go, I'm sure you have other ones.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And Lady Gaga goes, well, these are the songs that I wanted to write.

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And everyone's like, okay.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Then and the songs were again, The Fame Monster was huge too.

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 That's where you had Bad Romance.

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Alejandro may have been on The Fame Monster, but now here's the weird thing.

185
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So the theory is that Lady Gaga not only killed or had Lena killed.

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I guess I should have gotten to that.

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So the theory is that Lady Gaga had Lena killed or killed her herself, pushed her off the building.

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And you can say part of the theory is that she did it because to join the Illuminati

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 and it's part of the satanic worship of the music industry.

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I think a more logical thing is this woman was a better looking, better talented songwriter

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 who had a unique visual style and she was taken out of the game and Lady Gaga took all of that stuff.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And I think that those first two albums, The Fame and The Fame Monster wore Lena's songs

193
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 because Lady Gaga has never come close to putting together anything that's not only

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 stylistically close to those first two albums, but quality wise, it took a severe downturn.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So imagine if you stole someone's songs and you're like, oh, they wrote 15 songs or whatever.

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 You stole them and then you record them, but then it's time for you to write your own stuff.

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Well, the next big song she wrote was Stolen as Well and that was Born This Way,

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 which is actually a cribs a lot from Express Yourself by Madonna.

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 But everything, Edge of Glory, Born This Way, applause, all these other albums and all these other singles

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 that have come out since, they're completely forgettable.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 She's belting these big songs. She becomes a big power singer, which she wasn't on the first two albums.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Now she sounds like everyone else and she does a terrible job at it.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 The first two albums was this very unique songwriting style, very unique sound style.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 So one of the conspiracies, I believe, is Lena was not killed on accident.

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 There's three possibilities. One, she was killed on accident and someone said,

206
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 "Well, we've invested all this money in her. Let's take this whole thing and give it to Lady Gaga."

207
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 That's possible.

208
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Two, that someone had her killed to facilitate that move or three that Lady Gaga had killed her herself.

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I mean, the fourth one is that it just happened and it was no big deal.

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 But see, here's my thing. It's not the crime, it's the cover-up.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 If they reported in the newspaper that this young woman died and that was kind of a known story,

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 if the Wikipedia page was still around, if in interviews, Lady Gaga said,

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 "Yeah, it was really hard when I was just starting off with the music.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 My best friend, one of my co-songwriters, killed herself and I've always carried that with me."

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Because we see rappers. M&M's like, "Yeah, man. Proofs to death still haunts me to this day."

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Puff Daddy's like, "Oh man, I can't, you know, notorious B.I.G."

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And Puff Daddy's been theorized to be part of that whole killin' Tupac

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 and then Biggie being killed and responsive like that.

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And it wasn't covered up. You know, it's not like Puff Daddy or P. Diddy or Diddy, whatever.

220
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 He doesn't talk about it, he talks about it.

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So why isn't Lady Gaga, these is what we know for a fact.

222
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 They worked co-songwriters, they knew each other, they hung out together, they worked on projects together.

223
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 That is 100%. So why isn't she addressing it?

224
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Not saying, "For the 800th time I didn't kill anyone."

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Just being like, you know, she should have been like, "Yeah, you know, I lost a friend of mine and she never talks about it."

226
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So I think that that's a logical thing.

227
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 I think those first two albums were not written by Lady Gaga.

228
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Maybe she wrote Magic Stick or something.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 One of the trashier, dumber songs on that album.

230
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Because it's just the quality-wise is so different.

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And I know Metallica has different quality, but they spread out among, you know,

232
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 like the first six Metallica albums were great and then actually like, load and reload.

233
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But anyways, my point being, so that is one of the conspiracy theories that I actually believe in, because people do ask me that.

234
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 The second question, second thing I wanted to talk about, man, and that took a lot of time.

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 So let me see which story you'd be more interested in.

236
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I think I'm going to save the Mars story for tomorrow, because I think this story is interesting.

237
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So you may have heard of Trans-Abled.

238
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 These are people who feel like they're not born into the right body.

239
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Now you've heard that with people who are transgendered and transsexual.

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 But these, there's a group of people who believe that I, and I came across this years and years ago, I thought it was fascinating.

241
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I still think it's fascinating, but not in a good way.

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So basically they go, you know what, my body, I look at my body and my left leg should be amputated two inches above the knee.

243
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 When I look at my leg, that's not the right thing.

244
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And so for years, this was actually a relatively small paraffilia.

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 This was a very, it's basically a fetish, and we'll get into that in this article.

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 But it was a very small minority, and as the internet has grown, because when I first read about this,

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 it was actually probably back in like '99, like the internet, maybe 2000, the internet was still growing.

248
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And so you were able to track it, like the number of cases has gone up as more people in the internet can start communicating to each other.

249
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 So here's a quote from this article, I'll post a link in the description.

250
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 "A body modifier has exclusively revealed how his extra limbs feel alien,

251
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 and has resorted to the drastic measure of self-medilation because he actually wants to be disabled."

252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Now, let's see.

253
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So here, this is insane.

254
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 This is a body, B-I-I-D sufferer is what they, so I think it's body identification, something, something.

255
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Oh yeah, body integrity and identity disorder.

256
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 So that's the technical name for it.

257
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So here's what he says, "I have been experimenting with crippling my toes for a few years,

258
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 breaking, freezing, and smashing them.

259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I broke my big toe last May after binding it a lot with a bandage, then hitting it with a hammer.

260
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I never let it heal, and by July I had to go to the hospital because the pain was unbearable."

261
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 How, and then it's, the article goes, "However not to be disquaded, Howard's set to work on his second toe."

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Then he says, "I froze it twice with keyboard cleaner and crushed it with a vise before,

263
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 additionally dislocating it.

264
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 The pain is part of the process, and now I'm working on my third toe.

265
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I'm bent at an angle where the others used to be."

266
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Brutal, brutal, brutal.

267
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And then he goes, "Hey, his goal is he goes,

268
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 'What I really want is to lose my left leg high above my knees.'"

269
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So they have this weird fascination.

270
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Now, people, people say, you know, maybe they're born this way, maybe it's default,

271
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 but the reason why I think it can be classified as a fetish or a paraffilia is something like this.

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Now, I understand this is just one person and his experience,

273
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 but I think this can be connected to a lot of other stuff like feticism and kind of the damaging fetishes.

274
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So the next paragraph asks about the conditions cause.

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 He replies, "I believe I've always had B.I.I.D., but I do remember a trigger.

276
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I was around 10 when I saw an old Vincent Price movie, which showed a guy who lost all his limbs one by one,

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 and I thought, 'How fascinating.'"

278
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So we know that that's how fetishes develop.

279
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 You're 10, you're 12, you're basically starting to, you know, six or whatever,

280
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 you're basically starting to put together kind of an idea of pleasure and sexual feelings and identity,

281
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 and that's when the little girl at school keeps throwing her hair in your face,

282
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 just to be like a little dork.

283
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 She's like, "Hey, look at my hair, look at my hair, look at my hair. Ooh."

284
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And then you develop a hair fetish because you start to develop, you start to,

285
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 you start to feel these feelings that you don't have any sense of context with,

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 and you're thinking, "Well, it could just be the pretty girl,

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 but your brain starts to make the connection. It's the hair, it's the hair."

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And so people develop foot fetishes because when they're starting off going through the,

289
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 when they're having these feelings when they're young, they see women in really hot shoes

290
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 and their body goes, "Ooh."

291
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And that's how that is put together.

292
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I did a little stand-up and touched my chest like I was clutching my pearls.

293
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You're going to see that, but you understand the concept.

294
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 So a young person is starting to become sexually aware,

295
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 but they don't really know how to describe those chemicals.

296
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And the net latch on now, obviously 99% of people, when they're first starting to become attracted to the opposite sex,

297
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 they'll see them wearing high heels or girls will see guys in tank tops.

298
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 That doesn't necessarily cause the fetish.

299
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It has to be reinforced over time, or it has to be something so particularly odd like this

300
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 that you can't really replicate it.

301
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 So he's watching this movie and for whatever reason, it kind of triggered that chemical reaction.

302
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Now, hair fetish, foot fetish, stuff like that, those are harmless.

303
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Being spanked, that's very common because you're being spanked and you don't understand why you're liking it.

304
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But anyways, that's very common and very harmless.

305
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Most men have a breast fetish or a butt fetish.

306
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And it's the same thing.

307
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 It's the same thing.

308
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 You go back and they'll talk about their early attractions.

309
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 They'll be like, "Oh yeah, I was Mrs. Dinkins and she had a big butt or whatever."

310
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 But no one's smashing their toes open except for this small group of sufferers.

311
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Now, here's the thing.

312
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Like I said, I came across this years and a decade or two ago at that point.

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 The thing is, is that at this point, and people generally, they'll shoot themselves in the hand

314
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 and they'll go to the doctor and be like, "Oh, you're going to have to cut my arm off because my hand's blowing up."

315
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 But at this point, we're getting to, and before doctors were like completely against it, helping out.

316
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 But now we're getting to a point as a society where doctors are debating whether or not they should healthily remove like,

317
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 "Well, it's better for us to do it in an operating center for them to do it in, you know, by themselves."

318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Like, let's try to help them with this.

319
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 So, you know, that's not, that's, we can't do that.

320
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 There's a certain point where as a society, we have to say you can't remove your arm.

321
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 You can't remove your leg.

322
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 You know, that's not, that's not healthy.

323
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 And for a whole host of reasons.

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 You can say sexual, you know, gender, transsexual operation is the same thing as removing a glimpse, and I can see that to a point.

325
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 But I think there's a huge difference between removing your, you know, your penis and removing your leg.

326
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 One is that you're going to be dependent on others for the rest of your life.

327
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 It's going to, you're going to have economic problems.

328
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 There's that one woman who a doctor injected bleach into her eyes because she should have been born blind.

329
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You know, someone wants to get their dick chopped off.

330
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Whatever.

331
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 I'm not going to have a problem with that.

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Someone's blind.

333
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Someone wants to make themselves blind because of some fetish they have.

334
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 You know, I, I, I'm sure someone could go, "What's the difference? What's the difference?"

335
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 But I think that it's pretty obvious what the difference is.

336
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 One, this person, a blind person is really pretty much going to become a ward of the state for the rest of their life.

337
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 They're going to be on unemployment. They're going to, I mean, from a strictly financial level.

338
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It's a terrible idea.

339
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Two, here's another thing.

340
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 There are people who accidentally get blinded, who are born blind, and then you're going to have these fakers show up.

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I guess that's kind of like a guy, a transsexual, turning into a woman.

342
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I don't know. I don't know.

343
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I don't know. Maybe it is the same. I don't know.

344
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But if someone came to me and said, "Hey, man, I think I'm a woman and I'm going to have transsexual surgery,"

345
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I'd be like, "Oh, yeah, it's fine. I mean, whatever. You do you, dude."

346
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Or, "Ma'am."

347
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But if somebody came to me and said, "I want to have my left arm chopped off,"

348
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 No. No. I, I, I, I, you know, I don't know. I would talk them out of that.

349
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 But it's in it, now that I'm kind of saying it out loud, it is an interesting, it is an interesting argument

350
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 because I think the argument that I make in against trans-abled people could be made against people who want to become transsexuals.

351
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And why is one different than the other?

352
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 You know what? I'm going to, I think, I don't think I can come up with an answer for that.

353
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I think, I don't know. I don't know.

354
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 I have a lot of transgendered friends. I don't think I know anyone who's actually transsexual.

355
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And the difference is transsexuals where they have the surgery.

356
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 So I don't know. I will, well, let's see what you guys think about that.

357
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 See what, see, if, if they are the same, should we treat them the same? Like, am I off basis?

358
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Should we allow people to get their arms cut off?

359
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I don't know. No, you know what? I, no. You shouldn't allow people to get their arms chopped off or chop off major limbs.

360
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Because next thing you know, they'll be like, "I'm not supposed to have a stomach. I'm supposed to have a fishbowl in my body."

361
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 So we gotta, we gotta draw the line somewhere. You're going to have your dick cut off, whatever.

362
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 You can't get your arms chopped off. And you can't fucking break your toes.

363
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 That's the first time I've, like, actually said the F word on the show, but...

364
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 You can't break your toes with a hammer, bro. That's, that's gross and that's super painful.

365
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And you're causing some serious damage. And the only reason you're doing this is because you watched a Vincent, Vincent Price movie.

366
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 So I, so, yeah, no, we can't, you just can't allow this. You can't allow this.

367
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 That might sound like super controlling, but...

368
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Yeah. Can't chop your limbs off, bro. I can't believe that I have to say that.

369
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 But don't, so what did we learn today?

370
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Don't use nicotine, because your bone or it won't work.

371
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Two, Lady Gaga's mediocre now. I used to like her, but she sucks. And I think she's murderer.

372
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And three, don't chop off any body parts.

373
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Unless it's your dick. I don't know. I don't know.

374
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Just don't, don't, don't smash your toes with a hammer. I mean, I think that's the least that I have to worry about.

375
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I'm sure I'll get some hate mail, but I was gonna, again, get some hate mail eventually.

376
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I'm gonna go ahead and end this now.

377
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And turn this fan on and probably edit out half of it.

378
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 But maybe not. Maybe I'll just let it stand, because I think that's just part of the conversation.

379
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 My name is Jason Carpenter, and...

380
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Let's try that again. So my name is Jason Carpenter. Thanks for listening to Dead Rabbit Radio.

381
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 We will be back tomorrow. Have a great day. I don't know. I still don't have an...

382
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 What's that thing called? An outro. So, goodbye.

383
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:24,000
