1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
 An utterly mind-boggling, bizarre conspiracy that may have international implications.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,800
 What happens when a man only sees half of humanity?

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,080
 And then we meet a young woman and her son at home during a rainy day.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,080
 As they stare out the window and watch nature rain down upon the world, they see something

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,960
 true unexplainable.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:42,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,720
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun, whatever you guys are up to.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,800
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters coming into Dead

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
 Rabbit Command right now.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,080
 It's Corbin's channel, everyone give a round of applause to good ol Corbin walking into

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
 Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,040
 Corbin's, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,640
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,800
 Just helps spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,160
 Now Corbin's, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy and we're

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:20,040
 gonna take a nice, long drive out to Arizona, the sunniest state in the world.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,800
 I don't, don't look that up, I don't know if that's a fact.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,440
 I didn't research that but, bah bah.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,520
 Corbin's channel is driving us on out there.

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,800
 There are a few times in life where I'm dumbstruck, where I truly am kind of at a loss for words

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,080
 for what I'm, the situation I'm in.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,580
 It's rare.

26
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,800
 And when it happens, people around me go, "Whoa, seriously Jason, you have nothing to

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 say about what's going on?"

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,080
 I remember back in 2019, there was a karaoke bar, this is pre-pandemic obviously, we're

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,160
 at a karaoke bar and I'm up, I'm doing the Humpty Dance, I'm not, I'm not singing the

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,920
 song, I'm just doing the dances other people are singing tonight, Wayne.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,800
 I'm doing my stuff, I'm there with my brother and his fiance and I'm there with Sabine and

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,240
 we're at this local karaoke bar.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,000
 And all these songs are being sung and then this guy gets up on stage and he adjusts the

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,360
 mic.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:30,840
 There's this instrumental playing and he goes, "The flames of the castle grew forward, the

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,640
 soldiers readied their arms, they moved past the black chasm towards the great cliffs of

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,400
 glover," whatever and I'm sitting there and he's just like, "And then the great eagles

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,880
 flew down and they clashed with the dragons, blood rained down on the pe- and I'm like,

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,840
 looking around and no one is reacting to what's going on.

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:03,240
 When the mighty man held his axe high above his head, he cleaved open an o- I was dumbstruck

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,120
 and I go, "What is going on?

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
 What?

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,040
 What is- why is no one else reacting to the fact that this guy is reading a fantasy novel

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:21,800
 memorized by the way, set to 9 minutes of orchestral music and not like Beethoven, it's like that

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,880
 free audio music you can get if you just typed in fantasy noises into YouTube.

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,560
 But he's reading this novel on stage and everyone else is completely ignoring the fact that

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,520
 he's spoiling Game of Thrones.

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,160
 And I sat there and I would look at him for a second as he would talk about this elf

49
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,280
 lord beating another man with like a mace and then I would look back at my table and

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,720
 I'm like, "Are you guys not puzzled by this?"

51
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,720
 And they're like, "Yeah, he's probably just reading a book.

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,920
 I can't do it at home.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,880
 This is a karaoke bar.

54
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,200
 9 minutes."

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,280
 To this day I'm still dumbstruck and Sabine says that was the very first time and really

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,240
 the last time she seen me at a loss for words.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,760
 Cause I just had no idea what was going on.

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,240
 I halfway expected him to end it by yelling out the Zaw and pulling out a sword and cleaving

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,920
 half of the audience in half.

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,080
 That may have been the first time she's seen me dumbstruck, now it's the last time she's

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,240
 seen me dumbstruck, but she didn't see me while I was reading this conspiracy theory

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,000
 I'm about to tell you.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:49,320
 There's a subreddit, there's a subreddit called Conspiracy Fact.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,600
 These guys are way too cool for your lame conspiracy theories.

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,440
 This is when you have substantial evidence to back it up.

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,400
 So I want to say this is where this is coming from.

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,920
 This is not a conspiracy theory according to the weirdos of Reddit.

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,120
 This is a conspiracy fact.

69
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,360
 There's a guy called the real USS Kelvin.

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,840
 Kelvin is a Star Trek reference.

71
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
 So I can appreciate that.

72
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,720
 That is the only thing that makes sense for the rest of this segment.

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:27,000
 In 1997 Arizona there was a state law that amended ARS 12-604.1.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,140
 And that was Buckland guys cause it gets a little rough from here on out.

75
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,520
 That law basically, the amended law now says that sex with a minor under the age of 12

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,640
 could get you life in prison.

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,040
 But the way laws are written is there are subsections and there are subsections of subsections

78
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,720
 and you create this weird swamp of words.

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,100
 So every so often a loophole gets created and because of this there's a weird loophole

80
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:57,320
 so if you had attempted sexual contact between the ages of 12 and 14 it was 10 years in prison

81
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,660
 but attempted sexual contact under the age of 12 was 3 years in prison.

82
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
 And they didn't mean to do it.

83
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,380
 They didn't mean to make it so if it was under the age of 12 it was less of a penalty than

84
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,380
 12-14.

85
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,580
 It was just this weird, it was like a period was in the wrong place.

86
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,580
 Something went wrong.

87
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
 There was a loophole.

88
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:22,300
 In 2002 Arizona, Joseph Don Rosenbaum, 18 year old man living at a friend's house, sexually

89
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,080
 abused 5 boys between the ages of 9 and 11.

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,720
 5 of them.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,000
 He got a total of 10 years for that.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,600
 And he served like 12.5.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,800
 Something else happened and he had to serve some extra time but he basically did 12 years

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,240
 in prison for, he should have been in prison for life.

95
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,560
 But because of this weird loophole he got through.

96
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,520
 It was actually in line with the sentencing guidelines.

97
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,000
 So that's not a conspiracy theory.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It's injustice.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,220
 And that does happen and we do see, and they fixed it.

100
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,620
 They have fixed it in 2008.

101
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
 So what?

102
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,260
 It only took them 11 years to fix the guideline.

103
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,900
 But this is where the conspiracy theory starts.

104
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,060
 And buckle in here guys.

105
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,620
 Kenosha, Wisconsin, 2020.

106
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,420
 And I know not everyone knows about American history or American current events, but Kenosha,

107
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,820
 Wisconsin, 2020 you had the Black Lives Matter protest going on in the city.

108
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,360
 And there was this dude named Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17 year old from Antioch, Illinois, came

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,440
 to Kenosha, Wisconsin.

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
 And he's patrolling the streets.

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
 Now this is where it starts.

112
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
 I know a lot of people are like, "Oh no.

113
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,600
 Oh no, Jason, where are you going with this?"

114
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,080
 Hold on, I understand.

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,440
 Corbin's channel is sweating as he's navigating the Jason's lobby through a field of political

116
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
 landmines.

117
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,620
 Here's the thing.

118
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,020
 Kyle Rittenhouse goes, "I was just going there to defend property."

119
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,820
 The prosecutors, because he's on trial, or gonna be on trial soon, says, "No, he came

120
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,980
 here with more ill intent.

121
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,660
 We can't judge that, and we're not going to judge that.

122
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,060
 That's a trial that's going on."

123
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,820
 But what we do know is that events leading up to this situation are, again, also very

124
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,820
 hazy.

125
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,580
 Kyle, and when I say hazy, I mean, I'm sure my YouTube comments are gonna be full of

126
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,580
 stuff.

127
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
 That's fine.

128
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,280
 But that is nothing really, that doesn't have anything.

129
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,480
 Let me just get to the conspiracy theory, okay?

130
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,280
 Before you type over your comment.

131
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,800
 The conspiracy theory is Kyle Rittenhouse, this happened, this part happened.

132
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,640
 Kyle Rittenhouse shoots three men in the street of Kenosha, Wisconsin.

133
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,680
 He wounds a guy named Gage Grosskritts, a 26-year-old dude, and then he kills two people, Anthony

134
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,840
 Huber, 26, and Joseph Don Rosenbaum, 36.

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,700
 It's the same guy who was successfully prosecuted, he did commit the crime in Arizona, he's

136
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,140
 then shot 18 years later in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

137
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,660
 Here's the conspiracy theory according to the real USS Kelvin.

138
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,940
 I read this and I just kind of sat there for a second and I go, "My brain is like,

139
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,900
 "Dude, it's like shutting down."

140
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,100
 It was all a setup.

141
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,820
 So what happened was, he actually has three possible men.

142
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
 All three possible theories.

143
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,160
 We'll start off with the, none of them are such a logical one, they're all super dumb.

144
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,520
 But one of them was that his dad was a lawyer, Joseph Rosenbaum's dad was a lawyer.

145
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,040
 Once his own son was able to do these horrible things and his lawyer son got off, everyone

146
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,880
 was like, "Oh, I bet you that the lawyer's messed with the system."

147
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,880
 He planned this, his dad's like, "Oh, I know my son's a big old pervo, so I'm going to

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,520
 go out and I'm going to change the law."

149
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,300
 So it will get him off.

150
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,820
 And because of that, the government of Arizona goes, "We have to kill this dude to cover

151
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,340
 up a crime from 1997 that we fixed in 2008.

152
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,340
 We have to kill this guy."

153
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,940
 So do that.

154
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,020
 Send someone out there to go kill him in the year 2020.

155
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,980
 That's conspiracy theory number one.

156
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,940
 To be fair, the real USS Kelvin, after he states that conspiracy theory, says, "I can't

157
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,440
 prove that his dad was a lawyer."

158
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,880
 Why is it a theory then?

159
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,760
 We don't even know if that's true.

160
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,280
 So we can, that one's obviously fake.

161
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,360
 That one's obviously fake.

162
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,360
 The second one is that in Arizona, there's a bunch of vigilantes who saw this miscarriage

163
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,860
 of justice and they go, "We must rectify things."

164
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,020
 This guy did this horrible crime and us, us vigilantes, we have to do something about

165
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,020
 it, but we're also super slow vigilantes.

166
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,580
 They're called the turtle force.

167
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,980
 And they go, "We wait 18 years.

168
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,500
 They'll never see it coming.

169
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,020
 If we wait 18 years after their horrible crime, they'll be like hanging out at home, hanging

170
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,380
 out with their kids.

171
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,780
 Maybe they've even changed as a person even though they've done something horrible."

172
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,980
 But it doesn't matter.

173
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,760
 18 years later to the day we're going to pop up, we're going to come out of our turtle

174
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,560
 shells and we're going to shoot them and we're slowly going to leave the scene of the crime.

175
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,840
 We get caught almost every time.

176
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:22,520
 Now the idea is that Arizona vigilantes set this up to kill Joseph Rosenbaum at the Kenosha,

177
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,640
 Wisconsin protest.

178
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,680
 Or here's another one that he throws out because, I mean if you're just saying insane stuff,

179
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 just keep going.

180
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,780
 So real USS Kelvin says, or it could be that you had another government, say Russia or

181
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,300
 China, who said, "You know what would be perfect?

182
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
 Wait 18 years."

183
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,660
 That's always the key, right?

184
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,500
 Wait 18 years.

185
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,740
 And then we shoot a lawyer son.

186
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,860
 The other government officials are like, "Are you sure he's a lawyer son?"

187
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
 And I'm like, "I don't know.

188
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,140
 I read that on Reddit that he's a lawyer son."

189
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,060
 We shoot this guy on the street and then that will expose the loophole.

190
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
 Who was this guy?

191
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,480
 And they'll research him and they'll find out there was a loophole in Arizona law and

192
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,680
 then it will make the whole system come tumbling down.

193
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,520
 So Vlad, why don't you send some of your guys down there?

194
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,560
 We hear the turtle forces are on their way.

195
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
 They're super slow.

196
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,200
 An international agent did this.

197
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,160
 What I find so bizarre about this conspiracy theory is it involves so many different threads.

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,720
 And we watch conspiracy theories all the time.

199
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 Earth is flat.

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,140
 So then you need a boogeyman, right?

201
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,300
 Who's telling us the earth is flat?

202
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,860
 It's NASA, so NASA's controlled by Satan.

203
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
 That's real.

204
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,660
 If you get to the flat earth argument, that's what it comes down to.

205
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,820
 NASA's controlled by Satan or Dark forces, Illuminati, whatever.

206
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:49,300
 This one, even if we accepted it, that Joseph Rosenbaum was assassinated by a group, just

207
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,820
 let's pull on that thread a second here.

208
00:12:51,820 --> 00:13:04,340
 Would that mean that the entire protest was organized by the Arizona vigilantes?

209
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:10,400
 Or did they wait for the right set of circumstances to show up?

210
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,800
 This is a conspiracy theory that handles- I did an episode recently about whether or

211
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,040
 not impossible foods had fetal meat in it.

212
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,940
 When it doesn't, I was able to prove it.

213
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,780
 So impossible food lawyers do not sue me, even though I referenced that again.

214
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,540
 But this one, I'm just- I don't understand the logic behind it.

215
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,640
 I'm completely- I can understand the fact that someone's looking at these connections

216
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,100
 and going, "This guy was killed here, and he did this horrible crime back here, and

217
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,540
 it was connected to this loophole."

218
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,360
 But how do you build an international conspiracy theory out of that?

219
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,280
 And think about it, long time listeners of this show know I love to pull on conspiracy

220
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,640
 theories and try to- I can't even put a conspiracy cap on for this one, honestly.

221
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,200
 Because if I did, you would have to say the entire protest was manufactured to facilitate

222
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,360
 this murder.

223
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,240
 Everything was set up just so the vigilantes could get to this guy.

224
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,860
 And in the real world, people get assassinated all the time.

225
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,180
 All the time, right?

226
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,020
 There's probably a red dot on my head right now.

227
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,060
 Get assassinated all the time.

228
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,780
 You run them over with a car, or you poison them.

229
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,260
 You don't just kinda go, "Well, I hope America has a really, really bad summer, and I hope

230
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:41,180
 there's a ton of protests across the country, and I hope that racial tensions are inflamed,

231
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,040
 and then maybe the guy we want dead will die?"

232
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,680
 It's fascinating.

233
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
 It's fascinating.

234
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,360
 I just can't figure this conspiracy theory out, and I love dissecting conspiracy theories,

235
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,480
 but this is one that I'm just speechless.

236
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,200
 And there's at least one person out there who believes it, and if this show has taught

237
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,840
 me anything, if there's one person out there who believes it, there's a thousand people

238
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,680
 out there who will believe it once they hear it.

239
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,500
 Corbin Channel, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

240
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,340
 We're gonna leave behind Kenosha, Wisconsin.

241
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,300
 We are headed on out to Mount Athos, Greece.

242
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:27,620
 We're all hanging on to Corbin Channel's ankles for dear life, but he's able to somehow get

243
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,500
 us all out to Mount Athos, Greece.

244
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,460
 The year is 1938, and right when we land, we hear a "dong."

245
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:48,160
 And we walk into this monastery, and there we see a dude laying there and he's dead.

246
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,880
 Now it's not like we came across a crime scene.

247
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,360
 He didn't die due to bell related injuries.

248
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
 This is a funeral.

249
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
 DONG.

250
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,320
 And all these other monks are standing around him, and this dude is laying there, his eyes

251
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
 are closed.

252
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,800
 We're at the funeral of Mahalo Tolato, 82 year old man.

253
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,660
 He's laying there, he's all old and dead.

254
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,460
 But the reason why we're here, we're not just here because we want to see a dead body.

255
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,980
 I'm all poking it with a stick.

256
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,500
 They're like, "Get out of here, get out of here."

257
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:29,100
 Mahalo Tolato is the only man in the world, as far as we know, the only man in human history

258
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,100
 who never saw a woman.

259
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,740
 And I know what you're thinking.

260
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,780
 What about blind people, Jason?

261
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,080
 Blind people never see women either.

262
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,480
 Yeah, get out of my way.

263
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,980
 Just go, go, go.

264
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,720
 You want to bring sense, if you want to bring like logic into this, you can stand in the

265
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,440
 back of the line.

266
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,920
 This story is so fascinating to me, and I guess there is a blind loophole, but I do think

267
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,080
 there's a bit of wiggle room here.

268
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,880
 Yes, if you were born completely blind, you will have never seen a man or a woman or anything

269
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,720
 like that, and that's true.

270
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,460
 But this is the only guy who's not blind who's never seen a woman.

271
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,940
 You're still going to do the segment?

272
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,580
 Okay, so here's the thing.

273
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,100
 I came across this crazy news thing a while ago about this dude, and it's always like

274
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
 a crazy fact.

275
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,980
 There was a man who never saw a woman, and you're like, "Whoa, that's pretty awesome,

276
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
 right?"

277
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,060
 Not saying that it's awesome not to see women, but it's pretty awesome to think that someone

278
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,600
 lived to be 82 years old and never ever saw a woman.

279
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,040
 So when you do think about it, you blind people don't ever see women, too.

280
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,720
 That kind of makes it so it's not so rare, but let's pretend that that fact isn't real.

281
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,440
 Let's pretend that when blind people are born, they can see one thing, their mom.

282
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,880
 Because I want to tell this story, and I find this story fascinating.

283
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,700
 The reason why Milhallyo never saw a woman was his mom died when he was born, and he

284
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,360
 was taken to a monastery, a Greek Orthodox monastery on Mount Athos.

285
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,580
 There was a rule, no women or animals could ever enter the monastery, so he was raised

286
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,700
 in this place where all he ever saw was dudes.

287
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,980
 And they also had these other weird rules.

288
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,260
 They weren't allowed to bathe.

289
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,860
 They weren't allowed to fight.

290
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,800
 I mean, come on, if you're going to be trapped in a bunch of dudes, at least you can arm

291
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,160
 wrestle, you can't fight, you can't argue, you can't even like disagree with the dude

292
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,840
 next to you.

293
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,160
 And you can never, ever ask what lies beyond the monastery walls.

294
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
 So yes, blind people, you're right.

295
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,480
 There's a ton of them, and they don't ever see women.

296
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,960
 But he could see men.

297
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
 Okay, how's that?

298
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,800
 Okay, now I figured it out.

299
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,660
 He's the only person who ever saw a man, but couldn't see a woman.

300
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,260
 Oh yeah, see I knew I could get this story to work.

301
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,700
 He only ever saw, could you imagine that?

302
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,980
 Like that's so bizarre to me.

303
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,260
 And you know like the other people joining the monastery, they'd be like, dude, before

304
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,740
 I was a monk, I was just banging tons of chicks, and he's like, he's imagining them having

305
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,140
 sex with giant chickens.

306
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
 He's like, huh?

307
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
 Oh, it's kind of creepy.

308
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,700
 I wonder why you're at the monastery.

309
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,160
 You always have a bunch of sins to resolve.

310
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,040
 Or they'd be like, dude, I was watching this movie called Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and

311
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,600
 whoo whoo, and he makes the shape of like a sexy, the monk makes the shape of a sexy

312
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,200
 woman with his hands, and he'd be like, what?

313
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
 Are there people out there who are like waves?

314
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
 And they just kind of like float around like Casper ghosts?

315
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
 But actually, he wouldn't even know what a wave was.

316
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,680
 He's trapped in this monastery.

317
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,040
 It'd be so weird, because you figure people would constantly be talking about women.

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,380
 Monasteries aren't bars.

319
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,300
 Monasteries aren't like sports bars where people go and they're like, dude, you see,

320
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,020
 Kate Moss the other day.

321
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,020
 But you figure every so often one of them would be like, dude, you know what I really

322
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
 miss?

323
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,140
 I mean, like all of this religion, this oneness with nature and the almighty, that's cool

324
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,660
 and all, but I really miss a nice set of bazookas.

325
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,380
 He'd be like, huh, what's a bazooka?

326
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,140
 And he couldn't even picture that.

327
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:23,520
 I find it so weird that there is a human on this planet who couldn't picture a woman.

328
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
 But think about it.

329
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,760
 And then when Mihalio dies, someone mispronounced his name five times in a row and he just died.

330
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,360
 He floating around, he's now a Casper ghost.

331
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,480
 And think about it, do when he went to heaven, he's seen like all these lady ghosts.

332
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,000
 And to him, they would look like gray aliens.

333
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,380
 To him, he wouldn't even be able to comprehend like what those are bazookas.

334
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,420
 And they're like, yes, Mihalio, these are bazookas.

335
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,900
 Like it's just so fascinating to me.

336
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,620
 I mean, trust me, I find it fascinating.

337
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,900
 I wouldn't want to go through it.

338
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:05,420
 But one person on earth, he was able to see men, but unable to see women.

339
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,660
 And that is actually, I didn't plan this.

340
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,420
 That is a perfect segue.

341
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
 Believe it or not.

342
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,200
 A perfect segue to our next story, Corbin's Channel.

343
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,960
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

344
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,200
 We are leaving behind Mount Athos Greece.

345
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,000
 We're dropping a bunch of Victoria's Secret catalogs as we're flying out.

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,520
 That might have been deeply sacrilegious.

347
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,960
 So if it is, I never made that joke.

348
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,000
 We are leaving behind Mount Athos Greece.

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 We are headed out to Indianapolis, Indiana.

350
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,720
 Some stories are short because they don't need to be long.

351
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,700
 This story came from a woman named Debbie Tomey.

352
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,300
 It was published in Strange Magazine #13.

353
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,220
 It's a discontinued magazine.

354
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,980
 We've covered it before in other episodes.

355
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,700
 I need to get a collection of these because there are some bizarre stuff.

356
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,100
 We've covered a lot of really good stuff from this magazine.

357
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,940
 I found out about this story from one of my favorite websites.

358
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,300
 Think about it, docs.com.

359
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,920
 It's August 8th, 1991.

360
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:15,560
 It's 3pm in the afternoon.

361
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,680
 Rain is pouring down from the heavens across the city of Indianapolis.

362
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,240
 And Debbie and her son are just sitting at home.

363
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,400
 Just got done playing a game of parcheesy.

364
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,160
 Have a long afternoon of monopoly in front of them.

365
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,400
 Like Jason, you just said the story was short.

366
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,900
 How much detail are you going to add?

367
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,340
 They had Nescafe boiling on the stove and marshmallows ready to roast.

368
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:51,300
 It's just a rainy day afternoon.

369
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,420
 And Debbie's looking out the window.

370
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,220
 Someone catches her eye.

371
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,900
 And her son must have sensed something because he begins looking out the window as well.

372
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,400
 They're both silently staring into the front yard of their house.

373
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,880
 Rain is cascading down.

374
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,280
 Underneath the rain gutter is a gush of water.

375
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,920
 And their attention is fixated right where the rain gutter is and this strong gush of

376
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,920
 water is pouring out.

377
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:34,140
 Debbie and her son clearly see the water stop and then split.

378
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:43,300
 And they're watching this deluge of rain gutter water fall down on a ball headed man.

379
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:50,680
 But the man is totally invisible.

380
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,440
 The water splashed on his skin and outlined him perfectly.

381
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,600
 You could see his head.

382
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 You could see his shoulders.

383
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,120
 You could see it drip down his arms.

384
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,320
 There was an invisible entity standing out in their front yard at 3pm August 8th 1991.

385
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,440
 And the only reason they knew it was there was because it was raining that day.

386
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,800
 They watched this invisible man from inside their house as he stood there silently in

387
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,920
 the rain.

388
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,640
 This wasn't a fleeting glimpse.

389
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,520
 It wasn't a trick of physics.

390
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,760
 He stood there for 3-4 minutes.

391
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,040
 And then he left.

392
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,320
 It doesn't say if he disappeared or not.

393
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,680
 The term left is a very interesting choice of words.

394
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,160
 If he disappeared, generally the word is used vanished or disappeared.

395
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:05,040
 The fact that he left kind of implies that they saw him walk away through the rain.

396
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,280
 Either way it's a terrifying story of an invisible man standing in their front yard.

397
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,880
 It's one of those stories that doesn't have a resolution, doesn't need a resolution,

398
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:23,760
 doesn't need to be a ghost, doesn't need to be an alien or an interdimensional entity.

399
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,520
 It is something other than what should be.

400
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,640
 Was he there for a purpose?

401
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,760
 Was he there just passing through?

402
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,240
 Did he stand underneath the rain gutter to make himself visible or was it an accident?

403
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:50,240
 He didn't realize it would show his form so clearly.

404
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,800
 So many questions with this story.

405
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 And that's what makes the story creepy.

406
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,360
 Well that and the invisible man.

407
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,600
 Because was this a one off thing or are these invisible people around us all the time?

408
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,520
 And what would make it even creepier is imagine this.

409
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,120
 Imagine if your apartment was haunted with a ghost.

410
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,480
 Imagine if your workplace had a demon in it.

411
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,840
 Imagine if on the way to work there had been sightings of UFOs.

412
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
 That's all creepy.

413
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,120
 And I'd recommend getting a new job if there's a demon at your workplace.

414
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,480
 But now imagine in your house is not haunted by a ghost.

415
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:41,320
 There is a living breathing human who's invisible in your house.

416
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,160
 At work there's not a demonic force but sometimes late at night you get the feeling you're being

417
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,560
 watched by something.

418
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,800
 Not this infernal creature.

419
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:59,520
 But a human with all the wants and desires that a human has but they're invisible.

420
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,800
 Or when you're driving to work you're driving by that little wooded area between your house

421
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,720
 and your place of employment.

422
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,240
 You've always heard stories about lights in the sky and maybe there's some grey aliens

423
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,440
 in the trees.

424
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:19,440
 How more terrifying would it be if you knew that the entity in the woods was an invisible

425
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,760
 human?

426
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,420
 Because we know how humans are.

427
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,960
 Because we are human and we know what we're capable of.

428
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,780
 And imagine an invisible human.

429
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,280
 Sometimes the shortest stories are the most unsettling because they don't give us any

430
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
 answers.

431
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,320
 They just have so many questions.

432
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,880
 And if there is even just one human out there that has the ability to turn themselves invisible

433
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,840
 that should terrify anybody really.

434
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,980
 So the next time you hear a bump in the night or get an uneasy feeling when you walk into

435
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,500
 a certain part of your house.

436
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,860
 Maybe just shut the door.

437
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,380
 Maybe just ignore that sound.

438
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,940
 There's a chance you may not be dealing with a paranormal entity but a normal man with

439
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,220
 paranormal abilities.

440
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:38,920
 And that is the most frightening monster you can face in the dark.

441
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,420
