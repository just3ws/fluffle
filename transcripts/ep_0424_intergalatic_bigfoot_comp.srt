1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
 A man is killed in a famously bizarre way, and that's not even the coolest thing about

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,980
 his life.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,100
 And then we take a look at three bizarre Bigfoot stories.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,340
 This isn't a giant lumbering beast moving through the forest, no.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,300
 This monster is the Guardian of another dimension, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:32,420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,340
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,780
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,320
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, we're gonna get started.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,820
 First off, wanna give a shout out to one of my legacy Patreons, Lambi.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,740
 Lambi, thank you so much for continuing to support the show.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,220
 I'll give you the keys to the Carpenter copter in just one second.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,020
 First off though, let's talk about the Dead Rabbit Radio Movie Club.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,460
 Now Friday night at 7pm Pacific Standard Time, we're gonna do a live stream, we're gonna

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,660
 discuss all the movies we watched this week.

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,340
 We watched Housewife, we watched Sorority Babes and the Slimeball Bullerama, we watched

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,340
 The Baby.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,940
 Last night I watched Nectrotronic.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,820
 Nectrotronic.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,140
 Very interesting movie.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,900
 All of these movies are available on Shutter.com, they're also available other places, but

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,580
 right now Shutter.com has a free offer, not sponsored by these guys.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,340
 I'm just trying to share this with you because it's free.

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,540
 30 days free if you use the promo code SHUTTON, S-H-U-T-I-N.

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,500
 So those are the four movies we've watched.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,700
 The movie I'm going to watch tonight and I don't wanna watch it and I'm watching it

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,420
 because I love you guys and I mentioned it on my live stream that this movie was too

28
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,700
 scary for me because I hate.

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,180
 The American Ring is one of my favorite scary movies.

30
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,180
 I think it's terrifying.

31
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,180
 I don't know how well it holds up, but emotionally it really really scared me.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,940
 The Japanese versions of the grudge or Ju-On are superior to the American versions of

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
 the grudge.

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,620
 Well, anyways, some idiot realized, "Hmm, someone in Japan goes, "Hmm, how can we

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,540
 scare Jason the most?"

36
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,220
 So they made the movie Sidako vs. Kayako.

37
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,580
 It's the grudge vs. the ring.

38
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,580
 So I'm gonna watch it tonight.

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,980
 I actually was gonna watch it be a big baby and watch it during the day.

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,060
 I'm recording this like one in the afternoon because it took a bit of drill and I'm super

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,060
 sleepy.

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,860
 But I was like, "No, my fans demand more."

43
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,340
 So I'm gonna watch this at late at night.

44
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,020
 You guys are like, "Jason, it's just two little girls throwing their hair at each other.

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,020
 Why are you so scared?"

46
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,620
 Because both those characters terrify me so much and technically Kayako's not a little

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,620
 girl.

48
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,620
 But, there's a woman.

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,180
 But anyways, the point is, the grudge and the ring.

50
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,420
 Absolutely terrify me.

51
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,220
 I've seen most of Ju-On.

52
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,940
 I think I've seen all of the grudge movies and I've seen two or three of the ring movies,

53
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,500
 the Japanese versions and I've seen all the American ones.

54
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,540
 But, oh, I didn't see the latest one.

55
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,940
 Ooh, maybe I should have watched the ring.

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
 I heard it wasn't that good.

57
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,740
 But anyways, the point is, is that any excuse not to watch a ring movie.

58
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,740
 Oh, it's not good.

59
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,300
 No, Jason, it's super terrifying.

60
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,300
 What?

61
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,300
 I can't hear you.

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
 You said it's lame?

63
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
 You said the plotting's bad?

64
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
 No, no, no, that's really good.

65
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
 What?

66
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300

 I can't hear you.

367
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
 I can't hear you.

368
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
 I can't hear you.

369
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
 I can't hear you.

370
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
 I can't hear you.

371
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
 I can't hear you.

372
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
 I can't hear you.

373
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
 I can't hear you.

374
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
 I can't hear you.

375
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
 I can't hear you.

376
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
 I can't hear you.

377
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
 I can't hear you.

378
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
 I can't hear you.

379
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
 I can't hear you.

380
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
 I can't hear you.

381
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
 I can't hear you.

382
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
 I can't hear you.

383
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
 I can't hear you.

384
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
 I can't hear you.

385
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
 I can't hear you.

386
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
 I can't hear you.

387
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
 I can't hear you.

388
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
 I can't hear you.

389
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
 I can't hear you.

390
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
 I can't hear you.

391
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
 I can't hear you.

392
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
 I can't hear you.

393
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,300
 I can't hear you.

394
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,300
 I can't hear you.

395
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
 I can't hear you.

396
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
 I can't hear you.

397
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
 I can't hear you.

398
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,300
 I can't hear you.

399
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
 I can't hear you.

400
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
 I can't hear you.

401
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
 I can't hear you.

402
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
 I can't hear you.

403
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
 I can't hear you.

404
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
 I can't hear you.

405
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,300
 I can't hear you.

406
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
 I can't hear you.

407
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
 I can't hear you.

408
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
 I can't hear you.

409
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
 I can't hear you.

410
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
 I can't hear you.

411
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
 I can't hear you.

412
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
 I can't hear you.

413
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
 I can't hear you.

414
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
 I can't hear you.

415
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,300
 I can't hear you.

416
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,300
 I can't hear you.

417
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,300
 I think that's an overview of evolution, but that's what I was taught in 1984.

418
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
 I remember looking at the slideshow and I was like, "What?

419
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
 That doesn't make sense.

420
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,300
 You figure eventually the dogs would be like, "Screw fish.

421
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,300
 If my feet are turning into flippers, let me go figure out how to pick up a coconut,

422
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,300
 drop it off a mountain, drink that delicious milk."

423
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,300
 Anyways, so that rant aside, you can tell the Benadryl's kicking in.

424
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
 That rant aside.

425
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
 Ice Chellius.

426
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,300
 Ice Chellius, interesting dude, right?

427
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,300
 Gets a turtle, smashes his head open, he dies.

428
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
 Did I finish that story?

429
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,300
 The vulture picks the turtle up and drops it and it thinks his head is a rock.

430
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
 I don't know if I finished telling the story.

431
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
 He thinks his head is a rock, smashes his head open, kills him on the spot.

432
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
 That's not an urban legend.

433
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
 That's actually how he died.

434
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,300
 I started looking into it and I was like, "Oh, this must be some apocryphal tale."

435
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,300
 All of the accounts of the time say a poor, maybe it's Ice Chellius.

436
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
 It doesn't matter.

437
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,300
 We'll call him Chellius.

438
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
 Poor Chellius.

439
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
 Poor Chellius.

440
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
 He was out.

441
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
 He got this omen.

442
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
 He got killed by a falling turtle.

443
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,300
 And so that is actually historical proof.

444
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,300
 And I had heard that story a long time whenever I see a thing about weird deaths.

445
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
 That's always listed there.

446
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,300
 But I was actually planning on doing an episode about just weird deaths from the ancient world.

447
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,300
 And this dude is way more fascinating than just getting clobbered by a turtle.

448
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,300
 He was born in the year 525 BC, right?

449
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
 He's working in his vineyard.

450
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
 He's just a laborer.

451
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
 He comes from a pretty rich family, actually.

452
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
 But, you know, he's working.

453
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
 He's not slacking off.

454
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:47,300
 And one night he has a dream that Dionysus, the god of wine and the arts, visits him and tells him,

455
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
 "You are not meant to work in a vineyard.

456
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,300
 You're not meant to simply exist.

457
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,300
 You need to be a playwright."

458
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
 Now, theater was around.

459
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
 Obviously, the guy didn't wake him up and go, "What's a playwright?

460
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
 God of theater.

461
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
 What's theater?"

462
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
 Theater was around.

463
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:12,300
 But this guy, Chellius, ends up, has a dream, and ends up creating an art form.

464
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
 This is so bizarre.

465
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
 I never even thought about this before.

466
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,300
 I think you guys have listened to this so long enough to know I think about everything at some point.

467
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
 This is so weird.

468
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
 So he starts writing plays.

469
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
 Now, back then, plays were structured like this.

470
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
 A guy would come out on stage.

471
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
 And theater was huge, obviously, in Greece.

472
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
 We can still go back and look at a lot of these plays that were written back then.

473
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,300
 And plays like Romeo and Julie had a lot of Shakespeare's plays, or based on themes,

474
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
 really just rip-offs of old Greek plays.

475
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,300
 But anyways, you would get up on stage and I would go, "There was a mountain."

476
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
 It's basically storytellers.

477
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
 There was a mountain over there, and then you'd have the chorus be like,

478
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
 "Over there, over there."

479
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,300
 And then Zeus came down with his mighty lightning bolt.

480
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
 Ooh, lightning bolt, ooh, lightning bolt.

481
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
 That was basically theater.

482
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
 It was a storyteller.

483
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,300
 Well, Chellius has this dream, and it starts writing plays,

484
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
 and he's going to all these showcases and stuff like that.

485
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
 And he goes, "You know what would be dope?"

486
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:20,300
 If I wrote, like, two different people talking to each other at the same time.

487
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,300
 Everyone's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chelly, Chelly, hold on."

488
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, hear me out."

489
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,300
 Normally, a guy tells a story about Zeus coming down and punishing a vain man.

490
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,300
 What if I had one guy on stage playing Zeus?

491
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
 Everyone's like, "Please don't finish this sentence. Please."

492
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
 And another guy on stage playing the vain man.

493
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,300
 He was the first guy to have dialogue on stage.

494
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,300
 People were going to his place, and they're like, "What in the world? Whoa, whoa, whoa, is there like more choruses?

495
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
 Why are all these people standing around?"

496
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
 He was the first guy to have Zeus come down and be like,

497
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
 "You over there?"

498
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,300
 And the guy would be like, "Me? Yes, you. You were being vain."

499
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
 It was blowing people's minds.

500
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,300
 It would be the equivalent of, in 1954, if you went to go see a movie,

501
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,300
 and it had Transformers special effects in it.

502
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
 You're like, "What in the world? I thought I was going to go see them.

503
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
 I thought I was going to go see a giant ant movie instead."

504
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,300
 It's full on CGI, full color, bizarre, mind-blowing explosions.

505
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,300
 That's what it was. He invented dialogue on stage also.

506
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
 So they had this competition that he wanted to get into.

507
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,300
 He won a ton of awards, obviously, because he was creating theater.

508
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
 He was creating the theater that we know of today.

509
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
 They had this showcase, right?

510
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
 Each playwright had to present three different plays.

511
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
 He had to bring three different plays to be in the showcase.

512
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
 That was generally how it was.

513
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,300
 So you'd go and you'd watch three plays by one playwright.

514
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,300
 People would stand on stage, coursing, and you'd see three plays by another playwright.

515
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,300
 And they'd be like, "First play would be about Zeus.

516
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,300
 The second play would be about a battle from long, long ago,

517
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,300
 and the third play would be about a father letting his daughter get married or something like that."

518
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,300
 Chelius is watching all these plays and he goes, "You know what? You know what would be really cool?"

519
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,300
 He gets an idea. He's stroking his beard.

520
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
 It's his time to go up on the showcase, right?

521
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,300
 His first play is about the Battle of Marathon.

522
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
 Now, that really blew a lot of people's minds,

523
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,300
 because there were people in the audience who had fought in the Battle of Marathon.

524
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
 Chelius had fought in the Battle of Marathon.

525
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,300
 And this was the first time people were watching plays about historical events they were in.

526
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,300
 The plays were usually long, long ago, like a storyteller, like Star Wars a long, long time ago.

527
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,300
 People were sitting in the audience and they're like, "What? I know that battle! I was in that battle!

528
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
 Look it! I don't have a leg! This is super bizarre!"

529
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,300
 So he was doing plays about relatively current events within the past 10, 15 years, which was mind-blowing.

530
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
 People were sitting in the audience, they're watching this play about the Battle of Marathon.

531
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,300
 Then his second play comes up, because they're all in a row.

532
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,300
 The second play is about the character from the first play, "Son!"

533
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,300
 Dealing with some stuff. People in the audience are like, "What? Wait, wait. Is this... what?

534
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
 Is this like the same play, but longer?"

535
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,300
 The third play was about another member of the family.

536
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,300
 He invented the trilogy.

537
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
 No one had ever done that before!

538
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,300
 People went to go see three completely separate plays by one playwright.

539
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
 That's how they kind of judged the breadth of their...

540
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
 He wrote the first trilogy.

541
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 People were like, "What is this madness? It got multiple people talking on stage, stories connected,

542
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
 that tells a generational saga?"

543
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,300
 Which is funny, because I've always thought, "Why trilogies? Why do movies try to go into trilogies?"

544
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,300
 Sometimes they'll go more, but it's usually like the Matrix trilogy, the Star Wars trilogy,

545
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
 and even the Star Wars broken up into different trilogies and all this stuff.

546
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,300
 Iron Man 1, 2, and 3. Why do we have a trilogy? I think that's why.

547
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,300
 I think it's because that's the oldest story trope thing.

548
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,300
 Where you have a trilogy, you have a separate story lines, but then they all interconnect.

549
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,300
 That guy invented it. He's remembered for a turtle dropping on his head,

550
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,300
 but he created dialogue, he created the trilogy.

551
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
 He created massive set designs, he had polis and stuff like that.

552
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,300
 And again, so that's... It wasn't just two people standing on stage,

553
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:33,300
 it was two people standing on stage, backdrops, lighting, costumes, all of this stuff.

554
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,300
 This guy really invented.

555
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:43,300
 And what's funny is, in the end, world famous playwright at his time,

556
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,300
 nowadays he's remembered for a turtle falling on his head,

557
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,300
 but in his life, when he died, he goes, you know, the people ask him,

558
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,300
 "What do you want to be remembered for, for your tombstone?"

559
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,300
 He didn't care about the theater. The thing he was the most proud of

560
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
 was the fact that he fought in the Battle of Marathon.

561
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
 That's what's listed on his tombstone.

562
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,300
 Not the fact that he created an art form.

563
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,300
 Because it's one... It was just storytelling before.

564
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,300
 He created theater from a dream from the God of Theater.

565
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,300
 He created everything you see today.

566
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,300
 But he wanted to be remembered for his bravery and him standing by his brothers

567
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,300
 and standing for his country at the Battle of Marathon.

568
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,300
 Because in the end, that meant more to him than all of these plays.

569
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,300
 Most of his plays have been lost, but we do have some of them.

570
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
 Like, we do have his play about the Battle of Marathon and stuff like that.

571
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
 He wrote, I think, a couple hundred plays.

572
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,300
 I'm not saying they were super long. I don't even know how good they were,

573
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,300
 but it doesn't matter at that point. Like, he... Even if they sucked,

574
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,300
 he was the first person sucking at an art form.

575
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
 It's just interesting to... I never thought about that.

576
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,300
 I thought theater was just so intrinsic and it was a community evolution.

577
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,300
 Nope, just one guy had a dream, woke up and goes, "Ugh, I think I'm going to change the world of entertainment today."

578
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
 Fascinating.

579
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
 So is getting a turtle dropped on his head.

580
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,300
 But I... That didn't... That didn't create the fact that I can sit down

581
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,300
 and watch Sadako vs. Akako, or whatever the name of that movie is.

582
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,300
 I don't even want to pull back up the picture because it's so spooky on my computer.

583
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
 That movie exists because this guy had a dream.

584
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
 That's fascinating. Super, super amazing.

585
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

586
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,300
 Now, our next story is a collection of little stories,

587
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
 but I think they paint a bigger picture.

588
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,300
 These all come from that website. Think about it, docs.com.

589
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,300
 These all happen within a span of a few months.

590
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,300
 Lambie, let's fire back up. Let's take the Jason Jalopy because we're going to do a little bit road trip.

591
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,300
 So we're leaving behind Greece. We're coming back into the present day.

592
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,300
 And we're actually driving up to Mount Hood, Oregon.

593
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,300
 It's 1989. It's night.

594
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,300
 And there's this farmer... There's a lot of rural community up here.

595
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,300
 There's a farmer near Mount Hood and he's just...

596
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
 Ooh, I don't know why he's yawning. It's at night.

597
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
 He's walking around. He's wearing his PJs. He has on his suspenders.

598
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,300
 And he's walking around his farm. And then he just sees it appear.

599
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
 What? What?

600
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,300
 It's a shimmery... What he described as a raindrop.

601
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:25,300
 Just appearing in front of him.

602
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,300
 It was six to seven feet in diameter, so quite big.

603
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,300
 And he said he could look through it.

604
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:41,300
 He could see on the other side of this big raindrop hovering off the ground near his property.

605
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
 Now he doesn't say that he... It's nighttime.

606
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,300
 And I think it's interesting because when he looks through it, he doesn't say what it looks like.

607
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,300
 But I think if it was nighttime here and then it was just more nighttime and it was like a shimmering thing...

608
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
 I don't know if you'd use the term "look through it."

609
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,300
 This thing about a docs.com is just a lot of these little stories, but they do have a source.

610
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,300
 It's from the WBS Alien Report, Volume 1, Number 2. I couldn't track that actual down.

611
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,300
 I couldn't actually track that source down, but I'd like to get more information.

612
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,300
 The raindrop appears and he says he can see through it, which couldn't be one of two things.

613
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,300
 The raindrop was just kind of a fuzzy thing and he could still see the nighttime trees behind it.

614
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,300
 Or he saw another reality through it, like daytime, another world.

615
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,300
 But whatever the matter, that's actually not important. I just think that's a weird visual trick.

616
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,300
 He says you could see through it and as he's looking at it, what carnation is that?

617
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
 [imitates raindrop sound]

618
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:43,300
 Bigfoot jumps through the portal and starts running into the woods surrounding Mount Hood.

619
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
 Farmer's just kind of scratching his head.

620
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
 Looks at the camera, he's directing his shoulders.

621
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
 Teardrop disappears.

622
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,300
 Summer, 1989.

623
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 Let's drive on down to Red Canyon, that's in Sedona, Arizona.

624
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
 That rhymes. Sedona, Arizona.

625
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,300
 It's daytime. It's a beautiful sunny day in Arizona.

626
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,300
 There's a house being built in the middle of nowhere, i.e. anywhere in Arizona.

627
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
 This guy's walking around.

628
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,300
 This construction site, hmm, yes, this building will look amazing once it's finished.

629
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,300
 Right now it just looks like a pile of wood.

630
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:27,300
 And then he sees, well, a portal open up.

631
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,300
 Now this is interesting, because this story is in a totally different book.

632
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,300
 Same website is co-lating all this stuff, but this is a totally different book.

633
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,300
 It's a different book called Alien Tide by Tom Dongeau.

634
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,300
 The thing I find Tom Dongeau, what I think is fascinating about this stuff,

635
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
 is that if all of these things were reported in the same magazine,

636
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,300
 it kind of, it can be a little more suspicious.

637
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
 But the fact that different books being published at different times,

638
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,300
 and they're not cross-referenced in it.

639
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,300
 Even this website, think about it, Docs, this was just a list of 1989.

640
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
 They weren't even making the connection.

641
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
 They were just listing everything that happened in 1989.

642
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,300
 So it's interesting when you're reading these giant lists and you're going,

643
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,300
 "That sounds familiar," and you go back up and you're like, "Oh, here it is."

644
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:19,300
 Tom Dongeau and the WBS Alien Report both did not connect these, as far as I can tell.

645
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,300
 Portal opens up during the day in Sedona, Arizona,

646
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,300
 and Sedona also is known to have a lot of mystical activity and stuff like that.

647
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,300
 We've covered them before on this show.

648
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,300
 He can see through the portal, just like the farmer in Mount Hood.

649
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
 He's like, "What in the world is that?"

650
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,300
 This portal is like a circle this time, and it's a couple feet off the ground,

651
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,300
 just hovering a couple feet off the ground like the first encounter.

652
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,300
 He's looking through it, and he sees on the other side several Bigfoot,

653
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300
 who he described as nine feet tall, which is big even for Bigfoot.

654
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,300
 Bigfoot's normally like seven, eight feet tall.

655
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,300
 And he got the impression, before he ran, turned, and ran and got his car in the driveway,

656
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,300
 he got the impression that they were standing guard.

657
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:13,300
 The portal opened up, and they were on the other side to prevent somebody from getting in,

658
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
 was his impression.

659
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,300
 They were there to keep him or anyone else out.

660
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
 So he runs to his car drives away.

661
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
 So that's kind of an interesting thing.

662
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,300
 I don't know if they all had their arms crossed, like they were wrappers or something like that,

663
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,300
 but he got the impression to leave, which I think in, I think one Bigfoot sitting,

664
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,300
 reading a magazine in an interventional portal would give me the impression to run away.

665
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,300
 But he beats feet, he gets out of there, right?

666
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
 This next one we have a little more information.

667
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,300
 September 27th, 1989.

668
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
 So last one took place in summer.

669
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 The first one we don't know exactly when it took place.

670
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,300
 But this one takes place September 27th, 1989.

671
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 Oregon, again. Tillamook, Oregon.

672
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
 It's 4.20 in the afternoon.

673
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,300
 Grandma's in the house doing dishes.

674
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
 That's sexist.

675
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,300
 Grandma's in the house running her Fortune 500 company.

676
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
 And granddaughter runs in.

677
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,300
 Grandma, grandma, grandma, grandma, there's something outside and it's super spooky.

678
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
 Grandma, come and see.

679
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
 Come, come.

680
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,300
 Grandma's like, okay, I'm all done being president of this company.

681
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,300
 Eyes are shifting side to side as she really has cookies.

682
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
 Bacon in the oven.

683
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,300
 She just tells her granddaughter she runs a Fortune 500 company.

684
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
 Grandma runs outside.

685
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 And then she sees what she describes as a inverted spinning top.

686
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
 So you have a top.

687
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,300
 You guys know what a top is, but a little toy.

688
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
 Doodaloodaloodalooda.

689
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
 And spins in the--

690
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
 lamest toy, right?

691
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
 Who's like, "Wee!

692
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300
 Momentum for two seconds, lame."

693
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
 The original Beyblade.

694
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
 But anyway, and even though it sucked.

695
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
 But anyway, so it's an inverted top.

696
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
 So little pointy things at the top.

697
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
 And it's like hovering.

698
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
 So basically, she could have just said it looked like a spade.

699
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,300
 Not like the tool, but like the card club thing.

700
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,300
 Or just like, I don't know, anything other than a top.

701
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
 It just brings back bad memories.

702
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,300
 Whoever got a top for the present, like, "Hey, here you go, Jason.

703
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
 Yay, it's Christmas.

704
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
 Open a-- thanks.

705
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
 Thanks, my-- what I always wanted.

706
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,300
 A spinny thing that only spins for a few seconds.

707
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
 Yay."

708
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
 It's hovering off the ground.

709
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,300
 She describes it as being 20 to 30 feet in diameter, which is quite huge.

710
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
 I mean, that might not be big for a spaceship,

711
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,300
 but it's quite big to look to see when you're walking outside of your house

712
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
 because your granddaughter won't shut up.

713
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,300
 There's 20 to 30 feet of raw alien technology in your front yard.

714
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
 That's quite huge.

715
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 And it's just kind of hovering there.

716
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
 And it's grandma's brave.

717
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
 She walks towards it.

718
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
 She gets within 30 feet of the thing, and that's when--

719
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
 [imitates door opening]

720
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
 door opens up.

721
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,300
 And she sees standing inside of the UFOs, just hanging out in her yard.

722
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
 A blonde woman.

723
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,300
 Normal height, normal appearance,

724
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 but wearing a silver bodysuit.

725
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
 And that's interesting, because yesterday's episode,

726
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
 we had the seven-foot-tall alien who ransacked that dude's house.

727
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
 He was also wearing a silver bodysuit.

728
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:10,300
 And I wonder if that's because we connect silver suits with the future

729
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
 because of, like, old sci-fi movies we've watched,

730
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
 or they actually is an advantage--

731
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,300
 cut-- or they're actually is an advantage to having a silver suit.

732
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,300
 Like, it seems like such an odd detail.

733
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
 Either aliens really think they look good in silver.

734
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
 Man, this really brings out my skin tone.

735
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,300
 Now that I'm underneath this yellow sun and not the two blue suns in my home planet,

736
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
 I'm gonna wear more silver.

737
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,300
 Or is it because we-- if you see someone in a silver suit, you go--

738
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:43,300
 like, that old show, Get a Life, when Chris Elliott covered himself in tinfoil to pretend he was a robot.

739
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
 Isn't this like, living in the future?

740
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
 That ain't nothing like living in the future.

741
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
 Like, you associate-- that's a throwback.

742
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
 Anyone under the age of 40 has no idea what that was.

743
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,300
 When you see someone wrapped in silver, dressed in silver,

744
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,300
 you have a connotation in your head that that's futuristic.

745
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
 And I wonder why.

746
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,300
 But anyways, I think it could-- I think it could point that there's--

747
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
 aliens do actually wear silver,

748
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,300
 and that's where we got the idea for the sci-fi from,

749
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,300
 or all of these accounts are just--

750
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
 people are piecing together things in their mind,

751
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 and they're using motifs that they believe are supernatural, or alien.

752
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,300
 Because they've seen that stuff in movies and things like that.

753
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
 But anyways, I digress.

754
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
 The woman standing there in front of this UFO door opens up,

755
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
 and there's an attractive young blonde actually at the--

756
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
 I added the word attractive.

757
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
 I'm assuming she was attractive.

758
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
 Blonde hair, blue eyes.

759
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
 She's just standing there.

760
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
 Now, the grandma's looking at this woman.

761
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
 The woman's looking at the grandma.

762
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,300
 But then the woman's eyes slightly shift.

763
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,300
 So now she's looking into the UFO past the woman,

764
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,300
 and they're sitting in a chair at a control panel,

765
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
 is Bigfoot.

766
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
 [imitates explosion]

767
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
 UFO just vanishes.

768
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 And the grandma's left, like, "What-- what was that?"

769
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
 Granddaughters, like, shrugs their shoulders,

770
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
 licks at the camera.

771
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
 What I think is interesting about these stories--

772
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
 that one was from the Mufon Journal,

773
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
 number 264. It was published in 1990.

774
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,300
 The-- what's interesting about those stories are we--

775
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
 I think-- and I've talked about this before.

776
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
 I think-- and so I don't want to go on too long about it,

777
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
 but there's different Bigfoot camps.

778
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
 Just like there's different ghost--

779
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,300
 most people are kind of agree--

780
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 if you believe in ghosts, you kind of agree with the origin story is.

781
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
 That they're the souls of the dead.

782
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
 There's not a lot of debate.

783
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
 Some people say it might say they're demons,

784
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
 but I think most people who believe in ghosts believe in demons.

785
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
 Most people who believe in demons believe in ghosts.

786
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
 But some people-- but I-- so I think--

787
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,300
 I think that form of the paranormal is pretty connected.

788
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
 And I think as far as you look at like ESP,

789
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,300
 people who believe that telekinesis telepathy,

790
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
 they're all pretty connected too,

791
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
 but when you get to Bigfoot community,

792
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
 when you get to the UFO community,

793
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
 you get a lot of divisiveness.

794
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
 UFOs, some people believe they're demons,

795
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
 some people believe they're interdimensional,

796
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
 some people believe they're from here,

797
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,300
 some people believe they're from outer space.

798
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
 And when I say from here, they're--

799
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
 living within the cave systems,

800
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
 they've been here for 10,000 years, stuff like that.

801
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,300
 And even more different versions of what aliens are.

802
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
 And again, there are a lot of awesome people who just don't believe

803
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
 any of this stuff exists. We're excluding them.

804
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,300
 We're talking about the people who actually live in this stuff.

805
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,300
 Bigfoot, you have people who believe they're interdimensional entity,

806
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,300
 people who believe that they are a biological entity

807
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,300
 that can be found, tracked, hunted, captured, or killed.

808
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,300
 And this is kind of the mainstream view on Bigfoot.

809
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,300
 That it is a biological creature that lives in the woods.

810
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,300
 It has like a birth cycle, has a diet that it has to eat,

811
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,300
 it has territory, just like how you would catalog any animal.

812
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,300
 That's how it's usually portrayed on like,

813
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,300
 "Hunt Sasquatch History Channel."

814
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,300
 "Let's go Sasquatch hunting!"

815
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
 "Let's Squatch!"

816
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,300
 All that stuff. They're kind of like,

817
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
 they can track it and they're checking feces.

818
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
 They hunt them like they hunt deer.

819
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,300
 I think that, and this is where you go back all the way to how the Native Americans

820
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
 looked at Bigfoot. It was a spiritual creature.

821
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,300
 It was something that could move in and out of reality,

822
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,300
 could turn invisible, could read your thoughts.

823
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,300
 Basically, a super-powered ghost is how this thing existed.

824
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
 And these stories kind of point to that.

825
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,300
 And what's interesting is that if you were one of the Bigfoot hunters

826
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,300
 who believed like, "Ah, 7 a.m. This is the ordinary time the Squatch wakes up.

827
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,300
 Yeah, I know. One day I woke up and I heard a Sasquatch yelling in the distance.

828
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 Sounds just like a fox, but I knew it was a Sasquatch,

829
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,300
 because then like a tree rattled nearby.

830
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,300
 It was full of birds, but coincidences, I don't believe in those.

831
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,300
 So, that's... you have...

832
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
 That was okay, to be fair, that was a straw man.

833
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,300
 That guy was obviously an idiot.

834
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,300
 But, my point is, is that if one of those guys who believes that it has a life cycle

835
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,300
 and is a biological entity saw any of this, saw a portal open up and Bigfoot jump out of it,

836
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
 it would blow your brain.

837
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,300
 Because imagine if you were hunting elk, you're out in the middle of the woods,

838
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,300
 and you go to shoot an elk and the elk looks at you and then goes, "Welp!"

839
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,300
 Like, just flies away into a portal, but you'd be like, "What?"

840
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,300
 That's why I can never find elk, because they're magical creatures.

841
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,300
 I like this version of the Bigfoot story, because it actually makes more sense.

842
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,300
 It makes sense why we can't find them, because it's coming in and out of reality.

843
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,300
 But even that's not the most interesting part about this.

844
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,300
 These... these bigfoots are piloting spaceships.

845
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
 That's Chewbacca at this point.

846
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
 Bigfoot is basically a real-life Chewbacca.

847
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,300
 And it makes sense, because what do we know about aliens?

848
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,300
 People say they're reptilians, they're like totally tough.

849
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,300
 They're reptilian aliens, they got claws, they be fighting you, they're like seven feet tall, whatever.

850
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
 They're super tough, they would have taken it over by now.

851
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:57,300
 Generally, people think of aliens as grey aliens, or Pleiadians, humans.

852
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,300
 Nordics is the other term for them.

853
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,300
 So, normal looking humans.

854
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
 Or grey aliens.

855
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
 And yeah, reptilians, whatever.

856
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:12,300
 I don't... I... anything that can't regulate its own body temperature, I'm really not worried about beating in a fight.

857
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,300
 I'll just keep punching it, punching it until we go into the shade.

858
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
 And he's like, "Oh no, I'm freezing!"

859
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,300
 "Break it's break, punch it so hard it shatters!"

860
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
 Like it's in nitroglycerin.

861
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,300
 If you can't regulate your own body temperature, I think I can take you to a boxing match.

862
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:32,300
 I just simply, I'll just keep throwing my punches, but not hit you in the wind, will slowly cool you down.

863
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
 I'm not worried about you.

864
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,300
 If you're the grey aliens, or Nordics, or running around, you need muscle.

865
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,300
 You're coming to Earth, you're coming to the toughest planet in the solar system, if not the galaxy, right?

866
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
 We haven't been invaded yet.

867
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,300
 We are... we're built, we're basically killer apes.

868
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:57,300
 Humans were the monkeys who basically like, wiped out every other single primate that could have possibly challenged us.

869
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
 We weren't monkeying around.

870
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,300
 We took over the planet.

871
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,300
 So if aliens are coming from other planets, especially grey aliens, they're still kind of weak.

872
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,300
 But we're there just like, "Oh, we had a very peaceful evolution."

873
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,300
 And they come down, "You're going to have to have muscle."

874
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,300
 Right? You're going to have to have a couple bigfoot with you.

875
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
 Which makes sense. You want to have that muscle.

876
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,300
 So the fact that they're guarding time portals, that they're piloting UFOs...

877
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:30,300
 "Renonda, I don't want you to go to Earth alone, but Monka, I can do it. It's time for me to go on my mission."

878
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
 "At least take bigfoot with you."

879
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:38,300
 "Me protect you. Me also know how to fly class 5 warp drive engine."

880
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,300
 "Fine, I'll take bigfoot with me, but he stares at me while I sleep."

881
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,300
 "I know, that's super weird, but I'd feel so much more comfortable for you."

882
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,300
 "Oh, kiss me, my alien lover."

883
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,300
 Like it would be good to have it would be...

884
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
 The bit of drill is definitely kicked in.

885
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
 "Oh, yes, me fly ship."

886
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,300
 "Can't wait till she falls asleep so I can watch her."

887
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300
 "What'd you say?"

888
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,300
 "Uh, nothing. He's setting up the secret cameras."

889
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,300
 Now I don't know why now bigfoot's an intergalactic pervert.

890
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
 Uh, me be...

891
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,300
 Actually it would make sense that bigfoot would be a pervert.

892
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
 'Cause he sees you, you can't see him.

893
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,300
 You're always like sleeping in the forest.

894
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,300
 He's standing in the bushes, he's always breathing really heavy.

895
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
 It would actually make sense.

896
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,300
 Bigfoot might actually be the most perverted cryptid out there.

897
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,300
 So maybe bigfoot isn't a biological creature.

898
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,300
 Maybe bigfoot's not necessarily some sort of mindless thing that runs through the forest.

899
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,300
 Even if it is jumping from another dimension into ours.

900
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:43,300
 Maybe it is the muscle, maybe it is the bodyguard, the enforcers of an alien race.

901
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:50,300
 Maybe bigfoot's exist simply to make sure nobody messes with other alien races

902
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
 while they're doing stuff in remote areas.

903
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:58,300
 And every bigfoot sighting, if you went a couple hundred yards past the giant creature standing in the bushes

904
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,300
 that you're trying to grab your camera and also not wet your pants at the same time.

905
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
 There's an alien putting some sort of device into the soil or taking some sort of readings.

906
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,300
 We've covered tons of stories with bigfoot's and aliens being connected.

907
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,300
 And this, I always thought, well maybe it's just kind of high strangeness, maybe it's some sort of...

908
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,300
 They might actually be the shocktroopers of an alien force.

909
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,300
 So somewhere out there right now...

910
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,300
 [Drums]

911
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,300
 There's like a big old parade, right? There's a big old parade and there's like bigfoot walking through the parade.

912
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,300
 And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

913
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
 And then like, there's the whole like regimen of other bigfoot's walking behind them.

914
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,300
 He's the commander, he's the... they call him BF.

915
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:49,300
 He's walking, main bigfoot's like saluting everyone, holding his hand up.

916
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,300
 People are like throwing space flowers at him. And then he walks up and the like, the beautiful Empress...

917
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:00,300
 The beautiful Empress, Shunaki, is standing there and she like has her little like, glow in the dark.

918
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,300
 I mean, holographic glow in the dark, that's lame.

919
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
 In the middle of a parade, everything's lit up.

920
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,300
 A little holographic metal and she hands it to bigfoot and he like holds it up.

921
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
 And then all the other bigfoot's are like, "Gah!"

922
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:17,300
 And then he gives a speech, he's like, "Me, bigfoot, wee, bigfoot."

923
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
 Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

924
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
 And he holds it up again.

925
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,300
 And then like, the background and the shadows, there's like an evil bigfoot.

926
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
 He has a patch over his eye.

927
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
 No, no, no, he's missing a foot.

928
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
 He's missing a foot.

929
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,300
 He has like a little holographic foot that doesn't help him much because it's not a solid hologram.

930
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
 So he has a crutch too.

931
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,300
 He's like, "Oh, the traitors, the traitors, they think that they're the heroes."

932
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,300
 They think, "But it was me, it was me all along."

933
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
 And then they betrayed me.

934
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,300
 They betrayed me because I caught that bear trap on Earth.

935
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
 But I'll soon show them all.

936
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
 I'll show them all.

937
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:58,300
 And then credits roll for this fictional movie I made up in my Benadryl Adled Brain.
