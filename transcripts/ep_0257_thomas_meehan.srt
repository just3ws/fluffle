1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
 A fourth of July party turns into a terrifying ordeal for all involved.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,260
 And then we take a look at the curious case of Thomas Mayhan, a businessman who left work

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,200
 and was headed home.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,100
 But he never reached home.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,640
 He was spotted in three locations around town and in one of those locations he was already

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,760
 dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,120
 Season 6 starts now.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,680
 Now you may go, "Hmm, Jason, the audio quality is a bit different.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,360
 I'm on vacation, man.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,520
 I'm in sunny, sunny California.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,600
 In sunny, sunny Sacramento.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,760
 Sack of potatoes, sack of tomato.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,280
 The city that always sleeps.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,760
 I'm kicking it down here.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,120
 It's like 97 degrees.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,560
 I'm in an un-air conditioned apartment like I normally am because I can't have air conditioners

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,400
 or fans running while I record this show.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,680
 So if you hear the occasional drip drop that is sweat leaving my body.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,640
 But we got a lot of good stuff for you today.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,200
 We got two really interesting stories.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,920
 The first story just happened.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,360
 It actually happened as I basically while I was recording, the end of season 5 was on

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,720
 July 4th.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,040
 So this episode basically all of this stuff was transpiring while I was messing around.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,320
 And actually it was all transpiring while all of us were watching fireworks or sleeping

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,080
 because we're 80 years old.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,320
 But remember what you were doing 4th of July.

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,600
 Think about what you were doing 4th of July.

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,720
 And now forget that.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,400
 Forget that happened because we are going on an adventure.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,320
 We are going to Bodega Bay.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,160
 Bodega Bay, little town in California.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
 The sunny sunny state.

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
 I'm just joking.

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,560
 Okay so anyways, sun's always in California.

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,120
 Anyway, so I'm surprised there's no conspiracy yet about the earthquakes.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,280
 I'm surprised there's no one saying that it's the lizard people or...

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,640
 I saw someone trying to say that the LA earthquakes was a sign that the Yellowstone geyser was

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
 going to blow up the planet.

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
 Not a geyser.

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,880
 It's actually like a super volcano under there and it is quite dangerous.

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,800
 But I'm surprised we don't get more.

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
 I wonder how flat earthers, how they explain earthquakes.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,760
 Anyways, anyways, I should note to self, look up what maniacs think about natural events.

49
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,400
 Back to Bodega Bay.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,160
 Let's go ahead and get started with the saga of Batai Coffee.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,120
 Batai Coffee is a 32 year old man.

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
 Stanford graduate.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
 Upper crust.

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,440
 Upper crust old chum.

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,160
 Actually he's born and raised in LA.

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,200
 But anyways, Batai Coffee is like, he's a software engineer at YouTube right now.

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,920
 He wakes up from a coma earlier this week.

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
 He wakes up from a coma.

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,000
 He can't move the left side of his body.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,200
 He's like, what happened?

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
 Sexy nurses are all walking around taking his temperature, like filling out charts.

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,320
 A little short nurse skirts and they're like, oh, the patient's awake.

63
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,680
 This is my dream hospital.

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 Not this guy.

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,880
 This guy doesn't need to be there.

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,400
 But bunch of sexy nurses are like, oh, let's go get a doctor.

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,680
 A doctor comes in, sexy female doctor, even shorter skirt.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,280
 I didn't even know it was possible.

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,080
 She comes in, she goes, Mr. Coffee, you're awake.

70
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,920
 And he's like, what happened?

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,400
 What happened to me?

72
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,000
 She goes, well, first off, everything we're about to talk about is alleged.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
 And secondly, everything we're about to talk about is true.

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,840
 And it's alleged in the sense that everything that happened, like the first part, is true.

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,600
 But it's alleged whether or not coffee did it.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,720
 And coffee's like, what does any of that have to do with my medical condition?

77
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,240
 I want to know why I can't move the left side of my body.

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,040
 Sexy doctor turns back away from the camera and goes, well, Mr. Coffee, I think the police

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,760
 should explain to you what happened.

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,440
 Maybe you can answer a few questions.

81
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,240
 She gives a sexy wink at us as she walks out of the hospital room.

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
 So here's what happened.

83
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,880
 That was our little intro for the day.

84
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
 Here's what happened.

85
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
 Coffee?

86
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,400
 32 year old Petite Coffee, software engineer for YouTube.

87
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
 Stanford educated.

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
 Good old chum.

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,920
 Cream of the crop of American society is hanging out with five of his buddies in Bodega Bay.

90
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,120
 They rented a place so they could spend 4th of July all the weekend partying at this house.

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
 Now I don't know, I party.

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
 I'll kick it with a couple friends, drink a couple beers.

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
 If that.

94
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,560
 Usually I just hang out and talk about magic the gathering.

95
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,680
 But these guys said nah nah, we're not none of those plebs.

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,920
 We're not any of those working class that drinks Budweiser.

97
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,800
 Those drop acid.

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,400
 Taking it up a level I guess.

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
 But anyways they decide to drop acid.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,760
 Now I know a lot of my listeners do acid.

101
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,920
 Not a sizable amount.

102
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,440
 But I know a lot of people have experimented with it.

103
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,360
 I don't mess with hallucinogens.

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,000
 I already see ghosts flying around me.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Not all the time.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I'm not a lunatic.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,400
 But the line is so thin.

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,040
 Where if I saw a goblin just appear I'd be like oh my god that goblin's real.

109
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,720
 So I don't want to take a drug that's going to increase the likelihood of goblins appearing

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,880
 in front of me.

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,920
 So they decide to drop acid.

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,040
 Now I'm assuming it wasn't their first time.

113
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
 Maybe it was.

114
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,320
 But I'm assuming it wasn't.

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,280
 Now they all decide to take half a tab of acid.

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 Except for coffee.

117
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,320
 Because coffee is an overachiever.

118
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,360
 Stanford graduate.

119
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,880
 Software engineer at YouTube.

120
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,960
 He takes two hits of acid.

121
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,040
 He's like oh good ol' chums you don't understand.

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,680
 Acid is what you Americans refuse.

123
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
 Acid is American too.

124
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
 I don't know.

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,000
 I just imagine him very posh.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
 Because Stanford graduate right.

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
 I graduated from community college.

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,200
 So anyone who graduated from college is posh.

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,040
 Anyways he goes I'm going to take two hits of acid.

130
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,640
 I'm going to do better than all you guys.

131
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
 Just like I did better than you guys on the SATs.

132
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,120
 And they're like dude we all have the same job.

133
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,840
 You don't have to be a jury.

134
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,200
 So they're partying.

135
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,880
 Now at 3pm so they started pre-gaming really really early.

136
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
 At 3pm coffee starts freaking out.

137
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,680
 He's like oh man I don't know what happened ol' chum.

138
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,320
 I don't know.

139
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,120
 It could be the four times amount of acid I took over you guys.

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,400
 And they're like yeah probably.

141
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,680
 About an hour later he goes oh old bean I don't know what's going on.

142
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,240
 He looks at his friend he's actually an old bean.

143
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,200
 He's like oh I don't know what's going on.

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,720
 I need to study myself.

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,360
 I need to study myself.

146
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,560
 And he takes two more hits of acid.

147
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
 He's already having a bad trip.

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,680
 Takes two more hits of acid.

149
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
 His friends are like don't do that dude.

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
 That was the wrong move.

151
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,840
 And he's like oh don't tell me what to do talking watermelon.

152
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,480
 I'll take all the acid I want.

153
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,880
 Now that happened at around 4 between 4 and 5pm.

154
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,040
 He takes the two additional hits of acid.

155
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,520
 At 8pm fireworks are going off.

156
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,720
 Kids are poking each other with sparklers.

157
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 Dogs are terrified.

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,760
 It's a great quarter of July.

159
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,720
 He wants to leave the house.

160
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
 He wants to leave.

161
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,440
 Like dude you are in no condition to leave the house.

162
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
 Friends won't let him.

163
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,720
 And then like that our fake British pal our Stanford graduate turns into Jason Bourne.

164
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,240
 Now this is where the first off you're thinking oh Jason a guy who's getting taken a bunch

165
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,760
 of acid he's going to end up running around street naked.

166
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,880
 This guy turns into an action hero or more likely an action villain because of what happens.

167
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,720
 This is why Kofi ended up in the hospital paralyzed on the left side of his body surrounded

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
 by sexy medical staff.

169
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
 First off so he's surrounded by his friends and they're like come on Kofi settle down

170
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,400
 you can't you can't go anywhere.

171
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,480
 He punches the woman in the chest picks up a pencil stabs another one of his friends

172
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,840
 and other dude climbs on top of him he starts choking him while punching another man in

173
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
 the face.

174
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,240
 So within a second he's taken out four people.

175
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,440
 He takes off outside the house.

176
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,400
 And he's playing in his head because he's tripping hard on acid.

177
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,320
 Allegedly this is where all the crimes begin.

178
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,760
 He jumps out he gets in his rental car starts to drive away.

179
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,760
 One of his friends jumps in front of the car to be like no no no don't do it don't do it.

180
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,680
 And he ends up trying to hit his friend in the car allegedly and that's the last time

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,280
 I'm going to say allegedly it's all allegedly.

182
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,920
 Tries to hit his friend with the car misses crashes into the house.

183
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,360
 Can't get the car out.

184
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,880
 Jumps out of the car.

185
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,280
 He looks and at this point a local like security guard for the subdivision they're staying

186
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,520
 in is approaching.

187
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,480
 He jumps out of his van pulls out his little flashlight.

188
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,080
 Freeze evil doer.

189
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,320
 Coffee looks at him and goes evil doer more like can't think of anything.

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,920
 Think of a catchphrase.

191
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,600
 He starts running towards the security guard security guard starts running towards them

192
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,000
 split screen two different faces looking at each other.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,520
 This is this 100% real not the split screen that didn't happen but all of these events

194
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,880
 did.

195
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,840
 Security guard has like pepper spray billy club it doesn't have a gun but coffee doesn't

196
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:19,200
 have any weapon at all but he's running and he's this is insane he sees those little lights

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,280
 that are like stuck into the ground you know like the little solar panel lights that people

198
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,600
 put around their yards it kind of like makes it look nice I guess but it's these little

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,240
 lanterns that are all over the lawn or along the line of the lawn does that make sense

200
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,680
 but underneath the way they stick into the ground they have a long metal spike they stick

201
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,840
 them into the ground you don't have to worry about them falling over during rainstorm.

202
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:48,320
 Now that's as beautiful as it may look as a lawn ornament coffee goes uh-huh it's time

203
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
 to make my point.

204
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,680
 I didn't really say that but we'll just assume that he did because he picks one of those

205
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,480
 things up and stabs the security guard right in the chest so hard the security guard then

206
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,240
 falls to the ground like a straight up and the guy's like falling back in slow motion

207
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,880
 hits the ground coffee looks over and goes you light up my life and then it lights up

208
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,880
 no okay so anyway coffee goes running goes running off and he's happy that he came over

209
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,800
 that catchphrase he gets into the security guard's car he left it running he's in the

210
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:29,160
 ignition peels off starts driving through the subdivision it's 8 p.m. it's 4th of

211
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,520
 July people are outside of their houses just hanging out eating hamburgers throwing sparklers

212
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,240
 in each other's eyes causing harmless mayhem coffee had other plans he sees a young couple

213
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:50,640
 walking out the street hits him hits him with the vehicle and then like you're at that

214
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,760
 point you're kind of like Jason this stopped being a funny action story now he's just running

215
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,320
 over bystanders and you would think at that point he'd be like wait a second I'm not Jason

216
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,880
 born anymore actually some sort of horrible terrorist he then sees an other young couple

217
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:15,120
 walking across the street hits them too so at this point it's pandemonium in this neighborhood

218
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:23,920
 the police show up sheriff and chp they're like we need to get these sirens fixed that

219
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,880
 sounded terrible cop cars pull up coffee is driving down the street in his van towards

220
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,800
 the cops cop jumps out of his car stop stop the car is coming closer and closer and closer

221
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:46,120
 cops like stop stop the car coffee goes things are about to get complicated he's gunning

222
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,160
 it right towards the cop the cop waits until coffee's van actually strikes his vehicle

223
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,640
 before opening fire hitting him three times one time in the head putting him in a coma

224
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:04,960
 and paralyzing him from the left side not left side down it's the left side over paralyzed

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,320
 everyone survived so I don't want you to feel bad about the one of the women who got hit

226
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,800
 by the car was airlifted out but everyone was survived probably got a couple broken bones

227
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,840
 probably pretty scratched up dude who got stabbed with the light survived and everything

228
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,480
 I'll tell you one thing that didn't survive coffee's freedom he's facing five counts of

229
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,000
 assault with a deadly weapon two counts of attempted murder two counts of assaults on

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,880
 an officer and one count of carjacking because he took the dude's car you'd think it would

231
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,600
 kind of just be theft but anyways 32 year old stanford graduate software engineer at

232
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,680
 youtube 2.35 million dollar bail for taking four hits of acid but I find that stories

233
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,320
 like that fascinating we've talked about it before about people just snapping to me that's

234
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,080
 the scariest of crimes like organized crime stuff like that like they always have like

235
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,600
 an end result serial killers they can't get it up women intimidate them they're a bunch

236
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,920
 of just weak spineless individuals so that's why they kill their mama was mean to them

237
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,400
 that's why they kill they can't get it up their dick doesn't work organized crime they're

238
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,960
 saying we need money like this is one of the things we do to keep order is commit these

239
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,440
 crimes to do these murders but when people just snap I think that's the scariest thing

240
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,200
 because it really is unpredictable this dude was probably never on anyone's trouble charts

241
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,280
 for years and years and years and years and then this happens now yes the four hits of

242
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,080
 acid did help that but still though and his life will radically change he'll probably

243
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,800
 do eight to ten years plead down because he has a you know doesn't have a troubled life

244
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,160
 stuff like that he might do eight to ten years he's going to be sued into oblivion by these

245
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,400
 people but because of one afternoon his life has changed forever I find that fascinating

246
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,960
 and and he almost murdered multiple people he tried to allegedly I find that stuff fascinating

247
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,400
 but anyways let's go ahead and move on to our next story which actually is a story that

248
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,920
 I came across both of these stories I came across right after the end of season five

249
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,240
 there's a couple that popped up and I was like oh man but I had to take that break off

250
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,760
 it really is refreshing for me to take that break off so I'm glad you guys are coming

251
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,120
 back to the show and yeah it'll probably be about two weeks I'll be in Sacramento but

252
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,400
 we'll be on a regular schedule and all of that so let's go ahead and move on to the

253
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:38,720
 story of where'd you go bro I saw a movie last night I've been watching a ton of movies

254
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,520
 on my vacation like I've been doing nothing it was Jersey Shore shark attack I will tell

255
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,840
 you this and I know a lot of you people will not agree with me it's not a very popular

256
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,720
 opinion may lose a couple listeners over it Jersey Shore shark attack actually was pretty

257
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,080
 good but that's not the unpopular opinion it was a parody of Jersey Shore but a bunch

258
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,800
 of sharks showed up I think Snooki is hot I know a lot of people like think she's like

259
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,560
 trashy I've always had a thing for Snooki and she's one of those women who gets hotter

260
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,280
 the older she gets like normally well I'm not gonna finish that sentence but Snooki

261
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,160
 actually is really hot like now that she's a mom she has like three kids and stuff like

262
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,180
 that I actually find her more attractive than when she was like a drunk chick on the boardwalk

263
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,440
 so good on you Snooki god I love Snooki so anyways and they had an actress portraying

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,080
 Snooki and somehow she was actually even hotter very distracting movie but anyway so it was

265
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,480
 good though check it out Jersey Shore shark attack it was funny too which is really hard

266
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,240
 to pull off horror comedies are incredibly hard let's go ahead though and get to our

267
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:54,560
 second story for the evening the year is 1963 February 1st and Thomas Meehan 41 year old

268
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,120
 state worker is driving home from Eureka California to Concord California now that's

269
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,600
 quite a distance it's quite a distance he was on a business trip he had to drive home

270
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,320
 and he was a prominent member boy he was a prominent member of the community in Concord

271
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,800
 he was like on the hospital board people knew him he was very very well liked at work and

272
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 around town a stable individual if there was one four hours out from home he calls his

273
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,320
 wife and says you know I'm not I don't feel good something's wrong with me I don't feel

274
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,800
 good and his wife's like oh honey just get a hotel somewhere you'll be fine you'll be

275
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,920
 fine that's why my wife sound like a creepy goblin all of a sudden but he ignores that

276
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,360
 so he goes to the town of Garberville and checks into a hotel around five o'clock around

277
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,680
 five p.m. nothing suspicious about that just another businessman traveling through a sleepy

278
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,640
 little town in California at 645 Thomas Meehan walks into the Garberville General Hospital

279
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,880
 nurses like smack and gum yeah what do you want Buster we got a lot of injured people

280
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:15,360
 tonight what are you here for and Thomas goes I feel I feel dead I feel dead all over was

281
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,840
 his exact words nurse goes take a number go sit in that other room now you may think I'm

282
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,280
 making a joke she didn't have a she wasn't from the Jersey Shore but oh that'd be hot

283
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,480
 if she was snooki as a nurse sexy nurse outfit they were busy and they did say go sit in

284
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,800
 another room we'll see you in a bit and Thomas just like he had that conversation with the

285
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:47,920
 sexy sexy snooki nurse and then hung around for a bit but then left at 7 p.m. so 15 minutes

286
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,680
 later two witnesses are driving down the road they're driving down highway 101 and they

287
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:04,080
 see a car go off the road into the brush and where the eel river is eel river is this river

288
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,520
 that cuts through that part of California they call the cops now again there's a bit of delay

289
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,760
 there no one had cell phones back then they go to a pay phone to call the cops say we

290
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,640
 saw a car go off the side of the road and cops of course like where's that da da da what time

291
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,640
 did you see the car they say 7 p.m. is when we saw this happen 8 p.m. Thomas mehan walks

292
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,800
 back into his motel and the night manager sitting there filling out some paperwork and

293
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:37,440
 Thomas mehan walks in and what the manager notices is that his ankles like the pants

294
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,640
 his ankle pants the what am I trying to his pants his pants from the ankles area I don't

295
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,360

296
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,560
 to say and his shoes were wet and he could hear him going they're like you chewing gum

297
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,880
 mist he's like yeah I got it from snooki but that sound you heard was actually my wet wet

298
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,080
 shoes walking through your lobby and Thomas mehan walks up to the manager and goes this

 is a exact quote he goes do I seem dead to you feel like I'm dead managers like no no

300
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,360

301
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,360
 away it's not like a mysterious he just turns like a zombie walks away he also says hey

304
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,440
 employee goes into his room and says hey we tried calling your wife and conquered but

305
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,200
 there's something wrong with the phone connection we can't get a hold of her Thomas is like

306
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,360
 okay okay and then that employee says we just haven't talked about the weather for a bit

307
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,640
 like it was a normal conversation there was nothing weird about him except for one detail

308
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,120
 he was wearing different clothes now he seemed to be wearing like a formal attire like a

309
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,560
 black tie suit black slacks black jacket white shirt and he goes and what was weird is I

310
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,360
 didn't really see him come in with any luggage but he was wearing different clothes and we

311
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,000
 had seen him earlier and you figure yeah his pants were wet so he's going to change his

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,320
 clothes at 10 45 p.m. the cops are at the river the eel river and they're looking around

313
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,120
 and they see this car in the river the convertible roof had been ripped open the front end had

314
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,840
 been damaged so it definitely had gone off the road and impacted into the river it wasn't

315
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,560
 like under 10 feet of water it was just like poking out of the river and hit something but

316
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,920
 there was a pair of glasses just reading glasses just neatly folded up and sitting on the passenger

317
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,320
 seat all this violent action around the car and you have those glasses cops are like looking

318
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,920
 around and they're like well we don't see a body this is weird and the other guys like

319
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,520
 hey Tommy look over here and shine the flashlight all dramatically on the ground they see a set

320
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,280
 of footprints not magically appear in front of them but they see a set of footprints in

321
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,760
 the mud heading up the bank and they're like oh whoever was in this car accident that happened

322
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,360
 almost four hours ago it took us that long to get out here that's weird actually that's

323
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,520
 a weird detail it took them that long but we'll get to that that's weird I didn't put

324
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,840
 that connection anyways the cops are out there oh you know what actually now that I think

325
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,280
 about it the cops probably showed up shortly but it took them a while to find where the

326
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,840
 car was I don't know that's kind of weird detail but anyways the cops start following

327
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,480
 the footprints up the bank and they're looking at these muddy footprints leaving from the

328
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,480
 car up the bank and then they just stop cops are looking at each other shining their flashlight

329
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,400
 around looking through the brush and they see where the ground was still soft they see

330
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,040
 where there still should have been more footprints but nothing it was like someone was walking

331
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:54,040
 up out of the bank it just vanished that all happened on February 1st on February 20th

332
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:03,320
 41 year old Thomas Meehan was found in the eel river drowned but it just floating around

333
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:10,320
 bobbing around on the river now this story is very twilight zone-ish it's very carnival

334
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,280
 of souls but what's interesting about it was this was reported on by the Los Angeles Times

335
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,320
 and I think it was the San Diego Times it might have been the San Diego Tribune and

336
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,000
 a couple other newspapers major newspapers at the time because it's such a bizarre story

337
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,400
 and it's one of those stories that everyone kind of goes what it really makes you scratch

338
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,600
 your head now one thing is clear is that he was some people he interacted with people

339
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,800
 in these different locations it was Thomas Meehan's car in the river they knew that

340
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,560
 from the make a model of the car registration things like that that was 100% his car but

341
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,400
 the people who saw the car go over they didn't couldn't identify the driver but you had the

342
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
 person at the motel take his payment have several conversations with Thomas Meehan

343
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,800
 and then you had the nurse at the hospital Snooki who identified him as well had to take

344
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,080
 his information to treat him at both of those locations he said I feel like I'm dead I feel

345
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,240
 like I'm dead and the first time that he was spotted acting like a big old weirdo at 645

346
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,440
 he walks into the Garber Village General Hospital at 645 he checks in with the nurse and says

347
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:26,000
 I feel dead I feel dead all over can you treat me 15 minutes later his car is spotted going

348
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,360
 off the road it's possible yes Jason that he left that he was not feeling good he already

349
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,880
 called his wife and said he was not feeling good he went to the hospital said I'm not

350
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,200
 feeling good they said you're gonna have to wait a bit he waited a short while got in

351
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,160
 his car drove away and whatever he wasn't feeling good about crashed into the river but from

352
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:51,360
 the hospital to any point at eel river from Garberville to any point at eel river it's

353
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,800
 a 55 minute drive so he would have had to driven incredibly fast to leave the hospital

354
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,640
 and crash into that river 50 minutes later it's nearly an hour away is that impossible

355
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,960
 could you go 150 miles an hour sure but it's an odd detail you think he would have been

356
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,760
 seen speeding 150 miles an hour before I got it odd detail the car crashes this was what

357
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,760
 I thought happened because I'm fairly skeptical about a lot of this stuff this was my read

358
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,280
 on this the car crashes he gets out of the car he starts walking up the bank and then

359
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,520
 he just stops leaving footprints not because of any magical thing but his feet aren't

360
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,520
 sinking in as much as they were and what the cops had just misidentified the scene he then

361
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,000
 goes to the hotel like I don't think he was feeling good at all he's driving along he

362
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,840
 does starts feeling sick he calls his wife he goes to the hospital he's not feeling good

363
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,880
 he goes this isn't worth it he goes to the river somehow he gets there going 150 miles

364
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:00,320
 an hour crashes into the river and then walks out and when he goes to the hotel he says

365
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,080
 I still don't feel good but I think he's still in shock that the fact that he got in this

366
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,200
 car accident goes to the hotel his pants are dripping wet he goes he changes his clothes

367
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,480
 and at some point he suffered some sort of brain damage or was not feeling good already

368
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,440
 plus the horrible car accident at some point he goes oh crap my car is in the river because

369
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:29,480
 he's not thinking right he got some brain damage he will then walk back to the car and he drowns

370
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,280
 like he's messing around with his car he's trying to pull it out or whatever and he drowns

371
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,360
 the thing about being skeptical is usually like everything I said as stupid as a decision

372
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,080
 it could be are things people would do i.e. taking two extra hits acid when you're already

373
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,200
 having a bad trip people do stupid things especially if you've had a concussion or something

374
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,160
 he could have walked back to the hotel and then realized you know what I'm just gonna

375
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,600
 go back and pull my car out of the water myself the problem with that version of events is

376
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,000
 that he would then have to walk back you would figure that actually now to think about it

377
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,040
 if he way whoa okay I didn't think about this if he if Garberville's 55 minutes away and

378
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:18,480
 he drove there in 15 minutes and gotten this car accident at 7 p.m. at 8 p.m. he comes back

379
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,720
 to the motel you couldn't a 55 minute drive you couldn't walk in 55 minutes that's impossible

380
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,800
 and there's no I didn't see any record of a taxi cab picking this guy up so as a skeptic

381
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,880
 I thought that it was probably something likely happened but at the same time we also have

382
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,760
 to say there are a lot of weird things going on here let's throw off our skeptic caps and

383
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,880
 put on our conspiracy cap guy gets in a car accident this is my this is my conspiracy

384
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 not conspiracy there this is my paranormal take on it he knew he was going to die his

385
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,640
 body knew that this was his last night on earth wasn't feeling good but it was time

386
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,160
 to go so he's facing two different things his body is basically saying goodbye to the

387
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,200
 mortal world because I've always wondered if the day you die if you know you're going

388
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,280
 to die we look at people go whoa he was just walking on the street got hit by a car but

389
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,080
 we don't know if that person was like you know what just have a feeling I'm going to

390
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,320
 die today and for someone who suffers anxiety attacks like I do that's not a fun thought

391
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,080
 because I always think I'm going to die every single day but I wonder that so maybe that's

392
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,880
 the reason why he wasn't feeling good was that he was like I'm going to die today and

393
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,800
 he goes to the hospital because he thinks I'm going to die today and they're like no

394
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,720
 you're lunatic he goes drives he gets in the car accident and at that point he basically

395
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:52,720
 splits into his own little multiverse he basically quantum reality or quit as a basically quantum

396
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,200
 immortality is where you die you've moved to another universe he just kept moving into

397
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,120
 the same one I know this is getting really weird he dies in the car accident and his

398
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,160
 body floats out into the river okay but his him not his spirit because he's walking around

399
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,040
 signing paychecks and opening doors and stuff like that him also splits off into the Thomas

400
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:23,480
 mehan who starts walking up the bank of the river but because that's a physical impossibility

401
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:31,200
 everything's like things are happening that are impossible to happen IE walking a 55 minute

402
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,560
 drive in an hour he appears at the hotel he goes there do I feel dead he was already dead

403
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,440
 at that point you can make the argument he may have even died of a heart attack way before

404
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,520
 he even got to Garberville like he could have been splintering out every single way the

405
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,960
 fact of the matter is he is dead and people seeing him around town around the time he

406
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,120
 should have really been floating down the river face first I know that's kind of a brutal

407
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,640
 image but it really makes you quite I really makes you question a lot of things that's

408
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,200
 why I really like this story because it makes you wonder if you've ever interacted with somebody

409
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,600
 who's already dead this was a big story because he was such a prominent member of his town

410
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,520
 the sheriff from Concord drove hours and hours and hours and up with like a team of 20 people

411
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,080
 to investigate this they wanted to know what happened to their buddy that's why it was

412
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,440
 such big news but you wonder you ever go to like a fast food restaurant you're sitting

413
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,960
 in a bar there's a kid sitting next to you on the bus you look over at him and they look

414
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,080
 normal but something a little off about them now they're not going to turn to you and say

415
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,960
 do I look dead they don't know you they just know they're not having a good day they know

416
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,760
 that there's something not right in the way they feel today you just kind of sit there

417
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:01,320
 and you watch them they just seem to be staring off into the distance then eventually something

418
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,840
 catches their eye or they get reminded of something and they stand up and walk away you never

419
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,640
 see him again you're just a passerby we run into hundreds of people a day in the modern

420
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,640
 world but what are the and it's statistically improbable that this would happen but what

421
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:26,240
 if that person was already dead at home sitting in their favorite chair they passed away but

422
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,560
 somehow they're not a ghost they can still interact with the environment they can still

423
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,880
 talk to people they don't have chains but they're still able to move about the world

424
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,360
 for a short amount of time and them not really knowing that they're dead still interacting

425
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:49,480
 with us do you think that's possible and if that is possible who's to say I'm not already

426
00:30:49,480 --> 00:31:14,760
 dead and you're listening to a podcast recorded by a corpse.

427
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
