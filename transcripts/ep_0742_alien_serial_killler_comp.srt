1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When a young woman is mysteriously murdered, the only clue the police have is the contents of her stomach.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Then we take a look at a bizarre tale of UFO abduction, which makes us ask the question,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 are serial killers in league with aliens from another world today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you are having fun living out your life, achieving your dreams.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Speaking of dreaming, in comes one of... here comes the dreamiest Patreon supporter ever.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command, one of our newest Patreon supporters, it's Theo Sybold.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Theo Sybold walking on in.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Theo, you're gonna be our capital poster. Theo, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Really, really helps out a lot. When you promote the show, the show grows. It's as simple as that.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Theo, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 We are headed all the way out to Illinois.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Theo's driving this Jason Jalopy. The top is down. We are roaming across the highways and byways of the United States.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Specifically, we're headed to Northern Illinois University. It's October 2nd, 1970.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And as we're pulling up in front of this university, I want to give a shout out to LiveRabbitfur.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 That's the person who turned me on to the story. I never heard the story before until I saw a post by LiveRabbitfur,

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 so thank you very much for sending the story my way.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It's October 2nd, 1970. There's a young woman named Donna Dahl.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And she's like, "Bye, guys!" She's walking out of her classroom. She's walking across campus.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And they're like, "Hey, Donna, see you later for the sock hopper, whatever the world people were doing in 1970.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Surely it'll be the bees knees," Donna says as she continues her journey, leaving school.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Now, that's fine. Students are allowed to leave their classes.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 We don't live in a fascist dictatorship yet.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But she leaves. That's not abnormal. What's abnormal is her not coming back.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 She hasn't come back to her dorm, her roommates miss her. She has some plans with her friends.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 She doesn't show up for those plans. And when she's not showing up to class the next day, people are getting really, really worried about her.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So they start looking for her. They can't find her. They alert the authorities.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Authorities start looking for her. She becomes an official missing person. Donna Dahl, 21 years old.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Now, at that age, the police know maybe she had a boyfriend and she skipped town and she's on some trip.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Maybe she's cheating on her boyfriend and she skipped town with his new boyfriend.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 So at a certain age, the police do look into the missing person's case, but they have to think it's a college-aged girl.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 She might be off finding herself.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 But nine days later, that turned out not to be the case, because nine days later, they find her about a mile away from the college.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 There's a cornfield. This is the spookiest place, right?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Apparently, a guy and these two girls were walking through this cornfield.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Look how far I can go in and they're going into the cornfield and he sees the body of a dead woman in the cornfield.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And he tells the two girls, "Don't look! Super spooky!" And they go, they get the authorities, authorities show up.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And sure enough, it is the body of Donna Dahl.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Now, she was wearing...she was leaving school. So she had on like a trench coat. She had on shoes, obviously.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 She had her purse. All of that stuff was gone. She would still was partially clothed, but her trench coat, her shoes, and her purse were gone.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And they would never been recovered to this day.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And I guess I should jump to the gun. I guess I should jump to the ending, too.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Her murderer has never been found, either.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 To this day, this is an unsolved mystery.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 But the reason why I'm jumping to the gun, because the fact that this is an unsolved murder case isn't why I'm covering it on this show.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 There are some other details that make it, that elevate it to just average true crime.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I know there's probably like family members listening to this podcast. They're like, "My daughter, my daughter, why are you saying this was that?"

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You know what I mean? Like, on a scale of, like, Ted Bundy being the lamest, and then...

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 The episode we did about the demonically possessed guy in Britain who ripped a poodle in half with his bare hands.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Like, that's a 10. That's a 10, right?

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Chopped his wife up with a butcher knife and then ripped their dog in half with his bare hands.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 That's a 10. Ted Bundy. Lamo.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 On a scale of ripping your dog apart, being a 10 and Ted Bundy being a 1.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Super normy, serial killer nonsense. It's just lame. I hate the Ted Bundy story, Super Mourn.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I rate this a little bit above that.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Woman goes missing, we don't know who did it.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 The reason why I think this is more interesting than the Ted Bundy thing is, one, we never found out who did it.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And serial killers you get caught are lame. You're lame.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 You have one job, not to get caught.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 This guy wasn't caught. This guy... I'm not saying, okay, let me back here.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Now it sounds like I'm saying this guy's some sort of winner. I'm like, well, this guy's a way better than Ted Bundy,

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 but he's less good than any other person on the planet.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 The guy who killed Donna Doll has never been caught, but I'm not even covering the story because it's an unsolved mystery.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 There's a part of this story that is so bizarre that Internet sleuths are going crazy over this.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I read a lot of true crime stuff, and I later read a lot of true crime stuff online, and there's always the armchair detectives.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I do it too, right? I've done it on this show trying to solve a case, but I've never seen people say such dumb things over and over again.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 If one person had said a dumb thing, that'd be one thing. We would just all laugh at that person, but I can't believe how much people...

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 They're so bizarre how they seem to be so puzzled. Now I'm puzzled by this as well, but I don't really...

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I'm puzzled enough, and I know the limits of my own deductive skills that I don't even put on a conspiracy cap.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I have no idea how this is possible. None.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So let me tell you what I'm talking about. When they found Donna Doll's body, there was two unique things about it.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 One, they could tell that she'd been suffocated, but usually when you're suffocating someone with like a pillow or a sweater,

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 they will inhale the fabric from the sweater.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So hopefully it's not wool, right? Super itchy wool. You're all "Ugh! It's all itchy in your throat!"

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 You're like, "Oh man, how come you couldn't suffocate me with satin?"

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 If you hold the pillow down on someone's head or wrap a sweater around their face or whatever, they'll inhale the fabric, she'll find a...

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 They didn't find any of that in her lungs, in her airways.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 They found what... This is an interesting thing. They found a "mysterious substance."

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And sometimes you'll see... 'Cause I read a couple articles on this. Sometimes they'll just leave it at that mysterious substance.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And then there are other articles that... 'Cause that makes you think, "Oh, was Glipglorp the space alien smothering her?"

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 No, the mysterious substance, they didn't know how to identify it at the time. They believed it was plastic.

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 They believed that she was suffocated with a plastic bag. But at the time...

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I don't know if these detectives didn't know what plastic looked like under a microscope.

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 But that's an interesting tidbit, because what's gonna happen is over... This story's already, like, what, 40 years old?

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 But over time, there'll be less and less articles naming it as plastic, and you'll see more and more articles mentioning the mysterious substance.

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 You'll see conspiracies. People were talking about all sorts of Russian interference in this story, that this mysterious substance was some sort of toxin.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Well, that's because the article you read didn't give it context. The mysterious substance we know now is plastic.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 The reason why I think the Soviets may have been involved was she was steadying to be a teacher, and her specialty was she was learning Russian.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So some people thought it may be the Russians poisoned her with a "mysterious substance."

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 She was suffocated with a plastic bag, or a plastic fabric of some sort.

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But even that's not the reason why we're covering this on Dead Rat Radio. That, like, we can kind of explain.

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 No article, not a single article, was able to put forth how this "why" this is, or how it's possible.

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 When you eat something, if you die within about 12 hours, you haven't digested it properly.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So that's how they can tell, like, what the last thing you ate was.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 They can't tell, if you ate in the morning and then you died two days later, you hadn't eaten anything, you were in an RV, and you're like, "Ahh, ahh, ahh!"

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I'd rather sit here and die than have an RV's roast beef sandwich.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They wouldn't be able to tell what you ate two or three days ago, but that helps them estimate the time of death.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 That's one of the things, if there's food in your stomach, they can go, "Well, they've died at least within the past 12 hours, because this food is undigested."

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 They found this young woman, Donna Dahl, with potatoes in her stomach.

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Five to six pounds. You know that they weighed this. You know that they had to have weighed this.

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 She had, that was, that's, you got the intern to do that, you're like, "Get out that ice cream scoop and start scooping out that tummy."

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Five to six pounds of potatoes in her stomach.

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Somehow, Donna Dahl ate five to six pounds, let's just say six pounds, because I don't want a calf to use that.

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 She ate six pounds of potatoes within a 12-hour period.

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Now, I know what you're thinking. You could do that, right?

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You're like, "Jason, I totally wasn't thinking that. I'm as puzzled as you are."

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I could probably eat two pounds of french fries.

111
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Actually, I'm not going to add a "probably" on that. I know I can eat two pounds of french fries, because I can easily eat two pounds of mashed potatoes in a day in a meal.

112
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 In one meal, I can eat two pounds of mashed potatoes, and I have.

113
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But five pounds of potatoes they found in her stomach, and they don't know if this is a clue.

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 They don't know if this is an eating disorder.

115
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 They don't know if this is the way she died.

116
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 They have no idea.

117
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 They just know that one of the clues is she had six pounds of potatoes in her stomach that she had eaten no more than 12 hours before she died.

118
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So now, it's a mystery.

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I mean, technically, to the friends and family of Donna Dahl, her death, and it not being solved is the mystery.

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And that is a tragic thing.

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But unfortunately, we cover stuff like that all the time on this show. I don't think I've ever come across.

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 I can guarantee you in what, 740 episodes, we've never had someone who had six pounds of potatoes in their stomach when they died.

123
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 That's a mystery, and we don't know how or why they got there.

124
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Now, you would assume she had to eat them.

125
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And what's funny is that when you say she had six pounds of potatoes in her stomach, what did you picture?

126
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 The remaining listeners.

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 The remaining listeners who weren't eating potato all grottin'.

128
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 They're like, "Oh, this episode will be great to eat my grandma's favorite recipe."

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 You imagine five or six pounds of floating Idaho potatoes in her stomach, right?

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Do you?

131
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And I think that's part of the problem is why it's such an evocative image.

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 If somebody said, "Hey, what do you have there?"

133
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And that bag, and somebody goes, "Oh, I have six pounds of potatoes."

134
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 You would know that they were six pounds of potatoes.

135
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Because that's what they're called. If they were French fries, you would say that.

136
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 If they were mashed potatoes, they would say that.

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 If they were tater tots, you would say that.

138
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I have six pounds of tater tots in this bag.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 So when you picture six pounds of potatoes in a human body, this woman was very slight.

140
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 She was like, maybe like 120 pounds or something like that.

141
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 She was a very, very slim woman to have six pounds of potatoes in you, just potatoes, floating around in you.

142
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 The visual doesn't make sense, but we understand that there's no way that she crammed six pounds of potatoes down her throat.

143
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 She obviously ate them.

144
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So once you start to think of that visual, it starts to make a little more sense.

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But even then, how did she eat six pounds of potatoes in 12 hours?

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Like, could you do that?

147
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Could you eat 12 pounds of potatoes?

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And they're not listed as being French fries, maybe they're all mushed up.

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Potatoes.

150
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Fried potatoes.

151
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Maybe I don't know why so fixated on how the potatoes were prepared.

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Because the doctors didn't bring out the recipe book.

153
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 They're matching it to, they're like going through the cookbook.

154
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 They're like, it kind of looks like that.

155
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 But based on the consistency and the flavor, this doesn't taste like hash browns.

156
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Let's keep looking.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I don't think they were worried about the recipe.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 The point is, how did she get six pounds of potatoes in her?

159
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And let's go back to these internet sluts.

160
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I've never seen anything this ridiculous.

161
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I read this and I go, what an interesting mystery.

162
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Woman, dead, never found the killer, six pounds of potatoes in her.

163
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That's interesting.

164
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I'll probably cover it on the topic or maybe do a TikTok on it because it's fairly short.

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And then I started reading the comments here.

166
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And there was a user who went by the name Anonymous.

167
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 They just posted this.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 This is a break, like this story is just, it's old, but it's just gaining traction again because it's popping up online.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 There was a user who went by the name Anonymous said, this was their theory.

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Pregnant women get a thing called pica, some of them do, where they eat weird things.

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Some women eat brick dust.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It's basically because your body's telling you it's short of mineral that it needs for the baby to be born.

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And some people have pica all the time.

174
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 But they're thinking maybe she was just nibbling on potatoes and she was pregnant.

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 That's possible.

176
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And then Anonymous weaves this web that her boyfriend found out she was pregnant because she was eating potatoes all the time.

177
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So her boyfriend who didn't want the baby murdered her and dropped her off in the cornfield.

178
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 What?

179
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I mean, I get, if I was hanging out with a, if I had a girlfriend and I'm hanging out with her and I come home and she's nibbling on a potato,

180
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I'm not going to think she's pregnant.

181
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I'm going to think she's a big old weirdo, but I'm not going to think she's pregnant.

182
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I was wondering where my French fries are.

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Man, I was saving those potatoes for later.

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 If I saw a woman eat six pounds of potatoes in front of me, I'd take her to the circus.

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I'd take her to Ripley's, believe it or not.

186
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Have her sign up for the freak show and make some money.

187
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I don't think I would go, ah, she must be pregnant.

188
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 She must be having a baby.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 But you know, a theory nonetheless.

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 There is another user named Dirt Pink.

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And this was their idea of eating disorder.

192
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 A couple of people said this, that she had an eating disorder and she was binging on potatoes.

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But she didn't have a place to purge because she was in a college dorm.

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And college dorms have really thin walls.

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And she'd eaten all these potatoes and now she's in the purge faction.

196
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Now she's in the purge phase where she has to throw up.

197
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 She goes to the bathroom, she tries throwing up.

198
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And if someone hears her and she doesn't want anyone to know her secret,

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 even though they just noticed throughout the day she ate six pounds of potatoes.

200
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So she leaves school by, albeit that party later, and she runs a mile to the cornfield.

201
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And begins to purge up these potatoes in private.

202
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And then suffocates on the potatoes that she's throwing up.

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Now this is clearly someone who did not read the article.

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 This is what I talk about when people just read the headline of these things.

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Because let's say all that's true.

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Where's her trench coat or shoe in her purse?

207
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Did she throw up so much potatoes it created like a little,

208
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 actually if she's throwing up the potatoes, how did they find the six pounds of potatoes in her?

209
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So dirt pink, terrible, terrible suggestion.

210
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 We have Goiff, ascetic, who thinks it might have been hazing,

211
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 college hazing, eat the potatoes.

212
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Eat the potatoes, it's the potassium cult.

213
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It's alpha, beta, potassium, everyone's favorite fraternity.

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Then we get into saw level ones.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Things that jigsaw would be like, "Ah, that's a little unbelievable, even for me."

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Deputy Dog states that maybe, maybe, picture this.

217
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 You come home, you come home and you're expected to have a delicious baked potato.

218
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It's what you have every night.

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 You have a single baked potato for dinner, it's delicious sour cream and butter.

220
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And we just keep putting stuff on it until it tastes good.

221
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 You come home and some of your potatoes are missing.

222
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You only have so many potatoes for the month.

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And your roommate, Donna, she has potato skins, she has potato skins all around her feet.

224
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And you're like, "Dude, where are my potatoes?"

225
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And she's like, "I don't know, these potato skins were here when I got here."

226
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And you are so enraged at Donna for getting, this is actually what,

227
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 this is actually what a living, breathing human being believes may have happened.

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 You are so enraged at someone for eating your potatoes that you still have.

229
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 You still have six pounds of potatoes, by the way.

230
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 They didn't eat all your potatoes.

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 You're so enraged at Donna for eating your potatoes.

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 That you force-feed her the remaining.

233
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 You're like, "You know what? You like eating my food? Eat all my food.

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Eat it all in your room."

235
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 It's like, "Okay, I'll totally do that."

236
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 She force-feeds her the other six pounds of the potatoes.

237
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And she chokes on the potatoes, she suffocates on the potatoes and dies.

238
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And then this roommate transports the body all the way to the cornfield,

239
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 drops it off and leaves and takes her purse and her trench coat

240
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and is able to hide that material for the longest time.

241
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 That is a suggestion.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 These people are losing their mind.

243
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 That just makes no sense at all.

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It's so weird.

245
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 All of these hypotheses that are coming out about this,

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 that's what actually makes it interesting.

247
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 It's really sad because Donna Dahl is such a...

248
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 When you type in Donna Dahl, you'll find nothing about this person.

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Imagine this. Imagine you died.

250
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 This is horrible as I laugh.

251
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Imagine you died.

252
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Imagine you died because you mistakenly drank a bunch of castor oil instead of diapepsy.

253
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 You drink it all and you poop yourself to death.

254
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But your name is John Smith.

255
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 You have a pretty standard name.

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 So 40 years later, if anyone ever wants to find out information about you,

257
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 they just can't put in your name.

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 They have to put in John Smith pooped himself to death.

259
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And then you get a couple articles.

260
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 With Donna Dahl, it's like that.

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 If you type in Donna Dahl, you'll get nothing.

262
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 You'll get photos of Dahl's named Donna or Donna's Dahl Shop or whatever.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 You have to type in Donna Dahl.

264
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Donna Dahl potatoes.

265
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 She's linked forever to what was in her stomach.

266
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And then you'll get a couple links.

267
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Like I said, this story is old, but it's starting to gain traction.

268
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 The first three links are like within the past couple of days.

269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 But you have to put in Donna Dahl potatoes.

270
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Imagine if anyone ever wanted to find you in the future,

271
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 it would have to do with the massive amount of food that they found in you when you died.

272
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Jason Carpenter, double decker tacos.

273
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Be like, "Oh, that's kind of bad."

274
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But I did deserve because I did eat 30 pounds of double decker tacos.

275
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 We're leaving behind Illinois, Theo Fire Up this Carpenter copter.

276
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 We are headed all the way out to Bebe de Ruo in Brazil.

277
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 It's May 3rd, 1969.

278
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 We're in Bebe de Ruo.

279
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 That's in Mozzo Zeno's in Brazil.

280
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 It's 3 p.m.

281
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 It's a beautiful sunny day.

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 It's a perfect day to go fishing.

283
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Jose Antonio de Silva is doing just that.

284
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 He puts up his tent, kicks back, looks at the stars and goes,

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 "What a wonderful day to go.

286
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I waited a little late. It's nighttime.

287
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But tomorrow I will start my fishing expedition."

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And he does.

289
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He's fishing and everything is absolutely perfect.

290
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 He's on vacation.

291
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 He's a soldier in the Brazilian army.

292
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But they get a little R&R every now and then.

293
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And this is how he spends his relaxing time.

294
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 He hears something in the bushes behind him.

295
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 [Bushes]

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 He's thinking squirrel or goats or something's just moving around in the bushes.

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 He's not really worried about it.

298
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Until he hears the whispering.

299
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Now you don't have to be a zoologist to know that animals don't whisper.

300
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And he was not a zoologist so that is perfect.

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 He turns around to see what it is.

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And as he's turning, he is blasted with a beam of light.

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Completely paralyzed.

304
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 He's right then his fishing pole starts going crazy.

305
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 It was the biggest fish ever, I swear.

306
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I almost caught it.

307
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 He sees come out of the bushes two humanoids.

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 They're both fully encased in this bizarre space suit.

309
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It covers every inch of skin on them.

310
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 So he can't make out any facial features.

311
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He can't make out their skin tone or anything like that.

312
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 There's this gray suit and they have this domed helmet on.

313
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Almost like they're wearing like a bullet helmet.

314
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And they begin walking out of the bushes.

315
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He's frozen. He can't react to this.

316
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 They literally just each grab a sight of him, lift him up,

317
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 and drag him towards their spaceship.

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's this cylinder landing craft that's sitting there in this meadow.

319
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 He's brought on board and he realizes he's in this room.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 This is very common in UFO lore, UFOlogy.

321
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 He's in a room that's brightly lit, but there's no source of the light.

322
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It seems to just be coming from everywhere.

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 They make him sit down in a chair in the middle of this room.

324
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And they put a helmet on him.

325
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 They put one of these dome helmets on him.

326
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And he says it is very, very uncomfortable.

327
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It's actually really heavy.

328
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It's hurting his neck and his shoulders how heavy this thing is.

329
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And the cylinder he can tell begins to lift off.

330
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 [Lift Off Sound]

331
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 He's leaving Earth.

332
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Whether it's atmospheric, whether it's the helmet,

333
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 it's unclear, but he is having a hard time breathing.

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 The lights of the room, even with the helmet on, are incredibly bright.

335
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 A super uncomfortable spaceflight.

336
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And again, the helmet, like whenever he's no longer paralyzed,

337
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 whenever he moves, he can feel the helmet kind of dig into his skin.

338
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It was not designed for a human, but he is required to have it on.

339
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 [Lift Off Sound]

340
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 The vehicle lands somewhere and he is ushered into another room.

341
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And they take his helmet off.

342
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Then they take their own helmets off.

343
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 He can now see what these humans are.

344
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 I mean, they look exactly like humans.

345
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 They have a few different features.

346
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 They are four feet tall. They have red hair that reaches down to their waist.

347
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So in their dome helmet, they had to stuff all that hair.

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 They had big green eyes. He drew pictures of them.

349
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And one of the pictures that looked like it was nothing but green.

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 But when I was reading a description of one of these articles,

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 they had dark black pupils.

352
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 So I'm not for sure which one is accurate, his drawing or the article.

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 But either way, they had a naturally large green eyes.

354
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 They had pointed noses and a wide mouth, a mouth wider than a human.

355
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 He said it reminded him of a fish's mouth and they had no teeth either.

356
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 They all had white skin and they just kind of stood around him.

357
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 One of these people stepped forward and again, this is very common in UFOology.

358
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 He immediately recognizes this one as the leader.

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And there's this white slap in this room that the leader begins drawing images on.

360
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Josep realizes that this is how they plan on communicating with him.

361
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 They're going to draw pictures and that is how they're going to talk to him.

362
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 There is no language that they're speaking to him and there's no telepathy.

363
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Which that is something that does happen in a lot of UFO stories, more than I can even count.

364
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 They're not able to speak to him telepathically. They can't speak to him vocally.

365
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 But they're drawing pictures and that is how they're going to communicate with him.

366
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 But as he's looking at these pictures, he can't really make sense of them.

367
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 When he is taken on board, he had like a satchel on him.

368
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And these aliens have taken the satchel off him and begin rummaging through it.

369
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And anything that there is a duplicate of, they are keeping.

370
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 So he has two fish hooks, two different types of knives.

371
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 They're taking the second item but leaving him the original.

372
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 The one thing that he only has one copy of that they keep is his ID card.

373
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 They're fascinated by his ID.

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And while they're doing this, he's kind of taken in the room.

375
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 He's kind of looking around the room. The leader is still drawing on this white board.

376
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And he sees this motif on one wall and it's pictures of animals.

377
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Jaguars and owls and foxes and these animals drawn on this wall.

378
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And then also on the wall is modern technology.

379
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Cities and cars and houses and things like that.

380
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And underneath these painted images on this wall are four human bodies.

381
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Not drawings of human bodies.

382
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Four dead people.

383
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 All male.

384
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Three Caucasian. One black.

385
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Jose is looking at these bodies and he gets a weird sense about them.

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I mean, in fact, they've been abducted and surrounded by a bunch of dwarves.

387
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 He feels...

388
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He doesn't know how he comes across. He doesn't know how he figures this out.

389
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But he feels these four men were not killed by the aliens.

390
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 The leaders continue to draw on this white board and he's getting a sense.

391
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Again, he's having a really hard time figuring this out, but he gets a sense that the leader is saying,

392
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 "We will not harm you, but you need to drink. You need to drink.

393
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 You need to have energy for what we're about to do."

394
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And they bring him out this vile green concoction in a little cup and he refuses it.

395
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And one of the aliens looks at him and then he drinks it himself and then holds it out to show,

396
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 "This isn't toxic. This isn't poisonous. I'm willing to drink it."

397
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And Jose takes the concoction, smells it. It's disgusting.

398
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 It's kind of what he expected. He drinks it and he said the taste was not very good,

399
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 but he immediately felt himself invigorated and the drawings began to make more sense.

400
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 When he looked at what the leader was drawing, it was very clear what he was intending to say.

401
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And what he was intending to say was a mission.

402
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 They will take Jose back to Earth.

403
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 So at that point you figure he's on some sort of mothership.

404
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 They didn't take him to a cave or an underground alien base.

405
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 If not on their homeworld, he is off-planet at this point.

406
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I don't know if we've made that clear, but because he really doesn't know.

407
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 He's just moved from one room to another.

408
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 But they say, "We will take you back to Earth.

409
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 For three years you will collect specimens for us and gather information.

410
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Then we will come back down and you will come back to our planet for seven years.

411
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 After seven years we will bring you back to Earth."

412
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And one of three things is going to happen.

413
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Now they didn't tell him...

414
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 It wasn't sure it was an adventure.

415
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 They didn't tell him one of three things was going to happen.

416
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 But again, I read multiple articles about this.

417
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And depending on the article, they had a different version of events of what would happen.

418
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 One of them was he would be brought back to Earth and he would be their guide.

419
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 He would walk around Earth and show them all that he had known, all that he had learned, where the specimens came from.

420
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 He would be like a tour guide.

421
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 One of the articles I read said they would leave him here and he would be a spiritual leader on Earth.

422
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 He would become a very powerful speaker.

423
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 He would become a very powerful man and speak the religion of the aliens, guide the world towards what they wanted it.

424
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Or they just bring him back.

425
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And that's the end of it.

426
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 The deal would be you help us out, then you come back to our world for seven years and then you're done.

427
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Ten years total and then you do whatever you want.

428
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 That sounds dope.

429
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Like honestly, I would take up on that offer.

430
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So if I disappear for seven years, I'm probably floating around in space.

431
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 But that sounds reasonable.

432
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 That sounds pretty reasonable.

433
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 You know, you do three years here and then you're floating around in space for seven years and then maybe a spiritual leader.

434
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 I mean, all three of those options are fine.

435
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Bringing them back to Earth as their guide and not as their leader of their invasion force.

436
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 You're not betraying humanity, right?

437
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Or are you?

438
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 We'll get to that in a second.

439
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I kind of gave it away in the intro, but we're building to that.

440
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 He rejects all three, he rejects the offer though.

441
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 He doesn't want to do it and they get super angry at him.

442
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And they can't really talk to him, but he senses their anger.

443
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And he immediately remembers the four bodies.

444
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He probably didn't forget the four bodies in there, but he starts to think of the four bodies.

445
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And he thinks he's in danger and he has a crucifix around his neck and he holds onto it and begins praying.

446
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And this comes into a lot of UFO stories.

447
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 A lot of times people pray on UFOs and the aliens just disappear.

448
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 They're powerless in front of the power of Christ.

449
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 We've covered that a lot of times on the show.

450
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Again, so many, I don't even think I can count them.

451
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 It happens a lot in UFO lore.

452
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 These aliens, this makes them even matter.

453
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 And the leader alien rips the crucifix off of Jose's neck and keeps it.

454
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Keeps the crucifix.

455
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 He puts it in his pocket and is like, "No."

456
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And as the leader is walking back to the whiteboard to write another message, this story is so weird.

457
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Like, if all that stuff was normal, Jose standing there, he doesn't know what's going to happen next.

458
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 A monk appears.

459
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 A human appears and monk clothes just teleports into the middle of the room and is staring at Jose and looking at him.

460
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And he gives him this sensation, this feeling that he is loved and he is protected.

461
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And none of the other aliens know this is going on.

462
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 None of the other people in this room react to the fact that another human just teleported into the spaceship.

463
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 We covered that on another episode and I don't even know what episode that would have been.

464
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 You guys know the episodes better than I do at this point.

465
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 But we covered that on another episode where a person was abducted and an angel showed up.

466
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But what was interesting was in that episode, the aliens reacted to the presence of an angel.

467
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 They were like, "What's he doing on the ship? How did he get on here?"

468
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 It's set off a security crisis.

469
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And this one, this monk figure showed up, which implies that it's religious, right?

470
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 It's dressed in religious garb. It's a religious leader. The crucifix is ripped off. He shows up.

471
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 So, it's still a religion angle, but these aliens have no idea their security has just been breached.

472
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 But because he's rejected this, these aliens actually decide, you know what? Throw a blindfold on him.

473
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Put the helmet, put the uncomfortable helmet on him.

474
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Throw him back on the ship. We're going to take him back to Earth.

475
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 He is no good for us. We're going to drop him back off.

476
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And in typical alien jerk fashion, when Jose comes to a census, he's like in the semi-conscious state,

477
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 he stumbles out of the ship and he wakes up and he's in a forest.

478
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 He just begins wandering through the forest. He's parched.

479
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 He realizes that he has a beard, so he's been gone for a couple of days.

480
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 He finally finds a road. He finally finds a town. He finally talks to the populace.

481
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 It turns out he's 200 miles away from where he was picked up.

482
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 So, as a classic UFO story, it has a lot of the hallmarks that we talk about,

483
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 but it also has enough interesting stuff, like the aliens not being telepathic.

484
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 The drawing, the technology of drawing to communicate. That's very novel. I really like that idea.

485
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 The religious figure teleporting out of the ship, we've only covered that twice out of what? 740 episodes.

486
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 That's incredibly rare in UFO lore. People praying while they're abducted by aliens, that's common,

487
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 but the idea of a figure showing up. But I read this story and I thought,

488
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 "Let's put on a conspiracy cap and wrap it up like this."

489
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 I thought this was my thinking. The four bodies were not killed by the aliens.

490
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And we see humans as brothers and sisters. They're part of our clan. They're part of our culture.

491
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Our species. But to something outside of that, we're nothing more than specimens.

492
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 What if serial killers, as much as I think they're super lame, this would make them pretty cool?

493
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 What if serial killers have been offered this deal? Aliens show up and say,

494
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 "Listen, we're going to take you on a galactic adventure and all you have to do is bring up some specimens to us."

495
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 You don't even have to bring them to us. You just have to prepare them and we will collect them.

496
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 The specimens we're looking for are humans.

497
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And they observe these serial killers going about their work.

498
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 It's a weird combination of true crime and sci-fi, but it would make sense.

499
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 When a scientist needs to go out into the wilderness, sure, they can go out there with a bunch of guns and tag black bears and stuff like that.

500
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Imagine if they had to keep taking these black bears back to the lab. They couldn't study them in the wild.

501
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Or they couldn't do the studies they wanted to in the wild. So that would bring them back.

502
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Now imagine that black bear also is smart enough and wily enough and has access to firearms and can out-think people.

503
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And sure, it can get paralyzed and get their memory wiped, but every single interaction between an alien and a human has such a high level of violence.

504
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And that's why they do have to paralyze us. That's why they do have to use these beam weapons.

505
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Because the level of violence is so high. Humans are very, very violent species.

506
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And aliens most likely are too. If they've mastered rocket technology to leave their planet, they've mastered rockets on their planet through warfare.

507
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 But instead of aliens coming down and being caught and risk having their bodies left, or just even risk dying, they're not worried about the grand disclosure.

508
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 They just don't want to get their head caved in with a Louisville slugger.

509
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 They make allegiances with serial killers, with people who have no problem taking human lives, and might have wanted to do it anyways.

510
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 I mean, obviously if you put any weight on this conspiracy theory, it'd probably fall apart.

511
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I don't think it's anything I can actually prove, but I do think that it is possible that an alien force would work.

512
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 And actually now that I think about it, when you have governments wanting to take down other governments or seditious groups, they use people on the inside to do it.

513
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 You use saboteurs, you use assassins, you spies. So aliens would have to have that same thing in our human population.

514
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Some of them may be generals, some of them may be presidents, world leaders, who have bought into the alien agenda.

515
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 But some of them could be just Bob working down the street, the barista, the nice guy who always gives you a little bit extra whipped cream on your Frappuccino.

516
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And what would he get out of this deal with the aliens? It's not like he was getting power, maybe he was getting protection.

517
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Maybe he was finally able to revel in his lust to take human life.

518
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And the aliens are watching this, they're steady in this, they're seeing how humans hunt other humans.

519
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 They're seeing what it takes to turn humans against each other. That could be the experiment.

520
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 It would make sense that aliens would side with horrible parts of humanity.

521
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Because wars can be won without a single bullet or paralyzing space ray fired. If you can get the population to turn on itself.

522
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 If you can turn humans into hunters of humans.

523
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Over time you can have the world so subjugated by fear, terror and torment.

524
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 You could be protecting serial killers or propping up terrorist regimes.

525
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Puppet governments all over the planet. Chaos and bloodshed.

526
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 And whether it's a serial killer taking the lives of young coeds or the President of the United States defunding the military.

527
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 And making us unable to withstand an impending intergalactic invasion.

528
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Both scenarios end the same. We were betrayed by our own kind.

529
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 They made a deal with the aliens. And now we are the ones who will pay the price.

530
