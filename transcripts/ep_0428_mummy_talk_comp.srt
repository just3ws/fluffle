1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 A woman has a terrifying experience that we can all relate to. Is it possible that you can create

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:18,640
 superfood by sucking on a seed and then for the first time in human history, the dead speak today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,080
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Let's go ahead and say thank you to

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,720
 our newest Patreon supporter, Michael Hunt. Michael, thank you so much. We really, really appreciate

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,280
 you supporting the Patreon. It means a lot. You're going to be piling us around this episode. If you

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,040
 can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. I totally understand. Just help get the word out about

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,800
 the show. That really helps a lot. We have now reached back our numbers where we were pre-lockdown.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,760
 When the quarantine happened, we took a dive in listenership. So I'm very, very happy with the

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,960
 people who stuck around and now we're back to where we were. I think people are just trying to get

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,360
 like mentally there and people who commuted to work, who listened to the show or were at school,

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,760
 listened to the show. But it seems like we've gotten everyone back. That's awesome and handsome.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
 So thank you so much for you guys who are sticking with the show. Again, you don't have to listen to

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,880
 it every day. You don't even have to listen to every episode, honestly. If you just listened to

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,040
 an episode every once in a while, that's totally awesome. I would listen to every episode. I think

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,200
 the show is pretty awesome. But if you, you know, people tell me, "Oh, I didn't listen to the last

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,760
 episode. I don't care. Listen next one." Or the one after that, "I don't matter to me." Anyways,

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,000
 Michael, we're going to give you the keys to the Carpentercopter. We are headed off to Cat,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,840
 this is a disgusting name of a place. Cagged with, what does that even mean? Cagged with,

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,600
 it's in the Shire of Cornwall in England. So we're flying our Carpentercopter over this little town.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
 Everything's just muddy and gross and all the people are dismal and depressed and they're like,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,080
 "Oh, I wish I lived in a cooler town. Wish I lived in like any town. I wish I lived in Stinkville.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,800
 I heard that place smells so much better than Cadg with." Anyways, there's a little cottage here.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,520
 This is from the year 1988. We don't have a lot of details from this. It's from that. Think about

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,840
 a docs.com website, which I absolutely love. I'm going to spend the weekend really pouring over it.

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
 This is referenced in a magazine and we've talked about this magazine before and I've never

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,880
 been able to find out exactly what it is. It's in the names hilarious though. The magazine is called

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,720
 Pancake Perspectives. Now they've shown up twice, so I guess it's like a paranormal, but I don't know

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,080
 why you would talk about pan-- why you would have-- I mean, I guess Dead Rabbit Radio is not, that doesn't

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,480
 make you think we're talking about ghosts and conspiracies, but I'm not a food. It's not, you

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,080
 know, it's not like flambÃ©, podcast. You'd be like, "What you would-- you expect pancakes?" If it's

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
 called Pancake Perspective, maybe it was a magazine about pancakes. And first of all, often they just

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,120
 told a ghost story. I don't know. But anyways, let's land the carpenter copter. We're going to put on our

34
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,080
 little booties so we don't actually touch the disgusting ground of Caggwith. We're going to

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
 take a look at the story. There's a young woman she spent in the night at a local college out of

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,000
 towner. She's a toony. She's just hanging out and cagged with. I would assume lost on her way to

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,680
 a cooler named city. But anyways, she's in this cottage late at night. She gets up. It's windy.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:27,280
 Rainy. And just generally inhospitable, aka the weather in England all the time. She's like,

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,440
 "Why does this wake me up? It's always like this." She's walking around this cottage late at night.

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,280
 She looks down a long hallway. So you know this story's going to be good, right?

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,120
 She looks down a long hallway. Which at first off, I have a question. How long can a hallway be in

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
 a cottage, right? Whenever I think of a cottage, I think of like a Thomas Kincaid picture. It

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,400
 doesn't even look like there would be a hallway. It looks like it's just, you walk through the door,

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,600
 it's just one big room. And then there's like an eight foot tall wizard sitting by the fire.

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 And that's a cottage. I don't imagine, Gandalf wasn't really eight feet tall, right? That's just

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,800
 something I made up. The hobbits were small. The hobbits were normal size. And he was the giant.

47
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,640
 He was a normal sized human, I believe. Maybe it was Hat that made him look so big.

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
 But anyways, there's nothing to do with anything that we're talking about. I imagine

49
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,480
 cottages are just kind of one room. I've never been in a cottage. I've never been in a cottage.

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,840
 I've been in a mansion once. I'm just okay, never mind. I'm not going to go on a segue of the different

51
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,520
 domiciles I've been in. Yeah, you like that word? So anyways, this cottage apparently has a hallway.

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,680
 They might all have hallways, but that's the most mad. You're like, Jason, get to the part with the

53
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,200
 monster. You're stuck on the part of a hallway in a cottage. You do episodes about people who turn

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,560
 into monsters all the time. Anyways, anyways, there's a hallway in this cottage. And this young

55
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
 woman, she looks down the hallway and she sees something. She doesn't register at first. She does

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
 a double leg. There appears to be, it's really hard for her to kind of make out what it is,

57
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,800
 but there appears to be a man in a black robe at the end of the hallway. That's spooky.

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 Spooky for multiple reasons. And the reason why I like this story, we can really break into it.

59
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,680
 But she looks down the hallway, man in a cloak, a hood on. She's like the Nazgul.

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,440
 He's hanging out at the back end of Frodo's cottage. Then her mind clicks in and realizes,

61
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,920
 whoa, that's not just a figment of my imagination. There is actually someone down there. And at that

62
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:25,200
 point, the phantom, the figure raises its arms up. So it's almost like, you know, like,

63
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,480
 you know what raising your arms up are, even if you don't have arms, you know what it is.

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,080
 But it's like, it's like his arms are going up. So there, you know how you can do them in front

65
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
 like a mummy? He's not doing that. He's doing side to side. I don't know how else to describe that.

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,360
 I'm holding my arms up now as if you can see me. Side to side. Which again, how big is this

67
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,840
 hallway? I don't want to get too much into the hallway. Now, not only do we have a long hallway,

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,000
 it's apparently wide enough that I don't think I've ever been in a hallway that that's big.

69
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,240
 You're like, Jason, you're not a giant. Jason, I know for a fact you've been in hallways

70
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,680
 you can stretch out arm to arm. I don't think I have. I mean, it gets like hallways of like

71
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,320
 office buildings and stuff, but I wouldn't really consider those hallways, right? I'm not just like

72
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,560
 knocking over cubicles, but like a household way. I don't even, I don't think I've ever been in a

73
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,640
 hallway that's big enough to fit two people going down the hallway at the same time. You're like,

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,160
 Jason, that's 100% not true. I'm basically arguing with myself. Michael's just like taking off in the

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,640
 carbonicopter. He's like, I'm out of here. This guy's nuts. You're like, wait for me, wait for me.

76
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,840
 No, you get stuck here too. I don't think I've ever been in a hallway that wide before. But anyways,

77
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,360
 I might have. I might have. The point is, is that there's a hallway in a cottage and it's big enough

78
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,080
 that a man, a grown man can put his hands out like he's flying, which is interesting because that's

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,840
 what he starts to do when his arms go up and they're horizontal side to side, you know, like one

80
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,480
 know what it is. I assume you guys are smart enough. You have enough of a vision dictionary

81
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,400
 in your head that you know what I'm doing. He's holding his arms out like a cross. Okay. He's

82
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,120
 holding his arms out like a cross and then he hovers a bit off the ground and now she's terrified

83
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,480
 from the beginning, but again, your brain's trying to make sense of this stuff. And then he

84
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,760
 flies super fast like a jump scare. He's flying down the hallway at her and she runs and she

85
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,640
 jumps in bed and she throws the blankets over her. And then she says she hears like wrestling,

86
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:38,240
 wrestling noises. They're like, get him up, get him up. Cowls and not cattle wrestling,

87
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:48,080
 not cattle wrestling. Like stuff. He has maracas. He comes down the hallway. He has one of those

88
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,920
 Andy's rain instrument. That's what the rainstorm was. He was just practicing his instrument.

89
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,840
 Anyways, this is a Friday episode if you can't tell. Point is she hears him wrestling above her

90
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,200
 sheets. She's hiding underneath the blankets. It goes away. Goes away. So interesting story.

91
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,760
 It's spooky, right? Like all of us have looked down a hallway, cottage or not. All of us have

92
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,280
 looked down a hallway and they're spooky. Hallways in and of themselves are spooky, right?

93
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,680
 And then I'm reading the story and I thought it's weird that she jumps under the covers. There's a

94
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,960
 natural inclination to jump under the covers, right? I'm not that guy. I don't jump under the covers,

95
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,360
 but I also, because I mean, if I see something late at night, I don't like run away from it.

96
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,200
 I'm not super buff, tough dude, punching ghosts in the face, but I'm not. I can't actually know

97
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,640
 what that's funny. I can't, all the experiences I've had where I've seen stuff or felt stuff before

98
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,800
 I was going to bed or heard stuff before I was going to bed, I just kind of go about my normal

99
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
 business. I think it's interesting that people have, we have a tendency to throw blankets overhead.

100
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,960
 I've never done it, but I was starting to look into that. Why do people, when they're scared,

101
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,720
 tend to cover themselves up with blankets? And there was the answer that that's what kids do,

102
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,800
 because kids basically say, "If I can't see you, you can't see me." I think maybe a baby would do

103
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
 that, but by the time, well, they don't have the muscle to like pull a blanket up there weak.

104
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,240
 But like once you're like eight or nine or whatever, you know that's not true. Like every time you

105
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,920
 blink, you don't think the universe disappears. Other people said, "I think this kind of works

106
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,200
 well that being under a blanket," I don't know how true this is, but it just made more sense than the,

107
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,320
 "I can't see you, you can't see me." Being under a blanket, you replicate the mom's womb,

108
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,960
 which I mean, your mom was had a pretty wooly womb. Your mom's womb was made of microfiber,

109
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,240
 but because you're like encapsulated and capsule, there you go, Misty, encapsulated

110
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,720
 in something, you feel like you're in your mom's womb. And then I thought a tunnel is like the

111
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,280
 vaginal canal. So maybe that's why it's holes are so spooky, because really, I guess that's what I'm,

112
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,680
 that was a long way to get to this. Holes are spooky, right? I'm not saying vaginal canals

113
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,000
 aren't necessarily spooky. I guess it depends on what injury you're in. If you're in them,

114
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,680
 they suck because you're, this is your first time, right? Like I'm talking about being a baby. I'm not

115
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,480
 talking about sex. I'm talking about like, if you're in the womb, right, you're just chilling for

116
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:26,000
 nine months. That's all the reality you know. And you hear voices. You don't see nothing, right? You

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,360
 hear voices off in the ether. Every so often, you get a tasty twinkie to eat on. And then that's a

118
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,120
 reality to you. That's not, that's only thing you know. And the next thing you know, you're,

119
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,040
 "Ugh!" You're getting like squeezed through something that you definitely can't stick your arms out

120
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,280
 both sides and fly through. Like you're getting squirted out, like mustard coming out of a tube.

121
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:59,040
 And then you land into really bright, loud, colorful reality. And it's like a shock. What? I

122
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,840
 didn't know any of this stuff existed. I've always thought that's what death is like, that you have

123
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,760
 no con, we don't really con. A baby's probably like, "Oh, I'm sure there's something out there. Like,

124
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,400
 I hear something. Like, there's something out there. Like, I, but I don't know what it is. I'm

125
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,880
 hearing these voices and stuff like this. I'm hearing, I don't, the baby doesn't speak any language.

126
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,520
 The baby's not a dummy. We are chasing babies to the definition of a dummy. But baby's flowing

127
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,240
 around. Oh, I can hear stuff and stuff like that. But then the second that they pop out, it's a,

128
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,240
 it's a, they don't know what the color white is, or they don't know what's like really like,

129
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,040
 what sound it, well, they know what sound is, but they don't know like the beep, beep, beep of like

130
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,320
 the doctor machine or like hands. They've never like been held before. This stuff is new stuff.

131
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,880
 I think that's what death is like. Like, this is the only reality we can even come close to

132
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,160
 comprehending. Anyone who tells you otherwise, trying to sell you a book or get you to join their

133
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,600
 cult. And then you pop out of this one, boop, and then you're in a, you're like, "Whoa, I didn't think

134
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
 any of this stuff could have ever been possible. I had a little baby brain. Even though I was 90

135
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,520
 years old and I experienced all this stuff, I had no idea. Just like a baby who's one month old

136
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,800
 in the womb, little tiny peanut dude versus a baby that's going to come out in 30 seconds. They have,

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,240
 still have no knowledge of what's on the other side at all. That's a long way of saying that maybe

138
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,200
 being under your blankets is like being in a womb. Wholeways are spooky because it's, it reminds us

139
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
 of popping in and out of the vaginal, well not in and out. You only come one way out of the vaginal

140
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,840
 canal. I personally think the reason why we hide under blankets, it's a monkey behavior.

141
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,040
 Yeah, it's animal behavior. You're hiding from a predator. So if it's not a blanket, we'd be like

142
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,120
 scurrowing into a burrow or hiding under a bunch of leaves or something like that,

143
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,000
 painting ourselves with bark, all sorts of stuff, right? So, so did this story happen

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
 was she really pursued by a ghost down the hallway? Maybe, right? We've just covered

145
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,520
 weirder stuff. I just think it's interesting that it had the motif of spooky hallways is something

146
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:05,360
 we can all relate to. I think everyone who's ever spent any time, anywhere around a hallway,

147
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,840
 especially when they were young, they find them creepy. And now at night, you're walking

148
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,840
 through your house and it's dark and there's a hallway. It's creepier than just a dark living

149
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,640
 room, I would say, right? Unless you have a giant hallway that you can put your arms out,

150
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,480
 and then maybe there's enough space in case something was coming after you, you could get away.

151
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,560
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. We are going to go ahead that with that story.

152
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,920
 I just told you was a literally one paragraph long. I don't know how it blew up to be whatever

153
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,280
 20 minute long story it is. But let's go ahead and Michael fire up that car. Let's call Michael back

154
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,200
 in. Hey, Mike, we're done. We're done. He's like, are you don't being crazy? Yeah, yeah, we're done.

155
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,480
 Bring back down the carbonicopter. We are headed off for a little tour, actually. This story kind

156
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,080
 of takes us a couple different places. And this was actually a suggestion from another Patreon

157
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,440
 supporter, Lori. Lori Snyder, thank you so much for supporting the show. Thank you so much for

158
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,320
 leading me on to the story. Now, this story actually cost me $4.95. I had to buy a copy

159
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,600
 of Fate Magazine. So you guys better appreciate this story. Cost me more money than the past

160
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,080
 20 episodes put together. I never spent any money on these shows. I had to pay $4.95 for this.

161
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,360
 There's a section in Fate Magazine. Fate Magazine is pretty good. They've had eras where it's been

162
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,920
 kind of tabloid-ish. I don't know where they're at right now. I've only read this first part of

163
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,840
 this issue. Lori was like, oh, you got to do a story on this. They have a section called I Seen

164
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,120
 It in the Papers. I don't know what that's a reference to. I don't know if it's all like little

165
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,040
 news clippings. It's bizarre. We're going to talk about some of these stories that are just,

166
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,200
 it's like little news nuggets from Fate Magazine. Fate Magazine is like a paranormal

167
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,600
 magazine like 14 times. They've been around since like the 50s or the 60s, old school.

168
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,200
 This is the newest issue though. There's a cult in Russia called the Ringing Cedars Anastasianism.

169
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,160
 Anastasianism. So Michael, take us down to this cult compound. It basically looks like that movie

170
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 Midsummer that I didn't bother watching because I didn't like what was that other movie they did

171
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,440
 about the person with the head chopped off hereditary. Whatever. A bunch of people dancing

172
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,440
 around, maypole, wearing old-time dresses. This is a cult in Russia. It's gaining a lot of membership

173
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,160
 because it's a return to a simple life. Everyone needs to have a house. Well, everyone needs to

174
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,800
 be in a family. It's very family. It's kind of nationalistic, but it's also a return to nature.

175
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,400
 They said every man should have a house on about a hecca acre, hecca acre of land.

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,360
 And that's your love place. And I did like this. That's stupid. That's dumb. But I did like this.

177
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,080
 The idea that what you put in the universe gives back to you. I believe that. And they have this

178
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,240
 thing that you put love in the universe. It creates a loving universe. If you put hate in the

179
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,600
 universe, it creates hate. That's, I think that's fairly standard. And you might, I don't necessarily

180
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,760
 know if you can affect global change, but you can definitely see changes in your own life. People

181
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,080
 are very bitter and angry. Tend to have very bitter and angry lives. You very rarely see a bitter and

182
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,760
 angry person and everything go right for them. You will see optimists, and I know them. You'll see

183
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,000
 optimists that have a lot of unluck, like that's not a word, that have a lot of bad luck. You'll

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,800
 see that, but they just keep on going. But a bitter man will have good luck and can never see the

185
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,480
 bright side of it. And so at the end, the bitter person has, I think, a more miserable existence.

186
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,640
 They may seem more comfortable with what they're surrounded with. Their job, their family, but

187
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,880
 their family ends up hating their guts. Anyway, you know what I mean? Like, you have to put positivity

188
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,400
 to at least get it back in your universe. So I agree with that. The rest of this stuff is dumb.

189
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,720
 They believe that you create like you. It's very, I'm a fan of the family unit as well. It doesn't,

190
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,520
 not everyone has that opportunity, but I'm a fan of it if it can work for you. But

191
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,600
 they're vegans, so I'm done with that one. And not only vegans, they're the raw vegans. So they

192
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,720
 only eat like corn husk and grass whispers. Like they don't eat nothing. And all their clothes are

193
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,480
 made of natural materials, because yes, mine are made of quantum molecules from the fourth dimension.

194
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,320
 Everything's a natural material. I mean, unless you're wearing, unless you're a sheep and you're

195
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,600
 wearing your own wool, whatever. That's not, whatever. The point is, is that this is the reason

196
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,880
 why Lori sent me this. She's like, Jason, I want to hear your views. I want to hear your, right after

197
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,640
 you said you have to be positive. I want to hear your very critical reviews of a religion you found

198
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,320
 on Wikipedia. Love Lori. That's not what she sent the story for. You're allowed to be negative

199
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,400
 every once in a while. Just don't let it override you. Or when you're doing it, it should be for

200
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,440
 entertainment purposes only. Well, Lori sent me this. She goes, so there is a belief there's a

201
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,200
 conspiracy theory. It's hard to really decide how you'd want to call it. A cuckoo theory would be a

202
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:11,120
 good way. That you can create superfoods by sucking on seeds. This corn kernel. Don't eat it, Billy.

203
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,720
 You're supposed to plant it. Oh yeah. Is that how you plant corn? Do you take like a corn, a

204
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,960
 cobb of corn, right? Are all the kernels the seeds? Like could, what's weird about that is basically

205
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,440
 shouldn't the whole world be corn at this point? Because if a corn cob is nothing but seeds and

206
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,000
 each basically like, let's say I had a baby. I have me and a woman. We have a baby, right?

207
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,440
 That's how that works. That's what I've heard. I don't know. I don't have one. Maybe I've been

208
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,400
 lied to by the mainstream media. A corn, corn grows, right? And then it has a ton of seeds.

209
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,320
 And then birds come and eat the seeds and some of them just kind of fall out on the ground.

210
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,200
 And then the birds poop out the corn everywhere. So shouldn't there be corn? Like if there weren't

211
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,520
 humans, would there be a plant out of the corn? Would there be a statue of liberty? But instead

212
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,040
 of holding a torch, it's a corn cob. And instead of just a statue, it's just a giant corn cob.

213
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,360
 Like why don't we have plants that override, why isn't the world nothing but sunflowers and corn?

214
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,360
 Because like a zucchini, actually that's interesting because like stuff that grows in the

215
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,320
 ground, what happens then? Do like gophers eat it and poop out the seeds? I know that citrus,

216
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,640
 I've talked about this a long time ago, citrus trees wouldn't exist if humans disappeared,

217
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,680
 they'd be gone in like 20 years. Because we created lemons and limes. Birds are like,

218
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,640
 "Blech, that's gross. We're not pooping out those seeds." Bugs don't like them. The blood orange,

219
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,000
 like there's an old orange that's actually a real citrus thing. But like lemons and limes we created.

220
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,320
 The mongols created, it's all genetic engineering. But anyways, yeah if corn is nothing but like an

221
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,320
 apple has what like six seeds? Well I guess the apple tree has like 20 apples, but still like so

222
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:08,880
 that's still only 120 seeds, right? But corn is nothing but seeds. What else is nothing but seeds?

223
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,680
 Watermelons too? But again, so I'd have to be a bear and I eat a watermelon then I poop out.

224
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,320
 What's really Jason? Why is it always about it? That's how it's transferred, right? It's poop.

225
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,160
 Birds? Because it's a little bit of fertilizer. So a bird eats the sunflower seed and then flies

226
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,280
 and then poops it out and then it's all like a little fertilized and then it just grows, right?

227
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,640
 That's how that works. Anyways, what am I talking about? Oh yeah, sucking on seeds. So anyways,

228
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,840
 you suck on the seed. Let's get back to the story that I actually planned for. It's Friday episode.

229
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,240
 Lori sends me this story. So I go and I buy "Fate" magazine, issue 735, 495 by the way.

230
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,920
 This episode costs me money, so if you enjoy it, it has that story in there. In that section I've

231
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,480
 seen it in the papers. You suck and this is the logic, there's no logic behind it. This is one of

232
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,600
 the dumbest things I've covered in a while. So you know how a banana shares 50% of DNA with a human?

233
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,400
 It doesn't by the way. That's 100% not true. That's the same way thing when they say you only use 10%

234
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,560
 of your brain. It's not true. It's an old saying. It's people say it over and over again. It doesn't

235
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,800
 make it any more true. Banana does not share 50% of its DNA with the human. It shares like 1% or 2%.

236
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,400
 We all evolved on the same planet, but that means like we have the same amino acids and stuff like

237
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
 that. It's not actual, it's not half human. It's not half human. If you rearranged it, you wouldn't

238
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,720
 be like, "Hey, Mon, I'm banana Mon." Hang on, I don't know why I made him Jamaican, but anyways,

239
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,000
 the point is that it's not true, but because people are stupid, they believe that. Now there's this old

240
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,240
 idea that humans have deficiencies, which is true. Humans have vitamin deficiencies, and depending

241
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,960
 on which geographical region you're in, if you're in a place with tons of vitamin C,

242
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,400
 oranges everywhere, then you're not going to have a vitamin C deficiency, right? But if

243
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,120
 everything's super like spooky and dark, you might have a vitamin D deficiency. So anyways,

244
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,200
 with the idea is this. You take a seed because it's half human and you go, "Mmm,

245
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,680
 I mean, you don't have to make love to it. Maybe you just lick on it." Actually, there's two

246
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,920
 different ways to do it. In Europe, you stick it under your tongue. This is how dumb this is,

247
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,200
 by the way. There's no science to it. And even like a shaman or a witch would be like, "That's

248
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,240
 pretty stupid, even for our standards." You take a seed, you stick it under our tongue,

249
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,520
 not our tongue, we don't share one. You take a seed, you stick it under your tongue,

250
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,520
 then you look up at the sun and the sunbeams imprint your DNA on it. That's dumb. They imprint

251
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,240
 your DNA on it, and then you spit it out and you bury it. And what you've told the seed is,

252
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,600
 "I'm missing vitamin K and I could use a little more sodium in my diet. I don't have enough."

253
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,600
 So when the tomato grows, it basically will grow with extra vitamin K and a little more sodium.

254
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,680
 It'll be like, "This is nice and salty tomato right out of the ground. Gross. I'm allergic to

255
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:06,000
 tomatoes." The end. That's the idea behind this, and that's what ringing seeders do. A couple other

256
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,640
 groups do it. And the East, apparently, Eastern cultures, this is a thing too. People have been

257
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,200
 doing stupid stuff for thousands of years. You take, a little kid takes a seed, because the kid's

258
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,880
 the one who actually is going to be more vitamin deficient, they got to grow big and strong.

259
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,240
 They suck on the seed, imprinted with their DNA, and then it grows and they're like,

260
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,680
 "Oh, just what I need. I needed this specific potato to be able to." Which was dumb, because one,

261
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,320
 how many seeds are you sucking on, bro? I think this was probably some dude made this up because

262
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,920
 you had a seed suck on fetish. Because what happens, man? You don't grow just one potato.

263
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:51,920
 Isn't a potato itself a seed? You're trying to fit it in your mouth. The idea is this.

264
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,800
 I guess if you had just one farm for you and your family, it might work. But what if you have more

265
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,440
 vitamin deficiencies than your kids do, and they're eating the seeds you were sucking on,

266
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,320
 and they're like a super hyper and stuff like that, because all of a sudden they have all these

267
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,520
 extra vitamins. You're like, "Jason, that's not how vitamins work." It's a Friday episode.

268
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,360
 The point is, is that it wouldn't work on any sort of scale whatsoever.

269
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,400
 Especially like, again, you don't just go, "Oh, the harvest is in. We got one corn,

270
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,440
 one cobbocorn, one tomato." You have farms. So how long are they sucking on these seeds for?

271
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,840
 Your neck would get tired just looking up at the sun all the time. So we're going to stamp this

272
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,160
 false, busted, dead rabbit radio. Bust this myth. That's a new thing I'm doing. I'll probably never

273
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,800
 do it again. But, Lori, thank you for the suggestion. The reason why I wanted to talk about this one,

274
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,360
 that was interesting because it's just kind of a stupid practice. This section of

275
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,360
 "Fate Magazine," which I love about "Fate Magazine," they have usually like a ton of stories in each

276
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,600
 little book. They have two other stories. This is weird. One is like a paragraph long.

277
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,720
 "Extraterrestrial." We all have heard that word before, right? You're like, "No, I haven't. Explain

278
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,040
 it to me." Well, extraterrestrial is the idea of spacey. Why am I even... I don't need to explain

279
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,680
 it to you. The point is, is that you know what an extra... I've completely lost my mind. You know

280
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,640
 what an extraterrestrial is. This little blurb in this magazine said, "Some people," which basically

281
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:32,400
 just means "me," the person writing it, "some people say that extraterrestrial actually means

282
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:41,440
 more land." Because "extra" means more and "terrestrial" means land. You're like, "Okay, that's... I guess

283
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,880
 that's a fun word game, right?" Like, sure. But when you say "extrajudicial," you don't mean, "Oh,

284
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
 there's just going to be extra courts involved." No, it means that you're doing something outside of

285
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,520
 the court system. Like, "extra" doesn't simply mean more. "Extra gum" doesn't mean you have extra gum.

286
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,360
 It just means that's a brand of the gum. This episode's sponsored by extra gum. The idea of

287
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,080
 whatever, so that's just weird. But then underneath... So it's a paragraph long. That's the first

288
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,280
 sentence. "Extra-terrestrial" actually means more land. And it doesn't. It doesn't at all.

289
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:25,520
 Then it says... This is actual quote from this article. "Many..." There's not many people who

290
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:35,120
 do this, right? But whatever. "Many theorize that this is a subliminal message that there is more

291
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,120
 land out there that we are unaware of." Yes. So all of this time, whenever you hear people talk

292
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,720
 about extraterrestrials, they're actually... It's subliminal. We know that... What is... What does

293
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:55,120
 that even... More land where? Who's the... Who... Who are these many people who whenever they're like,

294
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,560
 they walk by an ET poster, they're like, "Yeah, I want to go there someday, too." People are like,

295
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,600
 "What is... You know..." Pointing at the... You want to go to the movie theater? This movie hasn't been

296
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,240
 in the theater since 1983. No! Pointing very slowly at the word "extra-terrestrial." I want to go there.

297
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,520
 Do you know how to get there? What? Is this like a phone home joke? No! That goes on for like 30 minutes.

298
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,920
 What is that even... Many theorize that this is a subliminal message, that there is more land out

299
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,880
 there that we are unaware of. What? On Earth? I don't understand this! Absolutely hilarious. This...

300
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,600
 This... That was worth $4.95. I really love the seat-sucking story. That was definitely good, too,

301
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:48,720
 but that statement alone was 100% worth $4.95. That many people believe that the word "extra-terrestrial"

302
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,880
 is a secret hint to us that somewhere out there, it could be outside your door, it could be

303
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,880
 billion light years away. There's extra land we don't know. Okay, sure, probably, but again,

304
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,560
 "extra-terrestrial" does not mean more land. It never has. It never has, but that's not even the

305
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:15,200
 best part. Lori really hit the trifecta on this one, and this was all from two pages of this

306
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,120
 magazine, okay? Two pages of this magazine. Lori straight up pulled a hat-trick on this one,

307
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,080
 so you got three crazy stories. Fire up that Carbentercopter one last time this episode, Michael.

308
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:34,480
 We're headed out to... Back to Britain, actually. We're going to Leeds. Little town, Leeds. It has

309
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,720
 a museum in it. I know that much. It's... The whole town is just one giant museum. All the people just

310
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,200
 stand there. Everyone's behind glass. The very safety are in this quarantine. We land, and there

311
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,640
 we meet a bunch of scientists, a bunch of nerds sitting around, and they have in front of them

312
00:28:50,640 --> 00:29:02,320
 the mummified remains of priest Nessiamen. Nessiamen. Nessiamen was a Egyptian priest. He was a scribe,

313
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,600
 and he wrote like on his thing... Well, he didn't write it. He was dead. He was being mummified,

314
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:15,120
 but people carved on his esophagus that his life wish was to speak after he died,

315
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,440
 because to him speaking, especially speaking your name, was the ultimate

316
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,240
 oneness with God, that people were still talking about you after you died. So basically, Marilyn

317
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,360
 Monroe is the equivalent of Hercules at this point. That was his goal. So these nerds are

318
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,880
 sitting there on their computers, and there's this mummy just chilling out in their lab,

319
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,480
 and they're like, "Are you ready to run the diagnostics, Timothy?" And Timothy's like, "Yes,

320
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:54,480
 I am. I forgot your name, Mark. Yeah, I forgot." And so they take this mummy, and these nerds are

321
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,400
 all running these tests. Now, elsewhere, this dude is like pitching this business thing, right?

322
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,360
 He's like, "There's this huge narrative now. There's this guy. His name is Tony,

323
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,040
 and he's like... None of these names are real. By the way, as far as I know, Tony goes,

324
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,120
 "Listen, we are on the cusp of one of the biggest breakthroughs that mummy technology has ever known.

325
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,160
 We are going to change the world of the bandaged and decayed." There's a fat cat corporate weasel

326
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:28,960
 sitting with this cigar. My grandfather didn't get into this business to spend a bunch of money

327
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:37,520
 doing mummy stuff. So get to it. And the guy's like, "Okay, we want to see that mummy right there.

328
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,160
 We want to take that mummy. We want to give him the ability to speak." And the fat cat investor,

329
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,800
 smoking his cigar, he's eating an apple, spitting out seeds, creating new apple trees in his office.

330
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,640
 He's pooping them out. I don't know where that even came from. I gotta end this episode.

331
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,360
 Okay, the fat cat goes, "Fine. I'll give you all sorts of money and all sorts of time.

332
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,200
 I want to see what you can do." Then none of that happened, okay? None of that happened. I just think

333
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:15,680
 it's funny that somebody wasted a ton of time and money and effort to do what I'm about to tell you.

334
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:24,400
 Okay? All of that was my bizarre way of letting you know. Somebody thought this was a worthwhile

335
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,560
 endeavor. They spent grants and college funds and all sorts of stuff. Money from colleges,

336
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,280
 I mean, not their scholarships. A bunch of money went into this. This is the end. This is the

337
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,760
 actual story, okay? Forget Tom and Timothy and Mark and the stereotypical corporate guy whose dad

338
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,560
 invested in mummies or whatever nonsense they came up with. These guys took this mummy. This part's

339
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,000
 real. This part's real. This mummy named Nessie Oman. That's true. He wanted to speak after death

340
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 and all that stuff. So they go, "He's a perfect candidate for this technology." They put him in

341
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,280
 a CT machine. They take a scan of his vocal cords, his throat, his mouth, all that stuff.

342
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,800
 It was all grody, obviously. He'd been dead for 3,000 years. But they were able to take all this

343
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:18,160
 information and then they put it through a 3D scanner. They go home for the weekend. It takes

344
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:28,240
 a while. They come back. It's ready. Now they have a 3D replica of this dude's vocal cords,

345
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,920
 right? Which, come on, they're decayed, but whatever. They're somehow, maybe it's just

346
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,760
 the way his bones were or something like that. They took that. Then they reconstructed his tongue

347
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,160
 because parts of it were missing and everything like that. So eventually, long story short,

348
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,200
 they replicate his voice box. You're like, "Jason, it's called a throat and a mouth."

349
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,680
 They replicate that and they go, "Well, we've spent a ton of money and a ton of time and all this

350
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:06,960
 stuff, but we have finally done it. We have finally created the ability to hear what this guy sounded

351
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,920
 like." Which in and of itself is pretty awesome. You're like, "Jason, that's pretty dope actually

352
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,920
 that you can do that and we can find out what people have to say in the old times." And while

353
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,520
 they're doing this actually, someone came forward and complained about it. Here is a quote. This is

354
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:30,240
 just adding to the ridiculous. Here's a quote. "Kara Kuni. She's an Egyptologist at the University

355
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,880
 of California Los Angeles. She says, "When you're taking a human being and using so much inference,"

356
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,680
 is that a word? "Inference?" Inference? Inference? It doesn't matter. "When you're

357
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,360
 guessing what, when you're putting stuff in that you don't know." Like how to pronounce a word.

358
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:56,720
 "When you're taking a human being and using so much inference about what they looked or sounded like,

359
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,240
 it can be done with an agenda that you might not even be aware of." She's for mummy rights.

360
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:10,240
 She doesn't think that she thinks, I don't know, is it deceased to imitate a dead person?

361
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,960
 I don't really. So basically she's going, "Well, what's your agenda? Do you have a hidden agenda when

362
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,320
 you're trying to give this mummy a voice?" And the scientists are like, "Yeah, we want to hear what a

363
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,320
 mummy sounded like. We want to hear what this guy sounded like 3,000 years ago. What would be your

364
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:29,440
 agenda?" That quote is the equivalent of many people believe. There is a journalist writing an

365
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,680
 article and they're like, "Well, I do need a counteractual point." So they probably caught,

366
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:40,640
 allegedly, allegedly, don't sue me anybody. I must, allegedly, the journalist calls up a friend,

367
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,680
 a close friend, and go, "Hey, you want to be in an article?" Yeah, sure. I need a negative quote.

368
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,560
 Oh yeah, yeah, I can do that. Allegedly, that's what happened. It's possible that she actually

369
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,000
 does care very deeply about the rights of 3,000-year-old mummies being given a voice,

370
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,240
 even though that was their last wish. She may actually have problems with that. She may have

371
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,000
 like power to the power posters and it's just like a picture of ash she's fighting for the people

372
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 who have rotted away. Anyways, now you have controversy. Many people are up in arms about

373
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,760
 this. You have controversy. You have money. You have time spent. You have technical brain power.

374
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,720
 You have a CTE machine that was used. There was some guy who really needed it. He's like, "No,

375
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,400
 I'm dying now." And they're like, "No, we're too busy scanning this mummy. Go home." He's like,

376
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,560
 "No, kick him down the stairs." The point is, is that you have all this time, money, effort,

377
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:41,520
 everything for this. That is, that was the, that is the result. So yes, let's hear it again.

378
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,280
 That's it. That's not a Minecraft villager. That's not any other number of cultural references or

379
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,600
 jokes I could make. That's the sound of a 3000. That's all they got. So they hooked, they built

380
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,720
 this huge thing and then they just like had a way to like make it make a vowel sound. That's,

381
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,800
 if you're gonna, I was, it's so funny because I'm reading the article. I read multiple articles on

382
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,280
 this and then I had to find the sound clip. You imagine, I don't, okay, here's the thing. Maybe

383
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,520
 it was my expectations, but I was expecting Hall of Presidents from Disneyland, right? Where it'd

384
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,960
 be like, "Oh no, Moses, not more frogs!" Like they actually would make it say something, right?

385
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:33,440
 No, I can, I, I, here's the thing, dude. I, allegedly, allegedly, I could get a ton of grant

386
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,480
 money, take a scan and then just go into a microphone where I can imitate, uh, there,

387
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,120
 I imitated that. Uh, maybe that's a little like it because I'm not hearing it right now. Uh,

388
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,720
 how much time and money went into that? And again, I, I could just make, you're like, Jason,

389
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,480
 science, science isn't about whether or not you can make it, you buy your, like that's not,

390
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,160
 sign, you're like, Jason, you can, you can create a whirlpool, you can create like a little whirlpool

391
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,680
 in your bathtub by pulling the drain. We still need people to steady whirlpools in real life.

392
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,720
 We still need people to steady momentum, things like that. Yeah, yeah, I guess, but still, that was

393
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,560
 disappointing. And I think it was equally disappointing for you considering the amount of buildup that I

394
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,480
 gave it. Now that story makes sense. I wanted you guys to feel like I felt when I was reading all

395
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,920
 those articles. I'm like, "Oh dude, is he gonna be like, "I've risen from the grave!" Like they could

396
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:42,160
 have made him say so many mummy-like things, not, "Come on, that's ridiculous!" Come on, science.

397
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:51,200
 You let me down. You let me down once again. But guys, have a great weekend. I hope you enjoyed

398
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,640
 this Friday episode. I promise there was no Benadryl or Nyquil involved in the making of this

399
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,480
 episode. I think it's just been a long week. Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is going to be

400
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,240
