1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 Are you currently being hunted by a cryptid?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,080
 Is a monster outside your house right now trying to get in?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,200
 Well, I've met a man who can help you.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,240
 Eventually, he'll get around to it.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,600
 Then we travel to Colonial America to take a look at what really happened to the Jamestown

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
 colony.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,200
 What's the population so hungry they began to eat each other?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,080
 Or did the Windigo come to town today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
 I don't know my hometown.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
 Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,800
 I installed my pop filter audio files.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,480
 You've listened to the last two episodes and you just have normal human ears.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,320
 When I rebuilt the studio, I didn't put in the pop filter.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,000
 So sorry about that.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 But it's here now.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,240
 You know who else is here right now?

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,360
 Our newest Patreon supporter.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,960
 Writing in on the back of a snail.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,440
 He's taken a long time.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,800
 Writing on the back of a giant snail like Neverending Story.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
 It's Sergio.

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
 Everyone give a round of applause.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,920
 A big sticky snail round of applause for Sergio.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,840
 I don't know why our hands are sticky, but they are.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,240
 Our hands have turned to slugs.

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,080
 Sergio, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,440
 If you can't swear to Patreon or if you are not a slug, that's totally fine.

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,080
 You'll probably get more job opportunities if you're not a slug.

33
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,880
 So you can support the Patreon, but if you can't, that's fine too.

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,440
 Just helps rid the word about the show.

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
 Really really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,800
 Sergio, go ahead and hop on off that snail.

37
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,240
 Here's the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,400
 We're going to head out to a house that's currently under assault from Cryptid.

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 So hurry up.

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,480
 I'm probably the slowest vehicle to help these people.

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,320
 We're flying over this house in Suburbi.

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,640
 It's late at night and there's just a bunch of Cryptids like banging on the windows and

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
 stuff.

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,480
 Bigfoot could do it himself.

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,960
 He's leaning against the car and giving directions like "you weird looking monster man slinking

47
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,240
 through the drains and the guy like goes in through the rain gutter."

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,760
 And then there's like Mothman.

49
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,880
 He's sitting out there and Bigfoot's like "take off Chimney" and Mothman's like

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
 destroying the Chimney.

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,120
 Because Bigfoot could really solo this stuff.

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,440
 Bill, Bigfoot's kind of the Thor of the Avengers of Cryptids.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
 He's so strong.

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,760
 I mean, outside of some of those weirdos from South America with flaming heads and stuff

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,440
 like that that are impervious to all weapons, I'd say for North America, Bigfoot's the

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,600
 big daddy.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 Or is he actually?

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,680
 We'll be getting to another Cryptid.

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,360
 But anyway, just for the sake of this story, so I stay on task.

60
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,040
 Bigfoot's the demolition foreman for this house.

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
 There's too many Cryptids.

62
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,680
 We can't help this family.

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,440
 We can't help these people in this house.

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,840
 There's like crawlers running around, bunch of leprechauns, gray aliens, all sorts of stuff.

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,640
 It's a real smorgasbord of weirdness down there.

66
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,720
 But then we see a van pull up outside of the house.

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 Big headlights illuminating the front yard.

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,120
 Once again, the intro's going on longer than the actual story.

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,480
 Here's the story, okay?

70
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,440
 Now I just turn around and stand in the dead rabbit's urge of "oh, I'm like forget all

71
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
 that."

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
 Here's the story.

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,920
 I saw this thing online recently from a guy named Sniper6407.

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,000
 So Sniper6407 lists himself as a Cryptid researcher and a horror author.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,320
 He posts this online, "Does anyone need help?"

76
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,560
 We need attention grabbing right now.

77
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,880
 He asks if you're being hunted or being tormented by any Cryptids.

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
 Then he gives this, this, like if you don't know what that means, right?

79
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 You're reading this and you're like, "Hunted?

80
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,000
 What's the definition of hunted?

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,040
 Tormented as like mice are chewing at your feet."

82
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,840
 You're like, "What is true torment in today's modern world?"

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,000
 He describes what he means by being hunted or tormented.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,200
 Such as quote, "Stalking, repeated tapping and banging on a house."

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,160
 So if you're in a car, if you're in a car and there's something banging on your car,

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,320
 that's not, don't call me for that.

87
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
 It has to be in a house.

88
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,360
 You're in an apartment complex, no dice, bro.

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,720
 Such as stalking, repeated tapping and banging on a house or the killing of livestock.

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,320
 One of those is not like the other, right?

91
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,640
 Stalking, we always get that feeling that someone's hiding behind us.

92
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,640
 Repeated tapping, that could be like a woodpeck, that could be anything from a woodpecker to

93
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,240
 Bigfoot trying to get in your house.

94
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,000
 The killing of livestock, that's living animals who have had their intestines ripped out.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,800
 Specifically, you're living animals.

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,000
 This is how you make your livelihood and you're like, "Dag nab it, but at least my house didn't

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 get tapped on.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,160
 At least my house is totally untapped."

99
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,560
 But he, Sniper, is here to provide help.

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
 Do you need help?

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,160
 What's the name of this post?

102
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
 Not him, though.

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,400
 He's actually volunteering his buddy, his buddy to help take care of you.

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,920
 He has a friend who can help you.

105
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
 He's not gonna do it himself.

106
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
 He's smarter than that.

107
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,760
 He has a friend who's not only a big game hunter, but a big game trapper.

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
 Is that a thing?

109
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,920
 Do you go out in the woods?

110
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,000
 You go out in the woods and wrap a rope around an elk and then go yee-haw and then just tie

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,840
 it to a tree and leave?

112
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,400
 Or like you have like an elephant trap, like a giant hole, a giant elephant-sized hole.

113
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,840
 The elephant falls in and you're like, "All in a day's work."

114
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,880
 What's a big game trapper?

115
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,120
 Do you catch penguins for zoos or stuff like that?

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
 Anyways, he's also ex-military.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,880
 And before, I feel like I'm kind of badmouthing this guy.

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,960
 Let me get to this last line.

119
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,640
 He was trained to shoot by a sniper.

120
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,560
 He's not a sniper himself.

121
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
 He's not a sniper himself.

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,840
 He did serve in the military.

123
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,320
 Specifically, he doesn't say which military either.

124
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,880
 So I could have been ISIS.

125
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
 Now that I'm looking at this, I could have said, "Thank you for your service."

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,320
 But then I realized he could actually be some ISIS soldier who also happens to catch penguins

127
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,200
 to help support his family.

128
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
 He was trained to shoot by a sniper.

129
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
 He's not a sniper.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,840
 So if you think you're getting help from a sniper, you did not correctly read that sentence.

131
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
 So he can have this friend show up and he says that him.

132
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,560
 Because remember, Sniper is a cryptid hunter, but he's not volunteering his services.

133
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,280
 He's volunteering the services of a man who's been trained by a sniper.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
 Not a sniper.

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
 A sniper.

136
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
 I love this, though.

137
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,120
 So he goes, "If you're having trouble with something's banging on your wall, or if every

138
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,840
 show often you come out and that sheep you raised from birth has its innards scattered

139
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,760
 across the field, either one, give me a call.

140
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,280
 Give me a call and I will send my buddy out."

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,520
 Now here's this is, don't pick up the phone just yet.

142
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,040
 He actually didn't give his phone number.

143
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,800
 He can go to the show notes.

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
 Don't troll the guy.

145
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,760
 Because I think this is kind of charming.

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,880
 But so then there's this weird part.

147
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,360
 I mean, this is the weird part, right?

148
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,600
 He says that his friend is willing to help you out, but you have to live in a state

149
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,760
 near him.

150
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,440
 We don't know what state he lives in, by the way.

151
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,720
 So if you're in North Dakota and you're under assault, you're like, "Oh my God, I hope he

152
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,280
 lives in South Dakota."

153
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,720
 A couple states away from him, he can go and he's willing to do it, quote, "on his

154
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
 own time."

155
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,840
 So you have to wait until he has a weekend off.

156
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
 You have to wait.

157
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,920
 Like, and that's the thing.

158
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,800
 Generally, I'm not an expert on being assaulted by cryptids.

159
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 It's never happened to me.

160
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,600
 However, I would assume, I would assume he would want help somewhere in between right

161
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,320
 now and two minutes ago.

162
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,160
 It's kind of an emergency thing when you're being attacked by a monster, but on his own

163
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,880
 time, if you live within a couple states of this mysterious man who was trained by a sniper,

164
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,520
 it does say he lives in a few surrounding states.

165
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,560
 So maybe the United States, maybe the Balkan states?

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 We don't know.

167
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,440
 I saw this, this guy posted this on Reddit, and I saw this and I thought it was super

168
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
 charming, right?

169
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,120
 I don't know how old this guy is.

170
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,560
 I honestly think, oh, and I will say this, I did go read one of his short stories.

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 He's a good writer.

172
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
 He's a good writer.

173
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,080
 So that's fun.

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,560
 He actually is writing and that's really cool.

175
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,720
 He's doing his thing.

176
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,160
 And this is super charming.

177
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,880
 Like I know I'm making fun of this, but we've all done this, right?

178
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,440
 We've all thought about, oh, you know, it would be so awesome if like I was hunting vampires

179
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,920
 and then I meet like a sexy vampire and I'm like, should I let him bite me?

180
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,440
 Oh no, why am I having these feelings?

181
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
 And then I stake him and then I go, I regret it for the rest of my life and I get married

182
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
 and have kids.

183
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,480
 I'm like, oh, I wonder if Angel, I wonder if things between me and Angel would have ever

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,400
 worked out from two different worlds.

185
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,880
 We've all, maybe not that detailed.

186
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,360
 But we've all thought about hunting monsters, right?

187
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,800
 We've all thought about like getting our tools together and going out and hunting monsters.

188
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,840
 Maybe with like Bigfoot, you kind of just want to see him because he's not super hostile.

189
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,880
 Chasing down these creatures through the woods.

190
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,000
 We've all had that fantasy.

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 So when I read this, I thought it was super charming.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,760
 But that's not the only reason I wanted to share it with you.

193
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,720
 This dude is posting this on crawler sightings, the subreddit for crawler sightings.

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
 Truth is here, cryptids.

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,320
 I'm subbed to all of those.

196
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,440
 So that's why I saw it pop up a couple of times.

197
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,280
 He posted it to something called humanoid encounters.

198
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,360
 And the backlash was so ridiculous.

199
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
 So ridiculous.

200
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,000
 This is really why one, this is weirder than him having a friend who was trained by a sniper

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,280
 who will show up on his own time.

202
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,480
 Humanoid Beans is a subreddit for cryptids that look like people.

203
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,120
 Oddly specific, right?

204
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,320
 Oddly specific.

205
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
 Does the mothman count?

206
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
 I mean, a lot of cryptids have two arms, two legs and a head.

207
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
 But anyway, so it's super specific.

208
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,760
 And Snipe starts a thread on humanoid encounters saying, "Hey, my buddy can come and shoot

209
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,480
 a couple cryptids if they're ripping the guts out of your livestock.

210
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,320
 He'll come out there eventually."

211
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,400
 And it ran into something that I guess I knew existed, but I don't think I've ever seen

212
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
 it so bluntly.

213
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,120
 It's something I call the cryptids are people to movement.

214
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,160
 He got lambasted, these people came out of the woodwork and said, "Whoa, whoa, why are

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,400
 you trying to hurt cryptids?

216
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,080
 They're just people just like us.

217
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,560
 They're just multi-dimensional creatures that lurk in the darkness just like me."

218
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,640
 They were really upset that his friend, that he was offering his friend to go murder.

219
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,240
 These cryptids, now again, he's very clear.

220
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,040
 You have to be harassed or tormented, stalked, the tapping on your house.

221
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,840
 Like I don't think anyone should get shot in the stomach over that, but stalked or killing

222
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,960
 livestock, they're like, "How dare you?"

223
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,760
 Here's a quote from this quote, "If they're killing livestock," so they do acknowledge

224
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,200
 that these creatures are killing livestock, but if they're killing livestock, then they're

225
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,480
 just trying to survive in a world where humans are constantly destroying the ecosystem that

226
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,840
 all these beings live in.

227
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,320
 I'm pretty sure wolves are eating sheep long before cavemen were walking around with clubs.

228
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,640
 But then you go, "Okay, okay, so sure, fine.

229
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,520
 Maybe it's our fault for taking cows and putting them in a pen and making them super

230
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,760
 delicious, bioengineering them to be all fat and juicy."

231
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,280
 Of course the cryptids are going to eat them.

232
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,160
 Of course the cryptids are going to eat them.

233
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,520
 Here's another quote, "If they're following people," now we're excusing stalking, we're

234
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,480
 victim blaming people who are assaulted by cryptids.

235
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,440
 If they're following people, but not hurting them, then they're probably trying to understand

236
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
 human nature.

237
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,440
 Okay.

238
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
 That's fair, I guess.

239
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,600
 Like a nature photographer.

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,480
 A nature photographer who walks on all fours, who growls and has no body hair.

241
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
 You're right.

242
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,240
 If they're following people, but not hurting them, they're probably trying to understand

243
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
 human nature.

244
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,080
 Or, this is the rest of the quote, "You sold me on that one."

245
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 Like I could have been like, "Okay, yeah, maybe Bigfoot isn't menacing.

246
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,120
 Most Bigfoot stories, he's not menacing, right?"

247
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,160
 Okay, yeah, maybe he's just trying to figure out what makes humans tick.

248
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,080
 They're probably trying to understand human nature.

249
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:59,720
 Or the quote continues, "Or possibly feeding off of their fear energy."

250
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
 That's not good.

251
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,280
 There's no way you can sugarcoat that.

252
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,960
 Then you know that they're scary and they love it.

253
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,200
 They're licking it up.

254
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
 They're licking up that delicious fear energy.

255
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 Licking that lush.

256
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
 They want you to pee your pants.

257
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,120
 Dude, it makes it extra tasty.

258
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,400
 They want your Adrena Chrome.

259
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,920
 That's a terrible argument.

260
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,160
 But anyways, he has run off of this subreddit.

261
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,680
 The last I checked, he didn't respond to any of us.

262
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
 People were nauseated.

263
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,520
 They thought it was quote, "Effene sickening."

264
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,720
 So I find it super bizarre that they are hung up on this idea that cryptids are people too.

265
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,960
 That you shouldn't go out and shoot something that's killing livestock.

266
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,800
 You would do that for a wolf or a coyote or anything.

267
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,880
 Rats are eating your chicken's legs.

268
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 You blow the rats away.

269
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,760
 You don't go, "Oh, it's probably just because I stored all these chickens in one location.

270
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,360
 I'm a chicken farmer, but probably shouldn't do that.

271
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,920
 Probably should become a rat farmer."

272
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
 Very bizarre thing.

273
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,480
 But I do think that story is really just kind of adorable wanting to hunt cryptids.

274
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,480
 And then these jerks show up and they're like, "No, cryptids are people too."

275
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,000
 And technically the very definition of cryptid is making them monstrous.

276
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,800
 They may not always have monstrous intentions, but even if you're just feeding off fear energy,

277
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,680
 that's the equivalent of when your bigger brother jumped out of the closet to scare you

278
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,960
 and said, "I'm just joking," as you're whimpering in the corner and you never want to go in

279
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,560
 the closet again, even though you are now recording in a haunted closet.

280
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,880
 Sergio, let's go ahead and leave behind the "Where were we at?"

281
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
 suburbia.

282
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,000
 That segment went on way longer than I thought it was going to.

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 We're leaving behind suburbia.

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,360
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter.

285
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,760
 We're headed out to a little colony known as Jamestown.

286
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:49,640
 And as the Carbentercopter is flying, Sergio hit that little back in time button.

287
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,760
 All of a sudden, the Carbentercopter becomes all woodsy.

288
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,440
 It's like made of trees and branches.

289
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,640
 It loses its ability to fly and we land softly, but at least now it looks like an old-timey

290
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,360
 log cabin helicopter.

291
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,320
 Sergio, land this Carbentercopter.

292
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,680
 Land this wood in Carbentercopter in the state of Virginia.

293
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,000
 The year is 1609 and we're in the colony known as Jamestown.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,400
 Now I got most of my information from this first part from a National Geographic article

295
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,920
 written by Paula Neely.

296
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,760
 So I really want to give a heads up and a tip of the hat, a tip of the colonial hat to

297
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
 Paula.

298
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
 Thank you so much.

299
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,720
 And this story that we're going to be going into was recommended by a dead rabbit radio

300
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,200
 listener known as Honeyworn.

301
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
 So thank you.

302
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,720
 You get a little tip of the colonial hat as well.

303
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 We're walking through Jamestown.

304
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,120
 We're wearing those old-timey provincial clothes, but it's not enough.

305
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,800
 It's super cold.

306
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,760
 Snowflakes are falling.

307
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,400
 People are singing "No Christmas Carols" this year.

308
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,040
 People are starving.

309
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,880
 What's going on in 1609 was you had the residence of Jamestown.

310
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,240
 They were having a really harsh winter.

311
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
 They weren't getting the crops they needed.

312
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,560
 They weren't prepared.

313
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,000
 These colonists weren't prepared for such hearty living.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,200
 They actually had an alliance with a local tribe, the Pohatan Confederacy.

315
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,600
 But that started to break down too because the Jamestown colonists kept going back and

316
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,480
 saying "Hey, can you give us a little more of that?

317
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 What do you call it again?"

318
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
 And they're like "Food?"

319
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 And they're like "Yeah, yeah, the food!

320
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
 Give us some of that stuff!"

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,680
 And the natives were working with them, but they were demanding too much food.

322
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,680
 They were demanding too much resources.

323
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
 And then other things were going off.

324
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
 Tensions roiled and a skirmish broke out.

325
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
 A skirmish that the colonists weren't ready for.

326
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,160
 It's already a really brutal winter.

327
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,200
 They're not prepared for these conditions.

328
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,920
 And now they are under siege from the Pohatan Confederacy.

329
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,600
 The colony of Jamestown is surrounded.

330
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,640
 There was a lot of stories that came out during this time period because the colony of Jamestown

331
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,760
 did overcome these obstacles.

332
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,040
 Eventually reinforcements arrived.

333
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,600
 The siege was broken.

334
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
 New colonists showed up.

335
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,040
 New supply showed up.

336
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,440
 And Jamestown became a flourishing colony.

337
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,200
 In 1609, the winter of 1609 to 1610, they didn't know.

338
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,960
 They didn't have notes on the laptop in the year 2021 to know how it was going to end.

339
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:15,480
 There were stories, though, all along that the residents of Jamestown resorted to cannibalism.

340
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:23,360
 Cannibalism is not unheard of, but it's very rare in most societies.

341
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,160
 Director of Archaeology of the Historic Jamestown Center, William Kelso, had always heard of

342
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
 these reports.

343
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
 He didn't believe them.

344
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
 He didn't believe them.

345
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,120
 He actually believed that they were fake news.

346
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,040
 People were trying to make the colony of Jamestown look bad back then.

347
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
 They had competing colonies.

348
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
 They were like, "Come on down.

349
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,540
 Come on down to this colony.

350
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,240
 We got all the corn you can eat."

351
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
 They didn't believe it.

352
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,320
 There was no proof of it at all.

353
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:53,160
 But what's happened is, archaeologists have recently discovered this back in 2013.

354
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,240
 There was cannibalism at Jamestown.

355
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,040
 Now I keep kind of underselling.

356
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,440
 I keep saying it was a bad winner.

357
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
 It was a bad winner.

358
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
 It was known as the Starving Times.

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,960
 You don't want any period of your life to have the word "starving" in it.

360
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,200
 It was known as the Starving Times.

361
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,240
 80% of the original colonists that were there died in these few months.

362
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,920
 So there were rumors about cannibalism, but they could never ever prove it.

363
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,840
 What happened was, archaeologists have recently been going through Jamestown and they unearthed

364
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,800
 underneath this building a garbage chute.

365
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,120
 And in it, they found the butchered skull and a shin bone of a 14-year-old girl.

366
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,680
 Just thrown in the trash.

367
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
 Now it was a harsh winner.

368
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,600
 People really weren't able to dig graves.

369
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,200
 I mean, you could, but you'd really have to put your back into it.

370
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 And considering it was known as the Starving Times, you had better things to spend your

371
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,720
 calories on.

372
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 But they thought it was weird.

373
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,480
 They found this human skull and this bone in the garbage.

374
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,440
 And that wasn't what made them think it was cannibalism.

375
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,120
 They noticed the skull actually had knife marks on it.

376
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,440
 It was broken open.

377
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,360
 This article says, quote, "They were clearly interested in cheek meat, muscles of the face,

378
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,120
 the tongue, and the brain."

379
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,120
 Looking at the skull, they've been able to do a facial reconstruction and they can say,

380
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,080
 this is what this 14-year-old girl looked like.

381
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,520
 And based on the teeth and the bones, they were actually able to paint a pretty vivid

382
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,440
 picture of who this 14-year-old girl may have been.

383
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,280
 Very very healthy skeleton.

384
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
 Good teeth.

385
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,680
 Probably could have been a teeth model if she was around in the times of cameras and not

386
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,960
 eaten herself.

387
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,640
 They think she was either wealthy from a wealthy family or the maid of a wealthy family.

388
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,160
 They believe she had just arrived into Jamestown that November.

389
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,240
 There's a new ship of colonists that had come in that November.

390
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,560
 It had a supply ship in this convoy.

391
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
 It didn't make it.

392
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,960
 It was waylaid by storms.

393
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,160
 So you have a bunch of starving people in this colony and then a bunch of other people

394
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,560
 showed up and they're like, hey, we're here.

395
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
 It's awesome.

396
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
 When's dinner time?

397
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,880
 And everyone just turns and looks at these newcomers.

398
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,440
 They don't know who these newcomers are.

399
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,560
 These newcomers definitely aren't prepared for the winter.

400
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,080
 And since you don't know who they are, who are you going to eat first, right?

401
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,140
 By November, by the time that these other colonists showed up, the people of Jamestown were already

402
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,760
 eating horses.

403
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,320
 They're already eating cats and dogs, rats.

404
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,080
 They're eating the leather out of their shoes.

405
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,960
 There was written documents saying that first they begin to dig up the dead and devour them.

406
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,280
 But eventually, I mean, if you're going to be a cannibal, eat it fresh, right?

407
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,960
 You want to do the subway method.

408
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,360
 Like you don't want to sit.

409
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,000
 If I have made the decision to eat human meat, do I want to be like, oh, grandma, you've

410
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 been dead for 200 years.

411
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,460
 I'll suck the marrow out of your bones.

412
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,500
 Or will you look at the plump dude in the corner, the plump dude who's sweating bacon

413
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,380
 grease because he ate some bacon.

414
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,780
 Apparently, apparently he still had some bacon.

415
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,900
 Well, who are you going to eat?

416
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,020
 I'm not going to say you should murder people to eat them, but at a certain point you're

417
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,220
 going to stop eating people who've been dead for a long time.

418
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,300
 You're going to eat people who just died.

419
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,140
 If they just died because you killed them, say la vie.

420
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,160
 They just started digging up the people and eating them.

421
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,480
 And so they had heard these, one of the most famous stories is that a man killed his pregnant

422
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
 wife and ate her.

423
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,080
 And then they executed him.

424
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,760
 In almost every culture, the punishment for cannibalism is execution.

425
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,160
 Like there's some cultures that see it as a warrior thing, and then they kind of get

426
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,760
 away with it.

427
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,400
 But for the most part, if you do it in a survival situation, even if you make it through that,

428
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,840
 you're going to be in some serious issues.

429
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
 So that guy was killed.

430
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,700
 But there was never any proof that that actually happened.

431
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,480
 Here we have this 14-year-old girl.

432
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,180
 They could tell from her bones that she came from a really well-off family.

433
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,220
 She was well fed before all this happened.

434
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,620
 They don't know.

435
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,660
 The one thing they can't say for sure is was she murdered to be eaten.

436
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,380
 They said it's possible that she died of natural causes, and then they ate her.

437
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,460
 They do say, though, that they can tell she was eaten by more than one person.

438
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,800
 They said that when they look at the skull, the knife cuts, it's really interesting.

439
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,680
 This is what I love about doing this show, and this is what I love about reading these

440
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
 articles.

441
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,840
 This National Geographic article is so well written.

442
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,360
 The research behind it is really good.

443
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,280
 They said when you looked at the skull and you looked at the knife marks on the skull,

444
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,280
 they said there was a hesitancy to it.

445
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,840
 You could tell that some of the knife marks were trying to figure out what they're doing.

446
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,420
 Could they cut sharply?

447
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,100
 As you start to look at the skull, you can start to see that it became more...

448
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,860
 We just want the brains, right?

449
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,760
 They could kind of see the evolution of the cuts on the skull, and then there is the breaking

450
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,700
 in the back where the brains were slurped out by what I'm assuming was a colonial crazy

451
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
 straw.

452
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,680
 They made a little loop-de-loop, but the shin bone, they said it looks like a butcher took

453
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,200
 the meat off of it.

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,320
 Very, very professional cuts on the shin bone.

455
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,440
 So it is almost like more than one person was devouring this girl, which would make

456
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,400
 sense because I think only like 26 or 30 people survived.

457
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,320
 That's off the top of my head.

458
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,840
 That's not in my notes, but when the new residents showed up, when the reinforcement showed up

459
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,500
 and the siege was broken, the new commander showed up and he's like, "Okay, this is super

460
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,340
 gross because everyone had been eating all these people.

461
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,820
 This is super gross.

462
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,700
 Let's get rid of all of this evidence and by get rid of, they meant throwing the garbage."

463
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,820
 So out of everything that was tossed in the garbage of all these human remains, and this

464
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,900
 was basically just cleaned up, we were able to find this young girl's skull and this bone.

465
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,820
 Here's a little piece of information.

466
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,380
 I never heard this before.

467
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,280
 James Horn, the vice president of research for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation,

468
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,760
 here's this quote.

469
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,600
 It is the only referring to this girl's skull and shin bone.

470
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:19,760
 It is the only artifactual evidence of cannibalism by Europeans at any European colony, Spanish,

471
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,840
 French, English, or Dutch throughout the colonial period from 1500 to 1800.

472
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,860
 There's always been stories that it's happened, but this is the only time we've ever found

473
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,020
 proof of it.

474
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,420
 Which means those stories are made up, they probably aren't.

475
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,680
 People have eaten people under dire circumstances and these colonial situations a lot of times

476
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,140
 could become dire circumstances.

477
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,100
 But what happened was the evidence was just destroyed.

478
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,740
 Those bones, those bones are so delicious.

479
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,820
 Make some bone soup of old Dutch boy over there.

480
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,960
 This is the only artifactual evidence of European cannibalism.

481
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,520
 But it has happened before.

482
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,200
 So that's an interesting story and it would be great to end on if this was a historical

483
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,080
 podcast.

484
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,880
 Which sometimes we do do historical stuff, but what Honeywands theory was, it ties this

485
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,720
 story into the story of the wind ago.

486
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,440
 And I want to take a time out to mention this as well.

487
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,280
 This story is what I mean.

488
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,360
 A lot of times people recommend stories and I really appreciate all your recommendations.

489
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,700
 They'll recommend stories to me that are fairly well known or would just be me kind of going

490
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,420
 over a very popular theory.

491
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,440
 If you want me to cover something like that, find a unique spin on it.

492
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,740
 Find a unique spin on it.

493
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:50,300
 The Windy Go, he's had movies, he's had television shows, cartoons, action figures, he's basically

494
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,080
 Bigfoot, but farther up north and all snowy and stuff like that.

495
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,440
 I wouldn't do an episode about the Windy Go.

496
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,240
 But Honeywands was able to present this to me in a unique way, a way I'd never heard

497
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,880
 about the Windy Go.

498
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,520
 So if you want me to cover a topic that's more popular, this is kind of what I'm looking

499
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
 for.

500
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,800
 So thank you Honeywands.

501
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,900
 And really thanks to everyone who sends me story suggestions because it definitely always

502
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
 helps.

503
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,760
 Sergio, let's fire up this colonial carpenter copter.

504
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
 We're leaving behind Jamestown.

505
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,980
 They're like, "Please give us some food.

506
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
 Give us some food."

507
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,700
 We're throwing corn out of the helicopter.

508
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,500
 We're changing the timeline, but I just had a bunch of corn out of gate rid of anyways.

509
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,220
 Let's make sure the snail's on board too or they're going to make them into some escargot.

510
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
 We're leaving behind Jamestown.

511
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,380
 We're flying up north to the wooded areas of Canada and America.

512
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,300
 I'm sure there's a specific forest named up there.

513
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,780
 We're just going up to the wooded areas.

514
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,940
 The Windy Go.

515
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,840
 Like I said, super popular story.

516
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,720
 It's basically a snow covered bigfoot in essence, in physical essence.

517
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,800
 But that's actually a westernized version of him.

518
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,320
 When we think of Windy Go, a lot of times in the movies he has horns, he's very beastal,

519
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,040
 he's like a bigfoot creature.

520
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,080
 But it's originally a Native American legend and it's very, very popular in the northeast

521
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
 of America.

522
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,800
 In Canada you have these stories.

523
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,560
 We actually covered something similar to it called the Stoneclad on a recent episode.

524
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,140
 There's some parallels between the Windy Go and the Stoneclad as well.

525
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,300
 It tends to be a 7-8 foot tall creature.

526
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,340
 In the original version it's an emaciated human.

527
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,420
 Which is less scary than a big beast with horns until we get to why it's going on like

528
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
 this.

529
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
 Why it's an emaciated human.

530
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,420
 7 foot tall, emaciated human with a heart of ice.

531
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,380
 The only way to kill it is to...

532
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,000
 This is funny too because this is where we do see other western elements.

533
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I could not find a Native American way to kill a Windy Go other than you have to get

534
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,480
 a shaman to practice these rights to get rid of it.

535
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
 If you look at...

536
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
 I was looking at these other websites and they're like, "You must smash the ice heart

537
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,000
 preferably with a steel blade and then take it and lock it in a steel box to put it in

538
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,760
 a cemetery."

539
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,980
 None of those things existed in Native culture.

540
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
 They didn't have steel.

541
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,900
 They definitely didn't have a steel box.

542
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
 They didn't have a steel sword.

543
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,180
 And they didn't have consecrated cemeteries.

544
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,820
 They did have burial grounds.

545
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,020
 So we start to see those western...

546
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,900
 So basically if you're being chased by a Windy Go you might want to call up Sniper because

547
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,340
 if you go online to try to figure out a way to kill them it's not going to work.

548
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,260
 Maybe Sniper's friend knows a shaman.

549
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,060
 But the Windy Go is this creature.

550
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,140
 Now it's very, very interesting cryptid.

551
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,840
 It's not really a cryptid in and of itself.

552
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,400
 It's a spirit that invades a human.

553
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,360
 And it starts off as just a normal person.

554
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,880
 Generally the most easiest way if you ever want to become a Windy Go is to devour human

555
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,560
 flesh.

556
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,720
 And the spirit comes inside of you.

557
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,360
 But you're just a normal dude.

558
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,280
 I'm 5'11", walking down the street.

559
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,360
 I see a dude sleeping on the ground taking a nap.

560
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,460
 He smells like bacon grease.

561
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
 So I walk up.

562
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,420
 I take a bite out of his bicep and I run away.

563
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,140
 They never catch me.

564
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,700
 But now the Windy Go spirit has gotten ahold of me.

565
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,740
 Now you think that big juicy bicep should have made me a little full, right?

566
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,900
 It actually should have made me sick and nauseous.

567
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,380
 But it should have at least filled my tummy up a bit.

568
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,540
 Now I'm hungry for more human flesh.

569
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,140
 I'm out walking the streets looking in the bacon district, looking for other people who

570
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,940
 taste like delicious sausage.

571
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,480
 And no matter how many people I eat, I never get full.

572
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
 I'm never satiated.

573
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,840
 But it's not because of any sort of weird, mystical black hole in my stomach.

574
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,800
 It's that the more human flesh you eat, the bigger you get.

575
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,760
 Because now I'm 8' tall that I can eat a whole human.

576
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,120
 And I think this will fill me up.

577
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
 This human is a minute bull.

578
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,020
 He's as tall as I am.

579
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,260
 But by the time I digest him, now I'm 12' tall.

580
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,640
 You get bigger and bigger the more human flesh you devour.

581
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,860
 But the more human flesh you devour, the hunger never goes away.

582
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,040
 It is the definition of a stalker and a tormentor.

583
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,660
 It can imitate any person's voice.

584
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,060
 It's so strong even in the beginning.

585
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,460
 It can push over trees.

586
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,980
 It will come at you straight through the forest.

587
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,560
 It will make tons of sound to scare you to feed off that fear juice.

588
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,560
 Or it can make no sound at all.

589
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,400
 And devour you without you even noticing it.

590
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,680
 Very very typical cryptid lore stuff.

591
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,760
 Very interesting stuff, but very well known stuff.

592
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,480
 So what's the special twist on this?

593
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,000
 Honeywands theory, and there's other people who believe this theory as well, is that you

594
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,800
 had early instances of the Windigo legend in native tribes.

595
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,980
 Maybe in the northeast of America and in Canada.

596
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,380
 You saw early stories about Windigos.

597
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,260
 Generally they were solitary events.

598
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,840
 A Windigo.

599
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,640
 The Windigo.

600
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:18,280
 But then when the Europeans showed up, the stories became more popular again.

601
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,500
 This is the theory.

602
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,580
 That the Windigo legend was inspired by the Europeans.

603
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,600
 But to be fair, you could say you got a whole new group of listeners who were writing down

604
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 the legend.

605
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,800
 It could have been very popular before the Europeans showed up, and now it's just written

606
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,000
 down and shared with future generations.

607
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,680
 But there are many people who say that the Europeans inspired the story of the Windigos.

608
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,200
 And that would kind of explain why in the beginning you had these limited instances

609
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,800
 of Windigo encounters.

610
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,760
 Because we can go back to the stories of Vikings landing in the United States.

611
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,660
 Of wayward European ships lost at sea ending up in the United States.

612
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,420
 And you just have these small groups of people.

613
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,580
 Alien to this land.

614
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
 Showing up.

615
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,620
 But you're like, Jason, the Europeans didn't show up and just full pack man and just started

616
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
 eating everybody.

617
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,940
 So why would this cannibalistic spirit be tied to the Europeans?

618
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,580
 The Windigo idea of cannibalism is only a part of it.

619
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:31,880
 When you really dig into the legends, another part of it is not necessarily flesh cannibalism.

620
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,420
 It's the destruction of nature itself.

621
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:41,240
 It's the destruction of the natural order.

622
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:48,320
 If you were a Native American and the year is 1200 AD, and a Viking longship ended up

623
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,000
 on your shore, your tribe has always been moving around.

624
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,940
 You may be confined to a fairly limited area, but the limited area today would be like 3

625
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,420
 or 4 US states.

626
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,300
 You're moving, following the food source, you're following the seasons.

627
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:09,820
 And a group of outsiders show up and they begin chopping down trees, building permanent establishments,

628
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,740
 riding runes on rocks.

629
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,780
 How would you explain that?

630
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:22,560
 Your encounters with them could either be pleasant, trading food, trading culture, or brutally

631
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,160
 violent.

632
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,920
 But they're doing something different to the world than you're used to.

633
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,760
 How would you explain that?

634
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,680
 They're chopping down these trees, they're changing the environment, it's almost like

635
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,600
 they're heartless, it's almost like they're outside of our world.

636
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
 Eventually though they die off.

637
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,340
 And then you start to see, generations later, hundreds of people come off of these boats,

638
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:58,740
 and they begin building forts and towns and cities and they're clearing out forests, damming

639
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:06,060
 rivers, and it feels hostile to the world.

640
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:12,860
 The story of the Windigo could be a reflection of outsiders coming in and devouring the natural

641
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
 resources.

642
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,760
 They're just devouring it but perverting it.

643
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,880
 We're going to chop down these trees and plant these little wheat fields here.

644
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,960
 When you could just travel the land and eat only what you need.

645
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,340
 You don't need to have these huge storehouses.

646
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,680
 When winter comes, they're like, "Just go to the place where the winter's less wintry,

647
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,760
 and kill the animals there."

648
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,720
 No, we're going to build the ground, we're going to reshape the earth.

649
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,000
 So that could be why the Windigo stories became popular once again, because they were seeing

650
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,460
 the legends come true.

651
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,860
 It's not necessarily about the humans devouring each other's flesh, it's about the humans

652
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,740
 devouring the flesh of the world.

653
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,340
 And what are we but children of the world?

654
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,740
 Now long time listeners of the show know I'm normally not this hippy-dippy talking about

655
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,420
 nature and stuff like that.

656
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,640
 But I think this conspiracy theory is very fascinating and I think we can even fast forward

657
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,380
 it to today.

658
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,900
 We have devoured the planet.

659
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:19,600
 As a species, not as an individual culture, not as an individual government, as a species,

660
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
 we have done this.

661
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
 And we've done it willingly.

662
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,020
 We've done it willingly.

663
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,380
 We love the comforts that technology has given us.

664
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,080
 That computer that I have in front of me while I'm recording this episode, it was made by

665
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,520
 people who weren't paid enough to make this computer.

666
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,760
 That's the bottom line.

667
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,600
 And when I'm done with this computer and it is recycled, it is going to be sent to India

668
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,020
 where a 12 year old kid is going to use toxic chemicals to remove the gold and the precious

669
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,060
 metals from this computer to sell to somebody else.

670
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,660
 I'm fully aware of that.

671
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,180
 We all are.

672
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:02,580
 The clothes that we wear, the cars that we drive, they all feed the spirit of the wind

673
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,820
 ago.

674
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,020
 The wind ago isn't just a cannibalistic spirit.

675
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:15,040
 The wind ago isn't just the Europeans coming to the states.

676
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,440
 The wind ago is society itself.

677
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,840
 It's the world.

678
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,640
 And we know the stuff we do is harmful.

679
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,520
 Not just to the planet, not just to our neighbors, but to ourselves.

680
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,120
 It's so interesting.

681
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,560
 We know it.

682
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,820
 We know the fact that we have those cell phones 2 inches from our brain all the time.

683
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,220
 We know it's not good for us.

684
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,260
 But we do it.

685
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,300
 Listen to music too loud.

686
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,220
 Blows out our eardrums.

687
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,420
 But we do it.

688
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:03,620
 I find it interesting to think that what if there is a countervailing spirit to what some

689
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:09,080
 people call mother nature that wants everything to be destroyed.

690
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,520
 This is beyond Lucifer.

691
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,360
 It's something natural.

692
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:20,520
 And it is a counterbalance to mother nature or an earth spirit.

693
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,520
 It is something that has existed before man.

694
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:31,880
 It is something that wants the destruction of the environment, of the people on the planet,

695
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,600
 of everything.

696
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,780
 There has to be a counterbalance to everything.

697
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,860
 There is a black hole.

698
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
 There is a white hole.

699
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:44,620
 If there is mother nature, then is there the windigo?

700
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:52,260
 Is there a spirit that infuses people that makes us want to distort and control and pervert

701
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:58,060
 the planet and our own bodies?

702
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,640
 The windigo is winning.

703
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,440
 It's hard to hunt a cryptid when you're already inside its belly.

704
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:31,740
 It's hard to hunt a cryptid when you're already inside its belly.

705
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:49,180
 It's hard to hunt a cryptid when you're already inside its belly.

706
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,760
 (upbeat music)

707
00:37:51,760 --> 00:38:01,760
