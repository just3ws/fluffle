1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 A string of arsons strike the city of Vancouver, British Columbia.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
 The target?

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
 Mason lodges.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
 Are we going to talk about that?

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,320
 I don't know.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
 I don't know.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,120
 This last episode of season 13 has been such a struggle.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,960
 I do have some stories though for you.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
 Maybe that one?

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,780
 Maybe that one we'll see.

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,720
 Are Nickelodeon theme songs haunted by angels?

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,920
 And then some other stuff?

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
 I don't know.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:43,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,760
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,800
 I'd like to say we have a bunch of stuff to cover.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,760
 But I do have stuff in mind I want to talk about and it is related to the topic.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,280
 I'm not just going to start doing movie reviews.

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,560
 But this is the end of season 13.

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,800
 I'm physically beat.

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,640
 I'm mentally beat.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 But in good ways.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,240
 I think we're ending off season 13 really strong.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,120
 I can't say that in the straight face.

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,480
 This episode might be a little wobbly.

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,000
 Just like yesterday's episode, I have recorded a full episode for the season finale.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,300
 Wasn't good enough.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,320
 This one will be better.

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,040
 The other one just didn't have any energy to it.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,520
 I wanted to pick some stories that I'm kind of excited about and are kind of more personal

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
 type stories.

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,120
 Not personal stories.

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,220
 Personal observations.

36
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,760
 Personal conspiracy theory type of things.

37
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,320
 Which you guys do seem to like.

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,080
 But before we get started on any of that, let's introduce our newest Patreon supporter.

39
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,680
 Uh uh uh uh.

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,080
 Duh duh duh duh duh duh.

41
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,720
 This incomes our newest Patreon supporter, Wiz's Carb.

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,440
 Everyone give a round of applause to Wiz's Carb.

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,800
 He's dressed up like a boy band memories in a white suit.

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
 Just like those boy bands in the 1990s.

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 Duh duh duh duh duh.

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
 Now we all have white suits on.

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,200
 We're all doing matching boy band moves.

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
 Trust me.

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
 This is better.

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,480
 This is better than the last version, okay?

51
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,240
 Last version was super boring.

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
 Wiz's Carb.

53
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,120
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you don't know all the moves, we're gonna

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,080
 spend a lot of time practicing.

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
 Just help to get the word about the show.

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
 Really, really helps out a lot.

58
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,320
 We're gonna get into why Wiz's Carb is dressed up like a boy band member in a second.

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,080
 Let's actually talk about this Mason's thing.

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
 I was joking in the beginning.

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,640
 I do want to talk about it, but we don't really have a lot of information to go off

62
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
 of.

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,120
 What happened was, actually before I'm totally getting ahead of myself, Wiz's Carb, let's

64
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,040
 go ahead and hop into Jason Jalopy.

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,640
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

66
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,920
 We were headed up to Vancouver, Canada.

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,320
 It's a really bizarre story.

68
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,200
 This just happened on March 30th, 2021 and anyone who knows anything about conspiracy

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,480
 theories knows the number three is very powerful and I always poo poo that stuff.

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,080
 But that doesn't mean that people who are into it find it very important.

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
 Do you know what I mean?

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,040
 I don't think there's any difference between committing an act on the 33rd day than there

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,200
 is on the 7th day or the 12th day or anything like that.

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
 But to someone who believes in it, it is very, very important for them to follow these numbers.

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:20,240
 So 33-0, 2021, three Mason Lodges in Vancouver, Canada were set on fire within 90 minutes.

76
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,560
 This wasn't an accident, it wasn't bad wiring and all three of them.

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,400
 We know that for a fact because the suspect who has not been named has been arrested.

78
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,800
 He was actually walking out of the third location with a gas can and an off-duty cop

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,960
 is walking by and there's flames coming out of a building.

80
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,400
 The cop is looking at the guy with the can walking away home in a jaunty tune and the

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,120
 guy is looking at the building and the guy is in his car and the cop looks back at the

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,960
 building and the guy is starting to drive away.

83
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,320
 The cop actually does start wrestling the dude.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,640
 The dude gets away but the cop is like "Okay, I'll just do this" and he pulls out his phone

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,040
 and he writes down the license plate and calls it in.

86
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
 They arrest him.

87
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,960
 They haven't revealed the name yet because in Canada apparently, this is a pretty good

88
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,040
 law, you can't name someone until they've actually been arrested.

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
 Actually, that's a terrible law.

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
 What if someone is on the run from the cops?

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
 They're like "There's a mass murderer and he might be buying a plane ticket to leave

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,560
 the country and kill again in another country but we can't tell you who."

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,760
 The airline's like "Oh, I'm sure there are.

94
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,080
 I'm sure they can tell other cops.

95
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,680
 I'm sure they can warn other cops."

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,160
 They're like "Who should we be on lookout for?"

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,400
 They're like "I can't tell."

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,000
 But anyways, the media, they won't reveal to media.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
 But anyways, so he burned these things.

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,280
 We know it's a 42 year old man.

101
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
 That's all we know.

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
 Here's my take on this.

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,440
 The arsonist believed that the Masons were an evil group of people and he waited until

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,400
 3030 to set all this stuff on fire.

105
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,680
 There's also a question, because I mentioned it on a previous episode but I didn't actually

106
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,960
 do the story about the, what was it, the 40 days blood ritual, the sacrifice, the mass

107
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,840
 sacrifice days that are coming.

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,880
 I researched a bunch of it and recorded it and then had a scrap and I don't really remember.

109
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,440
 But anyways, they supposedly were in this time period, like the 40 days of the feast

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
 of the beast.

111
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,600
 That sounds like something, sounds like a special sale down at the local hometown buffet.

112
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,320
 "All you can eat for $6.66.

113
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
 Feast of the beast."

114
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,120
 It could be related to that.

115
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,680
 My take on it is this guy is an anti-masonic conspiracy theorist and he set it on fire.

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,280
 However, I think we'll see conspiracy theories go around that the Masons set their own buildings

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,400
 on fire because they committed some sort of blood sacrifice there and they had to cover

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
 up the evidence.

119
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,560
 Because you know, whenever you're committing a crime you do it in three separate locations.

120
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,400
 But I think that'll be the conspiracy theory that grows out of this.

121
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
 He probably would have kept burning them down if he hadn't been stopped.

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,800
 I think it was the anti-masonic guy, but we'll see.

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,400
 He could just be a crazy guy who had a thing against compasses and pyramids and was like

124
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,640
 eyeballs and he decided to blow up any building that had that stuff in there.

125
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,080
 Also linking to where we're going to see conspiracy theories come out of this.

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
 I keep saying that, but it's so hard.

127
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,560
 This is really interesting, but I went on a couple conspiracy boards and I didn't even

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,920
 see them talking about this.

129
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
 So who knows?

130
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,240
 Everyone's so wrapped up in flat earth and the sky is fake and all this dumb stuff.

131
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,680
 This stuff, people should be eating it up, but my theory again is that he's anti-masonic.

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,640
 He's burning it down.

133
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,440
 One of the lodges is completely burned to the ground.

134
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 You can't save it.

135
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
 They have no sense of life support.

136
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
 They have a little IV bag full of cement.

137
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,600
 One of these masonic lodges just like a week or two ago, about five minutes away, a man

138
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,480
 walked into a library and did a mass stabbing.

139
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,040
 He murdered a woman and then stabbed six other people and then tried stabbing himself and

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,560
 the cops caught him.

141
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,840
 So just five minutes away from one of these lodges that burned down.

142
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,400
 So I think you'll see conspiracy theory within conspiracy theory within conspiracy theory

143
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 in this.

144
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
 Yeah, interesting story.

145
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,760
 And I'm honestly surprised we don't see more.

146
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,720
 As much as people seriously believing in conspiracy theories, I'm surprised we don't see more of

147
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
 this type of stuff.

148
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,320
 And we may in the future.

149
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,560
 We really may in the future.

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,040
 So remember that guy tried driving that train into the boat during the whole coronavirus

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
 thing.

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,200
 When the USS Comfort, when President Trump ordered that boat off the coast of LA to work

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
 as like a makeshift hospital.

154
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,480
 A guy was a captain of a train and he tried crashing the train into this military vessel

155
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,360
 because he believed that it was all fake, that the coronavirus was fake.

156
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
 Everything.

157
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,520
 He was trying to expose the truth.

158
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,040
 We had that other guy covered a long time ago who took an armored car and blocked the

159
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,320
 Hoover Dam and held up a sign saying release the AIG report.

160
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
 Which was supposed to be the...

161
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,800
 Remember it's so funny because looking at these things they were so important to conspiracy

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
 theory.

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
 Do you guys even remember the AIG report?

164
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,480
 Super early in President Trump's administration.

165
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,040
 I covered it in like episode six or seven.

166
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,760
 This guy blocked the Hoover Dam and put up a sign saying release the AIG report.

167
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,760
 The AIG report was basically supposed to be whoever the Attorney General was back then.

168
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
 I don't remember.

169
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,000
 It was supposed to be the whole thing about arresting Hillary Clinton and Q and things

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,360
 like that.

171
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,960
 And he's, I think he got sentenced recently to like 10, 20 years in prison because it

172
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,880
 was considered a terrorist act.

173
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,720
 The train guy I haven't heard from.

174
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,760
 But he's my personal buddy.

175
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,080
 I'm like, "Hey Alan, what's up?

176
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
 What's up train guy?"

177
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,840
 It's not like I would personally hear from him.

178
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,840
 It's why I shift from side to side, don't come looking for me FBI.

179
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,360
 But yeah, those conspiracy theories were so important and people have acted on them.

180
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
 This is Carbs.

181
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,680
 Let's call in the dead rabbit dirgeable.

182
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,680
 We are going to leave behind Vancouver.

183
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,840
 We are headed out to Hollywood.

184
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,360
 Dead rabbit dirgeable is taking the slow yet fun journey.

185
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
 It's the last episode of the season.

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,000
 So technically I should want to get there as soon as possible.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,640
 And as we're flying out there, here's a little, here's a little, why should come up a name

188
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
 with this segment?

189
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,880
 Jason's thoughts.

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
 Jason just thinking.

191
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
 How's that?

192
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
 He's just thinking.

193
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,560
 A long time ago I was at the Goodwill with my little brother and I said, "Hey, let's

194
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,080
 have a contest.

195
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,560
 Let's see who can find the saddest thing.

196
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,800
 Let's see who can find the most sad thing."

197
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
 Now I've done this before like Best Buy.

198
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,560
 I'm not trying to find the saddest thing at Best Buy.

199
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
 It's a tiny television.

200
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,480
 No, at Best Buy I would have this game with Josh.

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
 Josh Moore Meyer.

202
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,920
 It's like, let's find the suckiest movie.

203
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 So we'd each have to find the worst movie and it'd be like this game.

204
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,240
 Whoever picked the worst movie won.

205
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
 It was fun.

206
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,840
 But at Goodwill, at Goodwill, you can't find the best movie.

207
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,360
 Let's find the saddest thing.

208
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,160
 My little brother got a crutch because he goes, "This means someone's been injured.

209
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,880
 The only time you have a crutch is when you've been injured."

210
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,320
 I got a PlayStation 2 memory card.

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
 I'm a little rough.

212
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
 What?

213
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 What is that?

214
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,360
 And I go, "On this card," and I'm holding my card right now, "On this card is unfinished

215
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,680
 video games.

216
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,600
 This card is literally full of people's achievements that were never finished.

217
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:13,680
 Inside this card are hopes and dreams of beating levels, of saving the princess, of

218
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:21,680
 ridding San Andreas, of corrupt police, and they will never ever be played again."

219
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,840
 Now we argued over who actually picked the worst one.

220
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,840
 But on my vacation, the reason why I was thinking about that, on my vacation I pulled my PS2

221
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
 out of storage.

222
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,520
 I keep talking about it and play video games for the next few weeks when I'm on vacation

223
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
 from the show.

224
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,520
 And yeah, I put this in and it had a couple games on there, Grand Theft Auto, that hasn't

225
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,800
 been played, San Andreas of course, from 2009.

226
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 So yeah, it's weird.

227
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,880
 I think it's true.

228
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,800
 On these memory cards, we use them.

229
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,200
 They're so important to us.

230
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,360
 I don't even know what type of memory the new system uses.

231
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,200
 Apparently I'm a grandpa.

232
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,000
 But yeah, I just think it's interesting.

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,440
 These memory cards are the digital version of the self storage locker.

234
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
 That's always the thing.

235
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,240
 Self storage is where dreams go to die.

236
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,680
 I say it's where dreams go to be delayed.

237
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 But of course, some dreams do die off.

238
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,840
 You buy the guitar, you never use it, you pluck around on it a bit, but then you don't

239
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,040
 take it seriously and then it ends up in the self storage because you say you're going

240
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,120
 to pick it up again someday.

241
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,840
 Well, the memory card, I'm not saying to go play your PSDs today.

242
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,240
 I am going to play some 2007 WWE vs.

243
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
 Raw, this vacation.

244
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,880
 I'm going to have a lot of fun with that and Ghost Rider and Jackass, the video game.

245
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
 X-Men Origins Wolverine.

246
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
 Never played that, but I have it.

247
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,960
 But I like to say dreams delayed because like I was saying in the beginning, my 90 days

248
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:51,280
 to a better you for me was lifting weights and I'm seeing those cuts in my, not my cuts

249
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,800
 on my skin, I'm dropping the weights.

250
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,080
 I'm starting to see my body to return to what it was when I was in my 20s.

251
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,800
 I can look at my calves and see those little definition lines and I can look in my arms

252
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 and definitely my shoulders.

253
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
 Everything's filling out.

254
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:12,840
 So my Jason's just thinking was about how memory cards are full of dreams delayed and

255
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,920
 possibly denied.

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
 But don't let your dreams be denied.

257
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
 It's okay to delay them.

258
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,880
 But don't delay them too long.

259
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,440
 And that was Jason's just thinking.

260
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
 Let's go.

261
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,120
 Wizis Khalifa is like, what is going on?

262
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
 Wizis Khalifa land.

263
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
 Wizis Khalifa.

264
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,080
 You didn't know that?

265
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,560
 He has now changed his name from Wiz Khalifa and he's now supporting the Patreon.

266
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
 WizisCarbs.

267
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,080
 I don't know how many times I've said Wiz Khalifa this episode.

268
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
 Sorry, bro.

269
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 WizisCarbs.

270
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,880
 Bring that dead rabbit dirgible down here in Hollywood.

271
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
 Here's another.

272
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,520
 This is a Jason's just thinking or this is a Jason's just stretching.

273
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,560
 But I actually have wanted to talk about this for a while.

274
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,360
 Longtime listeners of the show know that back in the mid-2000s, really for a long time,

275
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,080
 like early 2000s, up until around 2011, up until I moved away from the area, I did a

276
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,480
 lot of babysitting.

277
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,000
 I lived with my grandma and they didn't have the energy to take care of all of their grandkids.

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,120
 But I did.

279
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,920
 So my boy Billy, I hung out with him, Logan and who are the other ones?

280
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,680
 Logan and Billy and Chuck, I don't know who the other ones were.

281
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
 Bobby maybe?

282
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 Maybe?

283
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,520
 Billy and Logan were the ones that hung them and Austin, I hung out with him all the time

284
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 too.

285
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
 Little dudes.

286
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,800
 And when you're babysitting and I babysat some other people's kids too.

287
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,800
 Jackie's kids, I babysat Jackie's kids and Kara's kids.

288
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,320
 And when you're babysitting, you end up watching young people's shows.

289
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,320
 So I watch a lot of Nickelodeon, I watch a lot of Disney Channel and there's some pretty

290
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
 good stuff on there.

291
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,520
 So I've been rewatching some of those shows on Netflix.

292
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,440
 And usually it's before I'm going to bed because it's all, no matter what horrible news I've

293
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,000
 been reading during the day or no matter what happened, I can always go and before I go

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,720
 to bed, watch two or three episodes of Victorious, it's normally on the background or now Big

295
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,320
 Time Rush is on Netflix.

296
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,120
 It's like the number four show on Netflix.

297
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,160
 And I just got done watching Big Time Rush when I started the show.

298
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,320
 When I started Dead Rabbit Radio, I would talk about Big Time Rush from time to time.

299
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 It's good stuff.

300
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,160
 I think it's quality show, it's funny, and it's also a good palette cleanser from reading

301
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
 True Crime and reading all this depressing stuff all day long.

302
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,080
 But I started to notice something in the theme songs.

303
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:46,840
 But there's always been this long controversy that Nickelodeon is connected to Satanic stuff.

304
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,600
 And it goes way far back.

305
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,720
 And the most recent one that I saw connected to was, it was such an odd detail.

306
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
 This part's not odd.

307
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,280
 Nickelodeon was supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.

308
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,600
 That's fine, right?

309
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,680
 That's not the odd part.

310
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,320
 But they would have this montage, and you can see it on YouTube.

311
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
 I'll put it in the show notes.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,840
 There was this montage where it was like Nickelodeon believes Black Lives Matter, and then it said

313
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,520
 like Black Culture Matters, and it had these other things.

314
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,920
 And then one of them said Black Magic Matters.

315
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
 And people were like Black Culture, Black Lives, totally understand.

316
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,320
 Black Magic, there's only one.

317
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,680
 I don't know the person.

318
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,800
 And it's like these quick flashes too.

319
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,000
 And I remember hearing it and not believing it.

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,520
 So I looked it up and I was like, well, I mean, there it is.

321
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Black Magic Matters.

322
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,560
 Now they could be talking about like, you know, like the magic of the culture.

323
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,200
 They could be talking about like the magic of, you know, the entire society.

324
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,200
 But that's normally not what that term means.

325
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,920
 Black Magic.

326
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,160
 It normally has a negative connotation.

327
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,680
 Even among magic users.

328
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,800
 You have white magicians and gray magicians and like witches and wikens.

329
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,760
 Black Magic is still, it has a negative connotation.

330
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,320
 And it's not negative towards the black community, but it's definitely, it has that connotation.

331
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,760
 And that is just the newest thing.

332
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,920
 I was seeing stuff about Luminati.

333
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
 There's like an Illuminati logo, you know, like the triangle with the eye in it, going

334
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,040
 way back into Nickelodeon's past.

335
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,120
 And then some of the choices they've used for the show.

336
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,440
 I remember a long time ago when I was more believing in conspiracy theories.

337
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,600
 And I say that, doesn't mean I don't believe in them anymore.

338
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
 But I used to be really, really like into them.

339
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
 Like believed them.

340
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:43,080
 I remember once there was an episode of Icarly where she fights Victoria Justice.

341
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,800
 Who's not a superhero if you're unfamiliar with that name.

342
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 It's not a superhero.

343
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,120
 It's an actual woman.

344
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,080
 Icarly was fighting Victoria Justice.

345
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,760
 And it was this whole boxing match or kickboxing match or something like that.

346
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
 I haven't seen the episode in years.

347
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,120
 For no reason at all.

348
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,560
 For no reason at all.

349
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
 Let me look it up here real quick.

350
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,200
 I didn't plan on going on this ramp, but let me look this up here.

351
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,360
 So in the episode I fight Shelby Marks.

352
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
 What was it?

353
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
 Damn it.

354
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
 I gotta look it back.

355
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,480
 I fight Shelby Marks is the name of this episode.

356
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,920
 For whatever reason, Icarly has to fight Shelby Marks who is a kickboxer played by Victoria

357
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
 Justice.

358
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
 This is the Nickelodeon show.

359
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,960
 Fine, whatever, whatever.

360
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,200
 But for no reason at all.

361
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,320
 They never acknowledge it in the show.

362
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,160
 Shelby Marks's logo is like a bull's head.

363
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
 And it's a picture of like a bull.

364
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 They never at it.

365
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,640
 Her name's not Shelby the bull marks.

366
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,840
 They never reference it on her workout or on her fighting outfit is a picture.

367
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,400
 It's a red circle with a bull.

368
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,520
 It's snout appears to be bloody and it has horns.

369
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,680
 And you could even argue it's not a bull.

370
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,400
 It looks.

371
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,800
 If you're a conspiracy theorist, it looks out of place.

372
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,520
 It looks satanic.

373
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,720
 And on her gloves are red stars.

374
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,040
 Which when held in a certain way look like upside down pentagrams.

375
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 A reach?

376
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
 Definitely.

377
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,960
 But I remember I was watching the show back when I was more in a conspiracy theory and

378
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,200
 that peaked my interest.

379
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,800
 I go, why is she wearing that horned?

380
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,120
 Why she like they never mentioned it in the show.

381
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,880
 She's just wearing a picture of a bull with like a red snout and these horns.

382
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
 And you know like is it mo-lock or something like that.

383
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,560
 And then she has the gloves with the red stars on them.

384
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,800
 Which again when her hands are held in a certain fashion blah blah blah.

385
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,960
 It doesn't mean anything.

386
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
 I thought it was weird.

387
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,240
 I thought it was a weird detail to add.

388
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,120
 So Nickelodeon has been tied a lot into Illuminati theory.

389
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,880
 Brainwashing the youth.

390
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
 Stuff like that.

391
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,520
 Kind of standard Illuminati conspiracy theory.

392
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,480
 So I'm watching the shows and watching Victorious and the theme song.

393
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,000
 This is banned from YouTube week so I can actually sing these theme songs.

394
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,720
 You don't have to listen to them.

395
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
 You don't have to listen to them.

396
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,080
 Let me sing you a bit of this song here.

397
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,520
 This is the Victorious theme song.

398
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,880
 So Victoria Justice ended up getting her own television show called Victorious.

399
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
 It's about a group.

400
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
 It's like fame.

401
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,320
 It's like a new version of fame.

402
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 It's about a group of kids.

403
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,160
 They're Hollywood high and their classes are singing and acting and dancing and they're

404
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,800
 all trying to become successful artists.

405
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,360
 It's actually a pretty funny show.

406
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,240
 I always rate stuff on how funny is it compared to network television.

407
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,320
 Like 2 and a half men or Big Bang Theory or stuff like that.

408
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,360
 And it's not as funny as say Arrested Development or Modern Family but it's light years funnier

409
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,920
 than Big Bang Theory or 2 and a half men.

410
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,000
 So they're actually pretty well put together.

411
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
 But anyways.

412
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
 Take a look at these lyrics for the show Victorious.

413
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,960
 I can't play you the song because I'm not willing to take that copyright risk.

414
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,040
 But you don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action.

415
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,800
 You're never going to get to the song.

416
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,960
 It's better than that.

417
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
 But here deal.

418
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,800
 You're going to have to roll with this.

419
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,840
 You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action.

420
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
 You're never going to fade.

421
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,160
 You'll be the main attraction.

422
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,560
 Not a fantasy.

423
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
 Just remember me.

424
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,800
 When it turns out right.

425
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:27,440
 Cause you know that if you live in your imagination tomorrow you'll be everybody's fascination.

426
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
 It's an interesting lyric.

427
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,920
 It's an interesting lyric and very uplifting right?

428
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,000
 The song is called Make It Shine.

429
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It's about...

430
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,840
 Well it's interesting because the song is about like making it.

431
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,920
 Making off not really knowing where they're at but eventually they make it shine.

432
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,320
 But let's look at these lines again.

433
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,400
 We're not going to sing them.

434
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
 Remember the show ran for three seasons.

435
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,000
 It ran much longer on repeats.

436
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
 It was in constant rotation.

437
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
 Now it's on endless rotation on Netflix.

438
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,760
 You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action.

439
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,880
 That's a great line.

440
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,040
 You're never going to fade.

441
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,120
 You'll be the main attraction.

442
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,680
 Not a fantasy.

443
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,040
 Just remember me.

444
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,720
 When it turns out right.

445
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,520
 What we're seeing in that line is the law of attraction.

446
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,200
 What we're seeing in that line is the science of getting rich.

447
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
 Which is the book I talk about all the time.

448
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,040
 This song is really talking about the secret.

449
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,160
 Cause you know if you live in your imagination tomorrow you'll be everybody's fascination.

450
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,840
 By visualizing it you can have it.

451
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,960
 So this is what I find so fascinating about this.

452
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
 The conspiracy theory that Nickelodeon is run by the Illuminati.

453
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,560
 But this song is very uplifting.

454
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,560
 And not only is this song uplifting it actually I believe in the science of getting rich.

455
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,520
 I believe you have to work hard and you have to visualize it.

456
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,640
 The strength gains I've made in my body.

457
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,320
 I give 60% to physically lifting more than I was lifting two weeks previous.

458
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,240
 And 40% to visualizing myself getting stronger constantly.

459
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,920
 You gotta do both.

460
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,280
 This song is actually giving young people the secrets.

461
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,680
 It's not just about hard work.

462
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,280
 It's not just about imagination.

463
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,840
 You have to do both.

464
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,560
 You have to put the dream in action.

465
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,680
 And you have to live in your imagination.

466
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,440
 And what's super weird about this.

467
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
 What's super weird about this.

468
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,320
 Is basically this song could be considered a spell.

469
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,560
 It's a very very positive song.

470
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,600
 And you're listening to it on repeat as the show's playing over and over again.

471
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,360
 The cast of the show, Victorious, you have Victoria Justice who was the star.

472
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,000
 You have Elizabeth Giles or Gillies.

473
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,200
 She went on to be in the remake of Dallas.

474
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,560
 She left the show and ended up doing the remake of Dallas.

475
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,240
 Victoria Justice has had done a few projects here and there.

476
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,840
 But the big star to come out of Victorious is one of the biggest stars in the world.

477
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
 Ariana Grande.

478
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,920
 Ariana Grande is on the level of like a Madonna at this point.

479
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,400
 She is a global superstar.

480
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,160
 There are still people who would be like, "Who's Cardi B?"

481
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,680
 Everyone knows who Ariana Grande is.

482
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,680
 Whether or not you like her music, she's put out hit after hit.

483
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,440
 She's on like album number seven.

484
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,520
 Like she's just been, and she releases, sometimes she'll release like two albums in a year.

485
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 She's like a monster.

486
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,400
 I covered her on an episode.

487
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,760
 She's really into the paranormal.

488
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,920
 She's really into supernatural.

489
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,240
 She'd probably love this show.

490
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,000
 But what's so fascinating about this is you have, and when she was doing the show she

491
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
 was 15 years old.

492
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,200
 She's a side character.

493
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,440
 Not a fantasy.

494
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,320
 Just remember me when it turns out right.

495
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,080
 That is the theme song for the show.

496
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,480
 Throughout the opening credits they're showing Victoria Justice walking to school.

497
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,000
 They're showing the cute boy number one waving his hand.

498
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,920
 They show cute boy number two with his marionette puppet.

499
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,480
 Not a fantasy.

500
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,320
 Just remember me when it turns out right.

501
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,120
 Ariana Grande appears on screen.

502
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,520
 Like right when they show her picture we're getting that line.

503
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,120
 It's not a fantasy.

504
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,480
 It wasn't a fantasy.

505
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,520
 It was putting your imagination and combining it with your dream.

506
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,160
 Put it into action.

507
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,600
 Is it possible that this song is a spell?

508
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,200
 Out of all seven characters on that show, the other most popular guy was the teacher,

509
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
 was the voice of Plankton from SpongeBob.

510
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,280
 Which I think they just grabbed him from that set and took him to this one.

511
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,640
 What if you had crafted a song that was a good spell?

512
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,400
 A positive spell?

513
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,120
 And it plays over and over and over again every time that episode is aired.

514
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,580
 Every time they're in the editing bay.

515
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,040
 Every time they are assembling this episode and it's sitting on these DVDs to be shipped

516
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,640
 off to the studio to actually be aired and they're constantly going through this and

517
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,280
 it's always playing that line and always showing Ariana Grande's picture.

518
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,200
 And she's the biggest star of the show by multitudes.

519
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,600
 Like not even close.

520
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,240
 There's a lot of talent on that show but Ariana Grande outshines them all.

521
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,880
 Is the song a spell?

522
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,680
 So did the people who even wrote that song knew they were crafting a spell?

523
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,680
 And are there more songs out there like that?

524
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,480
 I don't think so.

525
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
 I don't think so.

526
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
 To both of those.

527
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,440
 I think this was a fluke.

528
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,800
 I think a lot of magic could be flukes.

529
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,000
 But it's interesting nonetheless and it's interesting because it comes out of a place

530
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,820
 that is very very closely associated with Illuminati, with darkness.

531
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,160
 The conspiracy theorist hate Nickelodeon.

532
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
 Absolutely hate it.

533
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,040
 Now even when I was a conspiracy theorist I knew funny.

534
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,720
 Like I think the jokes are funny.

535
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,120
 Plus I was with a bunch of kids.

536
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,920
 I can't watch like Homicide Live on the street right?

537
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,520
 Or I couldn't even watch 2 and a half men.

538
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,000
 I was watching this stuff.

539
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 It's funny.

540
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 I was watching this stuff.

541
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,040
 But yeah, you wonder how many other spells are out there?

542
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,160
 Sitting on albums.

543
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,720
 Just a fluke.

544
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
 An accident.

545
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,280
 The songwriter didn't know they were actually crafting something that powerful.

546
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,320
 Just sitting out there.

547
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,160
 Waiting to be discovered.

548
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,320
 So Wiz's Khalifa.

549
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
 Dammit!

550
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
 So Wiz's Carves.

551
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
 Let's go ahead and leave.

552
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
 What if it is really Wiz Khalifa?

553
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
 He's enjoying the show.

554
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,040
 Wiz's Carves.

555
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,440
 Go ahead and call in the Carbentercopter.

556
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
 We are leaving behind Hollywood Hills.

557
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,040
 We are going to travel out to Finland.

558
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,720
 But first, do you like board games?

559
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
 And murder?

560
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,280
 Dun dun dun.

561
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,200
 Then the dark comedic thriller Murder Berry.

562
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,920
 Murder Berry Win.

563
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,800
 Burry, you know like Digging a Hole.

564
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
 Is for you.

565
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
 I point right at you.

566
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,120
 Critically acclaimed on the festival circuit.

567
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,600
 And winner of the best feature at Phoenix Fear Con.

568
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,400
 Murder Berry Win.

569
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,160
 Winners on three aspiring board game designers who have to dispose of a body.

570
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,920
 With few options available, they turn to their game for guidance.

571
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,560
 The premise of their game?

572
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,400
 How to murder someone and get rid of the body.

573
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,640
 Pre-order now and you'll receive the original deck of cards as featured in the film for

574
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
 free.

575
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,000
 Details at MurderBerryWin.com.

576
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,960
 Wiz's Carves as you're flying us out.

577
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,560
 This is why I was laughing during the promo read.

578
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
 It's a good movie.

579
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
 Check it out.

580
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,360
 But Wiz's Carves as you're flying us out to Finland, you start to notice that my voice

581
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,680
 starts to change.

582
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,200
 It starts to sound like this next story we're going into.

583
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,560
 I recorded for a different episode.

584
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,080
 For a different episode.

585
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,520
 But that's just the altitude.

586
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,840
 That's just because we're so high up in the carbonicopter.

587
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,080
 It's going to sound like I had recorded it for another episode, but the rest of the episode

588
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,680
 wasn't that great.

589
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,880
 So I clipped out that ending and moved to this ending because I can't figure out a way

590
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,560
 to end this episode without singing more songs.

591
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,520
 But it's just the altitude, bro.

592
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,040
 It's all in your mind.

593
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,440
 It's all in your mind.

594
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,760
 So Wiz's Carves and there might actually be jokes.

595
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,440
 There may be jokes that don't make sense because they're called back to earlier in this Phantom

596
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,480
 episode, but it's just your imagination, man.

597
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,200
 It's season 13 and you're just imagining stuff.

598
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,680
 That's the end.

599
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,120
 But so there we go.

600
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,880
 This is my eyes do the ultimate shift from side to side.

601
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,920
 And hopefully my voice quality doesn't change that much.

602
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
 Wiz's Carves.

603
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,800
 Let's call in that world famous carbonicopter.

604
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,960
 We are headed out to Finland.

605
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,280
 Specifically we're headed out to Cryola.

606
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,120
 It's in Jarvanapaa in Finland.

607
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
 It's November 1991.

608
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,240
 It's 9pm.

609
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,840
 There's a 29 year old woman.

610
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,720
 Let's name her Margaret.

611
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,000
 And she's just watching television.

612
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,760
 She's just sitting in her chair checking out the old boob tube.

613
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,560
 New episode of Perfect Strangers is on.

614
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
 That bulky.

615
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
 He's so funny.

616
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
 No one ever said.

617
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,880
 I actually liked that show when I was a kid.

618
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,720
 She's sitting there in the chair and then all of a sudden.

619
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,880
 She starts to take a breath.

620
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,200
 A circular wind starts to wrap her up.

621
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,960
 And she feels the wind kind of started her feet and wrap around her body all the way

622
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,240
 up to the top of her head.

623
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,760
 She tries to stand up but she can't.

624
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
 Her mouth opens up.

625
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,040
 I don't think she made that noise.

626
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,720
 I don't think she was mumra coming out of the crypt.

627
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,800
 Her head is forced up.

628
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,120
 She's sitting in her chair completely paralyzed.

629
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
 Mouth wide open.

630
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
 Looking up now.

631
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,520
 She's forced to see something in front of her.

632
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,920
 There is a what she describes as a holographic picture.

633
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:07,320
 And on that picture is a foot and a half tall alien just laying on a bed staring at her.

634
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,480
 Her eyes wide open.

635
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,440
 Her mouth a gape.

636
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,800
 She's staring at this image.

637
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,960
 This creature is laying there with one hand casually under its jaw.

638
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,400
 And its feet are kicking back and forth a little nervously.

639
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,600
 This creature doesn't seem to be prepared for what is going to happen next.

640
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,920
 She said the only thing she could think of is how angry she was.

641
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,920
 Margaret was overwhelmed with anger.

642
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,400
 This goes on for 10 minutes.

643
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,840
 She's completely paralyzed and she's staring at this foot and a half tall creature just

644
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,120
 lounging there.

645
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,240
 Staring back at her.

646
00:30:50,240 --> 00:31:00,920
 Then the image of this creature is replaced with a star map and then it slowly fades away

647
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:07,920
 and the creature is laying on the bed once again kicking its legs nervously.

648
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,520
 At this point the anger has become terror.

649
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,000
 She feels like they have now projected a map of where they are going to take her.

650
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
 And she can't speak.

651
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
 She can't move.

652
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,360
 She's beginning to just think how terrified she is and she's trying to send a message.

653
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,480
 I don't want to go.

654
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
 I don't want to go.

655
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
 I don't want to go.

656
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,040
 I want to stay here.

657
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,920
 Don't take me anywhere.

658
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:40,040
 And this creature stops kicking its legs and then sits up on the bed.

659
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,120
 This massive white tube appears.

660
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
 She can see it out of the corner of her eye.

661
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:52,800
 It's actually right outside her house.

662
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,520
 And she's staring at this alien.

663
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:04,000
 She's sitting on this couch and then he starts to fade away.

664
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,440
 And then starts to fade back in.

665
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,120
 He's sitting on the couch.

666
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,600
 Starts to fade away.

667
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:33,040
 Fades back into view.

668
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,640
 Starts to fade away.

669
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:45,120
 And then right where she could see the outline of the alien.

670
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,400
 He faded away but it's been replaced by the shape of the alien.

671
00:32:49,400 --> 00:33:00,680
 But now just fuzzy lines in the outline of the creature she just saw.

672
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,720
 The encounter ends.

673
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
 She can move again.

674
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,280
 The white tube outside of her house disappears.

675
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,360
 And she realizes something almost immediately.

676
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,760
 She's been sitting in that chair for 10 minutes looking at this thing, looking at her.

677
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:25,120
 She did not see its hands, its feet, or its face.

678
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,280
 She couldn't make out none of those details.

679
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,260
 She saw the legs kicking.

680
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,840
 She saw it looking at her.

681
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,400
 But when she tried to recall details about the face, how many fingers it had, what its

682
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,880
 feet looked like, her only answer is, "I didn't see them."

683
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,300
 She saw them, but she couldn't remember them.

684
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:54,200
 I got this story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com and they actually got it from Mervi Vertanen,

685
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,600
 who I believe is a UFOologist in Finland.

686
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,760
 This story was originally going to be on my David Lynch episode because talk about a

687
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,200
 lynchian encounter.

688
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,080
 This story is bizarre, just for the visuals.

689
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,120
 And just for the idea of the alien does nothing.

690
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,080
 I used to kick it with this girl named Kate in Sacramento and she always said the scariest

691
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,600
 thing to her is looking out into her backyard and seeing a man in the backyard.

692
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,720
 And I go and then, like, he tries to get in and she goes, "No.

693
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,520
 If he tries to get in, then I know what to do.

694
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,440
 If he tries to do anything towards me, I can do it."

695
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,680
 The man in the backyard is what's terrifying to me.

696
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,480
 Not knowing is terrifying to me.

697
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,980
 That's what this alien story represents.

698
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,000
 This creature just stared.

699
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,520
 It's in a very, very long for an alien encounter as well.

700
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
 Ten minutes?

701
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,160
 I mean, that's just boring, right?

702
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,000
 You get bored after a while, but ten minutes is a long time for an alien encounter unless

703
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,240
 you're getting taken onto the ship.

704
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,320
 But this story is so surreal.

705
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,760
 It's so bizarre.

706
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,600
 That you would almost want, like Kate was saying, the man in the backyard is creepy.

707
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,000
 You'd almost want to wake up and have an alien encounter at all.

708
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,480
 It's much better to wake up late at night and you see the gray alien poking its head out

709
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
 of your closet.

710
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
 And then you get terrified.

711
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,200
 And the next thing you know, you're facedown on some bed on a starcraft.

712
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,480
 I mean, again, I'm saying if you had to choose.

713
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,840
 Because at least that makes sense.

714
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,160
 Or you wake up and there's a dark shadow standing at the end of your hallway.

715
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,720
 And then, you know, that's creepy.

716
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,640
 But then you're getting chased by it.

717
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,520
 And the next thing you know, you're facedown on a metal bed on a starcraft.

718
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,600
 Because those make sense.

719
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,800
 And if you are being chased by something, if the gray is in your closet, you could beat

720
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,760
 it up, you could lock it in, you could make it record a podcast, you do all these things.

721
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,480
 But this is just so surreal.

722
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,120
 The way that it appears and the way that it disappears, the whole interaction with it

723
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,680
 defies logic.

724
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,680
 It's like an abstract interpretation of an alien encounter.

725
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,000
 You can't fight back against something that you don't understand.

726
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,480
 And we understand biology.

727
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,920
 We understand gray aliens.

728
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,800
 You can grab their little tiny legs and you can spin them around and hit their heads on

729
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
 everything.

730
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
 You can punch them.

731
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
 You can fight reptilians.

732
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
 Probably lose.

733
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,960
 But I mean, you could go toe to toe.

734
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
 You could ride an insectoid.

735
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
 You can turn them in.

736
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
 Put a little saddle on them.

737
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
 Whee!

738
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,120
 You can do all this crazy stuff.

739
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,000
 But how would you fight against this?

740
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,400
 I mean, she just willed herself into not going.

741
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,120
 But even in the end, like she's staring at something for 10 minutes and she can't "see"

742
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
 its face?

743
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:40,000
 That is more terrifying to me than scout crafts and aliens taking slaves and hybrids and

744
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,340
 all that stuff.

745
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:48,160
 An abstraction of those stories is far more terrifying because there's just no rhyme or

746
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,400
 reason to it.

747
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,640
 The real terror out there isn't the gray alien standing in the foot of your bed.

748
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,120
 Or the shadow man that you see crawling underneath your car in that dark parking lot.

749
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,920
 Or the movement out of the corner of your eye right when you flick off the light switch

750
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,720
 to go to sleep.

751
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:13,560
 The real true terror is the stuff that's so incomprehensible our mind can't even process

752
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,880
 it.

753
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,640
 That we could look at something for 10 minutes and then be asked a mundane detail what did

754
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,880
 it look like and you go "I don't know."

755
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,500
 Because if something can bend your mind that much then what hope do we have?

756
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:35,120
 We can fight physical wars, military might versus starships.

757
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,680
 But this, this abstraction, there's no defense against it.

758
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,280
 All you can do is hope and pray you never encounter it.

759
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,720
 Or if you do, you never remember it.

760
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:09,020
 Because by glimpsing madness like this, you are almost guaranteed to go mad yourself.

761
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,460

 Don't you worry about that with all sorts of new stories.

770
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
 My legs are cramped.

771
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 I'm ready to go guys.

772
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
 Peace.

773
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
 Love ya.

774
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
 Drop the bomb.

775
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
 Peace.

776
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240

778
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
 I said drop the bomb.

779
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
 I'm dead of that out.

780
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
 Otherwise we're going to get it.

781
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
 Federal government after me.

782
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
 Do not.

783
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
 I repeat, do not drop the bomb.

784
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
 Have a great one guys.

785
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,240
 Have a great one guys.

786
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:02,240
 Have a great one.

787
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,240
 Have a great one.

788
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:16,240
 Have a great one.

789
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,240
 Have a great one.
