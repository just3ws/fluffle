1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 When a hungry man shows up at a funeral,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,160
 Hilarity ensues. Then we traveled to Mexico to take a look at the story of two friends

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,800
 who are sitting in a park enjoying a panoramic view of their city.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,400
 Everything was fine until the world

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,240
 disappeared. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,460
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are staying cool out there. It is currently 94 degrees outside.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,560
 About 97 degrees in the haunted closet. Now I've been pumping the air conditioner on all day long in anticipation of this.

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,440
 My goal, spoiler alert, is to just record the rest of the episodes this week,

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,240
 tonight, when it gets cool, because I can't keep doing this during these hot hot days.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,920
 So I'm gonna record the next couple episodes and if something world-changing happens, I'll just edit it in.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,380
 You'll never know, except I just confessed that I was going to do it. Speaking of confessions,

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,720
 I don't know this weird segue. Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. It's our newest Patreon supporter.

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,380
 Hopefully he got pants made of ice cubes. It's Ethan. Everyone give a round of applause to Ethan.

15
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,400
 I'm here to entertain you, not to keep you cool. I hope you guys are cool wherever you're at,

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,080
 even if it includes pants full of ice cubes.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,680
 And I know I probably should probably should just try to get this episode done as quickly as possible

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,200
 before I die of heat stroke, but I want I want to...

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,920
 Well, I gotta finish doing Ethan's intro actually.

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
 Oh, the heat's already getting to me. Ethan, you're gonna be our captain or pilot of this episode.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,520
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine, do. Just help spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,040
 Really, really helps out a lot. Talk about the show online, talk about it to your friends, get the word out about Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,240
 And that's actually a great segue. Ethan, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,840
 Dead Rabbit Roeboat. We are going to take a nice leisurely, very cool journey because the water is the ocean's cool, right?

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,480
 We're headed out to El Salvador. Splash!

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,080
 Splash! I got a homework assignment for you guys.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,280
 All of you. I know one of you was like, "Oh, he's talking about someone else, not me." All of you.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,320
 I have a homework assignment for you. Right now, this is so weird. Right now, Dead Rabbit Radio

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,520
 is not only the number one paranormal podcast in the country of El Salvador.

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,080
 It is the number one science podcast.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,160
 And El Salvador, you didn't know it was a science podcast?

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,520
 It is. It's classified as social sciences, which includes like paranormal stuff, aliens, and...

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,240
 And I got a review, and I couldn't figure out what was going on in El Salvador.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,920
 I'll cover UFOs, I'll cover interdimensional creatures, but then I'm like, "What's going on in El Salvador?"

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,400
 The other day, back at the beginning of June, I got a review from Diego Cubo,

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,840
 and he wrote, "Great!"

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,320
 Spelled it with three R's, so he's like, "Tone of the Tiger, great!"

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,000
 And this is the review. I've never been into podcasts, but I've been listening for a couple months.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,120
 Great podcast from Jason. I really appreciate that, Diego.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,480
 And you're obviously telling other people about this show.

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,960
 Or people where the words just got out. It's awesome.

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,720
 But here's my... I'm not just humble bragging, right?

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,240
 I've spent the last couple weeks trying to find a way to reward the people of El Salvador.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,600
 This is the homework. I legitimately need your guys' help with this.

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,120
 I can't find anything. I can't find any ghost stories. I can't find any UFO stories.

46
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,360
 I found a cryptid that's like this wolf that's like one of them's black and one of them's white

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,240
 and one of them's evil and one of them's good. It's just the yin-yang symbol with fangs.

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,000
 I was like, "Eh, help me find..."

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,400
 I just insulted there's a bunch of people over there that were like, "Hey, that's our big...

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,320
 We're going to settle this in your podcast. This is a big part of our culture, you jerk."

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 I mean, it's interesting, I guess, but then there's like a little time...

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,320
 There's like a... a la-la-lor-nya woman.

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,240
 There's like a woman who like drowned her baby, which that's pretty standard, but the funny part...

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,000
 The funny part of the woman, I think she drowned her baby or one of the gods killed her baby or something like that.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,200
 The baby came back to life. It's its own cryptid.

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,080
 It's this tiny guy who runs around and messes up your wheat fields or something like that.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,280
 So, I mean, sure, I could talk about that. I probably should talk about that stuff.

58
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
 I'm obviously giggling about it enough.

59
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,440
 But guys, I want you to help me reward the people of El Salvador.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,720
 Help me find a UFO or a ghost story about it.

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,000
 There's a lot of...

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
 You know what? Even the true crime stuff.

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,320
 It's like this serial killer was in El Salvador.

64
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,480
 It's like, cool. And they're like, "And Columbia."

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,000
 I was like, "Dang it, anyone just staying in the borders of this country?"

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,240
 And that was another thing, like the cryptids.

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,880
 Like the little baby cryptid that's running around, knocking over milk.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,520
 He's all over Central America too.

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,760
 So, I wanted to find something purely El Salvador.

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,480
 So, that's my homework to you guys. That'd be really cool.

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,240
 Get it to me however you talk to me.

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,600
 Some of you guys email me. Sometimes you guys do YouTube comments, whatever.

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,440
 Whatever's easiest for you guys.

74
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,320
 Smoke signals.

75
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,280
 But, help me find something about El Salvador.

76
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,840
 Because we are...

77
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,280
 We are Dead Rep Radio.

78
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,800
 It's the number one science podcast in the country of El Salvador.

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,440
 And they just...

80
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,240
 Like, didn't they just change their entire economy to Bitcoin?

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,080
 Or, that might be an exaggeration.

82
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,240
 Now they're just accepting Bitcoin.

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,880
 So, this...

84
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,640
 El Salvador's on the cutting edge.

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,480
 We gotta get in on this.

86
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,000
 We gotta cash in early.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,040
 So, please help me reward the people in Diego.

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,760
 Thanks for the review.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,120
 That's another thing you guys can do.

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,480
 Review the podcast.

91
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,640
 Anyways, that was a little bit of marketing.

92
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,760
 A little bit of homework.

93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,160
 And a lot of love towards the people of El Salvador.

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,280
 But, I love all you guys.

95
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,360
 I love all you guys.

96
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,600
 So, let's continue this love fest.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,960
 Ethan, we're done with that journey.

98
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,160
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the key...

99
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,520
 What's another cool vehicle?

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,960
 The hair hang glider.

101
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,120
 I'm gonna go ahead and bring down the hair hang glider.

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,200
 Go ahead and get a good grip on it.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,160
 We're waving goodbye to the residents of El Salvador.

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,560
 We are headed out to Ghana.

105
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,560
 *breathes in*

106
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,200
 Ethan...

107
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,840
 Ethan's totally sweating.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,920
 He's like, "You really expect me to be able to hold on to this hair hang glider

109
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,160
 all the way from El Salvador to Ghana?"

110
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,840
 I have faith in you, my friend.

111
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,440
 And it's just a night we feel that cool air blowing in our face.

112
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,560
 Ethan...

113
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,000
 Ethan just lands in Ghana when he loses his grip.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,920
 We all tumble slightly to the ground.

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,360
 We're in the Karachi East municipality.

116
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,240
 That's in the Odie region of Ghana.

117
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,680
 Crazy, crazy story going on over there.

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,120
 This was published by the Ghana web.

119
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,440
 The website Ghana web.

120
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,360
 Isifu Yeliwa is a 52 year old farmer.

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,920
 And I can't believe they actually named him in this article.

122
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,640
 I have an idea.

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,120
 We'll get to it in the end of what's behind this, but...

124
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,440
 Why they specifically named this guy?

125
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,120
 But Isifu Yeliwa, a 52 year old farmer,

126
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,040
 he's at a funeral with his brother, his younger brother.

127
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,520
 And I'm assuming other people.

128
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,560
 It doesn't really explain how many people there in the article

129
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,440
 did explain how popular the guy was who died.

130
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,800
 But I'm assuming it wasn't just them two.

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,600
 But anyway, so we had Isifu, we had his younger brother.

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,360
 They're at this funeral and a man walks up to the funeral.

133
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,960
 And his name is Adams Quasi.

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
 And nobody knows who he is.

135
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 No one at the funeral recognizes this guy.

136
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
 The dead body's like, "I don't know, I don't know that guy.

137
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,520
 Never met him."

138
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,880
 Goes back to dead.

139
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,840
 Adams walks back into the funeral ceremony and goes,

140
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,080
 "Oh, I'm so hungry, guys.

141
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,360
 You guys have anything to eat?

142
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,640
 Like, I haven't eaten in a while.

143
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,560
 I know, I know, none of you know me.

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,520
 I'm a stranger to you, but that dude just died.

145
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,160
 I'm sure he had some groceries at his house, right?

146
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,960
 He might even have a whatchamacallit in his pocket.

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,920
 I'm just starving."

148
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
 So what happens then?

149
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,960
 I don't know how...

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,440
 This is...

151
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,400
 They don't explain it in the article.

152
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,520
 They just say that it did.

153
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,600
 They go to get this stranger some food.

154
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,120
 And the younger brother, it says in the bit to get him some food,

155
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,000
 the younger brother suddenly touched his senior brother's manhood.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,400
 That is imp...

157
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,840
 He's like, "Oh, you want sausages, my friend?

158
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,280
 We've got all the sausages you want."

159
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,800
 He's like scooping them onto a plate.

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,120
 And the older brother's like, "Uh, a little brother."

161
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
 And then he looks down.

162
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,360
 It's like, "Woo-woo."

163
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,000
 On the plate.

164
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,120
 Big Johnson's sausages.

165
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,040
 When you want a full stomach, you better make sure it's a big Johnson.

166
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,080
 Only people over 30 would get that joke.

167
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,760
 That wasn't even a joke.

168
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,400
 Just taking time out of your hot, hot closet.

169
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,960
 Just go.

170
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,480
 Just finish recording the episode.

171
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,880
 Anyways, somehow this younger brother's trying to make this stranger some food.

172
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,520
 He touches his brother's penis.

173
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,800
 I don't know how.

174
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,280
 You don't explain how that's...

175
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,040
 I've never accidentally done that.

176
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,280
 Or done that on purpose, either.

177
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,240
 I gotta be clear.

178
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,960
 Never done that.

179
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,720
 I've worked at several restaurants.

180
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,200
 Anyways, so the younger brother accidentally touched his older brother's penis.

181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,160
 But the reason why I'm covering this story, this isn't just some sort of fetish story, right?

182
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,720
 The reason why I'm covering this story is that then the older brother's penis,

183
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,160
 say it with me now, you guys listen to the show long enough, disappeared.

184
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,120
 We've covered this a couple times on the show.

185
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,880
 You might chase and play.

186
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
 I know, and please stop doing it.

187
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
 This is reported in Ghana Web.

188
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,600
 The older brother's penis disappeared.

189
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,280
 What?

190
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,040
 Oh, dang it.

191
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,080
 Did I leave it at home?

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,240
 I'm swore that I brought it with me today.

193
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,200
 His penis is gone.

194
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,240
 That seems to be this weird epidemic in parts of...

195
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,720
 I'll say parts of Africa, because that's where it's reported.

196
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,040
 Who knows if it's happening in other places.

197
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,840
 It could be happening in the middle of Siberia and some elk hunter.

198
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,720
 Oh, dang it.

199
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,000
 Penis is gone, but he just doesn't report it to the newspaper.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,960
 He just goes about his life.

201
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
 Ah, it'll show back up.

202
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,560
 We see these reports come out in Africa.

203
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,680
 This dude's penis is missing.

204
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,520
 So now you have Adams.

205
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,560
 You have Isifu.

206
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,200
 You have the younger brother who is not named in the article.

207
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,880
 By the way, he does not give his name.

208
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,960
 The younger brother goes, "Oh dude, that stranger must be your penis vanish.

209
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,920
 That's the thing that happens."

210
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,240
 Because they report it in the media over here all the time.

211
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,080
 And it says that Adams tried to restore the dick.

212
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,760
 Again, don't explain why he's getting melted chewing gum and matchsticks.

213
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,360
 He's like, "I'll make you a new one right now."

214
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,520
 But he couldn't do it.

215
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,080
 So then Adams was taken to the police station, because they're like, "You gotta do it.

216
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,640
 If you do the crime, you gotta pay the time.

217
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,480
 If you steal the dick, you get sent to prison.

218
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,080
 There's no rhyme for that one."

219
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
 So they take him to the police and they're like,

220
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
 "Officers, you guys gotta arrest him.

221
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,280
 He made my brother's dick disappear."

222
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,320
 And the officers are like, "Again, this one is weird.

223
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,360
 It's all the time."

224
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,720
 But the police issued a statement.

225
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,320
 We don't cover supernatural crime.

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,400
 We don't cover this type of superstitious stuff.

227
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:03,480
 But the police did put him in jail because they knew that if they did not do something,

228
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,920
 this guy was going to get killed.

229
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,280
 We've covered other times on this show where people have been killed,

230
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,880
 because it's been suspected they've been involved in penis theft.

231
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,720
 But there's good news.

232
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,520
 Half good news.

233
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,640
 The penis has returned.

234
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,080
 In this article it says that Issy Foo's penis has returned,

235
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,600
 but it's not working right now.

236
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,280
 It's not working.

237
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,400
 Sexually it's not working.

238
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
 I'm assuming you can still urinate out of it.

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,720
 It's all spraying.

240
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,280
 Like when you put your thumb on a hose and the water sprays out,

241
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,440
 it's just shooting out of the groin.

242
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,600
 He can still urinate.

243
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,280
 If my penis disappeared, I don't think I would run out and have sex right away.

244
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,600
 I think I would be concerned that it would like fall off.

245
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,000
 Like that little girl's head from the Schell Silverstein book or whatever it was.

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,760
 Where she had the ribbon around her neck,

247
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,120
 and the boy kept saying you were like, "Jason, this is the weirdest that way ever."

248
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,240
 You guys remember this story?

249
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,880
 Spooky story.

250
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,800
 This little girl had a ribbon around her neck.

251
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
 This boy liked her.

252
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
 And he's like, "I want to take that ribbon off your neck."

253
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,720
 And she's like, "Not today, Billy."

254
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,560
 And Billy and her dated for a while.

255
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,960
 And then maybe this was scary stories.

256
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,800
 Or this was some horrible fever dream I had.

257
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
 No, I'm sure you guys know the story.

258
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,360
 And then I don't remember if she allowed him to do it or if he just did it,

259
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,840
 but he takes her ribbon off and her head rolled across the ground.

260
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,520
 That story terrified me as a kid.

261
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,960
 That story terrified me as a kid.

262
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,880
 I never dated a girl with a choker on.

263
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,920
 I'm like, "Oh."

264
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,600
 But what were we talking about?

265
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,480
 Oh yeah, if I got my penis back, I would be afraid it would fall back off.

266
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
 At like the slightest thing.

267
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,920
 So I'm definitely not like, you know, banging some chick.

268
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,640
 But happy ending, right?

269
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,560
 This is what I find so interesting about the story outside of the disappearing penis.

270
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,000
 I mean, that's pretty interesting too.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,280
 His brother is a fetish priest.

272
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,280
 He's like, it's not voodoo because that's like, you know, Illinois.

273
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,800
 That's like an American thing.

274
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,920
 That's like the Caribbean thing.

275
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,400
 But he's like a fetish priest type of thing.

276
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,840
 He's not a Catholic priest and bondage gear.

277
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,800
 He, you know, like, you know what I'm talking about with like ceremonial magic.

278
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,160
 So his younger brother was never accused of this.

279
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,960
 His younger brother is a known magic practitioner

280
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,520
 and is the last known person to touch his penis.

281
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,280
 But he was able to blame it on Adams.

282
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,480
 But this is where we get, this is an actual line from the article.

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,400
 This is what the younger brother who again wasn't named in this article says,

284
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,320
 quote, "It is returned, but I can't tell you if it will function as it used to or not."

285
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720
 He said, laughing.

286
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:45,320
 So the dude, I'm not accusing this guy of stealing his brother's dick.

287
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,520
 But I do think he found the entire thing totally hilarious.

288
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,800
 Dude, your dick broke.

289
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,080
 Ah, he's laughing.

290
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,880
 He's like, yeah, I know.

291
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,200
 I know.

292
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,040
 Can you only find it fell off again?

293
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,640
 It's like rolling underneath the couch.

294
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,560
 He was laughing.

295
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,720
 He's telling this story to the journalist.

296
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,800
 He's laughing at the fact that his brother's penis not only disappeared,

297
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,200
 but now it's reappeared, but it is no longer a functioning sexual organ.

298
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,480
 Laughing while he's saying that.

299
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,400
 So it's all brothers out there.

300
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,200
 All brothers know that this is something they would totally do.

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,000
 Anyone who has a brother, not just brothers in general.

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,600
 But yes, yes.

303
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,000
 So that is the story of Issi Fu and his currently not working penis.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,520
 Hopefully it's working.

305
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,320
 But you know, if it's not, just go buy yourself a big Johnson t-shirt.

306
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,200
 That also turns the ladies on.

307
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,920
 Ethan, Ethan's like chicken.

308
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,800
 He's like, what the hell is a big Johnson t-shirt?

309
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,280
 Look it up.

310
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,560
 They're hilarious.

311
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,240
 They got banned.

312
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,400
 When I was in high school, they were like banned.

313
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,720
 They were banned from like, you couldn't walk into a federal building with these shirts.

314
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,120
 They were shirts of like this skinny little nerdy guy.

315
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,640
 I was looking them up the other day.

316
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,400
 I went to their website and just saw them making them.

317
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
 This skinny little nerdy guy.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,840
 It's always these busty babes and bikinis walking around.

319
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,280
 And each time there's a product they're selling, like this is a real shirt.

320
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,320
 It's big Johnson's vaccines.

321
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,720
 And then at the bottom, it has this little quote.

322
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,520
 It says, you'll feel more than a little prick with a big Johnson.

323
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,840
 Ethan, I didn't need to know that.

324
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,280
 It was a rhetorical question.

325
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,480
 Ethan, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to our big Johnson emblazoned.

326
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,360
 Carbonercopter, we're sponsored in this episode.

327
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,120
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carbonercopter.

328
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,920
 We are leaving behind Ghana.

329
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,760
 We are headed out to Monterey, Mexico.

330
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,360
 We're in Monterey.

331
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,400
 That's in the state of Nuevo Leon in Mexico.

332
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,120
 It's February 2021.

333
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,160
 It's Friday night.

334
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,960
 It's 10 p.m.

335
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,720
 There's two friends walking through the city.

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,280
 I found this story on Reddit.

337
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,880
 It was posted by someone named SickopatxRigio.

338
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,800
 We're not going to call him that the whole time.

339
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,200
 Sounds like a disease a decepticon gets.

340
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,720
 We're going to call him Marcus.

341
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,240
 Marcus is walking around with his buddy Luke.

342
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,400
 They're walking through the town of Monterey.

343
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,840
 This is their town they grew up in.

344
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,280
 They're actually just about seven minutes away from their houses, their neighbors.

345
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,200
 They're walking through this town.

346
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
 They got some beer.

347
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,240
 They got some cigarettes.

348
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,080
 They're going to have a good time before they go back home.

349
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,200
 I don't know how old they are.

350
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,600
 I'm going to assume they're legal drinking age.

351
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,960
 They're just, "Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

352
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,680
 We're going to go get drunk and come home and not be suspected."

353
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,800
 But they're also not like 32.

354
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,400
 Let's assume they're around.

355
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,160
 What's the legal drinking age in Mexico?

356
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,360
 18, 21.

357
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,120
 They're going through a walk through a local park.

358
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,280
 One thing I really like about this story is there are coordinates provided.

359
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,720
 You can actually look up where they're at on Google Earth,

360
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,600
 which I really appreciate it when we're covering this type of paranormal stuff.

361
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,120
 It really, really gives it more of a real feeling.

362
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,040
 They're walking through the city of Monterey, and there's this little park that they go,

363
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,120
 "You know, let's just go up here, smoke a couple cigarettes, drink a couple beers

364
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,080
 before we head home."

365
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,600
 You know, we're not going to be here that long.

366
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,080
 And they're not.

367
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
 They're up there for about an hour just chatting.

368
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,960
 And they have this panoramic view of the city in front of them.

369
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,600
 You got the cars driving through.

370
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 You got the life going on in the buildings, the shops.

371
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
 People are still walking on the street.

372
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,680
 It's about 11 at this point, but it's a Friday night.

373
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,880
 The city is still bustling.

374
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,480
 It's not entirely asleep yet.

375
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,880
 But while they're sitting up on this park, they're all alone,

376
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,520
 they see off in the distance, "Boof!"

377
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,520
 The power go out in a section of the city.

378
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,040
 "Boof!"

379
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,560
 Another neighborhood goes out.

380
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,040
 "Boof!"

381
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,240
 "Boof!"

382
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,440
 "Boof!"

383
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,400
 It's that blackout hitting the city.

384
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
 They're actually watching the city go dark.

385
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,280
 Until eventually the power is out to the entire city as far as they can see it.

386
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,920
 Kind of look at each other like, "What?"

387
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,320
 It's not paranormal, but blackouts do have it.

388
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,920
 They kind of look at each other like, "What?"

389
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,360
 So they go, "Let's call home and see if they need us to come home,

390
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,560
 if they need us to pick anything up,

391
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,320
 because the power might be out for who knows how long."

392
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,480
 Marcus pulls his phone out.

393
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,400
 There's no power.

394
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
 What?

395
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,000
 I've charged it.

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,160
 "Hey, Luke, go ahead and call."

397
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,040
 And Luke's like, "Dude, my phone has no power to it."

398
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,440
 They're just sitting up there on the park and now it's weird.

399
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,240
 It's not a normal blackout, right?

400
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,160
 And then Luke goes, "Hey, listen."

401
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,040
 Marcus is listening.

402
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,960
 He goes, "I don't hear anything."

403
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,480
 And Luke says, "What happened to all the cars, dude?"

404
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,720
 Powerouts don't affect cars.

405
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,320
 Why don't we hear cars anymore?

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,040
 Now, when you look at this park, it is literally like,

407
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,840
 there's like this steep staircase and then there's a road there,

408
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,400
 and then you see all the roads criss-crossing through the city.

409
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,320
 The power goes out.

410
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,400
 It wouldn't affect the cars.

411
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,200
 It'll affect the street lights, but you'll still see headlights.

412
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,040
 Not only has this blackout affected their phones, it's affected cars.

413
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,080
 It's nothing.

414
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,960
 It's almost like an EMP blast shut down the grid.

415
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,400
 But they don't hear cars and they're looking down the city streets

416
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,240
 and everything is perfectly still.

417
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,040
 They don't even see people walking down the street anymore.

418
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,960
 But they do see their city.

419
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,760
 It's drenched in darkness.

420
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
 It's only being lit by the natural light.

421
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,480
 But as they're sitting up in this park, they see no movement in the city in front of them.

422
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,200
 The only thing they hear are the bugs kind of wrestling through the bushes in the park.

423
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,360
 Those are some loud bugs, right?

424
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,560
 But I guess if nothing else was making noise, you'd hear that.

425
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,920
 They also, he specifically said, they could hear the cockroaches.

426
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,600
 So I've never heard a cockroach, but if you can hear cockroaches,

427
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,120
 those are pretty big cockroaches.

428
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,960
 They leave the park, they leave the park because the cockroaches are like, "Mmm, more food."

429
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,320
 They leave the park, they walk down the stairs.

430
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
 They begin walking through the city.

431
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,680
 And what they're expecting to see is people, they're expecting to see people.

432
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,480
 People in the stores, people sticking their heads out.

433
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,840
 I know whenever there's a power outage, most people's first response might be,

434
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,920
 "When the power goes out, you walk out of your house."

435
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,720
 Because you think, "Is it just me?

436
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,160
 Like, did I not pay the power bill?"

437
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,080
 Which is kind of likely.

438
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,760
 Then you see the rest of the street is dark and you're like,

439
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,680
 "Woo, my financial irresponsibilities did not catch up with me today."

440
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,720
 And then you go back inside.

441
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,600
 But none of that's happening.

442
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,160
 People aren't coming out to see if it's just them losing power.

443
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,040
 There's no people.

444
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,000
 There's no people in the shops.

445
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,760
 There's no people coming out of the restaurants.

446
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 There's no people anywhere.

447
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,560
 But Marcus and Luke walking through the city.

448
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:03,400
 Oddly enough, another odd detail is that not only was there no one in the city,

449
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,520
 the city seemed abandoned.

450
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,040
 It wasn't as if everyone just kind of disappeared.

451
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,440
 It was as if the city was left that way for a purpose.

452
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,200
 He said the stores look abandoned.

453
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,840
 He said the cars were parked.

454
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,720
 It's not like they were driving on the road and the drivers simply disappeared

455
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,160
 and the cars were still in the street.

456
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,040
 The cars themselves were in parking spots and they were walking down this empty road.

457
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,280
 They see a 7-Eleven for a second Marcus is thinking maybe we can break in.

458
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,560
 Maybe we'll get some more booze.

459
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,440
 Irresponsible, but a normal response when you're trapped in the twilight zone.

460
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,720
 They see a 7-Eleven.

461
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,920
 Lights are off like every other store.

462
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,480
 They walk up and they go to open the door.

463
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,120
 It's locked.

464
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,720
 This was a 24-hour 7-Eleven.

465
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,320
 The door is never locked.

466
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,560
 I don't even know 7-Elevens have locks.

467
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,160
 They've been walking for a few minutes.

468
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,840
 They're halfway home.

469
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,640
 And you have to wonder what they're thinking.

470
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,120
 At no point in this story are they starting as far as when Marcus wrote it.

471
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,200
 He was he thinking, "Paranormally, Vance, he wasn't thinking time slips or anything like that."

472
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,400
 They're in the moment.

473
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,320
 They can't figure it out, but you know that your home, your loved ones, are just a few minutes away.

474
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,880
 I would assume there's something in the back of your head thinking if everything's abandoned.

475
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,400
 What happens if I get home and they're gone as well.

476
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:44,520
 They're halfway home and all of a sudden the city lights back up.

477
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,320
 People are walking on the sidewalks.

478
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,640
 Cars are driving.

479
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,320
 Why are those are stumbling out at 7-Eleven?

480
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,000
 It's like nothing happened.

481
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,080
 The city is back to life.

482
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 Marcus and Luke are like, "What just happened?"

483
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,560
 You know, it's not like one of them was having a fever dream.

484
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,080
 They were both seeing this thing.

485
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,520
 Cars are driving by them.

486
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,120
 They're just kind of standing there.

487
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,400
 Well, now that the power is back on, maybe we can call home and see what's going on.

488
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
 Marcus looks at his phone.

489
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,840
 It's 2 a.m.

490
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,760
 They were at the park around 11 p.m.

491
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,720
 So three hours are unaccounted for.

492
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,400
 The last time they knew the time, it was 11 p.m.

493
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,240
 They left the house at 10 p.m.

494
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,840
 They were up at the park for about an hour.

495
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,760
 And now it's three hours later than it should be.

496
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,120
 And on Marcus' phone, there's a ton of messages.

497
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,760
 "Where are you? Where are you when you're coming home?

498
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,320
 I'm worried."

499
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,960
 When Marcus finally gets home, his mom is freaking out.

500
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,360
 Yelling at him gives him a big hug, is crying because they thought something horrible had happened.

501
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,240
 And Luke got the same treatment as well.

502
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,480
 Because they were just disappeared off the face of the earth for three hours.

503
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,600
 And the parents don't believe him, obviously.

504
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,000
 It's just one hell of an excuse, right?

505
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,520
 "What were you doing? Why'd you break her feet?"

506
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,400
 "Well, the universe... Mom, the universe went crazy."

507
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,720
 But he stands by that story.

508
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,160
 Now, at the end of the story, he leaves those Google map coordinates so you can view it

509
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,280
 yourself and see where they were at this whole time.

510
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,320
 It's an interesting story.

511
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,920
 It has parallels to

512
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:26,600
 dimensional rifts, alternate universes, alien abductions with the time distortion.

513
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,200
 This is one of those stories that he just gets classified as high strangeness.

514
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,760
 You can't really put it as one thing or another.

515
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,120
 They didn't pass through a portal.

516
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,640
 There was no event that led them into an alternate dimension.

517
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,480
 There were no beans from another world.

518
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,600
 There was no high technology.

519
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,120
 There was no glimmering orb coming out of the woods around them.

520
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,800
 They're war giant cockroaches, but we don't know what their technology's like yet.

521
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,560
 So it just fits into a story of high strangeness.

522
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,320
 But it's a chilling one.

523
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,800
 It's a chilling one.

524
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,600
 Time slips would work as well, but it doesn't seem that...

525
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,640
 We've covered stories with time slips before where people are walking through a British

526
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,680
 village and it looks like it was from the 700s.

527
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,960
 And they're walking through it in 1997 or whenever that story took place.

528
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,000
 I'll put it in the show notes.

529
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,800
 But this one, everything was...

530
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,400
 And that village was also abandoned, but they had the feeling like they were being watched.

531
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,320
 They had never been to that town before.

532
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,760
 They had passed through it once on a field trip or something like that.

533
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,080
 This was these boys' hometown.

534
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,360
 They knew it like the back of their hand.

535
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,640
 They were walking back home.

536
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,160
 At the farthest, they were only seven minutes away from their house when they were up at the park.

537
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:41,000
 And so to walk through an alternate version of your hometown.

538
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,280
 And the reason why I say alternate, it's not like everyone disappeared.

539
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
 The cars were parked.

540
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,920
 The stores were locked.

541
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,280
 When you looked through them, they looked like no one had been in them for a long time.

542
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,680
 Those elements really add a creepiness to it.

543
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:01,080
 It seems not so much like an alternate reality of the town, but a facsimile of the town that they live in.

544
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,160
 Like someone had built a model of it.

545
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,400
 Like a model train set.

546
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,360
 You have these little stores, but they don't...

547
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,320
 There's nothing in them.

548
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,800
 There's no...

549
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,520
 If you go in there, you don't see little bags of potato chips.

550
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,240
 It's just a facsimile of what a store would look like near a railroad track.

551
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,560
 So who knows what it was?

552
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,880
 I mean, obviously it could just be the story was made up

553
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,720
 and the guy found the coordinates on Google Earth.

554
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,080
 We gotta throw that in here.

555
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,040
 It's obvious.

556
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,720
 It's obviously possible it was made up.

557
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,880
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps here to wrap this guy up.

558
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,640
 It happened so easily to them.

559
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,600
 They were having fun.

560
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,480
 They were hanging out.

561
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,080
 And they got thrust into a world of darkness.

562
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,440
 That was empty.

563
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,880
 Devoid of human life.

564
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,240
 By no fault of their own.

565
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,920
 Like I said, they weren't exploring a spooky cave

566
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,320
 or they weren't able to outrun an orb

567
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,920
 or a ship didn't appear overhead.

568
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,840
 They were just there.

569
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,080
 So you have to wonder, could it happen again?

570
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,200
 Has it happened again?

571
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,880
 People just walking down the same street they have a hundred times.

572
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,920
 And then between one step and the other,

573
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,480
 they find themselves leaving our world

574
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,000
 and entering a world shrouded in darkness.

575
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,520
 That's so familiar you could find your way back to what was your home.

576
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,280
 But you're the only human living in it.

577
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,240
 These kids came back.

578
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,400
 These kids were found and they'll probably never forget this experience.

579
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,480
 Eventually they'll probably think it was a dream or

580
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,880
 one of them will say, "I don't remember it's quite like that."

581
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,280
 I think their minds will start to try to heal up.

582
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,560
 That's quite a psychic wound.

583
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,040
 So as time goes on, I think they'll probably stop believing it.

584
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,640
 I mean, it just happened a couple months ago,

585
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,720
 which happened in February of this year.

586
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,720
 But as they get older and hopefully they live very long, healthy lives,

587
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,120
 but as they get older, they'll probably figure out ways to cope with it.

588
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,800
 But again, assuming that it did happen, it could happen again.

589
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,720
 And what happens when you find yourself in that realm

590
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,040
 and you don't get teleported back?

591
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,480
 [silence]

592
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
 Over here, you're a missing person.

593
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,160
 People put up flyers for you and those flyers get tattered

594
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,960
 and eventually fall off the telephone poles.

595
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,120
 Your family never gives up looking for you, but

596
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,080
 the rest of the world kind of moves on.

597
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,720
 But you're right where you should be.

598
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
 You're at home.

599
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,520
 You're laying in your bed.

600
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,440
 You're sobbing.

601
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,680
 Because you can't understand what happened.

602
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,280
 You're in a world of darkness that looks like a cold, dead husk

603
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,800
 of the warm world you grew up in.

604
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,720
 You cry yourself to sleep every single night.

605
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:07,320
 Praying someday that the universe will be just and send you back home.

606
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,920
 The universe isn't just, though.

607
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,080
 It's chaotic.

608
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,680
 And it can steal you away at any moment.

609
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,280
 They never find you.

610
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,440
 They never find your body.

611
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,240
 But somewhere out there in the multiverse, there is a reality

612
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,360
 with precisely one skeleton.

613
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,600
 Yours.

614
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,320
 And it continues to lay in your own bed that is in your own house,

615
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,800
 that is in your own neighborhood.

616
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,280
 That is on a planet that is not yours.
