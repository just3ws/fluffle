 What do blind people see when they dream? And then we visit one of the last
 uncontacted tribes in the world. Are the inhabitants of North Sentinel Island
 actually guarding alien artifacts? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.
 It's actually still Thanksgiving for me because I recorded these the day before.
 For you, future listener, it's no longer Thanksgiving. It's still Thanksgiving
 for me and I have right here, because I'm celebrating Thanksgiving, a
 strawberry-ta. Strawberry-ta. It is sparkling margarita in a can. I actually
 have had this before. It's pretty good and before anyone says that it's a girl
 drink, I'll have you know it is 8% alcohol. That makes it 16 proof. That's not a
 girl drink. I also, this isn't a sponsorship or anything. I'm just
 celebrating Thanksgiving and then after I recorded this I'm gonna eat some
 Thanksgiving dinner, some instant potatoes, and some stovetop stuffing. And I
 got these little turkey TV, they're not even TV dinners. They're like complete,
 but it's like eats is all capitalized. So that's it. I like having a
 laid-back Thanksgiving. My family's all over the place, so I like just kind of
 chilling. And I'm chilling with you guys. I'm chilling with you guys, so that's
 totally cool too. And I hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving and if you're in
 parts of the world that don't celebrate Thanksgiving, I hope you had a great
 Thursday. So we're gonna go ahead and talk about a couple different things here.
 First story we're gonna talk about is something of particular interest to me
 and I think it's something that people have thought about and that's do blind
 people. What do blind people dream of? I said on an earlier episode people who
 wear glasses all the time in their dreams do they wear glasses? I've wondered
 about that. Like in the dream are you wearing glasses on your face and if
 your glasses aren't on your face in your dream or your dreams blurry? I wear glasses
 off and on. Like I starting to wear them more as I get older but generally only
 wear them if I'm gonna be doing a lot of reading. Most of the time I don't have
 my glasses on. But I was wondering about how the blind people, how the blind
 people, what blind people dream. Now I will say this to start this off, this will
 probably get a lot of listeners to just drop the show but I used to hook up with
 this blind chick a couple years ago and she kind of explained it to me. So she
 had this or has this degenerative "I" thing and started when she was like a
 teenager where her field of vision gets smaller and smaller and smaller and
 smaller. She may eventually end up being completely blind or it may just stop.
 I used to know the name of it but it's this thing. So she was
 explaining it to me one night and she said this was so bizarre. So she goes
 "my field of vision is very limited but my mind is still processing the visual
 input as if I still had a normal field of vision. So we're over at my apartment.
 In my apartment, my apartment's messy as is and there was something on the floor
 like a wrapper or I don't know candy bar something. Not a candy bar but there was
 something on the floor." And she said "you see that on the floor?" She goes "what I'm
 seeing right now is she goes "you're just seeing like a little green box sitting on
 the floor and then the rest of it is just the wood paneling, the wood floor." She
 goes "when I look at it, I see the green box sitting on the floor and I see that
 green box replicated a hundred times in every direction because her brain is
 saying, since it only has this little field of vision, her brain is assuming
 that that obstacle is everywhere." She goes "but if I look a couple feet over
 where there is no obstacle on the floor, I'll just see wood paneling go on forever
 and ever." So her brain is trying to process the limited information
 that it has and so that's why she kind of has to focus. That's why she can't
 drive. That's why she kind of has to focus when she's navigating. She had
 the walking stick and everything like that but you know you would
 talk to her, you wouldn't know that she was legally blind but she had to be very
 careful. And because it was degenerative, it wasn't like it happened
 overnight. Her brain has learned to cope with this loss of vision. And I
 will say this too, it was super bizarre. She was super nice and incredibly hot.
 She did all this stuff that I don't want to go into because then
 people could probably identify her better but she just lived the life
 normally and did all this stuff and she was she's amazing woman but anyways she
 doesn't listen to podcasts though so I hold that against her. The point is is
 that the brain will try to figure out how to cope with any obstacle that comes
 in its way. And that's where we get into the idea of dreaming because what
 dream what scientists feel dreams are is it is a way to do practice runs
 especially nightmares. Nightmares science believes is a way to do practice runs of
 tragic and traumatic events so when these things really do happen you're
 prepared for it mentally. It's a theory but I think it's actually pretty good
 theory. Now of course we have dreams about dragons and nightmares about like
 stuff that'll never happen but it's still your brain just basically putting
 itself in a traumatic state to prepare itself for something traumatic happening.
 In the future it's a safety mechanism basically. So this is where we're going
 to get into what do blind people dream about. I know that was a bit of a lead-up
 but I think it's important because we're going to get into how the what my
 friend's experience was with her waking vision you'll see kind of start to play
 out in the dreams as well. So Danish researchers did a study. It's a very
 small study. There's only 50 people. They had 11 blind people who were blind
 from birth. 14 people who became blind after the age of I think it was one and
 then 25 non-blind people or seeing people. They did they had to take surveys on
 their dreams. They had to ask questions like did you see was it in color? Did you
 taste smell, feel pain? What emotions did you have? What type of themes did the
 stories have? Seeing people had at least one visual dream. Now this was I think a
 six-week survey. So within the six weeks seeing people on average had at least one
 visual dream usually more but at least one. The blind from birth had none. No
 visual dreams which is to be expected. They've never seen anything. People who
 became blind the older they got since they'd become blind the less likely they
 would see something because their their brain now is working being like oh
 there's no visual stimuli coming in so we don't have to produce visual stimuli
 in the dreams. What's interesting and also they had across the board across the
 three groups they had the same they were able to identify themes in their
 dreams but one of the weirdest things was that when it came for nightmares blind
 people had over tripled the amount of nightmares of the seeing people. 25% of
 the blind people said they had a nightmare versus 7% of the seeing people
 who said they had a nightmare and and when they were looking at that they said
 this is kind of showing that the brain is going through basically practice runs
 for reality because the blind people their nightmares were things that they
 worry about things that are major obstacles for people who are blind
 things like getting lost. Falling in manholes was a very common nightmare in
 this group. I've never once worried about falling in a manhole. I've thought about
 climbing into them and seeing what was down there but I've never thought like
 oh no what if I'm walking on the street and I fall in a manhole that's not a
 problem that I face. Getting hit by a car was a common one because I have to
 deal with that. Losing their guide dog so I mean these are real threats that blind
 people face and so their brain is doing those practices so if that happens if
 they're out walking and their dog runs away goes chases a squirrel or whatever
 their brain will know how to deal with a situation that immediate panic will
 start to be quelled because basically this has already happened to them a
 hundred times in their sleep but even though this is first time it's ever
 happened in real life. So and then there's this quote I thought this was an
 interesting quote from this one study. It said when a blind man is asked if he
 dreams the answer is an immediate yes but if we ask him if he sees anything in
 the dream the answer is always doubtful because he does not know what it is to
 see. Even if there were images and colors in his brain during the dream how could
 he recognize them. There is therefore no direct way through the dream reports to
 evaluate the presence of a visual activation in the dream of congenitally
 blind subjects. So it's weird they may actually see in their dream but they
 don't people who are blind from birth could never explain it. Their dreams
 could be full of visual stimuli but it they wouldn't never be able to explain
 it to somebody and I think the story is interesting. I find it absolutely
 fascinating because that's almost how we try to talk about like cosmic level
 things or there's there's so much stuff in the world that we don't have the
 language to explain not only to ourselves but to other people. I find that
 fascinating. I find everything with the human brain fascinating because it's
 not just like oh I'm blind but everything else is normal like their their brain
 still is processing all that information and the brain if if they're
 just if just their eyes are blind their brain is still able to receive visual
 stimuli it's just not getting there. So what's that part of the brain doing? Is
 it creating its own? How would you define a color to someone who's never
 seen the color red? I find all that stuff fascinating. It's all philosophical
 arguments at a certain point but these people are living that philosophical
 argument. Absolutely fascinating. The next story we're going to cover is an odd one.
 It's one that I saw pop up a couple times on the conspiracy iceberg. I figured
 there's nothing to it. There's no resources behind it. A lot of people
 requested it and I said I'll look into it. It wasn't something I was too thrilled
 about and then I looked into it and I was like okay there's something here. So the
 conspiracy theory is that the sentinels, the sentinels are guarding alien
 artifacts so to get into it I'm gonna have to give you some background to who
 the sentinels are. There is an island off the coast of India, the Andaman islands
 and there's multiple islands there and there's there's a lot of tribes there.
 I think there's like four or five tribes there that are throwbacks. Now out of
 most of those tribes there are trade and contact with the Indian government and
 they're like yeah we know you guys are like way back. You guys are still using
 spears and stuff like that but we want to have regular contact with you. When the
 people in those islands are like yeah okay you know that's fine you know
 it's a it's beneficial to both sides. One India gets to contact the people you
 know and then the people on the islands get food and supplies and stuff from
 India. However one of the islands, North Sentinel Island has a tribe on there
 called the Sentinelese. They are completely for the most part uncontacted
 by the modern world. They know we exist and we know they exist but there's been
 no formal contact between the two. There's been attempts but there's been no
 like shaking hands, sending ambassadors, stuff like that. India has said this
 island's off limits. They don't want to talk to us. They're a fully functioning
 basically prehistoric society. They don't want to talk to us. There have been
 attempts where people have gone there and two of the so two of the elders from
 the Sentinelese came and met the sailors. They ended up getting diseases, the
 Sentinelese, because they're such a throwback. It's the same thing
 that when the Europeans came to America and so the government of India was like
 okay we can't be messing with these people. Like they're fully functioning
 tribe. We're only gonna make things worse. And they have tribes like this.
 Brazil has a couple of tribes like this. South America overall has a couple
 tribes like this. But the government actually says don't go near them let
 them be. There was a time where some sailors came to the island and they
 gave them like pigs and some toys and things like that. The Sentinelese came
 out, killed the pig and buried. They'd never seen a pig before. They didn't know
 what it was. They've only really lived on this island. Killed the pig, basically
 ran people off of spears. There have been times where the Sentinelese will come out
 and they'll look like they're going to accept the explorers and then they
 chase them off of spears. They shoot arrows at them. So they're a very very
 like closed off tribe. They don't want to get to know people on the mainland. So
 this guy just a couple days ago felt that he was in his heart to go
 preach Christianity to the Sentinelese. You're not supposed to go there.
 It's completely illegal to go there. He hired some fishermen, said let me take me
 to the Sentinelese islands. I'll talk about Jesus. They killed him. They just
 lit him up full of arrows. And India in response arrested the fishermen. Because
 India has said that they've killed other there a couple years ago. There was a
 fishing boat that the two fishermen fell asleep in their boat and it drifted
 too close to North Sentinel Island. They lit him up. The Sentinelese fired much
 arrows, killed him. India said we consider that island to be a sovereign
 state. You invaded their border. They have the right to do that. We're not going
 to interfere with that island. So India really has their back. Now let's go into
 a little bit more history of the Sentinelese and then we're going to get
 into the conspiracy theory because this all wraps up together. Sentinelese they
 believe they're about 40,000 years old. Not the people on the island but I mean
 the civilization somewhere around there. They believe they traveled from Africa to
 the island. I don't know how but somehow they got from Africa to this island. I
 guess if you have 40,000 years you can kind of do anything. We don't know how
 many of them are on the island. Estimates have ranged over time anywhere from 40
 to 500. So sometimes there's peaks in the population, sometimes there's valleys
 but we don't know because we've never been there. We can fly drones overhead, we
 can sit on the beach, not on their beach because they'll kill us, but you can sit
 in a boat, look at them from a distance. They don't know how to write. They don't
 even know how to make fire. What we can tell is they wait for lightning to
 strike and they keep the fire going for as long as they can. Very very primitive
 people. There's a little bit of relation between, like I said, there's other
 tribes on the other islands in that area. There's a little bit of relation of the
 language between the Sentinelese and one other tribe but it's still such a
 far gap. They can't communicate with each other. So they're basically cut off
 even from their closest neighbor. We know that they, anything that washes up on
 the island they use, we've seen them with metal but they don't know how to do
 metal working. So when we see them with metal we go, "Oh they must be getting
 debris that washes up on the island, making these spearheads, making whatever."
 Dude, and you're thinking, Jason, you're reading a Wikipedia article about
 North Sentinel Island on board. No, because this gets really good. Trust me,
 I'm just have to set this stuff up because we're gonna go back to this stuff.
 The idea, that's the setup. The idea that the Sentinelese are guarding alien
 artifacts. Let's take a look at that. Now, of course, the planet's been around for
 billions of years. If there were ever aliens moving through the, so let's
 assume the aliens are the aliens coming from other planets, not
 interdimensional things like that for the sake of the story. Aliens coming through
 the galaxy and things like that. Over the course of four billion years, it's
 possible that artifacts and ships, I mean you have such a long period of time,
 things are dropped off on our planet and actually there have been some scientists
 that to look for proof of alien life, they're not looking up into the sky
 because that's such a small window of time. They want to look at the Earth and
 Mars and Venus for energy signatures that they believe would be coming from
 alien craft. And they said, well we know Venus is basically a big old hot swamp,
 not a literal swamp, like I used to believe. I said this in our earlier
 episode when I was a kid, I was taught that Venus had lush rainforest jungles
 full of dinosaurs. And that's why I was so cloudy and I believed that until I was
 about 15 and I would quote that all the time to people and no one was ever like
 "you're an idiot, that's not true." And I always wondered why whenever people talked
 about looking for a life on other planets, I'm like why are you worried about
 microbes on Mars? There's dinosaurs on Venus and I literally would tell people
 that and they would never question it. But anyway so there's no jungles on Venus.
 Any alien craft that crashed on Venus would have been liquefied by now, you
 know, given the time period of millions of years. But if an alien ship or an
 alien satellite or alien artifact was crashed or left behind on Mars or Earth,
 we should be able to detect some sort of energy signature from it. And that's one
 of the things with the idea of an alien artifact being left on North Sentinel
 Island. If it was just a piece of metal that had like, you know, alien
 graffiti on it, that's very interesting but it doesn't really help. It would be
 like yeah okay, an alien ship crashed here. But what people are looking for when we
 talk about alien artifacts isn't necessarily just a hunk of metal. It
 would be something that would be incontrovertible proof of alien technology.
 Is it alien technology? A piece of metal is a piece of metal. And you go oh an
 alien must have crashed here but a power source or a weapon or something like
 that is what we would really want to find. Something that would change, not just
 change our view of the universe and say yes there is living stuff out here, here's
 a picture of an alien like you know a Betty Boop alien on the side of a ship
 or you know like how they used to paint the World War II bombers. That would
 just be proof there's aliens. We would want some sort of artifact that would
 give us free energy or teach us the secrets of the universe or something
 like that. And if those things existed on this planet we should pick up the
 energy signature. We haven't on North Sentinel Island. So you're thinking well
 Jason okay then I guess you are saying there's no alien artifacts on North
 Sentinel Island. Then I say don't interrupt me. Not done. And I'll go back to
 this. A little bit of pushback on detecting for alien signatures. It's
 possible that there would be alien signatures in our solar system. We just
 don't have the technology to decipher what it is. We don't know what it is. If
 they're not using nuclear or chemical or something like that they may be using
 some sort of power source or artifact that's undetectable. So a little bit of
 pushback on that. I'm not so sold on the idea that if an alien artifact was here
 we would detect it but we're giving it our best shot trying to detect these
 things. I don't think there's alien technology on North Sentinel Island. I
 don't believe the Sentinelese are protecting alien technology. This is
 what I think. And I have I have some interesting I don't want to say evidence
 but I have some interesting facts to support this. Let's say I was an alien
 and I wanted to put something hide something on Earth that nobody would
 find. You could say you would could put it on a place that was going to be
 guarded by a bunch of prehistoric people that wouldn't know what it was. So
 that you won't have to worry about them dealing with it. However here's the thing.
 You wouldn't necessarily know when you put it there that somebody else a more
 powerful government wasn't just going to show up and take it. You could say I'm
 gonna put it here and these people around it will never know what it is. But
 there's a always a chance that somebody else will just go in. If this tribe was
 located anywhere else in the world at any other point in time they would have
 just been taken over. Like all the other indigenous people on the planet. It's
 just because this isn't a super strategic area where you know all of this
 stuff started really coming out like the 1800s where they're like I just kind of
 leave them alone. But if it was a more strategic area and if it was in the 1400s
 when these people were discovered and all this stuff going on they would have
 just been taken over. Nowadays there's enough land enough resources and stuff
 like that that they don't have to deal with this island that has enough to
 natural. So if you were an alien race and you wanted to hide something yes. Hiding
 it among an indigenous population who don't know what it is is a good idea.
 But if they had done this with a Navajo, it was just the Navajo God-seem world who
 would have found this huge reactor. If it landed there accidentally, if an alien
 didn't purposely put it there, if it landed there accidentally then the same
 thing. Eventually the chances of somebody sumlin across it and if it landed
 there accidentally it could have landed anywhere, it could have landed in New York
 City, it could have landed in North Sentinel Island. In New York City they
 wouldn't have known what it was, in North Sentinel Island they wouldn't have, but
 then they're not necessarily guarding it. It's just a piece of wreckage that's
 there and they're there as well. But what if the alien knew that no one was going
 to go there? The alien knew for a fact that for hundreds of years no one was
 ever going to go there, that group of people were going to be left alone by
 the government of India. They knew for a fact that was going to happen. You would
 put it there because you'd have the best of both worlds. You'd have a group of
 people who would have no idea what it was. They'd probably stay away from it if it
 was too creepy and you knew no one would go to discover it. You would actually be
 able to say we know eventually they're going to discover it in the year like
 2100 or 2055 or whatever, but we're gonna place this here now and we know if for
 the next 500 years no one's going to mess with it because of all these policies
 with India and the way that people are structured and all that stuff. Now of
 course this... okay we're coming to the end here. Of course they would have no
 way of predicting if India was going to go there tomorrow, 400 years ago, or 300
 years in the future. Aliens wouldn't know that, but time travelers would. They're
 not guarding alien artifacts on North Sentinel Island. They're guarding a
 time machine. Hear me out. And let me back up here. If this conspiracy is true,
 I'm not saying that it's true, but let's assume that they are guarding something.
 For the sake of the narrative, they're guarding a time machine because in the
 future they would know for a fact how history would play out. They would know
 that they would try to make contact with the tribe. The tribe wouldn't want it.
 The government of India would step in and say nobody contact this tribe. People
 from the future would know how even... and they would know for a fact in the year 2049
 eventually someone does go to the island and that's when we move to time machine.
 But for now we're gonna put it here. It's perfect location because it is
 completely isolated. It's an island that you cannot get to. You will be arrested
 if you go to and you survive. If you die, you die. But it's close enough to the
 mainland that you can leave the island and get to the mainland. Sri Lanka, India,
 wherever you want to go. It's possible that the people, the North Sentinelese,
 were brought from the past by the time travelers, bring them from the past in
 Africa and put them on the island. That's why the language doesn't match up.
 They're there to guard the time machine. They said we're gonna go back to Africa.
 We're gonna get this tribe of people. We're gonna put them on this island. We'll
 take care of them. We'll give them the metal they need. Maybe make a lightning
 strike every once in a while to give them fire. We'll watch over them because
 they're going to protect this time machine that will give us access to come
 and go as we please. Where we're completely concealed, we're close enough to
 the mainland. And you go, okay Jason, interesting theory. But do you have any
 proof? I'll say this. I have more proof of that theory than of alien artifacts. And
 this is why. In 2004, the Indian Ocean earthquake, the Boxing Day earthquake,
 massive earthquake, huge tsunami, hundreds of thousands of people killed.
 Just devastated the coastlines of that area. North Sentinel Island, the
 earthquake was so powerful it lifted it up three to seven feet in some areas.
 Just completely crumpled the ground underneath it. Massive tsunami, hit
 North Sentinel Island, hit the rest of the Andaman Islands. As the world was
 starting to put everything back together after the tsunami, officials in India
 said they're all dead. The Sentinelese are all dead. The other tribes on those
 islands are all dead. That tsunami wiped out all the coastlines in this area.
 Those islands had no chance. Let's get a helicopter and fly overhead and confirm
 what we already know. Helicopter flies overhead. They see a villager come out,
 shake his spear angrily at the helicopter. Helicopter goes, well at least
 there's one of them. None of them died. None of them. As far as we can tell, they
 just went on as normal. This massive tsunami and earthquake that devastated
 the lives of millions of people and took the lives of hundreds of thousands of
 people, didn't even scratch a population between 40 and 500. The official line is
 that there, because they're such a primitive society, they're used to
 being a tune to nature and they could tell the animals were acting weird. They
 could tell the birds were acting weird and all this stuff. They found high
 ground. The other tribes in the area also found high ground because they didn't
 suffer massive casualties. So they knew it was coming in a way. They used their
 nature-based instincts for being so close to the earth they knew something was
 coming. I have another theory. They were warned from the future. Get to higher
 ground. Their God spoke to them. And the time tribe, people from the future, not
 only would they know that was going to happen, they would warn the people on
 the other islands as well because it would look weird if only the sentinels
 survived the tsunami and all the other tribes are wiped out. You just go to the
 other tribes and say, "Hey, get to high ground. Make sure you're at high ground
 before such and such time tomorrow. Disguise yourself as a villager." They
 wouldn't know. Make it as some sort of miracle or maybe the leaders of the
 other tribes are from the future. But for whatever reason, they were warned
 whether it was their own natural instinct or a message from somebody who
 knew what was going to happen. They suffered. As far as we can tell, no
 casualties. Their society definitely continues. And its higher coastlines, like
 I said, were destroyed. You can watch the YouTube footage of the tsunami and
 imagine a prehistoric village surviving that. Is it possible that there is a
 time machine on North Sentinel Island? When I started looking at the theory
 that the sentinels were guarding alien artifacts, like I said, I figured there
 wasn't anything there. But what I found is far more interesting than why I could
 have thought of originally. I have no proof of any of this, just facts that can
 be put together in any way because that's one of the problems with facts.
 But I will say this, if I had a time machine, I would put it someplace that I
 knew not only no one would ever go to, but the people there would have no idea
 what it was. And North Sentinel Island is the perfect place in the modern world
 for a time machine from the future.
