1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 The truth might be the right thing to say, but faking it could make you a millionaire.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,300
 And then we take a look at a listener-submitted story about a young man who was just trying to get some sleep one night

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,300
 and had a series of paranormal encounters keep him awake.

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,700
 That would be odd enough, but when he finds out that other members of the household had similar experiences,

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:33,200
 it points to something other than it was all just a dream. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,700
 [Music]

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,700
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,700
 You see them every night when you look up at the sky. It's Moonman.

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,200
 Go ahead, give it up to Moonman. It's not the actual moon.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,200
 The actual astronomical body is not supporting the show, but it might someday.

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 Moonman, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
 Thank you for your continued support. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,700
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,700
 So Moonman, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are gonna take a drive out to Cardiff, New York.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
 [Humming]

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,200
 Cars driving off. We also gotta go back in time to hit that back in time button.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
 [Humming]

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,700
 We're going back to the year 1869. It's October 16th, 1869.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,200
 So it's almost close to the anniversary. Probably could have waited for this story, but I'm not gonna.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,700
 We're already there. We're already hopping out of the Jason Jalopy. We're in Cardiff, New York.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,700
 We see some guys digging a well up on a hill. So we're gonna walk up there. We're wearing old-timey clothing.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,700
 They just wore rags back then. We're walking around in our rags.

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,700
 And they're looking at us like, "Dude, what are you? What are you? A bunch of orphans?"

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,700
 "Here, buy some real clothes." But while we're at the store buying real clothes, we actually missed the beginning of the story.

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,200
 We have a montage where we're trying on new outfits.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,700
 While we were doing that, these guys continued to dig the well.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,200
 And then they end up sticking their shovel into the dirt and it goes, "Chink!"

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,700
 Hit something and they're like, "What? What's this?"

32
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,200
 "Chink, chink, chink, chink, chink!" They keep trying to do it. It won't work.

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,200
 Shovels aren't made to go through giants.

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:37,700
 When they finally dig around whatever this hard object is, they uncover the fossilized body of a 10-foot tall human.

35
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,700
 They're looking at it and they're like, "Oh my God." The other guy goes, "I know. I've never seen anything that big before."

36
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,200
 "Dude, it's like me, neither."

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
 Now, they're not looking at the giant because I'll tell you this.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,200
 When you look at a photo of this giant, there's only one thing that you notice on this thing, right?

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,700
 Because by... maybe a giant human may not be. We'll get to that in a second.

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,700
 But, this episode is not appropriate for kids. Get them out before I finish this next sentence.

41
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:15,200
 It's a 10-foot tall giant fossilized human and it's male, obviously, because its penis has to be close to two feet long.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,200
 Like, disproportionately large. I don't care if you're 10 feet. It shouldn't be two feet long. It shouldn't.

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 It breaks all the laws of science. So everyone's looking at this giant fossilized human, but really, they're only looking at two feet of it.

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:35,700
 "Oh my God. This is insane. Let's cover it up. Let's make sure that the ladies of the area don't see this."

45
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,700
 And, let's also report that we found the giant. Now, I'm going to tell you right now, this was a total hoax.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,200
 They actually did find this thing, but I'm not going to build the story up as leading you on.

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 This was 100% a hoax. This guy hatched a plan to bury a giant fossil in the shape of a human in the ground.

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,700
 And the fact that it's a hoax, I think, is far more fascinating than the fact that people actually fell for the hoax.

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,700
 So, what happened was, there, in 1868, so a year before, there was a dude named George Hull.

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:24,200
 There was a tobacco-nist and an avowed atheist. And one day he gets in this really long argument with this local Christian dude about Genesis chapter 6 verse 4,

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 which we've actually done a whole episode on the show about the Nephilim, the giants that used to walk along Earth.

52
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,200
 So we have this Christian guy going, "Oh yeah, yeah, dude, back in the day, there's so much giants walking around, and then that's why God caused the flood."

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,200
 And George Hull is like, "What are you talking about? What? That doesn't make any sense!"

54
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,700
 And the Christian guy is like, "Well, it's in the Bible, so it had to be true."

55
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,700
 And they get this huge argument about this, and it really puts a seashell under George Hull's slippers.

56
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,200
 He can't let it go. He thinks that's the dumbest thing.

57
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,200
 He's an atheist, so he thinks a lot of parts of the Bible are pretty dumb, right?

58
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 But this one, he's like, "What are you talking about?"

59
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:11,700
 So he gets this thing in his head, and he decides to build the giants. He goes, "I'm gonna trick this dude. I'm gonna trick everybody. I'm gonna trick everybody."

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:20,200
 So he ends up buying a giant piece of gypsum. It cost him a total of $2,600 from start to finish to make this plan work.

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:29,200
 In today's money, $49,000 for a prank. See what I mean? The hoax is way funnier than people actually falling for this.

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,700
 This dude dropped the equivalent of $49,000 to pull this off.

63
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,200
 They carved the statue. The first thing that it was carved is the statue.

64
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,700
 And I can just imagine the sculpture, like, "So how big do you want its dick?"

65
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,200
 And he's like, "I'll tell you when. Just keep chiseling. I'll tell you when."

66
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,700
 Chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink.

67
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,200
 Sculptor's looking at George Hull.

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 George Hull has a big smile on his face. He's like, "I haven't said when yet."

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 Chink, chink, chink, chink, chink.

70
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,700
 His hand, the sculptor's hands are starting to cramp up. Oh, man, how big is this thing gonna be?

71
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,200
 They end up, like, taking brushes and putting fake pores in the skin.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 They're making it look as realistic as possible.

73
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 They wanted this to really fool people.

74
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
 It wasn't just a statue of David, like, perfectly posed.

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,700
 It was this dude, and it's so funny, 'cause his hands are, like, covering his waist.

76
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,200
 But they're covering his junk. That's fully exposed.

77
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 They put fake stains on it. They age it.

78
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,700
 It's supposed to look like a fossilized human.

79
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,700
 And what happens is George Hull contacts his cousin, William Stubb Newell.

80
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,700
 Stubb was the nickname he went by.

81
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,700
 Probably because he wasn't hung like the Cardiff Giant.

82
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
 Nobody is, by the way.

83
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,700
 All that porn, if you believe that porn is real, like, transformers are real.

84
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,200
 TIE fighters exist. It's all camera angles and special effects.

85
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,200
 But anyways, that aside, aside, Stubb probably did feel a little...

86
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,200
 I think everyone felt a little uncomfortable around the Cardiff Giant.

87
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,200
 George Hull goes to his cousin, Stubb, and says, "Hey, listen, I'm running this huge thing.

88
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,200
 It's gonna be so funny. We're gonna bury this dude, and then you hire some guys to dig a well on your property,

89
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,700
 and you happen to find it. I'll cut you in on the deal."

90
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,200
 And Stubb's like, "What do you mean cut me in on the deal?"

91
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 And at this point, George Hull's like, "This started off as a joke,

92
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 but I think we could actually make some real cash.

93
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,200
 Specifically, specifically more than $49,000."

94
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 Because that's how much I'm putting into this thing.

95
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
 They end up digging it up, and they put it on display.

96
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,200
 We found the Giant, everyone. Come on down. Genesis 6-4 is actually real.

97
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 You want biblical proof? It's gonna cost you five bucks.

98
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 Stubb and George are kind of looking at each other, and they're like, "Well, I hope we get enough rubes, you know, to pay five bucks."

99
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,200
 There were so many people lined up to see this thing.

100
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 Lots of housewives, by the way.

101
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 So many people were going to see this thing. They very quickly raised it to $10 a pop.

102
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:06,200
 It's funny, because when I was reading up on this, it said that they ended up selling the statue to, quote,

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,200
 "A syndicate of five men headed by David Hannum," which I read as a five-headed man,

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
 which would have been infinitely more interesting, because you figure circus freaks run in packs, right?

105
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,200
 So a five-headed man's like, "That'll go great in my sideshow, alongside me, the five-headed man."

106
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,200
 But no, it was just five men in a syndicate.

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,200
 They paid $23,000 to buy this statue.

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 Not $23,000 in today's money. $23,000 in old-timey money.

109
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,200
 Remember, from beginning to end, it cost him $2,600 in old-timey money to do this thing.

110
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:53,200
 Now they're being offered $23,000 just from the sale alone, just from the sale alone of this statue.

111
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
 They made the equivalent of $400,000 today.

112
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,200
 That doesn't include all the tickets they were selling to come in and look at the eighth wonder of the world

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
 and the ninth wonder that's right below his waist.

114
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,200
 So now David Hannum has this statue. He's working for the syndicate. He has this giant--

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 It is a statue, but people-- They didn't reveal it was fake. They just sold this thing to Hannum.

116
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,200
 People at this point were getting suspicious. One of the things-- This is funny how hoaxes work.

117
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,200
 One of the things people were suspicious about was that where they dug it up from wasn't a good place for a well.

118
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,200
 You had the skeptics go, "That's weird. You shouldn't have built a well there. Why would they have dug it up there?"

119
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,200
 But at that point it's not whole and stub's problem. They're swimming around Scrooge McDuck style in their money.

120
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,200
 David Hannum has it. P.T. Barnum shows up at this point because he's running around abusing animals,

121
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,200
 hurting circus freaks with shock collars around the country.

122
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:56,200
 He goes, "I want to buy that giant from you." And Hannum's like, "No way. This thing is worth way too much money."

123
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 They're not thinking about the biblical or archaeological implications of this thing.

124
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 This thing is worth a ton of money. What P.T. Barnum does is he sends a guy in all sneaky, right?

125
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 There's like a guy, he's like, "Oh yeah, I love the Bible. It's my favorite thing."

126
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,200
 And he's carrying a giant thing of wax because he ends up making a wax mold of the Cardiff Giant.

127
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,200
 And then bring-- I don't know how he did this. I don't know if he's like, "Hey everyone, look!"

128
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,200
 Out in that direction. There's a five-headed man and everyone turns around for 30 minutes as he's covering it in wax.

129
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
 But somehow he gets a wax mold of this, brings it back to P.T. Barnum.

130
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 P.T. Barnum makes his own Cardiff Giant and then says that the one that Hannum has is fake.

131
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,200
 So legal battle ensues over which one is the real giant from biblical times.

132
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 And someone asks, "Hey, so what do you think about people going to go see P.T. Barnum's Cardiff Giant?"

133
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,200
 They say yours is fake. David Hannum says, "There's a sucker born every minute."

134
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,200
 That's actually his quote in regards to this story. A lot of times that's misappropriated to P.T. Barnum,

135
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,200
 but David Hannum said it in this context. He had the real one and those suckers want to go see P.T. Barnum's one.

136
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
 Well, that's up to them. They're wasting money. They're not seeing the real one.

137
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,200
 December 10th, 1869, Hull actually comes forward and says, "They're both fake."

138
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,200
 I mean, unless P.T. Barnum dug something up, they're both fake. I made the one.

139
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,200
 He totally admits to the scheme. He's probably fanning himself with money while he's doing it,

140
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 writing a bunch of camels and stuff like that. I don't know why that means you're rich if you're writing more than one camel.

141
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:39,200
 And what's funny is that then both statues become curiosities.

142
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,200
 You can see them today. They're both still around. There's one in Farmington, Michigan at Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum.

143
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,200
 That's the one that was originally dug up on Stubbs property.

144
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,200
 And the replica, the one P.T. Barnum made, is at the Fort Museum in Frontier Village in Fort Dodge, Iowa.

145
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
 Now there are more curiosities of the hoax. That's what I think is so funny about this story.

146
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,200
 It doesn't seem like people were mad, right? Their wives were very happy.

147
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,200
 They spent a beautiful day out with their wives. Their wives were happy. They got to see a curiosity.

148
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,200
 Nowadays, people go see them to look at a time when this massive hoax took place.

149
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
 There's still these tourist trap type things.

150
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 I think the story is so funny because it shows, it is true, that you can make so much more money faking stuff.

151
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
 You can make money by telling truth. Let's say that you believe that UFOs are abducting people.

152
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,200
 You can make money writing books about that, spending years researching, going out to the middle of Iowa,

153
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,200
 talking to a farmer who got abducted, and then traveling to Chicago, talking to someone who got attacked by Mothman,

154
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 corresponding with people online waiting for responses from a 69-year-old guy whose internet keeps cutting in and out.

155
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
 Because aliens are abducting him while he's trying to email you back. You can do that.

156
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 Or you just make it up, right? You can just make it up and make tons of money.

157
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,200
 I don't want to throw anyone under the bus, but I get, because I cover this stuff.

158
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,200
 I read this stuff all the time. I get advertisements on YouTube for the weirdest things.

159
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,200
 First off, I get a lot of advertisements for schizophrenia medication.

160
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 So there's that. That's not a joke. Like, for the longest time, it was last summer.

161
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 All summer long, I'd be watching Omerucker play Dead by Daylight, and then the advertisement would come up

162
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,200
 and it would be like, "The vision's got darker by the day." And I'm like, "What is? I don't have schizophrenia!"

163
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
 I don't have schizophrenia. I would see schizophrenia ads all the time on YouTube.

164
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,200
 But I also see a lot of ads for, like, New Age shows. A lot of New Age stuff.

165
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 And there's one where this guy's like, "I don't know the guy. I don't need... I mean, I obviously don't know the guy.

166
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,200
 I wasn't born in Atlantis like he was, but there's this guy who has a show on some New Age network or something like that.

167
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,200
 I might be Gaia, I'm not for sure. But on this advertisement, he's like, "So I was born in Atlantis.

168
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 I was born in Atlantis and this is how society was set up and it was super peaceful.

169
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
 It was way better than you guys have it nowadays. We were the best."

170
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,200
 And I'm just like, "I'm just saying that. I'm like, "No, you weren't, bro. You weren't born in Atlantis.

171
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,200
 You were not born in Atlantis." Now, you might be able to sue me.

172
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
 You might be able to get to the Atlantean Defense League to come after me.

173
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,200
 They're all riding their seahorses and the seahorses are drying up right when they get to the courthouse.

174
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,200
 And I'm like, "Ehh." But they still sue me for $100 million.

175
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 People did not live in Atlantis and are around today.

176
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 And if they were, they wouldn't be talking about it on YouTube.

177
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 You would be in some government laboratory somewhere to try to figure out your fish brain.

178
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
 That's just, it's not...

179
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
 That's the... Come on, man.

180
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,200
 Like, I get it. Like, people will make up stories about UFO abductions and stuff like that for attention

181
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
 or for money to sell books and things like that.

182
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,200
 And that at least isn't the realm of possibility, because I do believe people do get abducted by aliens.

183
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,200
 I don't know what the mechanism is. I don't know if it's, you know, government-controlled UFOs and their disguises aliens.

184
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 I actually haven't gone into a lot of my theories about alien abduction.

185
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 I do believe it's a real event, but I don't know. I don't know. See, there's a lot of questions I don't know.

186
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:27,200
 However, I do know that the dude who has the YouTube show is not from Atlantis.

187
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
 Like, I'm okay. Let's put it, I'm pretty sure. Right? I could be wrong.

188
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
 Like, I was wrong with the forest fin thing, although I might have been right about that.

189
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
 Now there's a bunch of other weird news coming out about that.

190
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
 But here's the thing. I've thought, I've honestly thought about this from time to time.

191
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,200
 I've thought I could stop doing the show tomorrow and then just start making stuff up and do a totally different job.

192
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,200
 Because I wouldn't want to lie to you guys, right? What I would do is I would stop doing the show and be like,

193
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,200
 "Hey guys, sorry, it's been a great run. 535 episodes is great. I love you guys. Hope to see you around. Stay safe."

194
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 And then I would be totally silent, right? And then, like, maybe a year from now, one of you guys would be like scrolling through YouTube.

195
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,200
 "When you see me or you see like me, I'm dressed as the Cardiff Giant. That's my disguise."

196
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,200
 You would hear my voice doing something and you're like, "Wait, what? What? Jason, what? What's this? Why do I hear Jason?"

197
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,200
 And I'm like, "I was born on the 8th Astral Plane of Astar and I've come to give you life advice."

198
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:37,200
 You see my eyes shift from side to side. "Don't pollute. Be good to each other. Eat healthy. And other platitudes."

199
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:44,200
 If you're looking at like 52 million views, just raking in the money and going to conventions, being like,

200
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:51,200
 "Hey everyone, straight from Ash Tark Command. It's not Jason Carpenter because he's using a different name now and I'm walking on stage."

201
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:59,200
 And you're in the audience and you're like, "I know. I used to listen to his show. I used to listen to his show and there's a bunch of Atlanteans walking towards you."

202
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,200
 They're wearing their bubble helmets so they can breathe on land and they're grabbing you. You're like, "No, no. He's a fraud. He's a fraud."

203
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:13,200
 And I'll just be standing there, my arms crossed, shaking my hand. I'm like, "The non-believers out there, they want to pollute. They want to think bad thoughts.

204
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:19,200
 They don't believe in platitudes and everyone's just booing you as you're getting dragged out to an aquatic prison."

205
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 I've thought about that from time to time. Not in such detail. Not in such detail.

206
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,200
 I haven't planned out what sort of octopus type torture is going to happen to my enemies.

207
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 I have a ton of fun doing this show, but it's so funny because if I just started making stuff up,

208
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,200
 if I 100% stopped doing Dead Rabbit Radio, made up pleadious radio or something like that,

209
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 and was just lying to people about stuff that I know was fake, I'd be raking enough money. I'd be making so much money.

210
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:55,200
 It's so funny. You can make more money, I believe. You can make more money hoaxing people because it takes no work at all.

211
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,200
 It takes no work at all. The moral of The Card of Giant is you can make money telling the truth.

212
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 It's hard to make money being skeptical because no one buy this is something I heard a long time ago.

213
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,200
 No one buys a book saying UFOs don't exist, which is true. Very hard to make money being skeptical.

214
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,200
 You can make money telling the truth and that I think is the most noble way to do it, but it's harder.

215
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,200
 It's harder because you have to find the truth and sometimes the answer is, "I don't know. How many episodes do I end to go?"

216
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,200
 I don't know. I have no idea. I've spent on our conspiracy cap, but I don't really know.

217
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:36,200
 But if I just made stuff up, if I was investing $4,300 in building a giant, I could rip people off for days.

218
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,200
 And you could too, but I'm going to tell you this. If you guys do start hoaxing and making money and become millionaires from this,

219
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,200
 the only thing I ask, because I'm giving you this advice to deceive people, the only thing I ask is that you tell me.

220
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,200
 You don't have to give me none of your money, but you tell me, "Hey, this is fake. Don't cover it on your show."

221
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:04,200
 Because five years from now, I'd still like to be doing the show, but I don't want to be doing the show if all I'm doing is covering every listener's hoaxes that they've pulled off.

222
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 That's actually a great transition.

223
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 Moonman, let's go ahead and hop in that carbonar copter. We are headed out to a sleepy little house in a small town.

224
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 Now, it's a weird segue. I don't believe this story is fraudulent.

225
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,200
 So this story was sent to me from a listener called Pato, and I don't believe it's fraudulent, and I want to make that clear.

226
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,200
 That was a weird transition there, but it is a listener-generated story, which I've had a few of.

227
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 We're going out to this small little town. There's a boy named Pato. He's actually a young man.

228
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,200
 He's a long-time listener, though. He's been listening to the show for a while.

229
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 This actually happened very recently. September 22nd, he emailed me pretty much right after it happened.

230
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,200
 It's midnight, and Pato goes to sleep. Pato means duck, by the way, so feel free to imagine a duck on all these adventures.

231
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 Pato is going to sleep. Moonman's tucking him in. Lil' Feather is blowing in and out of his mouth.

232
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
 He probably should get that checked out from a doctor.

233
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,200
 And Pato has a dream. He's at a video game convention. He's at a video game showcase, and he's walking around.

234
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,200
 He's begging people for free stuff, because he says that's what he normally does at conventions anyway, so he's trying to get free swag.

235
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,200
 Eventually, the convention ends, and people start to kind of funnel out, and he sees a couch in the back.

236
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
 So he goes and he lays down -- this is all -- this part is a dream.

237
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
 So I'm just so we're clear. It's not really a duck walking around a video game convention.

238
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 Or a duck at all. It's a human being. But he lays down on a couch, face down.

239
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 And while he's laying there, he hears normal conversation video game convention staffers just kind of talking about planning the next convention.

240
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,200
 And he has his eyes closed, and he's just laying there on the couch.

241
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,200
 And then he said a warning screen appears that completely covers his vision.

242
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,200
 So like a screen that would pop up if you're watching television, a movie, a video game, a warning screen pops up.

243
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 He said there was a weird symbol in the middle of it. And on the screen it said, "Blank aren't real."

244
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,200
 And he goes, "I didn't know what the word actually said. Something aren't real."

245
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
 He's laying on this couch in the stream and he kind of chuckles to himself.

246
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 It's weird. It's a funny message. His brain understood the message, but he couldn't really process it.

247
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,200
 Then he realizes he's not laying on a couch. He's laying on a mattress in a place he knew as a child.

248
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
 And the convention staff has been replaced by his parents.

249
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,200
 And he hears them talking about just mundane things. He's laying face down on this mattress.

250
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,200
 The warning screen appears again completely covering up his vision.

251
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 And this time he can read the message, "Girls aren't real."

252
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:58,200
 But this time he doesn't laugh. For some reason, he feels terror begin to well up inside of him.

253
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,200
 Fear, horror. Girls aren't real.

254
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 He wakes up. He is fully awake at this point in his bedroom.

255
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:15,200
 And he hears the howl of a loud dog somewhere in the house.

256
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 He's sitting there in the darkness and he realizes he has three dogs, but they're tiny dogs.

257
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
 And he says, "None of my dogs could make a noise that I heard."

258
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,200
 The way his bedroom is situated is his bed is pressed against the wall.

259
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 And he's laying basically in the middle of his bed. So there's space in front of him, there's space behind him.

260
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,200
 And he's just laying there kind of frozen, trying to make sense of what that noise was.

261
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,200
 The dream is still kind of haunting him, but now he's being confronted with a real life noise.

262
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,200
 And then he hears the bed frame creak.

263
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,200
 He's heard that noise before. He hears it every time he gets into bed.

264
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,200
 With his back to the wall, he can feel the mattress begin to push down.

265
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,200
 And then feel it push down a little bit closer.

266
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,200
 And then a little bit closer. Something is moving along the mattress of his bed.

267
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 Between his body and the wall. He can feel the mattress moving.

268
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,200
 He has a cat. And he's thinking, "It's my cat." It has to be my cat.

269
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 But he can't bear to turn around to verify that.

270
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 So he's still laying there and he's thinking, "My bedroom window shut. My door shut.

271
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,200
 It can't be my cat. It has to be my cat. It can't be my cat."

272
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,200
 And he feels this thing moving up the mattress.

273
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:54,200
 At that point, whatever it is, is nestled between the wall and his back.

274
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 And he's laying there in the darkness and he feels his blanket slowly start to slide off his body.

275
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,200
 Not from the feet off the bottom of the bed, as if something was laying behind him,

276
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,200
 grabbing his blanket and slowly pulling it off of his body.

277
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 His instinct is to beat the ever-living nuggets out of this thing, right?

278
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,200
 But his mind is thinking, "It might be your cat."

279
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
 He closes his eyes, contemplating his next move.

280
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 And he begins to see video--this is how he described it.

281
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,200
 He begins to see different video game characters in his vision, flashing as if they got invincibility power-ups.

282
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,200
 He's seeing these different characters appear. They're all doing those flashing lights.

283
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
 We've all seen it for lifelong gamers.

284
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
 At that point, whatever is behind him vanishes.

285
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,200
 Like I said, I actually believe this story to be true because of this detail.

286
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,200
 He says the thing vanishes. He goes, "It didn't walk away. It didn't fly up.

287
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 It was as if it deflated. It weighed less and less and less and less than it was gone."

288
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,200
 Now, Pato didn't know this. There's no way he could have known this.

289
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:22,200
 I have a story ready to go. Think about it.Docs.com. It was from July 18, 1999, in San Antonio, Texas.

290
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,200
 A man was over at a woman's house. He feels something get into bed with him.

291
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:36,200
 He thinks it's the woman. He turns around and sees a basketball-shaped object underneath the blanket.

292
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,200
 And then he hears a noise. He said it sounded like a giggling, and he watched it deflate.

293
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,200
 He said, "Slowly the blanket just went slowly, slowly down until it touched the mattress."

294
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,200
 That was the detail that made me really-- I didn't think Pato would lie just right out the bat,

295
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
 but that detail has happened before.

296
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,200
 Is it possible that he went through all the thing about a Docs.com website and happened upon that?

297
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,200
 Sure. But when he told-- when I was reading that story, I read that.

298
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
 I had that story ready to go. That happened.

299
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,200
 So Pato, as you're listening to this, that is actually verifiable. That thing has happened before.

300
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,200
 It doesn't fly away. It doesn't blink away. It just deflates. It gets smaller and smaller.

301
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,200
 At this point, he turns on his television set to check the time. It's 2 a.m.

302
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
 So he had been asleep for a period of time.

303
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,200
 And he's sitting in his bedroom, and he's watching his television set,

304
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
 trying to make sense of everything that's going on, processing it.

305
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
 And then two things happen simultaneously. The television begins to flash a black screen at him,

306
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,200
 and he gets an overwhelming sensation to leave his room.

307
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,200
 He doesn't think about it. He just gets up off his bed and lets instinct carry him out into the hallway.

308
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,200
 He's outside of his room now, and he thinks, "Okay, I don't know what's going on. Maybe I just need to drink a water."

309
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,200
 "Maybe I should walk down this dark hallway and go into the dark kitchen to get a drink of water."

310
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
 I think that's where I heard that giant dog at.

311
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,200
 He begins walking through his house, and he sees underneath his sister's bedroom door her lights on.

312
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,200
 He goes in there and asks his sister, "Hey, I thought you were in bed."

313
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,200
 He actually went to bed around the same time I did. And he could tell something was off.

314
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,200
 She tells him, "I just woke up." And they begin to compare notes.

315
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:31,200
 She said that she had a similar dream, in that she was dreaming she was in bed somewhere else.

316
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,200
 She didn't feel the thing in her bed, but she was having a very disconcerting dream,

317
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,200
 and the key similarity was that she dreamt she was in a bed. She dreamt that she was sleeping somewhere else.

318
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,200
 And the way Patou kind of ended it there said she seemed distressed, and she was just starting to settle down by the time he was sending me the email.

319
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 So there may be some more details that either she's leaving out or he's leaving out, and that's fine.

320
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
 But it was definitely a distressing thing enough to wake her up as well.

321
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
 She didn't hear the dog either. I asked him about that.

322
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,200
 And then the next morning, he emails me again and says, "I got some more information."

323
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,200
 There was a third person in the house who at the same time had similar experiences.

324
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,200
 Now when he closed his eyes, he saw the flashing video game characters.

325
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:31,200
 When this other person in the house closed their eyes, they saw visions of their loved ones who had passed away already, standing before him in the darkness.

326
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:40,200
 And also said they had that feeling of dread, of despair that Patou felt throughout his experience.

327
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,200
 That is the end of the story as of now.

328
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,200
 But there are a lot of hallmarks there of alien activity.

329
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:57,200
 I mean, it could be a ghost, obviously, but it's interesting because, again, what kind of verifies these type of stories is I had another story ready to go

330
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,200
 about a man who ran into a monster in Brazil in Rancho Alegre in Menis Gereris, Brazil.

331
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,200
 This was September 22, 1997. There was a man named Correia.

332
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:17,200
 He saw that there was some creature out near his hen house, and he pulled his gun out and he's getting ready to blow this thing's brains out.

333
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:27,200
 And right before he pulled the trigger, he got a thought in his head, "Maybe if I fire my revolver, the thing will make it explode in my face."

334
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,200
 And that moment of hesitation allowed the creature to run off.

335
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
 The implication being that that was a defense mechanism of this creature.

336
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 "Don't shoot me, your gun's gonna blow up." We've actually had another alien encounter like that as well.

337
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,200
 I don't remember exactly what it was, but someone had a rifle.

338
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 They were getting ready to shoot some sort of cryptid or alien, and they had a vision of the rifle misfiring and blowing up in their face.

339
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,200
 And the creature gets away. It was another story just like this, and that would be Patou's version as well.

340
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,200
 He could have turned around and punched this thing, but the thing was putting in his head, "It's just a cat, man. You don't want to hurt your cat."

341
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 Whether or not it's aliens or ghosts is definitely in the realm of the paranormal.

342
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 And especially the fact that three people in the house had similar experiences around the same time make it less likely to be a dream or a waking dream.

343
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,200
 Actually, if all three of them had similar experiences and there was no contamination of the stories, it definitely couldn't be chalked up to be in a dream.

344
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,200
 It would be some sort of force that was able to invade the minds of three people in the house at the same time.

345
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:37,200
 To what means? Who knows? Will it return? What will it do when it comes back?

346
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,200
 These are all questions we don't have any answers to. We're just going to have to wait and see if Patou keeps listening to the podcast.

347
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,200
 Because if he stops, we might have an answer.

348
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,200
 The creepiest stories take place where we should be the safest.

349
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,200
 Walking through the haunted woods, driving down a dark road, kind of asking for trouble, right?

350
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,200
 Breaking into a haunted house, hanging out at a cemetery.

351
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 But when you're asleep in bed, that's when things get truly frightening.

352
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:18,200
 Because if you can't even take part in the biological necessity of sleep, if you're afraid that the next time you go to sleep this may happen again, it's just going to wear you down.

353
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,200
 And if it's happening to multiple people in the household, that's pretty serious.

354
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,200
 That's strong. It's doing it for a reason.

355
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 But again, we don't know what that reason is.

356
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,200
 So, Patou, I wish you guys the best of luck.

357
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,200
 I hope the Duck family is able to make it safe and sound to the year 2021.

358
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,200
 At least to my birthday, October 4th. Then whatever happens happens, right?

359
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 But no, I hope everything works out.

360
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:59,200
 It would be actually really interesting to see, after listening to so many episodes of this podcast, if the paranormal activity in your own life has increased.

361
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,200
 I think we generate a lot of good positive energy on this show, even when we talk about dark topics.

362
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,200
 I think people tend to come away with something, at the very least entertaining, tells a good story.

363
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
 The very most makes them look at the world a little bit differently.

364
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:24,200
 But if we're generating all this positive energy through this podcast, what if something negative doesn't like it?

365
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,200
 What if there's something out there that is looking to destroy the positive?

366
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:43,200
 So, dear listener, as you're listening to this podcast and you shut it off for the night, just remember, just be aware that the very act of listening to this podcast may put you on some sort of paranormal hit list.

367
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,200
 Right now, there may be dark forces swirling to defeat this podcast.

368
00:32:50,200 --> 00:33:00,200
 They may try to take you out one by one, because all the positive energy we generate is just too much for the hellspawn.

369
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:11,200
 And dear listener, if the hellspawn gets to me first, and I stop doing this podcast, and I disappear for months, nay years!

370
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:21,200
 And you happen to hear my voice on a podcast claiming to be from the eighth star of the Globus system?

371
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
 That's not me.

372
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,200
 Don't try to expose me as some sort of imposter. No.

373
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:38,200
 Just know that I fought to the dying breath against the forces of evil, and did not sell out to get my own show on Gaia.com.

374
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:45,200
 Don't believe that. Do not believe your own eyes. It's just a cat. It's just a cat.

375
