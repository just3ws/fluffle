1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 A mysterious beast slaughters, mutilates, and eats villagers.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,440
 And the government can't stop it.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,560
 And then we take a look at the phenomenon known as the third man.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,740
 When you're lost in the middle of nowhere and someone appears at your side seeming to

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,160
 help you, are you going crazy?

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,000
 Or have you finally seen your guardian angel today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,960
 I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,440
 I am broadcasting live, not really, but I am broadcasting with a half-shaved head.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,880
 I was giving myself a faux-hawk yesterday and my clippers I realized halfway through

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,640
 are much more dull than I had thought they had.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
 I bought them a couple years ago, I should have figured it out.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,040
 I don't have any oil for it.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,320
 So I got one side of my head looking pretty smooth, looking pretty tight.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,680
 The other side of my head, not so much.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,560
 So I got to go and buy a pair of clippers.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 And I don't care.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,920
 I mean, the point of the way I wear my hair anyways, I always look like I'm either a bushman

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,600
 or a viking.

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
 And their hair wasn't that even either.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,080
 So I'm not too worried about it.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,220
 But if you happen to see me about today and wonder why is his hair half-cut, that's why.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,240
 So we're going to go ahead and get started with our first episode.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,400
 Now our first episode is a bit of a double header because we're going to talk about what

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,720
 seems to be like one of the most badass jobs.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:38,640
 So from the year 2016 to 2018 in India, there's a man eating tiger and here are two cubs walking

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 around.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,720
 That's my tiger noise.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,000
 That's the prowl before they go "oww!"

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,320
 And they're eating people.

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,340
 13 people are killed.

34
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,380
 And the villagers are like, "Dude, this totally sucks.

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,020
 This tiger's eating all of us."

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,340
 And the reason why the cubs were also targeted because the mama tiger would kill someone

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,820
 and then let the little cubs eat it.

38
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,220
 So they have all become officially man-eating tigers, which means they have to be put down.

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,540
 They have developed a taste for that sweet, sweet human meat.

40
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,540
 Someone has to take them out.

41
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,860
 Now this is dope.

42
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,260
 This is what I thought was so dope.

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,880
 There is a hunter named Nawab Shafath Ali Khan.

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
 And he is the...

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,900
 He's like a big game hunter to the point where he's basically the James Bond of big game

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,900
 hunters.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,160
 The government calls him up and they're like, "Khan, we need your help."

48
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,520
 And he's like, "I'm already on it."

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,280
 And they're like, "How'd you know we wanted that rhino killed?"

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 He's like, "I know.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
 I read the news."

52
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,200
 He goes around and they hire him to take out wild animals.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,700
 And they sent him to kill a rogue elephant, or more than one.

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,740
 He actually killed his first rogue elephant when he was only 19.

55
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,700
 They were having this huge boar infestation in the area.

56
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,340
 And they're like, "Hey, we need you to go and call the boar in this area."

57
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,780
 He killed 250 of them.

58
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,700
 And he's like, "I'm just doing a social service."

59
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,980
 They were like, "You're kind of nuts, man.

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,380
 You're like killing all these animals."

61
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,940
 Conservation groups hate him.

62
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,300
 And when this case first came out, all these people were getting killed.

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,520
 And conservation groups were like, "No, no.

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,800
 You don't know what happens if you find the tiger and it's not the right tiger and you

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
 shoot that one."

66
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,320
 And he's kind of like, "I've been doing this job for a while.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,000
 I know what I'll be tracking."

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,040
 And they're like, "No, you must have harmony and balance with nature."

69
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,960
 Now, I don't have a problem with obviously conservation efforts.

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,000
 But if you have a tiger that's killed 13 people, and in the months before they hired him, he

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,680
 had killed three people, not him, the tiger.

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,220
 The tiger had killed three people in one month.

73
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,180
 So the government's like, they'd let it go on for two years.

74
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,820
 The government's like, "This is just going to get worse."

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,380
 And Khan was like, "The area is starting.

76
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,340
 There's not a lot of other animals for the tiger to eat where the tiger's at.

77
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,420
 So it's just going to keep eating humans until we stop it."

78
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,420
 Conservation groups try to block him from the hunt.

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,860
 The court ruled that you can go out and kill the tiger.

80
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,140
 But actually they ruled that you can capture the tiger, but if you can't capture it, you

81
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
 can kill it.

82
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
 So Khan tried to capture it.

83
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,520
 I'm sure Khan had his fingers crossed behind his back.

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,380
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, sure.

85
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
 Capture it."

86
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,380
 Again, this is just totally badass.

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,560
 So he goes to hunt it, and he shows up at the place, the village area, and he's like,

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,080
 "I don't need jeeps.

89
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,720
 I hunt on elephants."

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,280
 So he's riding elephants.

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,560
 Him and his team are riding elephants through the area.

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,920
 Now I imagine, I know India's quite populous, but I imagine this particular part of India

93
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,880
 is more like on the outskirts.

94
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,620
 So it's not like he's riding elephants through Mumbai, like shooting the tiger as it's running

95
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,620
 through the streets.

96
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,860
 I don't think it's like Black Hawk Down, where it's like this huge urban warfare.

97
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,780
 Although now that I say that, that would be quite cool.

98
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,980
 Eventually it takes him about a month.

99
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,420
 This thing had been around for two years.

100
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,100
 It takes him about a month or two.

101
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
 They do corner it.

102
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,340
 His son takes the shot.

103
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,060
 His son actually does end up killing the tiger.

104
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,260
 Family business.

105
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,260
 And so people complain that it was killed and stuff like that.

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,340
 And he's like, "Listen."

107
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,560
 He also, he's pretty good at his quotes too.

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,000
 He is basically the James Bond of hunters.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,360
 His quote was, "When people complained about him killing it, him killing animals in general,

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,660
 he goes, 'Blame the courts.

111
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
 Blame the courts.'

112
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
 This is his exact quote.

113
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,600
 'My job is of a hangman.

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,400
 I am the man who is putting the noose on the convict and pushing the button of the gallows.'"

115
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,300
 So it's not his decision to kill these things.

116
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,200
 The government is saying, "Go take care of this."

117
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,580
 And he's like, "Okay."

118
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,820
 Just like a hangman is said, "You gotta kill this guy."

119
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,820
 And the hangman's like, "Okay.

120
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,420
 It's a living right?"

121
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
 But they do kill it.

122
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,100
 And then when they asked him before he started the hunt too, this is another quote.

123
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,220
 "Before he started the hunt, they were asking him, 'So why do you want to kill this tiger?'

124
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,420
 And he goes, 'I have no desire to shoot the tiger or even capture it.'

125
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,860
 They have called me because they are incompetent.

126
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,580
 He's killed all these people over two years.

127
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,180
 Takes care of it in a month."

128
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
 So.

129
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,160
 He's just gonna go on now.

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
 It's a family business.

131
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
 His son will carry on his legacy.

132
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
 I find that interesting.

133
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,720
 That's a much longer segue than I expected to the story that I do want to address right

134
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
 now.

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,920
 And this is the story of, I talked before about cryptids who killed people and I found one,

136
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 the poplick monster.

137
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
 I may have found another one.

138
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,120
 I think it really depends on what you believe, but it definitely has racked up quite the

139
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
 body count.

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,640
 We're going to Malai.

141
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,100
 Sorry, we're going to Malai.

142
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,420
 It's the year 2002.

143
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,120
 It's August.

144
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,300
 People are just kind of wandering doing their things in their village, fetching water, making

145
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,620
 clay pots, watching friends.

146
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,620
 I don't know.

147
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,620
 It's not back in time.

148
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,980
 So I mean, they was a village, so they didn't have a huge infrastructure, but you know,

149
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,540
 it's not like they were just sitting around doing like shadow puppets and stuff.

150
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,540
 This guy goes, 'You know what?

151
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,540
 I'm gonna go out.

152
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
 I'm gonna go get some more water.'

153
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
 And everyone's like, 'Okay.'

154
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
 You know.

155
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,540
 'Bye, dad.'

156
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,640
 They should have hugged him.

157
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,960
 That jokes in bad taste.

158
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,920
 Guys walking off through the darkness to go get some water.

159
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,000
 He's glowing green eyes.

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,880
 All of a sudden we see beast vision running towards him.

161
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,080
 A point of view of the creature, like a bad horror movie.

162
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,320
 The man is beset by a creature, knocks him to the ground, attacks him, rips off his hands,

163
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,020
 and then his legs.

164
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,860
 A short time after that, man's walking around the village on the outskirts, not thinking

165
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,060
 safety in numbers, walking around the outskirts.

166
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,020
 They can, 'Hmm, I wonder what's gonna happen on friends tonight.

167
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,340
 I wonder if Ross and Rachel will ever end up together.'

168
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,500
 Creature attacks him.

169
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:55,640
 Huge claw shreds him, ripping out both of his eyes and both of his ears oddly enough.

170
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,140
 Short time after that.

171
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,040
 People are getting a little airy at this point.

172
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,540
 Short time after that.

173
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,240
 A woman is doing her laundry.

174
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,440
 I don't know specifically what these people were doing.

175
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,880
 I just know that they were attacked.

176
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,920
 So a woman's doing her laundry, she's hanging it up on her clothesline.

177
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,280
 She's thinking, 'That Chandler being.'

178
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,660
 All of a sudden, gets attacked from behind, smashed to the ground, feels powerful jaws

179
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,900
 begin to close over her head.

180
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:29,180
 Oh wait, no, for this to happen, she gets smashed from the front, lands on her back,

181
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,180
 feels powerful fangs start to claw into her head.

182
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,420
 Something eats off her nose and her mouth.

183
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,620
 These are the survivors, by the way.

184
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,600
 We've dead 20 horribly maimed by this creature.

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,600
 The four legged creature that's just attacking people on site, really.

186
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,960
 The police come into the area, the paramilitary police come into the area, a bunch of game

187
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,720
 rangers come in, they're searching for it and they can't find it.

188
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:09,000
 Finally though, they do find a large beast roaming the wilderness and they light it up.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Kill it.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,180
 So, oh, it was a hyena.

191
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,620
 It was just a rabid hyena.

192
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,140
 It's a one-off incident, freak of nature.

193
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,300
 Now the villagers are saying, 'We saw it and we knew what it looked like.

194
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,900
 It wasn't a hyena.'

195
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:32,500
 It was like a quadruped, it was like a predator type, not like alien predator, but like a

196
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,420
 four legged, like, hairy creature monster.

197
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,280
 Well, they said hyenas had really small legs and the creature that was attacking us was

198
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,640
 much bigger and the government's like, 'No, it's, we shot it.'

199
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,140
 It was a rabid hyena, it trusts us, that makes sense.

200
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,520
 That's why the hyena would be attacking people, that's why it was just like super vicious.

201
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,800
 It was crazy, it wasn't thinking.

202
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,240
 People are like, 'You know, maybe, maybe.'

203
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
 Seven months later, villagers are going about their day.

204
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,840
 Now I want to say this isn't one village either, this is a massive landscape with multiple

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,100
 villages because we'll see the number pop up here in a second.

206
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,660
 It's not just like one village of ten people.

207
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,140
 This is a pretty big land mass with these different villages in it.

208
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:25,060
 Seven months later though, the villagers are walking around just doing villager stuff and

209
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,380
 they notice a lump in the field, probably about 30, 40 feet away.

210
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,960
 They walk over to it and they're like, 'Oh, I hope, I hope that's not what I think it

211
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,080
 is, it kind of looks like a human body.'

212
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,400
 Old woman with her head crushed and intestines half eaten hanging out of her body.

213
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,320
 They're like, 'Oh no, this isn't good.'

214
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,480
 Short time after that, more attacks.

215
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,640
 People just getting horribly disfigured by this creature appearing out of the darkness.

216
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:05,220
 They find another old woman, head just completely just, 'pfft,' guts ripped out half eaten.

217
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:12,020
 And then what really started to spark the panic was they found another body, not quite

218
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:18,220
 as large as a woman's, a baby, half eaten.

219
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,580
 Four thousand people from all these different villages in the area, four thousand people

220
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,020
 just packed their stuff up and left.

221
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,840
 They marched all the way to this community center and it was like 100 kilometers away

222
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
 from the villages.

223
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
 They had like this big community center.

224
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
 Four thousand people just said, 'We're done.'

225
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,280
 Packed up the stuff that they had and they marched all the way there and they said, 'We're

226
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,600
 staying in here until that thing is killed.'

227
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,000
 Because this second round of attack, three dead, sixteen wounded, just seven months after

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,960
 the first attack.

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,880
 And the government says, 'Listen, there must be another rabbit I eat, right?'

230
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,220
 And the villagers are saying, 'No, this is the spirit of the creature that you killed

231
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,740
 coming back for more blood.'

232
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,220
 That story happened in August 2002.

233
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,500
 There was absolutely no follow up to it.

234
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,260
 Now and this story was from the BBC.

235
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,020
 This wasn't like from some fringe website.

236
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,300
 The Mollowai Terror Beast is what it's called, has popped up now on cryptid websites.

237
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,240
 These initial reports, there's tons of people quoted, there's doctors and politicians and

238
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,200
 villagers and things like that.

239
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,880
 These are very, very well sourced stories and there was no resolution to it.

240
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,320
 There's no, 'Oh, they finally killed it and there was another rabbit hyena.'

241
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 There's nothing.

242
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,240
 The story just ends with that second news report of the mass migration of people.

243
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
 The end.

244
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
 Nothing.

245
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,880
 It's very bizarre.

246
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,100
 Now, it's fair to say that back in 2002 internet record keeping isn't to the level it is now,

247
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,620
 but it's kind of creepy.

248
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,940
 What if there was something out?

249
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:03,700
 I mean, like, it's just weird to me that the story just ends, that there's absolutely

250
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
 no follow up.

251
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,860
 Did the 4,000 people eventually go back to their villages?

252
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,500
 I doubt they're still in the community center, but did they ever catch this thing?

253
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 Was it ever yes another rabbit hyena?

254
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,240
 This is what they killed the first time not the right creature, and if it wasn't, if there

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,880
 was a cryptid operating in that area and it knew it was being hunted and basically the

256
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,440
 hunters kill another creature and they think that's it, what level of intelligence would

257
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,640
 you need of a natural predator to say, 'You know what, I'm going to lay low for a while.

258
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,200
 I'm going to lay low, let them get not scared of me anymore and then I'm going to come back

259
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
 when they least expect it.'

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Weird.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 It's a weird story.

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,140
 I imagine if you had a cryptid that was smart enough to lead the hunters to go kill another

263
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,300
 animal and then come back around and start eating people again.

264
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,460
 That's incredibly unlikely.

265
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,020
 It's incredibly unlikely.

266
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,780
 But yeah, I think the story is interesting because it is a cryptid with a body count.

267
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,180
 It came back from the dead or just another hyena got rabies.

268
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,300
 And there's no resolution to it.

269
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,300
 It could still be going on or just have ended with them never catching the second creature.

270
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,800
 Those poor people could still be at the community center and they never found out that, yes,

271
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,440
 Ross and Rachel did end up together.

272
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,800
 Mollow-eyed terrorbeast.

273
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,040
 Another cryptid with a body count.

274
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,720
 I bet you there's a lot more out there.

275
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,960
 And what's funny is I bet you there's a lot more out there because the people who see

276
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,080
 them don't come back to tell the tale.

277
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,400
 And that actually leads us into our next story.

278
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,040
 This is a phenomenon I heard about a long time ago.

279
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,800
 I've always found completely interesting and you can look at it from a few different ways.

280
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,420
 You can look at it from a scientific view.

281
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,900
 You can look at it from a paranormal view.

282
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,260
 I'm going to read you this poem here.

283
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,940
 You're like, "Oh, yeah, Jason.

284
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,140
 I've always wanted Jason to read a poem on his podcast.

285
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,660
 I'm going to read you this poem."

286
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,340
 I didn't write it, but I could have because I'm not good.

287
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:03,980
 This poem is called, "Well, It's an Excerpt from the Wasteland" by T.S. Eliot.

288
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,060
 Who is the third who walks always beside you?

289
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,840
 When I count, there are only you and I together.

290
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,000
 But when I look up ahead of the white road, there is always another one walking beside

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,320
 you.

292
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,160
 Gliding wrapped in a brown mantle hooded.

293
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,880
 I do not know whether a man or a woman.

294
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,400
 So T.S. Eliot wrote that from a much longer poem, but that's the section that we're going

295
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,120
 to be talking about because there is something known as the third man phenomenon.

296
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,140
 And it's named after that poem.

297
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,340
 And that part of the poem is based on a real life event.

298
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,900
 Back in, like, 1919, right before the outbreak of the World War I, of the World War I, of

299
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:54,820
 the Great War, there was a guy named Ernest Shackleton, or I'm sorry, Sir Ernest Shackleton.

300
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,020
 And he's a really fascinating guy.

301
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,180
 I have read a lot about him to prep this episode.

302
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,980
 And I was like, "I think the story that goes into this is more fascinating, but I don't

303
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,400
 know if it really fits this show, but I'd recommend taking a look.

304
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 The show notes are there."

305
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,680
 A really, really just adventurous guy.

306
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,840
 But he came up with this plan.

307
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,520
 He wanted to take a boat to one side of the South Pole, walk across the South Pole, and

308
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,920
 then be able to get on another boat.

309
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,280
 He was an adventurer.

310
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,400
 And he was going to be considered one of the greats of the heroic age of Arctic expedition.

311
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,200
 And that's all, because I can go on and on.

312
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,680
 It's a very fascinating story, but it's a daily podcast.

313
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,240
 I only have half an hour.

314
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,420
 Anyway, so while this was going on, it didn't work out.

315
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,020
 And his ship got crushed by ice, because it froze, and then the ice froze more, and it

316
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
 crushed his boat.

317
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,460
 And they had to live on an iceberg for a couple...

318
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
 I guess I'm talking about it a little more.

319
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,340
 He had to live on an iceberg for a couple months, and then him and his team goes, "We're

320
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,260
 going to take a smaller boat.

321
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,380
 We're going to go to this island, the South Georgia Islands, and there's a wailing station

322
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,380
 there.

323
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,300
 Everyone else stay behind on this iceberg.

324
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
 Ice flow.

325
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
 We're going to take this boat.

326
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,220
 We'll go get help."

327
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,040
 And that's what the boys do, and they end up on the wrong side of South Georgia Island,

328
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,920
 and they have to hike for 36 hours over these mountains, because they know that if they don't

329
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,400
 make it to the research station, the wailing station, everyone on the ice flow is going

330
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
 to die.

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,760
 It was like another 40 people left behind.

332
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
 So they just walk.

333
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,400
 And Ernest Shackleton, when he got back, everyone survived miraculously.

334
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,440
 He said, "You know, there was three of us.

335
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
 It was me.

336
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,200
 My two other guys were marching over this 36 hours march over this mountain.

337
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,780
 He goes, 'But there was a fourth person there.'

338
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,820
 They're absolutely like, 'I always felt like there was a fourth person marching with us.'

339
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,420
 And the other people fell to two in that expedition.

340
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,140
 Climbers have talked about, they're climbing up mountains.

341
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,860
 They get really, really high up in the mountain, and there's a ton of stories about this stuff.

342
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,180
 They'll be climbing, and a climber will climb up with them and be like, 'Hey man, what's

343
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,180
 up?'

344
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,180
 And they're like, 'Oh yeah, it's really good.

345
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
 Really good climbing, isn't it?'

346
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
 'Yeah, it's great.

347
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
 What's your name?

348
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
 My name's Jimmy.

349
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,180
 Hey, my name's Jason.

350
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,180
 How you doing?'

351
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,060
 And the one guy who actually did talk about Jimmy said, 'There was another climber with

352
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
 me.'

353
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,300
 And he told me, 'Hey man, check your oxygen gauge.

354
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,760
 You might want to make the mix better.

355
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,980
 Yeah, this is how I do it.

356
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
 See?'

357
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
 He goes, 'I'm looking at him.'

358
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,500
 He goes, 'I could hear the sound of his oxygen tank.

359
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,740
 We had this long conversation.'

360
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,620
 He goes, 'We get to the top of the summit, turn around, completely gone.'

361
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,060
 There was another guy who was also climbing Mount Everest, who was climbing up and this

362
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,620
 guy was just like, 'Come on, keep going.

363
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
 No, no, no.

364
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,180
 I think maybe now it's the time for rest.

365
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,780
 Yeah, let's catch your breath for a while.

366
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
 You feeling good?

367
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
 Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling good.

368
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,580
 Okay, you want to start climbing again?'

369
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,660
 He's a very encouraging voice to the point where this climber, he had a snack in his

370
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,660
 pocket.

371
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,780
 He took it out of his pocket, broken in half, turned to give it to the other guy.

372
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,260
 There was no one there.

373
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,180
 He was alone on the mountain.

374
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,020
 And this thing is called the third man phenomenon, and it's this almost universal belief that

375
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,740
 when you're trapped by yourself or you're in extreme circumstances, you will sense

376
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,460
 somebody else there to encourage you on.

377
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,180
 There was a guy named Ron de France.

378
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,100
 I don't want to just keep reading off incidents, but I find this fascinating.

379
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,820
 There was this guy named Ron de France.

380
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
 This will be my last one.

381
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:18,140
 There's a guy named Ron de Fran Ciesco, September 11th.

382
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:24,060
 He was on the 84th floor, the plane hit, and he's like, 'Oh, the building's on fire.

383
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,380
 I better go down the stairs.'

384
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,140
 And he starts going down the stairs.

385
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,140
 Everyone else is running up because the floor is down there on fire.

386
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,020
 We have to get away from the fire.

387
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,340
 And he goes, 'I'm going to go downstairs anyway.'

388
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,740
 And they're like, 'You're going to die.

389
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,940
 You can't go down there.'

390
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,540
 And it is on fire, and he grabs a piece of drywall, and he decides to start trying to

391
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,220
 push his way through the fire, and it's too hot.

392
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,300
 And then he hears a voice on the other side of the fire being like, 'Come on, you can

393
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
 do it.

394
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
 You can do it.

395
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,780
 And I know it's really painful and scary right now, but you can do it.

396
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,500
 You have to do it.'

397
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,820
 And he pushes his way through the fire.

398
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,820
 That voice, there was no one on the other side of the fire telling him to keep going.

399
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,380
 And he survived, obviously, to tell that tale.

400
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,300
 Third-Man Phenomenon is so common.

401
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,740
 There have been multiple scientific studies done on what causes the Third-Man Phenomenon.

402
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,060
 There was a recent one.

403
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,660
 They talked to 83 hikers, 83 mountain climbers.

404
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:27,260
 So what the study basically showed was that half of them had bizarre encounters, but not

405
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,860
 to the level that it would be classified as a psychotic episode.

406
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,900
 And then I think it was like 23% of them, because I don't have my notes in front of

407
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
 me.

408
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,060
 But 23% of them had what they would be classified medically as a psychotic encounter, i.e.,

409
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,020
 a hallucination.

410
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,220
 But they also had symptoms of mountain climbing sickness.

411
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,620
 Probably like they had symptoms of brain swelling, because of the oxygen deprivation,

412
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
 things like that.

413
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,500
 But a good quarter of them, a good 25% of them, had a psychotic episode and were physically

414
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,060
 totally fine.

415
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,500
 They had no oxygen, loss, they had no brain swelling, nothing like that.

416
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,660
 So you had people who at the bottom of the mountain were completely mentally healthy.

417
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,140
 They go up the mountain, they have a psychotic episode, they come back down.

418
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,340
 And all of this stuff generally ends right after the event.

419
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,820
 It's not like this invisible friend's hanging out with you for the rest of your life.

420
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,260
 And that's what the third man factor is.

421
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,780
 There's two, I mean obviously the first explanation is, and again they've tried replicating this

422
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,740
 multiple times, there's all sorts of studies done where people have said where.

423
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,820
 And it's hard because you can't take someone and put them under stress and make them like

424
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,380
 see somebody else.

425
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,300
 But they go maybe it's disassociativeness, maybe they're so stressed out they're actually

426
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:45,460
 seeing another person mimic their movements to help them through something.

427
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,540
 It's some sort of coping mechanism.

428
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,740
 Some people think that it's related to oxygen deprivation or just a high stress event.

429
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,900
 Some people think it's the physical toll on the body because sailors, people who are stranded

430
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,420
 at sea will wake up and there'll be another person on the raft.

431
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,700
 This is quite common among survivors of horrible events.

432
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,740
 They'll see these things.

433
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,900
 Science is really trying to figure out what it is.

434
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,620
 What causes the brain to begin to hallucinate, what causes an otherwise healthy brain to

435
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,900
 begin to hallucinate or have psychotic episode.

436
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:24,940
 Now obviously the other side of it is, it is a guardian angel or some sort of spirit.

437
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,500
 There's an old legend that if you die on a mountain climb, that you, it is then your

438
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,380
 job to protect other hikers and climbers from having the same fate.

439
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,940
 Now personally, if you died doing what I'm doing, I don't want your advice.

440
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,820
 I think that's good advice to take.

441
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,060
 If I'm trying to learn how to drive a bus and a ghost of a previous bus driver shows

442
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,460
 up and he's like, "Hey, you better use your turn signal."

443
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,340
 I'm like, "We're on a freeway.

444
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,780
 I don't think I'm using my turn signal right now."

445
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,980
 I would be a little concerned if a ghost of a hiker was trying to help me.

446
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,300
 But that's the other thing a lot of people think that the third man factor is either

447
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:09,140
 an angel, a spiritual guide or, interestingly enough, I know I mispronounced that word but

448
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,640
 I'm going to keep going.

449
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,100
 It's possible that the third man effect is a scientific thing.

450
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:24,260
 It's a scientific process and that is where the stories of guardian angels come from because

451
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,380
 people back in the olden times would endure these horrible things and then they would

452
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,780
 come back and tell their people, "Yeah, in the middle of the desert when I was all trapped,

453
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,780
 this dude showed up and just helped me through the desert and helped me find water."

454
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:47,760
 It's always the weird thing too, is that their advice is always helpful.

455
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,560
 They'll say, "Hey, check your oxygen gauge."

456
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,400
 The guy will look down and be like, "Oh yeah, I probably should check my oxygen gauge.

457
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
 You're right."

458
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,480
 Keep pushing through the fire.

459
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 Keep pushing through the fire.

460
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
 You'll be okay.

461
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,760
 The guy pushes you through the fire and is okay.

462
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,280
 So if you back in olden times and even today but even more importantly in olden times when

463
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,320
 these stories were first being told about angels and messengers of God, that would be the only

464
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
 way you could explain it.

465
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,380
 You'd say, "Yeah, this ghost or this person who wasn't real helped me through this horrible

466
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,220
 tragedy and then left."

467
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,820
 I just talked about the talking tumor on Friday.

468
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,780
 It could be some...that is basically a level of the third man factor.

469
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,940
 But what was interesting was in the paper I initially read for this topic, for this episode,

470
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,540
 there's a scientific research about the mountain climbers having the psychotic episodes.

471
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,480
 And they were saying that, you know, the climbers come down and they go, "Yeah, I did hallucinate,

472
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
 but it was very helpful.

473
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
 It helped me to keep going.

474
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
 Help me to push on."

475
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,880
 The paper, the article says, "Yeah, because you had a good psychotic episode.

476
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,600
 If you had a bad psychotic episode, you wouldn't live to tell about it."

477
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
 So we talk about the third man factor.

478
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,560
 But is there an opposite one?

479
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,580
 Is there a time when a sailor is sitting on a raft in the middle of nowhere?

480
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,500
 And instead of the encouraging man sitting on the raft with him saying, "Just give it

481
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
 another day.

482
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,780
 Just give it another day."

483
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,900
 What happens when he wakes up and there's a man sitting on the raft and he goes, "You're

484
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
 never going to live.

485
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,740
 Just give up.

486
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,060
 It's all over."

487
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,660
 We would never hear his story.

488
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,960
 Or what about when the guy's climbing in the middle of Mount Everest and another climber

489
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,920
 shows up and they're talking and he goes, "I think your gauge is broken on your oxygen

490
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
 tank.

491
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,280
 I think you need to turn it up.

492
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
 I think that's..."

493
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,800
 And it starts messing with you.

494
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,360
 Or go left.

495
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 Go left here.

496
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,840
 I know a shortcut.

497
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
 We never hear those stories.

498
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,080
 It's weird because it is a phenomenon that is only positive because only the people who

499
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,180
 have the positive experiences live through it.

500
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:09,260
 But are there out of for every third man event that we have, are there hundreds more of people

501
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:16,540
 lost, of people trapped, of people cornered by flames and someone appears in front of

502
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,220
 them and says, "Come with me.

503
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,860
 Come with me.

504
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,820
 I know a way out."

505
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:33,120
 And we just find a body, a set of bones, or nothing at all.

506
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,120
 Who was their third man?

507
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:43,120
 Okay, so I didn't want to ruin the narrative because I really like this episode.

508
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,760
 I really like the way it's turning out.

509
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
 But I'm editing it.

510
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,960
 I'm editing this at the end.

511
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,240
 If you stick around and listen to it.

512
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,600
 I'm editing the episode and I start listening back to it.

513
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,660
 And I'm talking about how I don't want to get lessons from somebody who died doing what

514
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
 I did.

515
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,980
 Now, I haven't driven a car in maybe seven years at this point.

516
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,660
 Maybe longer, maybe closer to nine.

517
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:15,460
 So what I said, if a ghost told me, "Hey, you better use your turn signal right now."

518
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,700
 My response was, "Dude, we're on a freeway.

519
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,780
 I don't think I'm using my turn signal."

520
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,920
 Because I was thinking, "You don't turn on a freeway."

521
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:35,320
 I realized editing the episode, that you have to use turn signals to change lanes.

522
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:43,160
 So really, even in my example, there's most likely there was a semi-barreling down the

523
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,020
 road and the ghost of a bus driver showed up and said, "Dude, you haven't driven in

524
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
 nine years."

525
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,520
 "You should damn turn signal."

526
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,800
 And I'm like, "Nah, man.

527
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
 We're on a freeway.

528
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,760
 You don't use turn signals on a freeway."

529
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:07,600
 And then I just doom myself and all my passengers to a lifetime of also warning future travelers.

530
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,720
 Although I'm sure the ghost would be like, "Dude, you do not get to warn anybody about

531
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,360
 anything ever."

532
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
 So I figured I would just...

533
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,440
 I'm sure, honestly, I think probably most listeners listen to the show when they're

534
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,940
 at work or during their homework and that small passage probably didn't jump out to

535
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
 them.

536
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,460
 But I was like, "Oh my God."

537
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,460
 That's why.

538
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,100
 My exit music queued up here because I didn't mute it.

539
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,940
 But we'll just go ahead and end it out here.

540
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,620

 Here we go.

544
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
 We'll just let it fade out.

545
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,200
 I'll do a little mix fade out.

546
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
 Thanks for listening, guys.

547
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,320
 I just had to add that in there.

548
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
 Bye.

549
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
 Bye.

550
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,320
 Bye.

551
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 Bye.
