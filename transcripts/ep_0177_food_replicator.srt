1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Three girls walking on a country road, discover a creature, and possibly a government cover-up.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,800
 And then we look at Paul Adams' greatest invention. You thought the Yon Machine was a

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,720
 magnificent piece of technology/therapy. Today we look at the food replicator. And

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,200
 you can build it yourself, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:35,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,120
 I'm having a great day. I hope you are having a great day too. We've got some cool stuff to cover,

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,240
 some cool stories, but first I wanted to talk about this briefly. We have a Discord setup. A lot of

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,400
 people have been requesting to get a Discord setup. A lot of people have been requesting to get a

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,880
 Discord setup, and it is set up now. It was set up by Barfee Man 362 on YouTube, so I appreciate that.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,000
 I'm going to stop in every once in a while. I can't promise I'll be there every day just because

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
 I'm always doing research and working my jobs and doing the show, but I will be stopping by. But it's

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,760
 also a good place for the fans to hang out. I know something that a lot of podcast listeners have

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
 said is said, you know, I listen to the podcast, but I have to go to YouTube to really be part of

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,280
 the community. So hopefully this will mitigate that. It'd be a cool place to kind of hang out,

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
 be civil towards each other. I think everyone kind of gets along with this group. And so again,

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,440
 thank you Barfee Man 362. And then I have a buddy, he's Earbud on Twitter. He surprised me today

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,800
 with a built, he built a desktop computer for me. He saw the laptop I was using because he knows me

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
 in real life. He goes, you use that laptop for everything. And I was like, yeah, this is like,

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,080
 this is my podcast laptop. This is my work laptop. This is laptop I watch, you know, the office on.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,840
 This is kind of what I have. So he built me this super dope desktop computer. It's easily the fastest

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,760
 computer I've ever owned. And that's what I'm recording the podcast on right now. And it actually

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,040
 sounds a bit smoother. I'm still trying to fiddle with the audio, the mic volume and stuff like

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,280
 that. But to me, it already sounds a lot smoother just because it's a better sound card. Still got

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,120
 my laptop to watch the office on and to do all my research on. But thank you, Earbud. I honestly,

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,640
 I don't feel like I deserve it. It's this amazing gift that he just dropped off today. And but I

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 and I told him, I said, really, this will help take the podcast to the next level. My plan now

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,520
 is to do and it's in the future. It's not coming up anytime soon. But I want to do a video for

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,080
 Friday's episode. And for the podcast listeners, I know that it sucks when you listen to a podcast

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,560
 and they're like, Oh, look at this cool thing we're watching in a podcast listener can't see it.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,240
 I hate that. I absolutely hate that. So the Friday episode won't be any different to the podcast

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,880
 listener at all. I'm not going to be like, Hey, now let's watch this five minute YouTube video

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,760
 while I'm totally quiet. But to the YouTube users, you'll be able to see video. It will also allow

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,280
 me to do I've talked about doing Twitch. I want to play some scary games, find some spooky games,

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,680
 maybe even do like like terror readings and Ouija stuff. So I told I mean, this this computer

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,720
 is exactly I think what the show needed just the technology bump up is so high. So thank you,

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,880
 your but again, I don't feel like I deserve it. But obviously, you feel that I do and that is very

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,120
 humbling to me. Yeah, it's just amazing. So I think we're going to see a lot of really cool

38
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,560
 technological leaps coming for the podcast. I think it would be cool to play like some spooky

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,760
 games and talk to you guys on a Friday night. Because that's really my time where I'm not doing

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,400
 any podcast stuff and I'm not working Friday nights is kind of like from seven to three in

41
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,320
 the morning. It's totally mine. Everything else belongs to something. So let's go ahead and get

42
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:54,320
 started with the first story. Oh, fuck. Oh, carbonated water just exploded all over me. And

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,120
 it's freezing cold. I wonder why I did that. Oh, because it's a block of ice underneath. That's

44
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,120
 why it's pressure build up. I think it's going to explode. I got a hair hold on the year 1996.

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,720
 The country Brazil, we've actually it's funny. We've been to Brazil a lot on this show more

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,240
 than I would have thought. It's really, really interesting because it's something that's not

47
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,080
 normally covered in UFO or Bigfoot or Cryptid or anything allure. Tons of stuff happening down there.

48
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
 So we're in Brazil once again. And I have no problem with it. I think it's probably a lovely

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,480
 country. I've never been there. Too many aliens. So this story is actually a request from Gabriel

50
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,600
 on YouTube. He was the one who recommended the story for me. It's quite funny, quite weird,

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,160
 and it has a lot of odd twists and turns. The year is 1996. The countries Brazil were specifically

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,440
 in a region called or a city called Varghina. Varghina? Varghina. We'll call it Varghina.

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,640
 I already I lose Brazil listeners every time I do a Brazil episode. But anyways,

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,320
 we're in the country of Brazil, Varghina. Three young girls walking down the road. It's dusk.

55
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:14,720
 Still a little light out, but it's on that teetering between darkness and day. You guys know what dusk

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,280
 is. I'm setting the mood. These three young girls are walking on the road. They see something in

57
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,920
 front of them that concerns them, not someone. They think that what is walking in front of them

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,440
 is the devil. They later described this creature as kind of having a wobbling

59
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,560
 gate moving unsteadily in front of them alongside the dusty road. It's five feet tall, large head,

60
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,200
 very, very thin body, little limbs, little spindly limbs wobbling back and forth.

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:56,400
 Had V shaped feet, like a duck's foot. Just kind of an odd detail. Brown skin, large red eyes.

62
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,880
 Girls ran away, went and told their mother, "We saw the devil. We saw the devil."

63
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,080
 Mom's like, "It's so funny because the mom's like, 'No, you didn't.' The mom's like, 'You girls are

64
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,480
 stupid.'" These girls who were eight ranged in age between 14 and 22. Two of them were sisters,

65
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,800
 so they went back to their mom's house. They told their mom this story, and the mom's like,

66
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,880
 "No, you didn't. That's super dumb. You guys are idiots." But anyways, the daughters convinced her

67
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,240
 to just go out and check the scene. "My mom, my mom, go check the scene." So the mother goes out there,

68
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,440
 and which is kind of ballsy actually. If I had three daughters and they ran home and they said,

69
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,160
 there's a lot of hypotheticals in this one, but if I had three daughters and they ran home and

70
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
 told me they saw the devil, I don't think my first inclination would be to go out and be like,

71
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,880
 'Prove it!' and then to go out into the twilight to find this creature. But anyways, she did.

72
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,680
 The mom goes there and she noticed two things. Three things. She noticed a strong smell of ammonia.

73
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,840
 She noticed some footprints, which apparently matched the V shaped feet. And there was a dog

74
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,520
 in the area. I don't know why the dog is a detail that she noticed, unless she's like,

75
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,840
 "Harry the Spy," and she's just like, picking up clues randomly. But the strong ammonia smell

76
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,840
 and the V shaped feet do make sense. What happened was that then this panic started in the town.

77
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,600
 The story spread very quickly that there was an alien or the devil in town. And I think most

78
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,040
 townspeople were like, I think most people in town were like, "Five feet, tiny little arms,

79
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,560
 weird, you know, like giant head." It was probably an alien. It probably wasn't the devil.

80
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,320
 So you started getting this rash of UFO sightings in the area. Other people were like,

81
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,160
 "I saw a UFO in this area. I saw this strange light." One farmer said,

82
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,000
 "A UFO flew over his property and hovered there over his cattle." I think this story is completely

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,680
 made up by the way. Not the whole story, but this particular part. This farmer says, "I came out,

84
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
 my cows were acting all weird. They weren't as talkative as they normally are. They were kind

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
 of like looking down at the ground. They weren't engaging with me." I noticed there was a UFO

86
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,200
 floating above them that it floated there for 40 minutes. No photos, really dude. You didn't even

87
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,440
 bring a sketch artist out to draw a picture. 40 minutes is a long time for you to not be able

88
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,520
 to go get your camera. But anyways, that story is completely ridiculous. But there were other

89
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:29,280
 UFO sightings in the area. Culminating in a big story where apparently an alien collapsed on the

90
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,360
 side of the road. And it was at night time. This alien is just collapsed on the road, sick or

91
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,760
 something. And that's what the original people, the original girls after they got over the devil

92
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,000
 story said. It looked like it was sick. What we saw the way it walked, it looked like it wasn't

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,160
 healthy. But anyways, there's this other alien sick on the side of the road. Maybe the same one.

94
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,720
 We'll find out. Three military trucks pulled up, put the body in the back, took it to a local clinic.

95
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,560
 So it didn't take it to like a Area 51 S hospital underground. They took them to a like 24 hour

96
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,760
 med clinic and dropped it off where it was treated. And you think that's ridiculous, but multiple

97
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,880
 people saw more than one alien in the clinic that night. They're like, "I know that story's stupid

98
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,800
 that the military would just drop an alien off at a 24 hour express med, but I saw an alien there.

99
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,560
 I absolutely saw an alien there." So the story spread like wildfire through the town. So the

100
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,080
 Brazilian military investigated this. Brazilian military is like, "We should look into this.

101
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,920
 Let's see what happened here." Here's the thing. This is it. They're findings for what happened

102
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,760
 over that period of time in 1996 is either absolutely true or the worst cover-up I've ever

103
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,520
 heard. Because you're not like men in black when they like scan you with that little beam in your

104
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,640
 eyeball and I know that's not real life, but you know they'd scan you with that little eyeball

105
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,880
 thing and then they'd give you a fake story. People say UFOs are swamp gas or the plan of venus

106
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,800
 or stuff like that. All of that stuff is for... This sounds like the worst cover-up ever, but it's

107
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,000
 most likely what really happened. So the military investigated and first off they said, "Listen guys,

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,640
 those three military trucks that were driving on the road that night, that it was a schedule drive,

109
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
 those trucks go through that area all the time around the same time. Like that is a normal,

110
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680
 we didn't pick up anything on the side of the road." The people go, "Well okay, well what about

111
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:32,640
 the... what about the alien that the girl saw walking down the road?" So this is what the

112
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,640
 Brazilian military had to say about the original sighting. This is from an article here. "In regards

113
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,560
 to the wasteland creature, an official inquiry led by the Brazilian military authorities concluded

114
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,480
 in 2010..." So this is 14 years after the event, they really did look into this. "Concluded in 2010

115
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,280
 that the Silva sisters had actually come across..." So this is what the military concluded was walking

116
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,080
 by these girls. "...had actually come across a homeless, mentally unstable man nicknamed

117
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,680
 Mudhino, covered in mud. Can you imagine the military investigator who's been working for

118
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,040
 the government for 15 years? He thinks he's investigating a possible alien sighting and

119
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,560
 when he starts interviewing people around town he consistently sees a muddy homeless person

120
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,440
 walking around unsteadily with red bloodshot eyes because he has a drinking problem and he's

121
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,040
 probably quite skinny because he's homeless and mentally unstable and I can imagine the

122
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,840
 investigator every time he's interviewing somebody and he's like, "So you swear that you saw the

123
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,480
 Shiofo over your cows and they're like, "Yes, yes, he sees Mudhino walking in the background

124
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,280
 all unsteadying." The investigator's like, "God, man..." And then some people go, "Okay, yeah, we know

125
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,200
 Mudhino, we know him. He does have an abnormally large head, skinny little body, brown skin,

126
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,840
 which is just a mud covering him. But how do you explain the aliens that we all saw in the clinic?

127
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,400
 How do you explain that?" And at that point the military goes, "We have an answer for that as

128
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,360
 well. We came to that conclusion in 2010 as well." Apparently they traced it back. Now again, this is

129
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:21,120
 either a terrible cover-up or the absolute truth. But the military says we traced back the sightings

130
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,000
 to the clinic. We went to the clinic, we talked to them, we went over records. Apparently two...

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,560
 This is the military said, two dwarves, two little people were in there who were expecting to give

132
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,120
 birth. Not both of them at the same time, but it was either like a routine checkup or it was a

133
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,640
 like a... what are those things where they check out the baby? Prenatal visit, something like that.

134
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,920
 So you basically people who were hearing all this UFO flap and then they walk into a clinic

135
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,960
 and they saw just two short people, one with a big old belly, and that was the big alien sighting.

136
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,680
 Now it's one of those things like because of mass delusion, I could see people jump into that

137
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,200
 conclusion when they see something out of the ordinary. They see these little people and they're

138
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:17,040
 like "Ah aliens!" So yeah, that's the story of the alien of the town that I can barely pronounce.

139
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,760
 I have to say this though, how mentally unstable and muddy do you have to be to be confused with

140
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,400
 an interdimensional creature? I kind of want to do a story on this guy. If anyone has any

141
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,720
 information on Mudino, I'd love to hear it because that just sounds absolutely bizarre. Why is he

142
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,200
 covered in mud? Is it a decision he made or did he just fall into a mud puddle and never took a

143
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,680
 bath? Like what is the origin story of this guy? And what is up with his feet? I gotta look into this

144
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,800
 guy. I swear there are, I think a cool place to look, this might sound kind of cruel and savage,

145
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,240
 but I'm sure if you wanted to find some cryptids, hang out with the homeless. Not saying that they're

146
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,680
 cryptids, but if I was like a skinwalker, if I was some sort of like half-human hybrid,

147
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,120
 that's where I'd hang out. They got bigger problems to worry about the fact that your eyes

148
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,280
 roll back into your head when you sleep or that you have like eight tongues or you're eating the

149
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,000
 flesh of you know the living. They got bigger problems to worry about. If I was a cryptid,

150
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,520
 I would hang out with the homeless. I actually should look into that. Are cryptids feeding on

151
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,240
 the homeless or just blending in with them? Interesting. Okay, but before we get into that

152
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,640
 story I just came up with. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. So this was the original

153
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,840
 request I got from Ramsay via email. He said, "Jason, you gotta look into this guy. He's an

154
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,600
 inventor and you gotta look at this invention." I started looking around the site and the first

155
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,760
 thing that popped up that I saw was the Yon Machine. I was like, "I want to cover him,

156
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,400
 but I'm going to break it up into two because the Yon Machine, that was the last episode of Season 3.

157
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,880
 I love that episode." And the one that Ramsay specifically wanted me to cover was the food

158
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,360
 replicator. So I've always kept it on the docket and now it's time. It is time to tell you about

159
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,680
 an invention that will change your life. It changed his. It definitely changed his.

160
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,840
 So a brief overview of Paul Allen. He's a man. He's probably like in his late 60s. Actually,

161
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,720
 actually he may not be around anymore from the look of his blog, but at this time he looked to

162
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,440
 being about his late 60s maybe. It's really hard to pin down his age. Just a couple photos of him.

163
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,280
 He invented the Yon Machine. You are the Yon Machine. By yawning you can relieve your stress.

164
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,680
 I recommend listening to that episode. He also invented something and I curse, I curse God and

165
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,120
 I curse the world that I live in that this link is not working. I'm looking at his website of

166
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,320
 all of his inventions and one of them is called Paul's Squirrel Academy. And then you just click

167
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,600
 on it and it goes to a 404 page somewhere and I was like, no, like how why was I born onto a

168
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,440
 planet where I don't have access to what Paul's Squirrel Academy is? I can only imagine the insanity

169
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,920
 that used to be behind that link, but it is no more. We will not, that phrase belongs on the

170
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,480
 conspiracy iceberg. If anything that I've covered belongs on there, that does. Paul's Squirrel Academy.

171
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,200
 What does it mean? Is it a literal academy or are there squirrels walking around with little

172
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,280
 top hats or little, what are those little graduation caps? Is it a metaphorical academy?

173
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,640
 Like how we each have a squirrel inside of us and the academy helps us. I don't know that phrase.

174
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:41,600
 If anyone ever edits another conspiracy iceberg image, please put Paul's Squirrel Academy on

175
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,880
 there because that is just, that is a lost conspiracy. But unfortunately I exist in the

176
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,200
 timeline where Paul's Squirrel Academy doesn't exist, but we are left with the food replicator.

177
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,680
 Now the food replicator is exactly what it sounds like. Paul Adams, is Paul Adams or Paul, it's

178
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,120
 Paul Adams. I think I called him Paul Allen earlier, but it's Paul Adams. He has invented a food

179
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,320
 replicator and it will cost you maybe eight bucks to build and just 20 years off your life,

180
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:19,520
 just letting you know. Very, very simple. Here it is. Two, two tin cans. So any invention that

181
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,240
 starts off with two tin cans, you know is going to be gold. You know that is an amazing invention.

182
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,080
 That's a shark, that's above shark tank. That's like DARPA level technology. Two tin cans. They

183
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,760
 have to, you should write this down. You guys are going to want to do this. They have to be food-based

184
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,120
 cans. So they have to be cans that previously held food and they have to be the same. So you

185
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,360
 can't get a can of Denison's Chili and then a can of raviolis. You have to get two cans of Denison's

186
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,720
 Chili and then give the chili to me. Y'all eat it. You then empty out the cans, you wash them down,

187
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,480
 take off the wrapper and there you go. You have the first part of your science fiction device

188
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,000
 known as the Food Replicator. This is real, by the way. This is, I should say that he's been

189
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,280
 doing this for years, eating this, eating this food. Well, again, he might be dead now, but we'll

190
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,400
 get to that. Two matching tin cans. Clean. Some circular magnets. You'll need those as well.

191
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,640
 One lead with two alligator clips. So you'll need a little wire and then two little alligator clips.

192
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,880
 And two identical plastic or glass bottles. That's all you'll need to really start making this food.

193
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,520
 You're going to take the two tin cans, you clean them out. You're going to take the magnet. He

194
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,960
 spends a long time describing how magnets work and I'm thinking, who is this for? Fourth graders?

195
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,920
 Like, who doesn't know how magnets work? The reverse polarity of magnets, he goes on and on.

196
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,400
 Anyways, no duh, dude. You take the magnets and you completely cover the bottom of one can

197
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,320
 with the magnets. So you take the can and you make sure that they're all facing the same way.

198
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,480
 Which obviously, but anyways, so you take a bottom of the can, you put the little circular

199
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,000
 magnets down, you cover as much of the surface area on one can with the magnets, and do the same

200
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,160
 thing to the other can. Then you use the alligator clips and you connect them via the wire, and now

201
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,000
 you're done with the Food Replicator. That's the actual device itself. Then you are going to take

202
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,120
 your bottles and you're going to fill them up full of water. But Paul is very, very specific.

203
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,000
 It can only be tap water. No other water will work for whatever reason. You can't use any other water

204
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,040
 but tap water. Fill it full of tap water. Fill both bottles full of tap water. So now you have two

205
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,800
 bottles, your source bottle and your replica bottle. In your source bottle, put food in it.

206
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,520
 I'm almost done. I'm sure this is probably boring, but in your source bottle, you put food in the

207
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,280
 water and you swish it around and put it under one tin can. And in the replica bottle, you don't do

208
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,000
 anything to it. You put it under the other tin can. So you have to be fairly small bottles of water.

209
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,640
 Wait 10 minutes and then drink out of the replica bottle. You have just drank the food

210
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,920
 from the first bottle, from the source bottle. And you're thinking, "Okay Jason, this guy is

211
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,480
 this wacky invention. Ha ha. You told us some stupid instructions and that's the end of the

212
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,360
 episode, right? That's kind of boring." No, because I wouldn't waste your time with that. It is funny

213
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,920
 to look at this recipe for this device, but what it gets insane because so he makes this device

214
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:40,800
 back in 2004. And he has blog posts going for years. Now we start, this is where we start to see

215
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,880
 the insanity sink in. This is where we start to see that this guy invented this machine. I'm not

216
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,960
 necessarily calling him insane, but just the bizarre thoughts that got wrapped around this.

217
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,920
 In 2004, when he invented the machine, he was having some blood pressure problems. He was having

218
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:02,480
 some health issues. And he decided to invent this machine to help those health issues. He was a little

219
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,880
 overweight and his blood pressure was high. And I think it started initially that he was trying to

220
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:14,000
 lose weight, but you gotta eat something. His blog then goes, there's two levels of the blog.

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,560
 There's the interactions with himself and interactions with other people and the food

222
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,600
 replicator. The interactions with himself, every blog post, he lists his blood pressure. And you

223
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,120
 can actually watch it go up and down over the course of months. And his weight, he loses 20

224
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,720
 pounds incredibly rapidly. And he wasn't a super big guy to begin with. He was like 195 in the

225
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:42,000
 beginning. And then he's down to 170. So he drops 20 pounds fairly quickly, which is fine. It's good

226
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,800
 to lose weight, but you need to eat stuff. He is getting most of his meals from the food replicator.

227
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,720
 And when I say put, when I first read this, I was like, Oh, put food in a bottle of water.

228
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,640
 I was thinking, you know, put like a piece of meat in there. And then it gets transmitted

229
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,400
 to other water. He put, he's putting breath expiritos in his food replicator. He's constantly

230
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,160
 talking about taking omelets and making an omelet and only eating a part of it and sticking the

231
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,520
 rest into a bottle of water and then drinking the replicated omelet. He's like, Oh, I feel so good.

232
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,400
 I've eaten this omelet. And then the next blog post is blood pressures up. Like it's just insane.

233
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,760
 It's totally nuts. And he's doing that. And then as the year like the months go on, he starts being

234
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,800
 like, I woke up this morning and I'm not hungry, but I'm like kind of hungry. And I made toast with

235
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,880
 butter and I ate it. It was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten because he's starving himself.

236
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:52,640
 And then there's this weird, weird pattern emerges where he starts talking about how much he loves

237
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,360
 Panda Express. And he starts going to Panda Express and eating chow mein. And then he gets sick

238
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,000
 because he's eating a bunch of carbs and he's been starving himself through the food replicator.

239
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,200
 And he can't figure out what the problem is. So he drinks an omelet the next morning. It's

240
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,040
 absolutely bizarre. And the whole time he's watching his blood pressure go up. So here is,

241
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,280
 oh, again, this is, this is, this is, I want to read off a couple of his sample blog posts here.

242
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,520
 This is February 10th, 2004. So this is very, very recent from him building the food replicator.

243
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:34,800
 I had the urge to exercise today. That's good. Exercise is good. I always think exercise is good

244
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:45,120
 thing. So I've been bouncing. So I've been bouncing on the mini trampoline, what? For a total of a

245
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:56,080
 couple of hours. So now I imagine this guy just, and is on a mini trampoline for hours,

246
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,480
 for hours. I have so much energy since I drank that burrito. This is so good.

247
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,000
 This is, this is actually the same day, February 10th. All I had eaten of real food today by about

248
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,800
 4pm was half a cup of orange juice, apart from drinking water as usual. I'd had a few squirts

249
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:25,120
 of yesterday's burrito and so on. So I didn't feel particularly hungry. But the idea of some toast

250
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,720
 and cheese was appealing. So again, like he's constantly like talking about eating other food.

251
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:41,040
 It's not working. But he swears by it. And also the phrase, "A few squirts of yesterday's burrito"

252
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,600
 is not appetizing in the least. That's what I say after I've gone to Taco Bell and I'm headed to the

253
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,480
 bathroom. Ah, I gotta drop off a couple squirts of yesterday's burrito. That's disgusting. So anyways,

254
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,120
 but he loves squirting, eating squirted burrito. So, and he then decides to share his miracle

255
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,680
 invention with the world. He puts the invention online, but he's like, "No, it's not gonna

256
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,880
 end." He starts trying to get his friends to take squirts of water into their mouth. So he has one

257
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,640
 buddy who's pretty game to it, and Paul starts giving him squirts of coffee. So it's just regular

258
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,120
 water that's been infused with coffee. And his buddy's like, "Oh yeah, fine. Probably don't,

259
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,800
 don't shoot me. Don't kill me at work, please. Don't, please, Paul. I'm on your side." And then

260
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,520
 there's this, there women pop up every once in a while in his blog post. There's this woman,

261
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,960
 a friend of his he's hanging out with, and he's like, "Here, take some of this water." Which, I mean,

262
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,640
 ma'am, you have terrible common sense. If a man goes here, take a squirt of this enhanced water,

263
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,000
 and you do it. She takes the squirt and he's like, "I wonder what she'll, I wonder if she'll taste

264
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:57,520
 the omelet in the, in the water." And anyway, she comes home from work and he's like, "Did you notice

265
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,000
 anything from the water?" And she's like, "Well, not really, but I did crave an omelet later." And

266
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,080
 he's like, "Success! Maybe I put the idea of cheese in her head." This is totally wrong, by the way.

267
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,080
 And then he finally tells her what his invention was. He goes, "You know that water I gave you

268
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,440
 was actually replicated omelet in a bottle of water." And he goes through the process, because

269
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,400
 he didn't tell her at first. He just said here, "Have some enhanced the water." So he tells her

270
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,360
 what it was. And then later on that night, he goes, "Would you like some more?" And she's like,

271
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,320
 "No, I don't. I don't." And even he's like, "I think I creeped her out. I think I scared her from my

272
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,320
 invention." But, so he's now trying to share it with other people. But then we talk, now he's a

273
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,880
 true scientist because he starts experimenting on himself. He has this weird post on February 15th.

274
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:57,200
 Where he talks about his pornography and masturbation addiction. And he's going on about how

275
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,240
 it's, okay, so this is the year 2004. He's like, "I have this huge collection of pornography and

276
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,440
 I masturbate all the time and I don't know what to do." And then he goes, "Sometimes I just want to

277
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,480
 delete my collection, but then I think, no, I can't." And he goes, "I have all these pictures and I'm

278
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,200
 thinking pictures. Pictures? How old is your computer? I get like 2004 wasn't the highest level

279
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,880
 of internet, but who has pornographic photos? Like, did people still have those back then?

280
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,720
 Am I, am I that like removed? Like, it was video, we had videos then, right? When was the last time

281
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,920
 someone looked at a pornographic photo on there, just a photo on their computer? So anyways, he has

282
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:45,200
 this huge collection of pornographic photos. What are you, photos? Anyways, I came. He has this huge

283
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,760
 collection of pornographic photos on his computer and he's chronic masturbator. So as a scientist

284
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,920
 would do, he thinks, "I bet you the food replicator can solve this." And he talks about a phrase he

285
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,480
 once heard, says, "If you're having a problem with something, you don't have enough of it yet."

286
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,680
 He doesn't source who said this quote. And it sounds like a terrible, terrible quote,

287
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,440
 because basically if someone has a heroin problem, you could say, "Well, technically,

288
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,240
 you don't have a heroin problem. You have a problem with not having enough heroin." And be like,

289
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,640
 "Oh, yeah, you're right. That is my problem." He repeats this phrase multiple times throughout

290
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,720
 his website. If you're having a problem with something, you don't have enough of it yet,

291
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,480
 which is quite bizarre. I could see that applying to like money and love, but anything else,

292
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,120
 masturbation. So he's thinking, "Maybe it has something to do with my semen. Like, I'm releasing

293
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,400
 all of this. This is so gross because now this guy is in his late 60s, early 70s, and he's basically

294
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:53,120
 just jacking off all the time. His mini trampoline is super slippery." And he goes, "I am jacking off

295
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:02,480
 all the time, but maybe I need more semen because I have a problem releasing semen." So he jacks

296
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:13,840
 off into a bottle of water and puts it in the food replicator and drinks the replicated semen water.

297
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:30,080
 Now, I mean, come on, dude. Come on. Like, if the invention doesn't work, it's just very,

298
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,640
 very unclean. It's unsanitary. You're jacking off in a bottle. But if the invention does work,

299
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,000
 you're drinking magical jizz. Anyway, so he begins drinking his own replicated semen

300
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,120
 for pretty much the rest of the blog. Like, I was looking through blog ratings and it'd be like,

301
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,840
 "Today I drink some semen." So his photo is on this blog. It's his real name, his address is on

302
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,040
 there. I can't imagine any business associate ever stumbling across this thing and being like,

303
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,600
 "Hey, Paul, can I see you in my office today?" You're not. You're not. The water during the

304
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,320
 work is when he's semen in it, right? He's like, "What? No, no." Fingers crossed behind his back.

305
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,640
 Salt water. But anyways, so the madness continues. So he starts doing in February. He has pretty

306
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,200
 consistent updates on his blog. But on June 28th, everything kind of takes a turn. There's only

307
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,200
 like a blog post every month or every few months after that. And the blog posts are saying, "All

308
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,120
 the blog posts say is, 'I'm still alive. I'm not dead yet. I'm still alive.'" He's just like letting

309
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,960
 us know that he's not dead yet because he started to have, he thought he had a heart attack.

310
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,720
 Like, short, like a couple months after building the food replicator because he wasn't eating enough

311
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,200
 food. And he was taking vitamins via the replicated water. So he would buy vitamins and he'd take

312
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,000
 some of them. But most of them, he would drop in water and drink the replicated vitamins.

313
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,160
 He started putting like silver in the source bottle and then spraying the replicated silver all over

314
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:08,080
 his body to get rid of germs, like crazy, crazy stuff. And the last update to the website was

315
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:17,680
 2015. Now, in 2015, he had gone back up to his weight of 190, 195. So he did start putting weight on

316
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,560
 again, but he hasn't posted anything that I've seen since 2015. So it is possible that he has passed

317
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:31,600
 away at this point. Or he's built his new replicator he was talking about. On March 17th, he talks about

318
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,120
 his friend saying, "You know what? I'd really like to replicate a haughty, 20-year-old haughty."

319
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:45,920
 Paul's like, "Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Hmm. Let me think about that." Here's a quote in his own words,

320
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,960
 "Which gives an interesting idea." The guy was joking, by the way. The guy who said he'd like to

321
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,720
 replicate a 20-year-old haughty was joking. He didn't realize he was joking to a supervillain.

322
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,720
 He didn't realize he was joking to a supervillain on a shoestring budget.

323
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:10,320
 "Which gives an interesting idea. What if you got two 55-gallon steel barrels, added the magnets

324
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,320
 and a wire between in the usual manner and put a person in the input barrel?" What? So some guy's

325
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,040
 cracking a joke and Paul's like, "That actually might work. We might be able to replicate a human

326
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,720
 being." Or turn him in a water. See, that's what I know. You're just going to turn him in water.

327
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,920
 So then he goes on, "There would need to be the usual electrical connection between the

328
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:40,800
 cans and the person should be barefoot and touching the bottom and should probably also touch the

329
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:48,640
 side of the barrel with his hands." What? So now you want to replicate a dude? Like, the other guy

330
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:56,480
 was talking about like a chick, but you're replicating a guy now? That's a weird turn, Paul. Bizarre.

331
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,560
 Okay, but anyway, that kind of threw me off. "What would be the result?" he asks. "What would be the

332
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:12,800
 result of taking squirts of a replicated person?" And then he says, "I have no idea." Luckily, he does

333
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:21,520
 say that basically you put a person in a 55-gallon drum and then you take a giant water bottle,

334
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,600
 like an Alhambra water bottle, and you would suck some of them out and turn them in water,

335
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,560
 and then you could drink the person, drink the person's essence, and he starts to say,

336
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,200
 "Maybe I could use this like if someone's fighting with me or someone's angry with me or I don't like

337
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,640
 them. I could take their essence and drink them because," he repeats the phrase, "if you have a

338
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,000
 problem with something you don't have enough of it." He's thinking, "Maybe if I have a problem with

339
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,040
 someone because I don't have enough of them, but if I drink them they're inside me, so I have all

340
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,080
 that I need." That's his rationale. Now, he goes, "Obviously I'm not going to be able to get this

341
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,880
 person into a 55-gallon barrel, especially if it's somebody who doesn't like him. If it's somebody

342
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,480
 who doesn't like Paul, he's not going to be tricked to come in over to his murder dungeon

343
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,480
 to hide underneath a barrel." But he does have a helpful tip for that. What you can do is you can

344
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:24,400
 get a non-digital photograph, a lock of their hair, or some of their blood. He will drink

345
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,720
 the blood of people who he's having trouble with. He will put some of their blood into a container,

346
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:38,240
 replicate it, and then drink the water. This guy is, I mean, come on Paul, come on. You're already

347
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,800
 drinking your own C-A-A. I wonder why he didn't say I'll just drink their semen too, but anyways.

348
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,000
 And then, depending on your point of view, this is either a creepy way to end it or a heartbreaking

349
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,360
 way to end it. I personally think it's a little bit of both. But in his blog post where he's trying

350
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,600
 to figure out if he can replicate a human being and drink them, he says this. Another interesting

351
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,840
 experiment to be done. He says it's like he's wearing a smock covered in blood with a little

352
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,640
 doctor's mask all bloody holding a butcher knife. And he's talking specifically about taking hair or

353
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,440
 blood or photographs of people and replicating them. Another interesting experiment to be done.

354
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:24,960
 I'll try it with some photographs of people. I'll start with a photograph of my daughter

355
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,720
 who hasn't contacted me for four years. She doesn't like me. And I don't even know where she is.

356
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:43,920
 She does know my address though. So basically this guy is suggesting drinking his daughter.

357
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,080
 That's super creepy.
