1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Is the world's largest carnivore currently trolling the ocean floor looking for something to eat?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Now we take a look at a bizarre story of a boy who claims he was abducted by aliens.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,120
 If that wasn't bad enough, one of the aliens was his dad today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Garmenter.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,080
 I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,680
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,980
 Recording live from the haunted closet, the faster I talk, the sooner I can get the episode finished.

8
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,980
 It is so hot in here.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,980
 And coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, riding on the back of a giant goose.

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,480
 It is Amalia. Everyone give a round of applause to Amalia. She's hanging on to its neck.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,480
 Now the goose does not like this journey, but Amalia does. It's a nice feathered seat.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,480
 For her bottom, she's holding on to the goose's neck.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 Amalia, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you don't like strangling geese, that's fine too.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,480
 Just helps read the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,480
 Dude, so a couple quick things before we get the show started.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,480
 First off, Amalia quit strangling the goose. Okay, perfect. They're giving each other hugs now.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,480
 Now before we get started, two quick things. First off, this is the end of season 13.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,480
 At the end of this week, I'm taking a two week break.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,480
 Secondly, I already announced this to the Patreon supporters.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 I will not be able to do bonus episodes this time.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,480
 The bonus episodes, I really like the idea of them. I actually had already recorded six of them.

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 I just don't have time to edit them. If I'm going to do the bonus episodes, I have to start them early, early in the process.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,480
 Oh my god, I gotta open this door. It's so hot in here.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,480
 Oh my goodness. So, if I survive this episode, if it gets uploaded, you know I survived. I didn't die of heat exhaustion.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,480
 The bonus, I'm not going to have bonus episodes this break. I just don't have time to edit them up.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,480
 So I apologize for that, but doing five episodes a week is already pretty hard for a one man job.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,480
 I don't know why I thought I would be able to add ten more episodes at the end, but I'm definitely not working on them on the vacation.

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 When I'm on vacation, I don't even read. If I'm reading the news and it says ghost in the headline, I avoid it.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,480
 I just want to play video games and not read anything about ghosts. I really need to recharge.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,480
 So sorry about that for the bonus episodes, but you can listen to some past episodes.

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,480
 You can imagine, you can imagine episodes in your head and then go, "Hey Jason, remember that time you covered that episode about those unicorns that took over parliament?"

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
 And I was like, "No, I don't." But you do because you made that episode open your head.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,480
 But sorry about that. And then a band from YouTube week. We're going to take a break from that for today.

35
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,480
 I realized that the band from YouTube week, yesterday's episode especially, was pretty dark.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,480
 One of the reasons why I wasn't talking about them on YouTube was because the subject matter was dark.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 It was either dealing with like brutal, brutal murders or racism. Both stories kind of had elements of racism in it.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,480
 And let's take a break from that because I don't want to keep talking about dark stuff.

39
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 And I definitely know you guys don't like it either. Whenever I run a series of really dark episodes, I get a lot of complaints from you guys.

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 So, Amalia, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command and we are headed out to Chile.

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,480
 [imitates sound effects]

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 I can't do the sound effects in this closet, dude. I cannot do Jason Jalopy's sound effects to save my life.

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,480
 Amalia, drive us down. You make your own sound effects. It's the end of season 13. Just make your own sound effects.

45
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,480
 Amalia, drive us down to Chile. This story was recommended to me a long time ago by Squeezegod on YouTube.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
 And then I recently got a recommendation from Ben Werther on Gmail.

47
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,480
 So thank you very much for recommending the story. And Ben, thanks for reminding me of it. Send me a bunch of links as well.

48
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:58,480
 Really appreciate both of you guys, though. This story is part creepypasta, part truth, all around mystery.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,480
 Amalia is driving us down to Chile. Goose is in the back seat regaling us the stories of Goose-dom.

50
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
 We're having a good time. He's actually a pretty good storyteller.

51
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,480
 And while we're headed down there, we see some scuba divers swimming in the water.

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,480
 We have really, really good eyesight from their freeway. We're like, "Hey, look it. It's scuba divers. They're scuba."

53
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 And we can tell what type of equipment they're using. And we see them splashing around.

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,480
 And they're like, "Ahh, we have good hearing. We can also hear them from a car on the freeway. Ah, help! Tell my wife I love her."

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 We can hear all this stuff. And then we see like a tentacle come out of the water and grab one of them and pull them down.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,480
 "No, Barry, no!" And then we see another tentacle grab down that other dude. And the water is completely calm.

57
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,480
 And we're just parked on the side of the freeway. What we just saw was an attack from the black carpet.

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:54,480
 So there are these real creatures. They're called "sipofono-rays." They're not called that. That's how I'm pronouncing it.

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,480
 That's as close as I can get to it. It's actually what happens when you have a collection of little organisms.

60
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 They create a colony. So like ants are each a little ant. And even though they have like a hive mind, even though the queen goes, "Go here."

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 And they're like, "Ddu-du-du-du-du." And they go there. There's still each individual ant. And the ant itself is a creature.

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 Now what if all the ants formed into one giant ant and started eating you and the first ants would bite you?

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:29,480
 And like the ants that made up their mouth would cut you in half. And then you would be digested by each little ant in the middle.

64
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:37,480
 So eventually they would like the ants of the-- Think of the human centipede. Think of the-- You're like, "Damage is my-- I never want to think of the human centipede."

65
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:45,480
 Think of the human centipede. People's mouths, so and other people's buttholes. That's real. That's 100% medically accurate.

66
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,480
 These things are called syphophorone phrase. And they're in the ocean. And it's a bunch of cells.

67
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,480
 And they're probably-- No scientist-- No-- No scientist has ever compared them to the human centipede.

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:06,480
 A bunch of cells, they form together to make one creature. And they hunt together. They like, some at the bottom are like, "We're gonna push."

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 And they jump up and then the thing will start floating around. And then some of them make tentacles to grab things.

70
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:23,480
 And they eat fish. These things eat crabs and crustaceans. These things, like even though it's a bunch of little tiny cells, they'll eat way bigger things than them.

71
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:34,480
 And those are real. They use tentacles. They shoot toxin into you. They can also use mimicry. They can be like, "Hey, hey, over here, I'm a sexy-- I'm a sexy fish."

72
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:45,480
 And the fish just go, "Oh dude, I've always wanted to meet a sexy fish." And then, "Oh!" They can create-- They don't do that. They light themselves up, makes the fish come towards them, and then they get eaten up.

73
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:58,480
 The biggest one ever found, I believe, was down in Australia. It was actually 49 feet by 154 feet. So massive. It was like this giant spiral rope thing.

74
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:10,480
 It was found in 2020. They've considered the world's largest carnivore. This thing, this sip-fo-ro-n-fray. One of these-- One of these pronunciations is close.

75
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,480
 They're very-- You're like, "Just keep reading the Wikipedia page. You're gonna keep reading facts from Wikipedia. Hold on."

76
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:26,480
 They're very fragile. They're very fra-- According to sources. Look, check the footnotes. They're very fragile. You actually very rarely find these things alive.

77
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:35,480
 And there's no fossils of them, 'cause they're so fragile, but people believe they've been around for at least 60 million years. So those are real. Those are totally real.

78
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 Now there's a story going around on 4chan and a couple other places on the internet, known as the Black Carpet. So Amalia Park, this-- Jason Jalopy on the beach. We're now standing on the beach.

79
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 Let's put on our scuba gear. We're putting on our goggles and our tanks and stuff like that. We jump into the water, splish-splash. We're swimming.

80
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,480
 How come we don't have a submarine? We don't have a dead rabbit submarine. It probably won't save her after we just saw these two scuba divers get eaten.

81
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,480
 I'm like, "Okay, guys, let's jump on inside. Let's swim underwater to see where those people got eaten."

82
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:20,480
 The story is there's a thing called the Black Carpet. And it is a cypher-fro-n-fray, but it is a mile long and a mile wide.

83
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:33,480
 So it's this giant square in the ocean that crawls on the ground. It has little feelers that kind of help it move around, and then it has 20-foot-long tentacles that will grab food and eat you.

84
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,480
 Now these things are carnivorous. They're not lame. They're not eating algae and stuff like that. They're eating stuff that can get away.

85
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 They see that crab trying to move. Nope, eating it. You see that fish going home from a long day of being a fish? Eating it.

86
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:54,480
 So it would be no surprise if it was a mile long and a mile wide. It has 20-foot-long tentacles. It's not eating crabs at that point.

87
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,480
 It's not like, "Hmm, this little tiny hermit crab. It's going to have to eat bigger things." Is it eating people?

88
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,480
 This story is this thing is crawling on the ground. It's eating a bunch of wildlife in the area.

89
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:21,480
 And it's so large it may be responsible for the sound "The Bloop." The Bloop is this really famous anomalous sound. It was recorded in 1997. Back to Wikipedia, guys.

90
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,480
 Back to Wikipedia. No, I remember this. I remember this is like a true mystery, but there's this sound called the Bloop.

91
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:39,480
 It was an underwater sound that was picked up 3,000 miles away. It was the largest underwater sound ever recorded. Sight sources for that one.

92
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,480
 I don't know if that's specifically true, but it was a super loud sound. They said no living creature could make that sound.

93
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:56,480
 And it's like, "Oblop." I'll probably just play the sound clip. I'm just going to make the sound clip.

94
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:06,480
 [Dramatic sound]

95
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 But anyway, so that's the Bloop. And it's been a mystery. It's been around since 1997. It was heard off the coast of Chile.

96
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:24,480
 Now, this creature, this black mat, is supposedly the cause of the Bloop. This massive organism is the sound of the Bloop. It's kind of where this story goes.

97
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,480
 So I looked into this. And I'm pretty sure this is creepypasta, for a couple reasons.

98
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:39,480
 One, the main source I found on it was this list of journal entries. It was like journal entry.

99
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,480
 My name is Joey, and I went underwater today. This is my first day diving. I tested out my new suit. Thanks, Mom.

100
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:55,480
 Then it's like the next date. I saw some fish, and they were doing this. And it's like this really cheesy SCP type of countdown.

101
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,480
 And it's like, "I saw something in the water today. I've never seen anything like it. It went on for miles and not..."

102
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 It went on for one mile. And then it looked in the other direction. It was a mile long. It was crazy.

103
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,480
 And then at the end of it, it goes, "The scientist went missing and nobody found his last lock." Boring.

104
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,480
 That stuff doesn't happen in real life. I mean, people do go missing. Scientists do not finish their work. But that's not true.

105
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,480
 That's not true. There wasn't some scientist leaving very vague information online, not dating. He didn't put dates for any of his stuff.

106
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:38,480
 It was just like date unspecified. Today I saw a calamari. It was really cool. It was SCP-level writing. No offense, whoever wrote it.

107
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 But it was written like that. And then it ended up on a creepypasta on the export as well. And I remember seeing that on there.

108
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 And it was kind of like, "There's this thing under water." Kind of what I told you. It's the carnivorous. And it's very...

109
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 It doesn't really state any specifics. It doesn't go, you know, "These boats were lost in the area," or specifically eating people.

110
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,480
 It's just kind of like, "There's this big thing that scuba divers think exists that's a mile long and a mile wide."

111
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,480
 But scuba divers, there's been posts on this on Reddit as well. Scuba divers are like, "No, it doesn't exist." There would be records of it by now.

112
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,480
 There would be logs of other divers seeing it. And then you go, "Well, maybe they're not taking logs because they're getting eaten by this thing."

113
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:26,480
 That was actually my first instinct. But then I thought, if there were a bunch of divers who were dying in a certain area, then there would be rescue crews out there and they'd be spying in this thing as well.

114
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:36,480
 So I think it's creepypasta. It's definitely... It has all the elements of creepypasta. You have the original story, which is kind of written very...

115
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,480
 "Dear Diary-esque," which is an easy way to write a story. And it's a little too detailed in some parts, not too detailed in other ones.

116
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,480
 It just has all these... thrown up all these red flags. And there's no proof of it. Supposedly it's this massive thing. No one can see it.

117
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,480
 And it's tied into a no-one event. It'd be the same thing if I started a creepypasta and it turns out that this is the reason why the Vermeuter Triangle exists.

118
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:06,480
 Or the creepypasta ends with me turning around and Mothman goes, "Good job. Good job." It's like tying it into an ex... That'll do, pig.

119
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,480
 That'll do and Mothman flies away and destroys the city. Tying it into a real event adds legitimacy to it. So they tie it into the bloop.

120
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,480
 What I find fascinating about this whole thing, and thank you, Ben, and thank you, SqueezeGod, for letting me take a look at this, because what I find fascinating about it is it's totally missing the mark.

121
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:32,480
 This thing could be real. Absolutely could be real. But because they wanted to go this creepy way of doing it, they totally missed the mark.

122
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 There is a real thing called the microbial mat. It's underwater microbes on the seabed. They cover an area bigger than the country of Greece.

123
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:52,480
 So not this mile by a mile thing. That got eaten by this thing. It's underwater microbes on the seabed.

124
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,480
 Now it's not this carnivorous creature. It doesn't have tentacles, but it is a life form. It is this thing that exists as one cohesive entity that is bigger than a country.

125
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:13,480
 At the bottom of the seafloor. And this thing is located off the coast of Chile. The same place where the bloop sound came from.

126
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 This is what I find so interesting. That could be, they just discovered this microbial mat in 2011. That might have been the sound of the bloop.

127
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:34,480
 And it doesn't have to be a sea monster. It could have been a living organism as big as a country. And bigger than several other countries. Moving.

128
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 And causing that sound. The thing with the bloop sound being connected to any living organism though. We've only recorded it once.

129
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 The going theory is it was a certain iceberg calving. It was a certain iceberg breaking off. Creating that sound.

130
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 If it was a living organism you think we would have picked it up more than once. But then people go oh no they're covering it up. They're covering it up for whatever reason.

131
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,480
 NASA hates the color orange. They're covering it up. They'll always throw that in as an easy get. But whether the black carpet doesn't exist.

132
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 But this microbial mat does. And it exists in the same location where the bloop was heard.

133
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,480
 But then you know let's put our own spooky twist on this story. To wrap this up.

134
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,480
 When I was reading this I thought you know what else. It totally reminded me of this. We covered something off the coast of Chile.

135
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,480
 And we're specifically talking about the southern coast of Chile a long time ago.

136
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,480
 I think it was like episode 134. It could be wrong. It's in the show notes. But off the coast of Chile was an island of warlocks.

137
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:42,480
 And they would create these creatures called the umbunche. They would take youth from local neighborhoods and break their legs and bend them backwards and turn them into these horrific creatures.

138
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 They were skinning the recent dead. Like breaking into people's tombs and wearing their skin as capes so they could fly around.

139
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,480
 These warlocks were so feared the local population didn't even want to talk about them.

140
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 And when these warlocks did get taken to trial for these black arts it was the last witch trial.

141
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,480
 It was the very last witch trial in modern times. I think it was like in the early 1900s or mid 1900s honestly.

142
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:15,480
 It's been a long time since I reported that. What if all that black magic, what if all those dark arts actually created a beast in the water?

143
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:25,480
 Now I get, now we're back on the creepypasta thing. But it's just an interesting thing. This place was a place of dark magic.

144
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,480
 Of cannibal magic. Of human sacrifice magic.

145
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:42,480
 And then from this same location we have the creature that's as big as the country of Greece and the location of the loudest sound ever recorded underwater.

146
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,480
 It's possible, I don't think the black carpet exists. But something big does exist off the coast of Chile.

147
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:58,480
 It could be a scientific curiosity. It could be all these little microbes hanging out and something to look at under a microscope, under a macroscope in that case.

148
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:11,480
 Or it could just be the first shape, the first form of a dark creature that was summoned decades ago in the deep blue seas off the coast of Chile.

149
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 Amalia, let's go ahead and hop in that carbonic hop to work before this Cthulhu-like creature is fully summoned. Get us out of here.

150
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,480
 We are going to leave behind Chile. We are headed out to Pot-Win, Kansas.

151
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 Have you done it yet? Have you pre-ordered your copy of Murder, Barry, Wynn? Do you like board games and murder?

152
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
 Then the dark comedic thriller Murder, Barry, Wynn is for you.

153
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:49,480
 Critically acclaimed on the festival circuit and winner of best feature at Phoenix Fear Con, Murder, Barry, Wynn centers on three aspiring board game designers who have to dispose of a body.

154
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:58,480
 With few options available, they turn to their game for guidance. The premise of their game? How to murder someone and get away with it.

155
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,480
 Pre-order now when you'll receive the original Deck of Cards is featured in the film for free. Details at MurderBarryWynn.com.

156
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,480
 Really good movie. I've talked about it a lot. I'd like to do something else with the creators of that movie.

157
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,480
 One of the guys who worked on it is Carson. He's a long time Patreon, long time friend. Really, really fun movie.

158
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,480
 It's actually super-tens- I wouldn't say it's fun. It's actually really super-tens-fun. I greatly enjoyed it. I know you will too.

159
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,480
 Amalia is flying this carbonicopter. We are headed out to Potwin, Kansas.

160
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:42,480
 Man, I opened the side door of the helicopter. I'm leaning out. I'm like, "Oh, it's so hot in here."

161
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,480
 The goose is patting my head. "Season's almost over," he says. "Then you rest."

162
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,480
 And then he started his home process again for Season 14. I'm always ready to start at the end of the vacation.

163
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:05,480
 But before it starts, ugh, I'm super sweaty. It's October 1st, 1972. We're in Potwin, Kansas. It's 1 a.m.

164
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 There's a 7-year-old boy sleeping in his room. Let's call him Mikey. And Mikey's tossing and turning. And he's like, "Ugh."

165
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,480
 He's a 7-year-old. He's not a toddler. Me want, ba-ba. And then he can kind of hear footsteps.

166
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,480
 That sounds like booty. That sounds like booty clapping. He's- he's-

167
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:36,480
 That's how sweaty my legs are. I'm wearing shorts. He hears footsteps. Step, step, step, step, step.

168
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:45,480
 And he opens his eyes and he sees in his darkened bedroom two gray aliens standing in front of his bedroom door.

169
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,480
 Now, your first inclination is going to be you're 7 years old. Like, as you get older, I think you'd scream,

170
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,480
 and then you'd start like finding stuff to throw at him, or maybe scream and faint, or maybe scream and pretend to faint,

171
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,480
 or maybe fetish for gray aliens. You're like, "Ooh, my time has come."

172
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,480
 But he just screams. He's 7 years old. What is he going to do against a gray alien? He starts screaming for his dad.

173
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,480
 He's like, "Dad, no! Help me, help me, help me!" He hears his dad run up through the hallway. The door opens.

174
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:22,480
 The aliens vanish. The dad is now standing in this empty bedroom. And Mikey's like, "No, Dad! Before you got here, there were two gray aliens there.

175
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,480
 They were trying to get me. I don't know. It's the part they're trying to get me. It's implied they were trying to get me because they're in my bedroom.

176
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,480
 But maybe they just wanted to like hang out. Dad goes, "Listen, there's no aliens here. It probably does the whole thing.

177
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,480
 Like, do you want me to check the closet? Do you want me to check under the bed? Do you want me to check the interdimensional teleporter?

178
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,480
 Yeah, yeah, check all that stuff." The dad leaves. And Mikey's still in the bedroom. He's super scared.

179
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,480
 And after the dad leaves, the aliens step out of the darkness.

180
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,480
 [makes weird noise]

181
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:04,480
 Now Mikey is in a room, and he's laying down on a table. And he sees what's described as humanoids.

182
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:12,480
 So he had gray aliens first, so these are more human looking. He sees a doctor. He sees like a man who appears to be a doctor.

183
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,480
 We see that happen a lot in UFOology. Someone will see someone and they'll say, "I think it was a doctor."

184
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:27,480
 But first off, most doctors don't wear like the doctor coats. Most doctors just wear like clothes, just like normal clothes.

185
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:38,480
 So it's interesting when people have these alien experiences, are they seeing them in the actual like smock or whatever that is, that white lab coat thing, which real doctors don't really wear anymore?

186
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:47,480
 Or do they just see someone in clothes and they get the mental impression that they're a doctor, that there's some sort of medical specialist?

187
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:57,480
 That's an interesting question. But he sees this doctor and then he sees two shorter humans around the doctor, who he thinks are his assistants.

188
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:06,480
 Now the boy's freaking out. No, no! His boy's got super deep. He started puberty the second they teleported him. No, no, let me go!

189
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:14,480
 And he's freaking out and the doctor's kind of looking around. The assistants are just like handing out earplugs, handing out sci-fi earplugs.

190
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:25,480
 The boy's freaking out though. He won't calm down and then his father walks into the room and he looks at his dad and he immediately begins to calm down.

191
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:42,480
 Now the boy knows this isn't his father. The boy knows that his father is not here, but they are able to roll him over onto his side and then they put something into his left ear.

192
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:51,480
 His dad walks over to him and looks down at Mikey and says, "Don't touch your ear. Don't touch your ear until you wake up."

193
00:22:51,480 --> 00:23:02,480
 And the next thing the boy knows, he's laying in his bedroom. He has no further memory after his father says that.

194
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 I got that story from ThinkAboutItDucks.com. They got it from New Fork, which is the National UFO Research Center, I believe, and it was listed in their records.

195
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:25,480
 It's a very short story, but it has some really creepy implications. It would make sense that if you were abducting somebody in an alien setting, you really couldn't do it in real life.

196
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,480
 It would be way harder in real life if somebody kidnapped Mikey and threw him in a warehouse and then his dad showed up.

197
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 It was just a guy dressed up like his dad normally dresses up, but he's wearing like a bag over his head.

198
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,480
 He's like, "Hey Mikey, I'm your dad. I can't show my face because technology hasn't evolved to the point where I can mimic your face, but I'm your dad."

199
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,480
 It'd be a lot harder to do in real life, but in an alien setting, you figure it would be pretty easy to actually...

200
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 I mean, if you can traverse the stars, you think you can put on a disguise, right? Hologram or something like that.

201
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
 So it would make sense to imitate a loved one to get you to calm down.

202
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,480
 But then let's put on our conspiracy caps, because I think we can take this to a crazy level.

203
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
 I think we can take this someplace way crazier.

204
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,480
 And I'll say this too, if you have any mental issues, maybe this is a cursed episode.

205
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,480
 Maybe this should be on the Not For YouTube week, when it is, so it's perfect.

206
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 If you have any, like, mental issues, you might not want to listen to this next segment.

207
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,480
 There was actually a young man who kept following... I get so much weird emails and stuff from people.

208
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
 This was on YouTube as well.

209
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,480
 I think on Monday I mentioned that I get a bunch of weird... I get, like, weird emails every single day, and hate emails every single day.

210
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 It's constant.

211
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:49,480
 But I got this weird series of contacts from this young man recently, and he was skipping from video to video,

212
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 and he thought the videos were cursed, or that they were speaking to him.

213
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,480
 He found the despair... He kept pleading for me to convince him the despair code wasn't real.

214
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
 He found that episode.

215
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,480
 And then he found the Solar Plexus Clown Guiders one.

216
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,480
 He was, like, 12. I think he was 12 years old.

217
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,480
 And he was like, "No, since I've heard this I can't get it out of my head."

218
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 And he was like, "Somehow was..."

219
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,480
 He was able to hop from, like, my most psychologically disturbing episodes.

220
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
 He did despair code.

221
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
 He did Solar Plexus Clown Guiders.

222
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
 And then there was one other one.

223
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,480
 And first I thought he was a troll, because that's usually what a lot of this stuff is,

224
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,480
 but I actually... I'll always take a look and see what I can find out about the person.

225
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
 I'll spend, like, 10 minutes doing it.

226
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,480
 I'm not Perry Mason or any other investigator. He was a lawyer. It doesn't matter.

227
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
 The point is... He's a fictional character.

228
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
 The point is, is that he did turn out he was 12.

229
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,480
 I was able to verify his age, because I'm a reporter.

230
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,480
 I know how to find stuff out about people really, really quickly.

231
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
 I was able to verify his age.

232
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,480
 So I remember telling him, "You may not want to listen to this show."

233
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
 "It's that distressing to you."

234
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,480
 "No, no, no, I can do it. I just need to know that despair code isn't real,"

235
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 "because I listened to this episode and now I'm afraid my life is gonna be ruined."

236
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,480
 And so, yes, I mean, I... Most of you guys, like I said,

237
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 I get crazy emails every single day, but I get, for every crazy email,

238
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,480
 I get five or six emails from people telling me how much they love the show

239
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,480
 and good story suggestions and things like that, like "Sweeze God and Ben" and all that stuff.

240
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,480
 It balances out on the side of good, definitely, but most of you people are mature

241
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,480
 and have really strong psychic... In the sense, not like psychic powers, like you can see the future,

242
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,480
 but psyche, like you guys can take some mental...

243
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,480
 Basically, most of you guys, I'm gonna tell you this. I don't remember what I was talking about, honestly.

244
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
 But anyways, oh, oh, so, yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,480
 So, here's the thing. If you have any sort of, like, issues distinguishing the difference between reality and fantasy,

246
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,480
 don't listen to this next segment.

247
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,480
 What if conspiracy cap's falling on and disclaimer fully given?

248
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,480
 What if this is the way that aliens operate?

249
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,480
 And what if you could actually look back at your life?

250
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:15,480
 Imagine this. You look back at your life's memories and you find out that 10% of them aren't real.

251
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,480
 10% of the memories you have may be even more.

252
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,480
 Or memories implanted to cover up alien abductions.

253
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
 That memory you have when you were three and your mother giving you a bath,

254
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,480
 you realize you're actually neck deep in a thick purple fluid,

255
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,480
 as a gray alien is slowly inserting a needle into the base of your spine.

256
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,480
 But you just remember your mother washing the back of your neck.

257
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,480
 A smile on her face.

258
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,480
 You remember walking down the street one day to go to the park. You were so excited to see your friends that day.

259
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,480
 But you never got to the park.

260
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 You never even left your house.

261
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,480
 The memory of you walking down the street never happened.

262
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,480
 It was a cover-up for that time that you were walking down a dark hallway.

263
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 Nervous.

264
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
 Anxious.

265
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
 Afraid.

266
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,480
 You'd been down this hallway a dozen times already.

267
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 You knew of the operating room that laid beyond the black door.

268
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 But in your mind, you can't wait to get there.

269
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,480
 You're gonna have so much fun at the playground.

270
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,480
 That time you were in school, you asked for permission to go to the bathroom.

271
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 You were only gone for a few minutes, but when you came back, your teacher yelled at you.

272
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
 What took you so long?

273
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
 Your first kiss.

274
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,480
 The first time you saw a rainbow.

275
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,480
 That time you were laying in the grass, and you felt completely content.

276
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,480
 None of these events ever happened.

277
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:15,480
 They're simply implanted memories to cover up what the aliens were doing to you.

278
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,480
 And that's why when you asked your mom or ask a friend, "Hey, you remember that time?"

279
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
 I go, "No, what are you talking about?"

280
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
 That never happened.

281
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,480
 Yeah, I remember that one time when I was a little kid, I was running down the hallway and fell and I scraped my knee.

282
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,480
 Well, I remember you scraping your knee, but I don't remember you doing it at that house, and you said,

283
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,480
 "No, honey, that never happened."

284
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:50,480
 It's because we're asking real people to verify events that were implanted into our mind.

285
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:58,480
 And if that's the case, if you have childhood memories that were crafted by alien abductors,

286
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,480
 and you're not able to tell the difference, who's to say that it stopped?

287
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,480
 Who's to say that it's still not happening?

288
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,480
 That night you stayed up late playing video games, and man, it seemed like time just stopped.

289
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,480
 You had so much fun, you were up till 3, 4 in the morning playing video games, having so much fun.

290
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:40,480
 But you were really strapped down into a chair, eyes forced open, single tear drop falls across your cheek as the experiments continue.

291
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:58,480
 And even now, you could be sitting in a cell aboard an alien medical starship, and you're sitting in the darkness terrified of what comes next, and then the new memory is implanted.

292
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,480
 The memory of you sitting there listening to your favorite podcast.

293
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,480
 A man's voice echoing across the distance. He says he's recording it in a haunted closet.

294
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,480
 He says that he's having a great day, and he hopes you are too.

295
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:28,480
 But he's just a figment. He's just an implant. He's just a voice to calm you down.

296
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:46,480
 He doesn't exist, he never existed. All that exists is the pitch black cell you exist in, and the grey aliens outside the door, ready to drag you out for another experiment.

297
00:31:46,480 --> 00:32:03,480
 Didradveradio@gmail.com, I do exist.

298
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:19,480
 Didradveradio@gmail.com is going to be your email address and a fictional air conditioner in this haunted closet.

299
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:35,480
 You can also do this on facebook.com/DeadRabberadio.

300
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,480
 Didradveradio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listen to it today. Have a great one, guys.

301
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,480
 Is that okay, alien masters? Did you like that? Did you like that episode?

302
00:32:49,480 --> 00:33:05,480
 Man, it gets real hot in this closet. It gets really, really hot. Have a great day, guys.
