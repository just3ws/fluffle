1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
 When a man who loves animals so much, society tells him to change.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,600
 He's gonna fight the system.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,400
 But will his nose be a friend or foe?

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,280
 That made zero sense.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
 What are you talking about?

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
 Hold on.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
 Just keep listening to the episode.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,720
 And then we travel to Japan to take a look at a conspiracy theory that the Japanese Red

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,720
 Cross used young men's own horniness to get them to donate blood.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,720
 Sounds like a pretty cool deal, honestly if you ask me.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,000
 But does this fun story point us towards a much bleaker future?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,120
 One where the AI controls everything we do.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:59,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,280
 I'm your host Jason Garminer, I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,800
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend doing whatever you're doing.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,640
 I hope you guys are also still working on your 90 days to a better you challenge.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,240
 We started that a couple weeks ago, a couple weeks ago, but you can start whenever it doesn't

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,600
 matter 90 days to a better you.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,120
 Just pick a goal and try to complete it within 90 days.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,680
 You're like running for president all of a sudden and you're like "Ah I only have 90

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,640
 days, I need more than that."

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,200
 It's great, it's fun, I'm doing it, a lot of my listeners do it.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,080
 It's free too, this isn't some sort of money making scam.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,600
 Set a goal and see what you can achieve in 90 days.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,520
 Trust me, if you do it, you will be better for it.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,480
 I guess I can't guarantee that you want to be the world's best bank robber you end up

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
 in jail.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,640
 You're like "No, my life sucks now."

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,200
 But someone who robs banks and never gets caught walking into Dead Rabbit Command right

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,120
 now, everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
 Lord Shin 2021.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,080
 Yeah, woohoo, come on in Lord Shin 2021.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,680
 Lord Shin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy and get this episode

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 started.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're going to drive all the way out to a

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
 psychiatrist's office.

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,160
 If you're a new listener to the show, you probably didn't notice anything different,

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,480
 but longtime listeners of the show noticed that I left something out of that intro.

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,720
 Normally, I say, if you can't swear to the Patreon, that's fine too, just help spread

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,240
 the word about Dead Rabbit Radio, means a lot.

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,240
 But this episode I have some homework for you.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,040
 In that psychiatrist, this is real, this is totally real, I need this, I need this.

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,080
 Everyone is listening to this episode, do you now have a homework assignment?

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,400
 In this psychiatrist's office is an item.

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,680
 Now it's not just in this psychiatrist's office, apparently this is a tool that many

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
 psychiatrists use and I want one of these.

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,320
 I kind of need one of these, I'm becoming obsessed, I feel like as I'm talking about it, I'm

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,560
 Indiana Jones looking down a dark jungle tunnel only to see a golden idol sitting on a stone

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
 wall.

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,920
 I need this.

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,280
 Let's take a look at the story of this guy who is experiencing this truly cursed item,

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,920
 I mean if anything comes close to the Necromonon, it's this thing, or the Necronomicon, I've

55
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,040
 been told I've been pronouncing it wrong for the past 46 years of my life.

56
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,920
 A cursed object, this guy named Vah Sasha posted this online, we're gonna call him Josh.

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,320
 Josh?

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,000
 Even the story starts off where it's missing so much context.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 As the story starts off with Josh being arrested for committing bestiality.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,520
 I don't know why that part happened, right?

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,520
 I can't imagine how you get caught doing that.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,280
 I mean I guess there's a bunch of different ways, right?

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,600
 People videotaped themselves doing that?

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,920
 Which I get it, sure like rappers will videotape themselves like juggling fentanyl and they're

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,800
 like this is where I get my money and they're like sitting on a bunch of dollar bills.

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
 A dollar bill, a hundred dollar bills, right?

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
 And they get arrested.

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,240
 There is a one famous rapper in San Francisco, actually he wasn't famous, he was famous at

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,760
 the underground scene, his name was Kraz I think it was, and he would rap about how

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,680
 much money he made selling weed and they scooped him up.

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,560
 He's still in prison as far as I know, he got like 20 years for dealing, because he

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,640
 was dealing so much he was shooting music videos about how much weed he was selling,

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
 but that's fine, right?

74
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,960
 It's actually illegal, it was illegal back then, at least this was back in the early

75
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
 2000s.

76
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,800
 He actually might be getting out soon now that I think about it, but hopefully.

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,920
 That's one thing, right?

78
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,640
 Like you're filming yourself, throwing around money, whatever, it's artistic license, sure

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,000
 you're committing a crime, whatever.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,020
 I don't understand why someone would film such a disgusting act, but people do.

81
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,080
 So maybe they found video footage of him, maybe, which is fine, right?

82
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,920
 On the Fun-O-Meter, on the Laugh-O-Meter, it's out of 10, it's probably like a 1 or

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,640
 a 2, right?

84
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
 Whatever, but I'm thinking, wouldn't it have been funnier?

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,320
 The first thing I would say, this is a horrible crime, it's animal abuse, I'm trying not to

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,120
 make a light of it as I'm laughing, but if you had to arrest someone for being so evil,

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,400
 all of a sudden this hypothetical fell in your lap, would it rather be that you caught

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,160
 video footage of him doing it, or that some nosy neighbor, some nosy neighbor looked over

89
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
 the fence and caught him in the act?

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
 That'd be way, that'd be way funny.

91
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,200
 Like Jason, courts, judges don't care how funny it is, how funny it is that they got

92
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
 caught.

93
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:52,840
 I just imagine some old woman baking muffins in her kitchen and she hears a sound in the

94
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,200
 backyard and the guy kissing a dog and she's like "what?"

95
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,280
 And then I imagine like a little family circle type cartoon strip on this wall.

96
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,880
 Poking her head up over, okay so here's the thing, obviously I'm approaching this, I'm

97
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,760
 not being super sensitive to the topic, I'm sorry, I would not be laughing so much, I

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,720
 wouldn't be like "oh he kicked that dog to death, but did he get caught in a funny way?"

99
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 It's different.

100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,680
 There's still animal abuse, hopefully people aren't unsubscribing to the show right now,

101
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,360
 but I'm just saying, there's a funny way to get caught committing a crime in a boring

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,760
 way, so hopefully he got caught by a neighbor or a policeman who was just passing by and

103
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,480
 he heard a "mmm" on a dog.

104
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,040
 Anyways, Josh got arrested committing bestiality and he made a deal, he made a deal, he would

105
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,440
 serve no prison time for his crime and really more importantly, would stay off the sex offender

106
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,120
 registry, that's the big thing right, you can do a year or two in prison standing on

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,520
 your head as long as you keep to yourself, but if you're on the sex offender registry

108
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,280
 you can't work, you can't you know get a place to live, all this stuff.

109
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,840
 Now it's kind of gross because he actually did have sex with an animal, we don't know

110
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,400
 if it was a dog, I'm assuming it's a dog for what's coming up later but it doesn't

111
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,320
 matter, it's not like they're like "oh it's just a squirrel, we'll let you off with a

112
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
 warning."

113
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,280
 He had sex with an animal, most likely a dog, even if he's not on the sex offender

114
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,360
 registry he's still a sex offender, but you can make deals so you don't appear on that?

115
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,400
 This guy, he can stay off the sex offender registry even though he's a sex offender,

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,480
 and a creepy one at that, like again we haven't even gotten started, if he completes a version

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,880
 therapy, so he's like "yeah that's awesome, I can stay out of prison, I don't have to

118
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,400
 be on the registry, I just have to do this version therapy, I can do that."

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
 But then he goes "what's a version therapy?"

120
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,160
 And they go "well it's not what you think, it's not like we attach electrodes to you,

121
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
 it's not torturous."

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,400
 And he's like "oh okay good."

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,440
 They said "what we do is we're going to hook your penis up to this machine, this electrical

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,680
 machine right, it is kind of electrical, they hook your penis up to this thing called a

125
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,400
 PPG test that I actually tell how aroused you're getting, and it's like a lie detector

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,040
 for your penis, and we're going to show you deviant images."

127
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,560
 He's like "sounds like a good Saturday afternoon to me, they show you deviant images while

128
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:34,720
 you're hooked up to this PPG, and if you show arousal, we take this vial of smells, we have

129
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,560
 like these little jars in the office, this is what I want guys, I want one of these."

130
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,520
 They have these jars in these offices, and they go "well hold it on your nose and you

131
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,960
 just take three deep breaths, and that is the aversion therapy, we'll just do that once

132
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,560
 a week, takes about 30 minutes an hour to go through it."

133
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,600
 And he's like "dude I can totally do that, that's totally fine."

134
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,680
 Now what's creepy is he's writing this and he says multiple times "listen, I committed

135
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,160
 the crime, and I understand that and I'll never do it again, however, I don't want to change

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,440
 who I am inside."

137
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,280
 He says this a couple of times over two different posts "I don't want to change who I am inside."

138
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,960
 See he's an animal lover, he really really loves animals so that's such an intrinsic

139
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,680
 part of his personality he does not want to let go of that.

140
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,680
 Anybody who knows anything about therapy knows that that's the goal right, is to get rid of

141
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
 that.

142
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,320
 "Oh I don't want to gamble all my money away but I don't want to get rid of the risk taker

143
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,520
 that I really am inside."

144
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,960
 Well that's what's causing that problem in the first place right?

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,040
 I don't want to change who I am, it's actually part of his personality that he's a Zoua

146
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,480
 file.

147
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,280
 So he decides to start doing this aversion therapy and what happens is he's posting a

148
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,960
 story online on week five.

149
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,600
 He's been doing this for five weeks now and he posts online and he's like "I have no idea

150
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,800
 what I signed up for, none."

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,000
 Because I'm failing the PPG test.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,320
 They are hooking me up to this thing, they're showing these animals this doing stuff right?

153
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,920
 Not playing, there's not a bunch of dogs playing poker even though that is deviant.

154
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,960
 It's sex stuff with dogs and he's getting aroused by it and then the therapist brings

155
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,960
 this, brings these vials to him and makes him sniff them.

156
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,560
 He goes "I can barely even get too deep breaths."

157
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,440
 And I begin retching uncontrollably.

158
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,960
 He goes "I'm so nauseous that even when it's over with as I'm leaving the office going

159
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,240
 home I still feel like I'm on a puke."

160
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,080
 These scents are animal related right?

161
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,200
 It makes sense.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,560
 One of them is rotten meat, just like the most pungent rotten meat smell right under

163
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,000
 your nostril and you have to sniff.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,880
 Did I tell you guys not to eat before this segment?

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,720
 I don't know if I included that part.

166
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,280
 Rotten meat right underneath your nose you have to sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff,

167
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,000
 get three deep nostril folds of this smell.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,720
 The other one is cat spray right up under your nostrils and then I've never smelled this,

169
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,200
 I've smelled the first two right?

170
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
 But this one, I've heard horror stories about this.

171
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 I've never had a pet dog but I have had friends that have and they've told me about times

172
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:38,120
 they've had to interact with the dog's anal gland and that's the smell.

173
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,920
 It's just pure undiluted, the scent of a dog's anal gland right on your nose and you're forced

174
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
 to smell it.

175
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,920
 Not like you can pull away and be like "No, no, no, no, no more.

176
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
 Take the dog to the vet.

177
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,520
 I'm tired of doing this myself."

178
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,920
 No, this is part of your therapy in a last about an hour a week.

179
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,280
 Now part of this therapy is he also has homework to do which sounds hilarious.

180
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,960
 They give him just a chunk of rotten meat in a little lunch box, a little he-man metal

181
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
 lunch box.

182
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,360
 They're like "Now you gotta go home and do this, do this connect the dots and once you

183
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
 realize what it's a picture of you gotta smell that rotten meat."

184
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,120
 He has homework to do but this is again where he says "I don't want to change who I am so

185
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,760
 I really haven't been doing the homework."

186
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:28,000
 But it's week five now and my therapist is able to tell that I'm not in it to win it.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,200
 The therapist can actually tell I'm not committed to changing things.

188
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,280
 And it's interesting the therapist said "Listen, society has decided that what you did is

189
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,720
 so wrong that you have to do this.

190
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,980
 We have to change you so you don't have these desires anymore.

191
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,080
 If you do not by the end of the year you will be in jail and a registered sex offender.

192
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,880
 So it's your choice but you have to start working on it and taking this seriously or

193
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,320
 I'm gonna bring out the stronger sense."

194
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
 And he's freaking out.

195
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,320
 He goes "Stronger sense?

196
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,080
 It gets worse than what I'm smelling now?"

197
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,820
 And that's when the therapist goes "What you're smelling now is diluted."

198
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,420
 The normal smells are ten times as strong.

199
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,980
 So you have to make a decision right now.

200
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,780
 Are you gonna stick with this or not?

201
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,540
 You gotta do your homework you got to figure this out.

202
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,500
 He posted that back in June.

203
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,100
 He has to do this program for a year, it's once a week, it lasts about an hour and he

204
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,180
 has to get his act together.

205
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:52,880
 Well just earlier this month Josh posted again online he said "Guys I can't do this anymore.

206
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 It's been three months, really four months since this started and now I have to go twice

207
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:06,080
 a week and they're using the stronger smells."

208
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,760
 And because he's failing right?

209
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,340
 He's still looking at these images and getting aroused.

210
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,580
 He has this PPG machine up to which I kind of hope all sort of sound effects.

211
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,020
 It's all a boing and therapist is like "Oh it made the boing noise again."

212
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,460
 It's a little less than the og.

213
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,260
 But still no boings allowed looking at this picture.

214
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,660
 He's getting the charts ready.

215
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,620
 This seems like clockwork orange level stuff.

216
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,340
 I don't know what country this is happening in.

217
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,820
 I'm assuming America.

218
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,700
 But I didn't know they did stuff like this anymore.

219
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,200
 And it seems kind of effective right?

220
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,640
 Not for this guy but he's been doing this for four months and hasn't changed him.

221
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,760
 He wasn't doing the homework right?

222
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,080
 He wasn't doing the paint by numbers and revealing these disgusting pictures that he's throwing

223
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,600
 up at home.

224
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,480
 He wasn't committed to it and now they're using these more powerful smells.

225
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,480
 He has to go twice a week and he goes "These smells.

226
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,640
 I used to just be three deep breaths."

227
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,160
 He goes "Now they hold it under my nose for 15 seconds."

228
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,500
 And I have to just be breathing it in the whole time.

229
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 And it's interesting.

230
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,380
 I didn't think about this.

231
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,820
 You have to switch up the smells otherwise you would get used to it right?

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,380
 That's why they would use the rotten meat, the dog anal gland and the cat pee.

233
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,620
 Because you would just be like "Oh I have a sense of cat pee.

234
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,820
 That reminds me of sparkles.

235
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
 My family cat."

236
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,500
 Like if you smelled a smell enough even if you got taken away from me and put it back

237
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,180
 you would build up an immunity to it.

238
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,740
 But you didn't know if you were going to get rotten meat or dog anal gland.

239
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,240
 I mean out of those two I'd rather have rotten meat.

240
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
 But you don't know it.

241
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
 Like psychs your brain out.

242
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,840
 Well now they're still doing the dog anal gland and the cat pee but there's a nuisance

243
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
 involved.

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,760
 And it's funny because he goes when I ask what is that smell they never tell me.

245
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,320
 He goes "I can put two and two together.

246
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,240
 I know the smell of rotten meat.

247
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,640
 I know the smell of dog anal gland."

248
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,720
 He goes "This new one I don't really know what the smell is."

249
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,720
 The way he describes it is they stick it under his nose and he says it smells like rancid.

250
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,900
 Rancid dog breath.

251
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,700
 Rancid dog breath and he goes actually more than that he goes "Imagine that if a dog

252
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:23,460
 with dental problems like you had a dog with rotten teeth just ate roadkill and feces and

253
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:31,580
 walked up to you and put its face right under your nose and breathed into your nostrils for

254
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,080
 15 seconds straight."

255
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,200
 And he says in this again in his post he goes "I don't want to change who I am."

256
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:47,360
 But in this post when he's talking about the therapy he says quote "What I hate about it

257
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,640
 is that it works."

258
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,520
 So even though he's failing this PPG test he's getting aroused by these images.

259
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,840
 He's smelling these scents.

260
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,580
 It is changing his attraction towards animals.

261
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,180
 The smells are so strong.

262
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,900
 They're held under his nose for so long.

263
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,340
 It is changing who he is inside.

264
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:14,860
 Now who he is inside is someone who's very likely to commit criminal acts against innocent

265
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,380
 animals right?

266
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,660
 Who he is inside is someone who wants to engage in bestiality.

267
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:30,720
 He holds that as a core character identity and it's being erased.

268
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,440
 He's fighting that psychological battle and he's losing.

269
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
 He's losing out to one of the five senses of the human body.

270
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,440
 Isn't that fascinating?

271
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,960
 To think about something that you...

272
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,240
 I mean he's a sicko right?

273
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,480
 I'm not saying that.

274
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
 I'm not just defending anything he's doing.

275
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,140
 I did laugh about it a lot ten minutes ago but he's a sicko.

276
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,580
 And again he could have chosen to just go to jail and be on the sex of indiregistry

277
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,060
 for ten years, rest of his life, whatever the sentence was.

278
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,260
 He chose this and it's changing who he is for the better right?

279
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,820
 Now he doesn't want to have sex with animals but crazy.

280
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,180
 It seems so simple right?

281
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,740
 A smell can actually...

282
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,780
 Like could that work against somebody else?

283
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,680
 Let's say that it wasn't something egregious.

284
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
 Let's say...

285
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
 I mean you figure it would right?

286
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
 If you were an overeater, you loved...

287
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,280
 You're not anymore to listen to this episode.

288
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,480
 You're like I'm done.

289
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
 I'm done.

290
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,160
 But yeah imagine if every time you wanted to eat a chicken pot pie, they're showing you

291
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,160
 these photographs of this delicious food, they stuck a disgusting smell under your nose.

292
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,560
 I wonder if you could actually make someone starve themselves to death.

293
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,640
 Like you could actually turn them off of all food.

294
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,200
 But I mean that's like a biological necessity.

295
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,280
 What if there was something...

296
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,500
 What if you loved art?

297
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,780
 You loved looking at paintings.

298
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:53,060
 Like could you override somebody's core programming?

299
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,900
 Part of someone's soul simply by assaulting one of their five senses.

300
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
 I mean you could obviously torture people.

301
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,620
 1984 is all about that right?

302
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,540
 How badly do you have to beat a man before he stops loving symphonies?

303
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,380
 The spoiler alert that's basically 1984 in one sentence.

304
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,020
 But even that's like physical torture, fear and stuff like that.

305
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,480
 It's just this breathing and stuff.

306
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,760
 And someone else replied on one of his posts, this guy named YicLoke.

307
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,240
 And it's interesting, he said listen by the end of the year you'll either be in jail or

308
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,160
 be a registered sex offender or the mere sight of a dog is going to be enough to give you

309
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
 the dry heaves.

310
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
 Pick one.

311
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,040
 And that would be true right?

312
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,920
 Like just by looking at them he would get sick.

313
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,720
 He wouldn't be able to even have a normal human relationship with an animal.

314
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,880
 He would just be disgusted by them.

315
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,020
 Fascinating right?

316
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,620
 Like the fact that you could change something about somebody, whether it's good or bad right?

317
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,780
 This is a bad thing that he either needs to do time for or change.

318
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,820
 But you could probably also obviously do it for good stuff.

319
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,900
 A very compassionate person if every time they saw two people hugging you shoved dog

320
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
 puke up their nostrils.

321
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,060
 I'm pretty sure they'd stop being compassionate.

322
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,620
 Fascinating and I want one of these vials.

323
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,480
 I want one of these.

324
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,120
 I've actually been looking for them online to buy.

325
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,040
 I can find skunk spray.

326
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,560
 I can find dog pee.

327
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,720
 Boring.

328
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,960
 I want a jar.

329
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,000
 I want a jar that contains the smell of a rancid dog's breath.

330
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,560
 I actually was looking up a version therapist in my area to ask.

331
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,240
 I wanted to, I very rarely do interviews on this show.

332
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,200
 I think I've done maybe three or four.

333
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,620
 I'll talk to people behind the scenes and stuff like that to get more information.

334
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,980
 I couldn't find one.

335
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,820
 And then I started, that's when I go, maybe I can just buy one.

336
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,060
 There's some black market therapist out there.

337
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,940
 He's walking around with a trench coat, a very, very smelly trench coat holding it open.

338
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,220
 What do you want?

339
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,980
 I want one of these vials, man.

340
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,980
 I could do so much with one of these vials, right?

341
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,700
 Yeah, I can throw it at people.

342
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,100
 That's kind of all I can think of.

343
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,960
 I can sit there and I can check it at someone.

344
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,640
 I would keep it as a relic next to my balloon boy.

345
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 I have a piece of the balloon boy balloon.

346
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,880
 Not a piece of the balloon boy himself, but I want a vial of rancid dog breath.

347
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,480
 Actually now that I've thought about it, someone could just send me a vial and go, here you

348
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,960
 go and wonder whether or not I would open it up.

349
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,880
 I just trust them or would I go, yeah, that's rotten dog teeth.

350
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,860
 I want one of these vials.

351
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
 I want the scent.

352
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
 That's so fascinating.

353
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
 The story's fascinating.

354
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
 I didn't even know this therapy was still around.

355
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,140
 Apparently it works.

356
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,740
 Crazy, insane, true crime story.

357
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,980
 But let's go ahead and get on to our next one.

358
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,780
 Because trust me, I can keep talking about that one.

359
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
 Let's go ahead.

360
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
 This next one though is even weirder.

361
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,020
 If you were able to stomach that last one, this one's not gross, but it has some really

362
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,160
 interesting implications for you, for you specifically.

363
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,320
 Lord Shin 2021, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonar copter.

364
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,120
 We are leaving behind this therapist's office with clothespins around our nose.

365
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
 I'm not.

366
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
 I'm breathing it in, baby.

367
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,240
 Ah, that's the stuff.

368
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
 Fly us out of here.

369
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,480
 We're headed all the way out to Japan.

370
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,160
 First off, I got to give a shout out to one of our dead rabbit radio loyal listeners.

371
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,020
 Shizou Raised by Wolves.

372
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,460
 Shizou Raised by Wolves recommended this story to me.

373
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
 Absolutely fascinating.

374
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,040
 They posted it on the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

375
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
 Never heard of it.

376
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
 Great story.

377
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
 Thank you so much.

378
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,240
 This story is really summed up in one sentence.

379
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:52,500
 The question is, did the Japanese government target nerds in Japan, male nerds, for blood

380
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 donations?

381
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,140
 And then the other follow up question would be why them, right?

382
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,100
 Would there be a reason why you'd want nerds to do this?

383
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,740
 Or Otaku is the term, Otaku is actually worse than a nerd.

384
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,440
 Otaku is almost like an insult.

385
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,940
 It's like a shut-in in Japan who does nothing but play video games, read manga, and watch

386
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
 anime.

387
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,740
 It sounds totally awesome, right?

388
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
 It sounds totally awesome.

389
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,740
 I wish I could do that.

390
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
 I used to.

391
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,860
 But, um, yeah, Otaku is more of like an insult over there.

392
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,620
 Nerds, we have nerd culture and all that stuff over here and everything.

393
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,900
 I used to get beat up for being a nerd, right?

394
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,820
 Now I get to see people wear my culture on their shirts.

395
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,380
 Sir, let me have a word with you.

396
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,900
 Anyways, 2019 is when our saga takes place.

397
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,820
 There was this manga written by a guy named Taki, and he wrote it.

398
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,620
 You could obviously tell it was questioning the pronunciation as I said it.

399
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,900
 He wrote this manga called Uzaki-chan wants to hang out.

400
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,020
 What it's about, it's about these two college kids.

401
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,180
 One of them is kind of a loner, just kind of wants to go through the motions and get

402
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,100
 through school, whatever.

403
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,540
 Then there's this girl named Hana Uzaki.

404
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,820
 She's always trying to get him to do stuff and she's super annoying.

405
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,340
 The set of it is, will they won't?

406
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,300
 Will he eventually fall for her?

407
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,060
 Does she really have feelings for him?

408
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,420
 It's kind of like a soap opera type thing.

409
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:25,740
 Hana Uzaki, her character other than being annoying and vivacious and just a glimmer

410
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,980
 of light, a glimmer of hope in this poor dude's life.

411
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,020
 She also has size J boobs.

412
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,160
 She has these giant boobs and she's just living her best life.

413
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,140
 With giant boobs and what I'm assuming crippling back pain as well.

414
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,380
 She's running around, they're going on these adventures.

415
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,620
 It's more like a slice of life manga, right?

416
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,100
 It's not like they're fighting Dr. Doom or anything like that.

417
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,060
 Anyways, so back in 2019, they've done this before.

418
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:58,380
 The Japanese Red Cross will team up with manga creators and anime creators to have them draw

419
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,180
 stuff.

420
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,620
 Basically like a little poster, right?

421
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,900
 You donate blood, you get a poster.

422
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,620
 They've done this before and this particular time they got ahold of Taki and they said,

423
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,460
 "Hey, Uzaki-chan wants to hang out.

424
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,580
 Do you want to do something for the Japanese Red Cross?"

425
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,700
 He jumped at it.

426
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,140
 He said, "Absolutely."

427
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,020
 And this is so interesting.

428
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:27,900
 Back in 1995, the author was seriously injured during the great Hanshin earthquake of 1995,

429
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,100
 which we all know was caused by magical princess Minky Momo.

430
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,340
 Put that episode in the show notes.

431
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:38,740
 But he was really badly injured in this earthquake and he survived because of blood donations.

432
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,420
 He survived because the Japanese Red Cross had enough blood of the type that he needed.

433
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,180
 And so he has always loved supporting the Japanese Red Cross and supporting blood donation

434
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,580
 drives and stuff like that.

435
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,300
 So when they approached him, he goes, "Yeah, totally."

436
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,020
 He might have even approached them at this point, but they were totally ready to do this.

437
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,140
 So the file for this one and these posters were kind of posted around town apparently

438
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,900
 too, was a picture of Hana Uzaki.

439
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,060
 She's wearing this really tight black shirt.

440
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,380
 Her clothes are normally pretty tight.

441
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,900
 She's wearing this normal, like this button-up black shirt, but it's pretty tight.

442
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,820
 She's holding, this is probably a cultural thing, she's holding a tray of fruits and

443
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,780
 veggies.

444
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,260
 And then she's yelling.

445
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,860
 It looks like she's screaming at you, but she's saying, "Sanpai, have you not donated

446
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
 blood yet?

447
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,700
 Are you perhaps scared of needles?"

448
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
 That's the whole thing, right?

449
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,060
 It was just this image and on the back was her and the dude pretending to be spies or

450
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,500
 something like that.

451
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,860
 You had this.

452
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,180
 What the conspiracy theory is about this, that's all true, all that stuff really happened,

453
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,700
 is that they specifically chose this character, this bust, even though she's not like super

454
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
 sexualized.

455
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,420
 The comic book is apparently PGPG13.

456
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,140
 She's not like, it's not a nude one, right?

457
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,300
 But the reason why they chose Hana Uzaki is they were specifically targeting males to

458
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,300
 donate blood in Japan because you, the conspiracy theory goes that less women were donating

459
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,020
 blood and the Japanese Red Cross goes, "If we can't get more women to donate blood, let's

460
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,420
 get more men to donate blood."

461
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,700
 So we're going to use this woman, this busty woman, and we're going to get more guys in

462
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,100
 here.

463
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,660
 Now that's where conspiracy theory comes from because obviously we don't know what they

464
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
 were thinking.

465
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
 We don't know if that was their master plan.

466
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,060
 We can look at the statistics and she's now raised by wolves.

467
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,380
 Send me some of these statistics.

468
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,940
 Thank you very much for this.

469
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:43,700
 We look at in 2020, you had 1.5 million women donating blood and 3.6 million men donated

470
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
 blood that year.

471
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,900
 So by the net, this started in 2019, we see in 2020 that there is a huge difference in

472
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
 most countries.

473
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
 It's 50/50.

474
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,820
 50% men, 50% women.

475
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,020
 There's a few countries where a lot more men than women like Greece and parts of Italy

476
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,180
 as well.

477
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,100
 It's like 60/30 difference, but generally it's 50/50.

478
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,900
 So you are seeing a huge increase of men donating blood.

479
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,260
 I couldn't find the statistics for 2019.

480
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
 Neither could they.

481
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,580
 We couldn't get them.

482
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,660
 But we do have a rise there.

483
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,500
 So did they plan for this?

484
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,220
 Did they say, "Listen, not enough money?"

485
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,340
 And we can't see statistics from 2014 to 2020.

486
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,980
 There was a dip in blood donations.

487
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,940
 We can actually look at dropping pretty regularly until 2019 and then it started to rise again.

488
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,460
 So we did see that.

489
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,700
 Now people may have been donating more blood for all sorts of reasons, but we definitely

490
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,500
 have these coincidences, you could say.

491
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,860
 So did they plan that?

492
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,940
 Did the Japanese, Red Cross go, "We need to make up for the females not donating, so

493
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,860
 let's get more males to donate blood?"

494
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,540
 And then there was even a more interesting spin on that conspiracy theory.

495
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,420
 It wasn't that they just wanted more men to donate blood.

496
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,980
 They wanted nerds to donate blood.

497
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,700
 They wanted the otaku to donate blood because, and this is pretty common, right?

498
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,620
 I think it's the same thing in America.

499
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:14,620
 To be a blood donor, you have to have not had sex with a new partner within the past

500
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,100
 six months.

501
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,100
 So if you're married, you're with the same person forever, it doesn't matter.

502
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,260
 If you haven't had sex in six months, it doesn't matter.

503
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,420
 But if you're out Tomcatting around Tokyo, banging women at bars and stuff like that,

504
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,580
 you can't donate blood.

505
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,460
 So they specifically targeted guys who weren't getting laid very often, right?

506
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,140
 That's the conspiracy theory because if they just marketed to men in general, you'd get

507
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,420
 guys walking in and being like, "Yo, I just had sex with one of your nurses in the back

508
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,940
 room, don't know her name, but it's time to give blood."

509
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,180
 They're like, "Sir, you can't do that also.

510
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,220
 You should probably get yourself checked out.

511
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,780
 She's full of disease.

512
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,900
 We won't let her donate either."

513
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,300
 They wanted specifically men who weren't sexually active.

514
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,140
 So they took a character from like a romance manga.

515
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,740
 Again, it was not like a horny, X-rated one, right?

516
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,140
 It's almost like a soap opera for guys manga.

517
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,100
 You're getting these guys coming in and they're walking away with this little picture of Hana

518
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
 Uzaki.

519
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,620
 It's an interesting conspiracy theory.

520
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,820
 And again, the events are real.

521
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,500
 The conspiracy theory comes down to when they were coming up with this decision in the office,

522
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,140
 because that what was going on, they go, "We need to boost the levels of nerd blood in

523
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,300
 our system."

524
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,180
 How do we do that?

525
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,180
 This is what this is.

526
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:38,340
 The plan they came up with, they get a busty girl from a popular Japanese manga soap opera

527
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,100
 slice of life type comic book.

528
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,780
 And there you go.

529
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:49,740
 And actually after this first campaign in 2019, it was so popular, they ended up doing

530
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,060
 an anime of this.

531
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,340
 Two people walking around in college.

532
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,140
 I guess it's a cartoon where people were like, "Did you study for your test?"

533
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
 And he's like, "No."

534
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
 And she's like, "You should."

535
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,660
 I put the cliffhanger to that.

536
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,900
 I mean, I guess people watch soap operas in real life.

537
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,540
 I watch lifetime movies all the time.

538
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,140
 I mean, I guess I can't criticize it.

539
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,620
 But I mean, if you have the ability to animate anything, I mean, literally you can draw anything

540
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,620
 you could possibly think of.

541
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,900
 People walking around a college setting.

542
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,420
 I know it's popular.

543
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,620
 I know slice of life anime is super popular.

544
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,300
 I'm just like, can't they at least punch each other or slice people up with swords and stuff

545
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
 like that?

546
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
 I guess not.

547
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,180
 Because that's illegal and unrealistic.

548
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,460
 And this is supposed to be a realistic cartoon comic.

549
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
 People love it.

550
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,540
 But anyways, fascinating conspiracy theory and one that we won't know.

551
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,540
 And it's so mundane, right?

552
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,060
 It doesn't affect anyone's life.

553
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,700
 There's some guy who only had one gallon left of blood in him and he's super horny.

554
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,140
 He's like, "Oh, I really want that picture of that girl to take some more of my blood."

555
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,020
 It doesn't really affect anyone.

556
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,500
 And these are the conspiracy theories that I think are super likely, right?

557
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,620
 But I want to segue into something else.

558
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,340
 Because what you have, like let's step back from it.

559
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:03,580
 It's kind of a fun story about, I mean, it may not be a conspiracy theory at all, right?

560
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,740
 Or it could be them going, "We need more nerd blood.

561
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,060
 Let's do this tactic."

562
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:15,700
 But it could be more sinister because at the end of the day, what's going on and why they're

563
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,020
 doing it, they're saving lives.

564
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,020
 It involves people's health.

565
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
 So they're blood.

566
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,860
 You kind of manipulate people to give your blood to get this little picture of this girl.

567
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,020
 But you have a bunch of blood.

568
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,780
 Blood replenishes itself pretty quickly.

569
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:35,100
 So I spent about five weeks in California with my mom recently during the summer.

570
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,980
 And I bought her this thing for a year called Friendly.

571
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,620
 Friendly TV.

572
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,380
 It's basically, this isn't an ad, but I love the service.

573
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,620
 You know, nowadays you either pay $100 for your cable package or you have all these streaming

574
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,180
 channels that don't show what you want anymore.

575
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,180
 Friendly has this thing.

576
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,180
 I think it was like $70 for a year.

577
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,620
 And it gave you like 32 channels of television.

578
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,300
 And some of them were like, "You'll get local news and stuff like that."

579
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,780
 Because my mom watches local news.

580
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,340
 But then it has like a Hallmark channel and it has Vice.

581
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,660
 I was watching Vice and stuff down there.

582
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,500
 I was watching a ton of Lifetime channel movies.

583
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,020
 I watch Lifetime, I call it pretty girl television.

584
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,460
 Lifetime channel, I go watch it seriously all day long.

585
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,500
 It's one of my vices.

586
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 Jessica Morris.

587
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,380
 Oh my goodness, she's a goddess.

588
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,660
 But anyways, you sit there and you're watching this television.

589
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,620
 Now it's streaming, but it plays like regular television.

590
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,260
 It has advertising.

591
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,540
 And I'm sitting there and we're watching it, watching, you know, stalked by my cheerleaders

592
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,180
 coach or whatever.

593
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,420
 And then it cuts to the commercial break.

594
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,660
 I'm like, "Oh no, are they going to get away from the cheerleader coach?"

595
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,140
 You would watch the commercial and it would be like normal commercials.

596
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,700
 So we would see commercials for like local restaurants, right?

597
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,100
 You know, like chilies or whatever.

598
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,620
 Stuff they want to show commercials for up here.

599
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,620
 For example, where I live.

600
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,700
 And there's no chilies, unfortunately.

601
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,220
 We're seeing these local commercials.

602
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,620
 We're seeing these national commercials for like, well, chilies is national, but you

603
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,620
 know what I mean?

604
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
 Like regional restaurants.

605
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,140
 Then they have like Charmin commercials and stuff like that.

606
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
 It wasn't like YouTube commercials.

607
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,580
 It wasn't like commercials that are a total waste of my time for like politicians I don't

608
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,100
 even know the name for, whatever.

609
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,220
 Well, I guess that's what's with advertising because I don't know their names.

610
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,220
 You know, YouTube advertising is so shotgun, right?

611
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,540
 It never seems to really apply to you yet.

612
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,860
 That's kind of what I'm getting to here.

613
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:37,340
 Watching this friendly television and then what I saw down there was so interesting because

614
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,940
 I don't know where friendly is getting these ads.

615
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,500
 I don't know if we're actually watching the ad package for the Lifetime Moving Network.

616
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,980
 Like had I gone to my brother's house, he does pay $100 a month for cable and all those

617
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,100
 streaming services and everything.

618
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,820
 I don't know if I was watching Lifetime Moving Network at his house at the same time, we would

619
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,260
 see the same commercials, right?

620
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,540
 We may.

621
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,180
 We may be watching basically the cable equivalent of Lifetime or we may be watching an internet

622
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,500
 streaming version of it.

623
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,300
 So the ads are changing.

624
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,620
 I don't have the answer to that, but what I do know is as we're sitting there watching,

625
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:24,780
 I saw more commercials for Crohn's disease.

626
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,260
 Like medications for Crohn's disease than I've ever seen.

627
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:35,540
 Now my mother suffers from Crohn's disease.

628
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,140
 And it took like maybe 10 or, you know, commercials you don't even really pick out at first unless

629
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,460
 they're really funny or super weird.

630
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,620
 It wasn't until like three or four days watching Lifetime Moving Network that I realized, why

631
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,500
 are they showing all these commercials for Crohn's medication?

632
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,460
 What are all these popping up for?

633
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,700
 And I started to think about it and I go, if this is internet based, obviously we're

634
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,900
 on my mom's wifi.

635
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,220
 I've been researching Crohn's medicine for her trying to find stuff.

636
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,020
 She's doing really, she's doing good, right?

637
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,180
 But it's like $1200 a month for her medicine.

638
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,220
 I'm like looking for alternatives and stuff like that.

639
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,020
 I'm like, here, just eat these hay seeds and drink thistle milk and that won't work, but

640
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
 it sure is yummy.

641
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,660
 You know, I'm trying to look for alternatives.

642
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,660
 She's totally fine.

643
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,540
 She doesn't have any complications from it or anything.

644
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,380
 But I started to think, what if this is internet?

645
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,500
 Like what if it's because we're talking about it and all the microphones in the house are

646
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
 picking it up, right?

647
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,180
 Everything's smart, even if you don't know it.

648
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,580
 And that's why we're getting those commercials.

649
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,100
 Is it possible because I'm doing these Google searches that it's showing those commercials?

650
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:44,620
 YouTube will do stuff like that from time to time because of the videos I watch on YouTube.

651
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,460
 Every so often YouTube will start showing me ads.

652
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,460
 This is not a joke.

653
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,860
 I might have even talked about it before.

654
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,740
 They'll start showing me ads for schizophrenia magic medication.

655
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,500
 That's one every cent true.

656
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
 And I'm sure you guys have gotten them too.

657
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,260
 It's those real creepy videos.

658
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
 Those really creepy ads.

659
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,020
 They're like, I was in Washington DC when the hallucinations began again and it's all

660
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,900
 in these black and white charcoal drawings.

661
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,540
 I'll see if I can find one to put it in the show notes.

662
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,300
 They're actually like really kind of cool, creepy ads.

663
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,700
 But if I'm watching enough stuff, you type in Alex Jones, you're going to start getting

664
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,940
 those schizophrenia ads.

665
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,860
 I think it could be something like that, right?

666
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,940
 It could be something that we're simply talking about on the internet is go, oh, they're looking

667
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,940
 into this?

668
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,820
 Well, let's give them this medication that's just been invented and barely tested on anyone.

669
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,180
 But then I thought, interesting, right?

670
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,180
 I thought that was interesting.

671
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,180
 I thought this Hana Uzuki story was interesting.

672
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,100
 And then I wanted to peanut butter and jelly it together and we're going to wrap it up

673
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:52,420
 with this conspiracy theory because what I predict is going to happen.

674
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,780
 My mom has Crohn's.

675
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,420
 She's had it for decades, right?

676
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,780
 And they're talking about this medication.

677
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:05,300
 I predict that eventually we will begin to see ads for diseases.

678
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,060
 We don't even know we have picture this picture.

679
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,420
 This is weird and it's 100% believable.

680
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,780
 Based on your internet history, I think you could predict future health problems based

681
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,540
 and remember, it's not only that.

682
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,180
 It's not just what you're typing into Google.

683
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,780
 It's everything you're saying around any electronic device.

684
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,220
 I hang out at Sabine's house once a week, maybe.

685
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,180
 It's far less than that lately.

686
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,340
 Most of the time we're hanging out in my place.

687
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:43,980
 When I'm at my place and I start Googling stuff, she starts getting ads for it.

688
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
 She'll get ads.

689
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,420
 She'll wake up one morning and she'll check the news and it'll be ads for none checks.

690
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:55,820
 It's constantly weapons and then they'll stop for a while.

691
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
 And then she'll start seeing it.

692
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,300
 She goes, "Jason, are you planning on buying a gun?"

693
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,060
 Because I started getting all of these ads for holsters and stuff like that.

694
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,620
 I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I've been thinking about it."

695
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,620
 It's kind of coming to that point where it's almost irresponsible for me not to have a

696
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
 gun.

697
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,260
 I don't think anyone else would agree with that statement.

698
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:21,740
 So you're sitting around, you're talking to a friend about how your stomach hurts, right?

699
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,260
 Maybe you're playing a game and you're on your headset and you're talking about your

700
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,380
 stomach's not feeling good and you've noticed you started to have a little bit of pain in

701
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,460
 your joints.

702
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,900
 And the AI is picking all of that stuff up.

703
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,620
 And I predict eventually by the time you realize that you have, let's just say, type

704
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,540
 two diabetes.

705
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:45,580
 You've been seeing ads for it a month or two before you even realize it.

706
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,460
 It will start to detect your symptoms by what you talk about.

707
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,340
 Because one of the first things I do when I get sick is I Google it.

708
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,180
 Is this normal?

709
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
 I didn't tell you guys.

710
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
 I got Lyme disease.

711
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
 I didn't tell you guys that.

712
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,980
 I got Lyme disease over the summer and I Googled like, "I have a circle on my arm.

713
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,300
 I have a rash.

714
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,460
 That's a perfect circle.

715
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,300
 I watched it appear over the course of one day with a little dot in the middle of it.

716
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,380
 And I started getting pain in my knee and pain in my left foot.

717
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,380
 And I went to the doctor and I had to go on a bunch of antibiotics to clear it up.

718
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,820
 But yeah, that's the first thing I do, right?

719
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,140
 And so people are going to be typing this stuff.

720
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,580
 Why does my stomach hurt?

721
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,220
 Why does my heart beat fast when I wake up?

722
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,700
 Like all of these ailments we type in, we type in, we look at WebMD, we go, "Oh, it's

723
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,700
 nothing."

724
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,860
 Or it could be one of these 10 things, but that's super obscure.

725
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
 I don't think it's anything like that.

726
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
 We go about our lives.

727
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,820
 The AI remembers that, right?

728
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,220
 And when I'm saying AI, I'm not talking specifically about Skynet.

729
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,820
 I guess just the algorithm.

730
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,820
 That's a better term right now.

731
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,980
 The algorithm remembers that.

732
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,980
 And it stores all that.

733
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,100
 And you're putting in all of your symptoms over the course of six months to a year.

734
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,460
 The algorithm will figure out, "Oh, this guy is going to have gastrointestinal bleeding

735
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,700
 in the next year.

736
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,340
 So let's start advertising."

737
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,140
 And you're going to see ads for things.

738
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,540
 You're like, "Well, that's kind of weird.

739
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,140
 Like, I don't have that."

740
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,340
 Now you're super paranoid about all those ads you see for toenail fungus because we

741
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,500
 all get them, right?

742
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,460
 I have the best feet in the world.

743
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,180
 They are hobbit feet and I have those toes that can pick up pencils and stuff like that.

744
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,660
 Quarters, I can pick up stuff with my feet.

745
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,180
 But we all get the gross ads because it makes us look at them.

746
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,340
 But what if those ads stop being like these gross shocking ads that we click on because

747
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,740
 we want to see some gross photos?

748
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,180
 And you look in here, "I don't have that.

749
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,060
 I don't have an underactive thyroid."

750
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,420
 But you do, you just haven't been diagnosed for it yet.

751
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,820
 Based on all of your symptoms.

752
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,820
 I mean, think about it.

753
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,140
 It could even tell the fact that you're like waking up late at night and going online.

754
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,420
 It could, the algorithm could register doesn't sleep all the way through the night.

755
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,820
 Restless sleep, fitful sleep.

756
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,940
 It's putting all this stuff in and it's diagnosed.

757
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,300
 I'm telling you, if this doesn't exist now, it will.

758
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,700
 You will be marketed cures for diseases you don't even know you have.

759
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,300
 And that is interesting and potentially life saving, right?

760
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,540
 You're being marketed drugs.

761
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,980
 So the second that you start to have that and the doctor says, "Hey, I think that you

762
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,260
 have this problem."

763
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
 You could be like, "That's so weird.

764
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,780
 I haven't seen ads for that."

765
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,540
 And you kind of have maybe a little bit more information to go off of.

766
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
 Maybe.

767
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,660
 In a good way, the algorithm storing this information and pre-diagnosing you, because

768
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,180
 so many of our illnesses, you can tell you're going to get them.

769
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,860
 Not all of them, obviously, right?

770
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,140
 There are a lot of illnesses like you can fit a genetic factor for depression.

771
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,140
 You can fit a genetic factor for Crohn's, right?

772
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:46,180
 You can have these things and they go, "You have a high chance of getting Crohn's or

773
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,500
 having Crohn's already.

774
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
 You just don't know it.

775
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
 IBS."

776
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
 All this stuff.

777
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,900
 But then also we have to look at the dark side of the algorithm because this could work

778
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,380
 both ways, right?

779
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:02,060
 It could pre-diagnose you and then it could misdiagnose you on purpose.

780
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,060
 The algorithm could look at you and say, "Just like we could go back to this conspiracy

781
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,300
 theory, the nerds, we need blood.

782
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,700
 They can't have had sex with a new person in six months.

783
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,140
 We're going to target them specifically.

784
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,100
 What if the algorithm and some shady people, medical companies behind the scenes, right?

785
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,580
 They go, "We need to boost the profits of drug X.

786
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,980
 We need to get more people to take this drug to meet our quarterly goals."

787
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,580
 They can use the algorithm to look for people who fit that type.

788
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:41,380
 Not that they necessarily have the disease, but that they could.

789
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:47,580
 They find single men who are 46 years old, who are overweight, who spend a lot of time

790
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,540
 in a haunted closet.

791
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,700
 They pump all this stuff in and they start marketing me for drugs because they know what

792
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
 my symptoms are, right?

793
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,700
 They can go, "That's interesting."

794
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,860
 He said recently that his stomach hurt.

795
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,860
 We picked it up on the mic.

796
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,140
 The algorithm says this guy is 45 years old, 46 in what, two weeks?

797
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,860
 My birthday is coming up.

798
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,220
 There's this about him, this about him.

799
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,300
 He wakes up in the middle of the night.

800
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,780
 He only gets like five hours of sleep a day, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

801
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
 blah, blah, blah, blah.

802
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,580
 We have all of this stuff about him and we know that this drug, because they're specifically

803
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,020
 looking for people that this drug will work for, they go, "Let's start marketing him this

804
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,020
 drug."

805
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,020
 It won't hurt him.

806
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,020
 Maybe.

807
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,020
 I don't know.

808
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,020
 It won't help him.

809
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,020
 He doesn't have the disease, but if we start trying to convince him, "Hey, if you

810
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,540
 have a stomach ache, you can't sleep all night and sometimes you find yourself in a haunted

811
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:36,820
 closet, take this pill."

812
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,940
 You start seeing this ad and you're like, "Well, that is weird.

813
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,460
 I do always wake up in the middle of the night and I do often have a sour stomach and I do

814
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,460
 often."

815
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,620
 How about these other things?

816
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,100
 You start looking in with medication.

817
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,100
 You don't need.

818
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,980
 The algorithm is selling you a product.

819
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,180
 They're misdiagnosing you on purpose.

820
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,500
 I predict both of those things will happen and it will be something no one will be aware

821
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
 of.

822
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,580
 It'll be a conspiracy theory in a boardroom somewhere and they'll just be, because they

823
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,580
 just harvest this information, whether it's for a political campaign or a marketing campaign,

824
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:14,580
 the people just sell it and we willingly give it out every time we talk in front of a smart

825
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,780
 device, be it a phone, a watch, a computer, a fridge.

826
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,820
 They take all that.

827
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,940
 They can pre-diagnose you and possibly save a lot of lives by making money still, right?

828
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,180
 They're not doing it out of the kind of center of their heart.

829
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,500
 They're making money or they can misdiagnose you on purpose to make money and maybe risk

830
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
 lives.

831
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,340
 But one or I predict both of those things will happen.

832
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,860
 If they're not happening now, they'll start happening within the next couple of years and

833
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,740
 we won't know about it until years after that when it's exposed.

834
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:49,220
 By the time it's exposed, there will already be a new trick they're working on.

835
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:57,420

 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

839
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,620
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

840
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,620
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

841
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,620
 Have a great week guys.

842
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:21,620
 Bye.

843
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,200
 (upbeat music)
