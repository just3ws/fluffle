00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 What happens when a group of police officers try to take on a group of fur smugglers, but these fur smugglers are from another planet?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we travel to a haunted hospital. Is there any truth to the ghost stories surrounding this hospital?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And more importantly, is this ghost powerful enough to kill children?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. If you guys listened to yesterday's episode, it was pretty depressing.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 This episode, obviously I'm talking about a ghost possibly killing babies. Still depressing.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I've been looking over the notes for what I'm doing for the rest of the week.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It seems to be a pretty depressing week, but before any of you guys ask, I'm doing fine.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Just sometimes the stories that get selected, it's weird.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Who would have thought a true crime and paranormal podcast would ever be depressing?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But someone who never depresses us, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now with a huge smile on his face,

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, Steven Burrows.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Woo yeah, come on in. He's burrowing on into Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I'm sure he's never heard that joke before. He pops out like a little gopher.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Steven, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 If you guys cancel for the Patreon, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 That really, really helps out a lot. Now, Steven, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're headed all the way out to South America.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 [Distorted sound]

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 This is a really interesting story because I got this from a website called Inesplitcota.blogspot.com.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 They handle a lot of UFO stories in Mexico and Central America and South America.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And even they, when they were writing about this, they go, listen, we don't have a date or a time for any of this stuff.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We had a hard time even finding this place on a map.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 They go, this story does seem quite outlandish.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We don't have a date. We don't have a location.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Well, the story supposedly takes place in a location called, a ravine called Cuebrada de la Bandurias.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 But they said there's actually two or more places with that name.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 They tried locating this on a map.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So somewhere in the border region is where this story takes place.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And what happens is there are five mounted police officers riding through the area.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 [Distorted sound]

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Like little cowboy cops and stuff like that.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Right in their horses, they're like petting their horses, feeding their horses apples.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 [Distorted sound]

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Just a fun day.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I don't think these guys are on picnic. They're on patrol.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 These police officers weren't like, you know, it's such a sunny day. Let's take our horses down and walk through the gorge.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 They're actually patrolling the area and they come across something that they describe as a silvery house just sitting there in the canyon.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 In the lieutenant who's leading this patrol/tenny bear picnic, he puts his hand up and he goes, "Stop, guys!"

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I bet you that is where there's a bunch of fur smugglers, because we know there are fur smugglers in the area.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And we know fur smugglers love bling.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 So they probably spent all their fur money building a silver house.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 That's probably them. So guys, fan out. Make your horses all super quiet and stuff.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So they put like big mittens on the horseshoes.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So they're like...

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 They don't even hear these horses sneaking up on them.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And these police officers are able to fan out and they're kind of surrounding this silvery house.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And I don't know if this is proper police procedure. I doubt it.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I'm sure there's a hundred different ways they could have handled this situation, but they've surrounded the silver house and the lieutenant's like,

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 "Hey, Jones, over there. You're over there behind your bush.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Somehow there's a bush big enough to hide a man on a horse."

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Flush them out, boys. And Jones picks up a rock and throws it at the house.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Which I mean, it is effective, right?

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 It wouldn't make you come out of the house if all of a sudden you were just sitting at home and a rock hit your house.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 You would wonder what caused it.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 There's probably like other ways to do that, because if you were a criminal in the middle of nowhere and a rock hit your house,

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 you're going to not just check, you're going to bring your guns with you.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And that's what happens. The Jones throws a rock at the house, BONG.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And then the occupants of the house come out of the house and they take up defensive positions behind rocks and other shrubs and things like that.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And that's when the lieutenant, again, I don't know if this is normal police procedure, but when people walk out of a house,

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I don't think this is what you're supposed to do. They haven't committed any crimes, right?

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Basically, all that's happened now is someone threw a rock, a police officer threw a rock at his house and then everyone in the house left.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 They came out and they were scared so they hit me on the rock.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 The lieutenant orders his officers open fire.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 [Poof, poof, poof, poof]

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And these dudes are getting shot at from all angles.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 The story doesn't describe what the dudes look like.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 It just says that the occupants of the house spilled out.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I think the implication one, it's being covered on a UFO website and the silvery house, right?

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 You're thinking, you know, maybe that's like one way to describe a landed UFO.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 But these people aren't described as reptilians or greys or anything like that.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So why do we think they're alien?

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Well, I mean, they could be human first smugglers, but the heat they're packing is a little out of this world.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So you have the police shooting at these dudes who just walked out of their house, you threw a rock out of the house and they walked out.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And what happens is beams of light start to shoot from the quote-unquote "first smugglers" positions.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So you have these guys hiding behind rocks and while bullets are flying at them, all of a sudden [makes noise]

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 there are these bright, super bright, multi-colored beams shooting out from behind the cover.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And maybe you figure someone's just trying to shine a flashlight in your face.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 You're playing that old game, gun versus flashlight, you figure maybe someone's just shooting flashlights at you or what.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But all of a sudden, one of these beams of light that were just kind of flying by randomly shines on one of the police officer's horses.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And the horse split open from the inside out.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 [makes noise]

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 They said they described it as watching a horse turn into a cauliflower.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Just completely open up and just get shredded from the inside out.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And the horses were obviously so big that was the easiest target and they see one of these horses just [makes noise]

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 go everywhere. And before anyone can really react to this, one of the beams hits one of the officers in the chest.

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 No! [makes noise]

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And he also billows out. All of his internal organs just kind of get sucked out of his body and get shredded up.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And he begins to just tear open. His flesh and his muscle begin to just get shredded after getting struck by this beam of light.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And he falls down dead.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 At this point, the lieutenant realizes these guys probably aren't first smugglers.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And even if they are first smugglers, the cops are completely outgunned.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So he orders a retreat. Let's get out of here, guys. Come on, come on.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And they're riding away. I guess one guy doesn't have a horse. He's like having to ride on the back of someone else's horse.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And they left that officer there. They couldn't get him.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 The police officers make it back to the station and they're like, "Dude, you guys won't believe what happened."

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 "We are out having a picnic. I mean, we are out on patrol."

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 "We weren't having that picnic. Like, we were warned about three times. One more picnic and we were going to be fired, chief."

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 "We weren't having a picnic."

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And you'll notice that we're missing a horse and an officer. They both got hit by a cauliflower gun.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 He actually called it that. The chief's like, "Oh, that makes me hungry."

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 "Time for a picnic."

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And they go, "Yeah, this guy got shot by the beam and he split open from the inside out."

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So they go back about two days later. They get a larger contingent of troops.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And they go back down to the canyon.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And when they get there, there's nothing there. There's nothing visible.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And so the chief goes, "Are you sure this is a location, Lieutenant?"

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's like, "Yeah, right down there is where the Silver House was."

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 So they get even closer. They don't find the Silver House.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 They don't find any of the occupants.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 They don't even find the bodies of the fallen police officer or the horse.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 But the ground is still soaked with the blood of these two fallen comrades.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 This clearly was the spot where the battle took place.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 But other than thick horse blood soaking into the soil,

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 there was no proof that this encounter ever happened.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 It's a fascinating story. The website NXsplitcutta.blogspot.com

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 got it from an author named Jorge Onfrunes, or Researcher Jorge Onfrunes.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And they were a little skeptical of it, but they weren't skeptical of it because of the details.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 They just said, "We don't have a date. We don't have a time. We don't even really have a location.

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 We wish we could research this a little bit more."

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 What's interesting is that when you look at the article, Jorge is very cagey about giving any of this information up.

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 He says it either took place in the Chilean border or the Peruvian border or the Bolivian border.

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And then he goes, "But I really don't want to tell you either way."

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And it's interesting for a UFO researcher to be that cagey.

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 But again, sometimes they may have gotten the story from someone who doesn't want that information revealed

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 and they have to obfuscate a detail a little bit.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Fascinating story, though. One, it could be totally made up. Fine.

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 But other than that, these are either humans versus an alien force,

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 which you've covered multiple times on this show.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And it's interesting because sometimes the aliens just get completely annihilated by a couple of farmers with shotguns.

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And then other times we have KGB troops laying siege to an alien-controlled island and the battle is far more balanced

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 in that you have military versus grays and they're just killing them.

134
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I'll put that episode in the show notes. I really like that story.

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 But you can never predict this.

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Like, whenever we start one of these stories where the humans are fighting aliens,

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 it's hard to tell who's going to win. We've seen it happen both ways.

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 In this situation, the aliens clearly won.

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 They inflicted more casualties. They caused the police to evacuate.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But what's also interesting about this story is there is nothing in it that says that they are aliens other than their weaponry.

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 This easily could have been humans with experimental guns.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So it could have been humans, right? It could have been humans with this technology that we can only describe

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 or only makes us think of aliens because we don't have any raygun technology that splits people open like that.

144
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 You could argue that we have lasers on like battleships and things like that could shoot down missiles.

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 You definitely can't hold them in your hand.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 There's no really even description of the weapon.

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 It's just they just saw these beams emitting from where these people were standing.

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It was just decimating the troops.

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 A fascinating story. Was it humans with some advanced technology?

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Was it some sort of black operation run by the US government or by some sort of corporation?

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I think about that. But what were they doing out in the middle of nowhere?

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I mean, were they testing the weapons on trees? Why would they have been there?

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Was it a listening post?

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 It's actually easier to think of it as being aliens because aliens like to be in the middle of nowhere doing stuff.

155
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Black operations when you're talking about KGB, CIA, stuff like that are nowadays grew with Russia.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 You have these organizations, Mossad from Israel.

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 They like to be kind of not discoverable. They definitely don't walk around with a big shirt saying, "I'm from Mossad. Where are you from?"

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 But you also don't run it in like the desert, right?

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 You don't have many spying opportunities if you're in Death Valley.

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 So they would want to be around population centers unless this was some sort of listening post or something like that.

161
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It just fascinating was or maybe it was just fur smugglers who somehow traded enough fur that they were able to invest their money in their laser technology.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 That all fur traders secretly want.

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 We don't know. Humans with laser guns, aliens with laser guns? Who knows?

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And again, that just adds an other layer of mystery to it.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I think I would be more leery of a human with a laser gun just because I know how despicable some humans can be.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I mean, okay, let's be fair. I don't want to be shot with a laser gun by either of them.

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But yeah, if a human's out in the middle of nowhere with a laser gun, he is up to no good.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I will go on the record as saying that.

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And if you're currently in the middle of nowhere in your hermit, Jack and you're building your laser gun and you're listening to this podcast, you're like, "Aww, he doesn't like me. I like you."

170
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 If you currently have a laser gun, you're my best friend.

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I was talking about someone else. I was talking about another hermit with a laser gun.

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Fascinating story. Again, what happens when humans come in contact with aliens? We don't know.

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 There's so many different ways these stories can play out.

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 This one ended with a horse and a cop being turned into cauliflower.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Steven, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter. We're leaving behind this border region.

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 We're flying all the way out to a haunted hospital.

177
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 [imitates car engine]

178
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I came across this story recently online. It's from a guy named RavagerTrade. We're going to call him Terry.

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But he was talking about his time working at a hospital.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And he said while he was there, he was told, "Never go to the fifth floor of this hospital."

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 He's like, "Why not?" And they go, "Well, you know, you just shouldn't go up there. Don't go there."

182
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So he doesn't, but he still wonders why he shouldn't go to the fifth floor.

183
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Eventually, he's able to piece together this story.

184
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It's haunted. And it's so haunted we actually don't use that floor of the hospital anymore.

185
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Which is weird, right? I think if you built during COVID when rooms were getting filled up and stuff like that,

186
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 people are like, "Do you have a place I can go?" And they're like, "No."

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They're like, "No, this is a five-story hospital. Don't you have rooms on the fifth floor?"

188
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 They're like, "No, sorry, it's haunted. As you're dying, you're like, "Oh, no, I'm a ghost. No!"

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 You still never go to the fifth floor. They abandoned it.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Not only was it haunted, but what happened was a while ago, a fire gutted the floor.

191
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 It totally ruined that part of the hospital.

192
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And this fire ripped through the fifth floor and it killed a bunch of patients who were non-ambulatory.

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 They weren't able to move, so you probably had people in a full-body cast, and they're like,

194
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 "Oh man, my cast is coming off tomorrow. I can't wait to go out and play rugby.

195
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 That's how I got all these injuries, but I love it so much." And then he sees the fire like knocking on the door.

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 "Can I come in?" "No!"

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 That was kind of grim. That was kind of disturbing, but anyways, it's dark and disturbing week.

198
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 You didn't know that? A bunch of people who couldn't move were burned to death.

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And so Terry, he just never went up to the fifth floor. It wasn't in use.

200
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I don't think it had been burned out for like 20 years.

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I think this was relatively recent, because again, most hospitals, you would just have to eventually repair the fifth floor.

202
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 But he's not going up there.

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And he has a co-worker who he says, listen, this co-worker is one of the toughest guys I'd ever known.

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 He was this ex-army veteran. One day we're at the hospital and this dude, this army vet,

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 his ears kind of perk up like he hears something and he gets up and he runs out of the room.

206
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And a while later, he comes back down to where we're all at.

207
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And his pale is a ghost.

208
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 He's not a ghost. He's not a ghost himself. He didn't have little Casper legs. He wasn't floating around.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 His pale is a ghost and he was super quiet and he just kind of sat there and then covered his face with his hands.

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And then like, for a brief moment, just kind of sobbed a bit.

211
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And then got up and left and took a month off work.

212
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And later on, Terry said that he heard what had happened was this army veteran guy had heard someone screaming.

213
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It sounded like a woman was screaming on the fifth floor of the hospital.

214
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And he ran up there to see what was going on, because it is abandoned. You know, bad stuff can happen up there.

215
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 He runs upstairs to see what's going on.

216
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And when he's on that fifth floor, he is suddenly hit with a wave of sorrow.

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Like his emotions, his own emotions are just drowned out in this ocean of grief.

218
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And he gets this feeling, he gets this whole thing kind of pushed into his body at once, this whole sensation that there was a woman on the fifth floor who wanted to enter her own life.

219
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 So she started the fire.

220
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And as the fire grew out of control and she began to hear all the panicking chaos that was going on on that floor of the hospital, she realized other people were going to die because of her decision.

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 As the flames were beginning to consume her, she could hear the screams of other people and she realized that she was not only someone who was killing herself, she was a murderer.

222
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And this army veteran just felt that story wash over him.

223
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 But even with all that, right, even with all of that, this floor is burned out, it's been abandoned, you're not supposed to go up there because they're spooky ghosts.

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 People still did go up there regularly to have sex.

225
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Because it was the one place you knew you weren't going to get caught.

226
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 No one was ever up there.

227
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 So you would have like doctors and nurses who are having affairs or medical staff who are having affairs.

228
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I mean, not only doctors and nurses, but you have all these people, they might be cheating on their boyfriends and their wives, they might just be hooking up with other random single people.

229
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Who knows.

230
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 But they would go to the fifth floor, even though you would know about all of these horrible deaths and possible hauntings and psychic sorrow wafting through the air, people are going to have sex.

231
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 People are going to go to weird places to have sex.

232
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 People will go to weird places, they'll go to weird extremes to have sex.

233
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I would not have sex in a haunted hospital.

234
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 To be fair, I wouldn't have sex in a non-haunted hospital. Hospitals are not sexy to me.

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 But they would go up to the fifth floor, even with all of this stuff, all of these stories and all of this emotional psychic baggage attached to this floor.

236
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 People would go up there to have sex.

237
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And what Terry had learned over his time there working in this hospital.

238
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Some of it he had direct contact with.

239
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Some of it he heard these stories from a friend of a friend.

240
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 But every couple that went up to that floor to have sex.

241
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 If they got pregnant, they always had a miscarriage.

242
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 There wasn't a single time that someone went up there to have sex.

243
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And if they got pregnant, carried the baby full term.

244
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Every single child conceived up there died in the womb.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And he goes, "I don't know if that's a coincidence or if something malevolent is still in the air." But it was a pattern that people in the hospital recognized.

246
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And that's really the meat of the story, right?

247
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 It really makes you think, how powerful is the world of the paranormal?

248
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And just like how we have that shootout between the police officers and the aliens in the first story.

249
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Whenever we look at these humans vs. aliens stories, we never really know how it's going to go until we reach the end.

250
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 It's not an always no one conclusion.

251
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Aliens will win all the time, and humans will win all the time.

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And that's the same thing with these type of stories, right?

253
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 When we have normal people's lives collide with the paranormal, you don't know if it's going to be a happy ending or not.

254
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 You would think that the world of the paranormal would always win because it does seem so powerful.

255
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Being able to reach out from beyond the dead, being able to pass through multiple dimensions to come from hell or to come from heaven.

256
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 These creatures that are older than the earth itself.

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 But a lot of times the humans come out on top, or at least the stories that we know, right?

258
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Because when the humans lose, then there's no one to tell the story.

259
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Again, it could just be a coincidence that this is going on, but it could not be.

260
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And when I read this story, it reminded me of another story going on right now.

261
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 At Colonia High School in New Jersey, a hundred former students and staff have come down with an extremely rare brain tumor.

262
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 It's so rare that the fact like one of the guys, he got it and he beat it, and then his sister got it and it killed his sister.

263
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And I think his wife had it.

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And he started looking into it, and it's so rare, but at this one school you had a hundred people come down with this brain tumor.

265
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And the only thing that causes this brain tumor is ionizing radiation.

266
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 It's nothing in the water. It's nothing that you eat. It's not a bad habit you have.

267
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 You have to be exposed to ionized radiation, or ionizing in the process of it, radiation.

268
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And nobody knows why it's striking this particular school.

269
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 They're doing soil samples and stuff like that. Now, this might seem crass, but remember, I'm putting my conspiracy cap on all the time.

270
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I thought, what if...

271
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Just saying, right? I don't know. This might sound super insensitive.

272
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 But what if underneath that school a hundred, two hundred years ago, or more before that anyone was even in the area, there is like a crashed UFO underneath the ground.

273
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Now, it's most likely that... Well, this was interesting. I was going to say it's most likely some sort of contaminant, some sort of pollutant.

274
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 But it's weird that it's only this high school, right? You think some sort of contaminant or pollutant would kind of be in the water system, and you might find some of these brain tumors.

275
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But I'm thinking, like, what if there is something unexplainable underneath the high school, not necessarily a ghost?

276
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 But I remember reading that, and I remember making that connection I go, but that's really like, you're not going to do a whole segment on that, Jason.

277
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 That's actually... You don't want to do that.

278
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But then I saw this other story, and it said, well, maybe this does happen. Maybe these times where we have these unexplainable health events, it could be connected to the world of the paranormal.

279
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 We know about the miscarriages of the hospital because you could put together a sample group over a long enough time.

280
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 We know about these brain tumors at this high school because you could put together a sample group over a long enough time.

281
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Let's say that you have 100 people have this super rare disease and they're spread out all over the United States, and you go, well, you know, sometimes people get this super rare disease, but you were able to trace it back,

282
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 and 90% of those people spent the night at a particular hotel in a town somewhere in Arizona.

283
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And they're all... You were able to tell that they all stayed at the same room. You wouldn't... You wouldn't... You would never think that them staying at a room at a best Western

284
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 would have ever caused them to come down with this bizarre super rare disease.

285
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And you have doctors studying it in different parts of the country, treating their patient.

286
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And it all came down because in 1892, a young woman died of that super rare disease at the site where that hotel is, and her spirit is in so much agony, she's continuing to spread that.

287
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 What if our daily lives are very often being interfered with by the world of the paranormal?

288
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 People dropping dead of heart attacks, otherwise completely healthy people.

289
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Not even ones that they can go, well, this person had the widowmaker. They had that little flap in their heart that could kill them anytime.

290
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 No, totally healthy people. Heart, totally fine. Dropping of a heart attack, and people go, "How did this person die? He was so healthy."

291
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Doctors go, "We don't know, just sometimes it happens."

292
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But if you connected the web together, there is a point. There is a place where they were all at at one point in their life.

293
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Not all as a big group, like a tour group, but they all passed through the same town.

294
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And it was in that town they picked up this psychic time bomb.

295
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 If this story is true, and everyone who had sex on that floor when they got pregnant, they had a miscarriage, you would have to study that and say,

296
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 "Was there something that the fire caused in the environment to make it so a child cannot be carried full term?"

297
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 You know what I mean? Like, flaking paint, or the fire activated certain chemicals in the building.

298
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 There would have to be a reason for it. There would have to be a reason for it.

299
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And if you couldn't come over the rational reason, having sex in a haunted hospital is the next best reason of why this is going on.

300
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And if this does connect, if there is a clear connection between having sex on the haunted floor of this hospital,

301
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 and if the child is conceived up there, is never carried full term, if we can prove that, then you could extrapolate that out to say,

302
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 "This is happening other places."

303
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 So is it possible that some of our illnesses, some of the weird afflictions that we face, again, not like a cough,

304
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 which you can just give typing around someone who coughs, but just an odd disease,

305
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 whether it's something like more gel-ins, which no one has ever really been able to put their finger on,

306
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 to something more dangerous, like a cancer, something minor like arthritis or crippling dementia?

307
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I'm not saying all of these cases are connected to the world of paranormal, but what if even some of them are?

308
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Even 1% of these cases being connected to the world of the paranormal, being connected to a place you went to,

309
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 and you may have never gone in a ghost hunt in your life, but you go to a particular hotel room,

310
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 and in that room is a spirit who died in such sorrow that a little bit of its psychic energy attaches itself to you,

311
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and you go on about your life, you don't see the ghost, you never experience the ghost,

312
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 but it doesn't mean the ghost isn't there, and a bit of it flakes off and infests your own spirit.

313
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 You may think you can avoid the world of the paranormal by not visiting the haunted house in the first place,

314
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 but it turns out we may all be living in a haunted world.
