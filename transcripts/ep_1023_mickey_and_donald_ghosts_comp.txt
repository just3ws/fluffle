 In 2020, a man detonated a bomb at an AT&T building in Nashville.
 Remember that?
 Geez, that sounds like forever ago in the world of conspiracy theory.
 The official story is because his father died of dementia, he blamed 5G technology that at
 that time was rolling out across the world.
 But is the truth behind the bombing even more bizarre?
 And then we travel to a house in the suburbs to take a look at the story of a young girl
 whose best babysitter is the television set.
 When her mother turns on the television set and leaves the room she has no idea she's
 opening her daughter up to.
 Supernatural attacks today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, hope you guys are having a great

 First off, crawling into Dead Rabbit Command on all fours, wearing nothing but tattered
 clothing.
 Everyone give it up for Jim Morfis Gas.
 Jim Morfis Gas sent me a book off my Amazon wish list.
 It was the book of werewolves.
 It was an old tome published back in 1863.
 So this is back when werewolves were a thing.
 This was basically a guide to keep you from getting your guts mauled out of your body.
 So thank you Jim, it's a totally awesome book.
 I love reading books of the time period, right?
 That's really really cool, the book of werewolves.
 And you're going to be our captain or pilot.
 And as Jim is preparing the Jason Jollibee, I'm going to be the captain of the show.

 Let's go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.
 Drive us all the way out to
 Nashville.
 Bop Bop
 Nashville, Tennessee.
 Home of Country Music
 Probably other stuff.
 Actually, I don't know if it's the Home of Country Music.
 I think that's probably Virginia or something like that.
 I think Country Music has been around since the Civil War.
 But
 Nashville, Tennessee.
 We covered this story
 a long time ago, back when it happened.
 And it's really weird.
 It's one of those stories that was so huge
 in the conspiracy theory community.
 It was mainstream news.
 People were talking about the solar news
 and then it completely disappeared.
 Everyone just kind of shrugged
 after a certain point and left.
 And I didn't predict it with this one.
 I didn't think this one would go away
 so quickly, but I did predict it
 with the Georgia Guidestones.
 When's the last time you've heard about that?
 When's the last time you've heard about that?
 A massive bomb
 was detonated
 in the middle of Georgia.
 Destroyed
 the structure that had been around
 since the 70's, right?
 So almost 50 years.
 Never caught them.
 They had video footage of the car
 leaving the area.
 You think at least the ATF would be interested
 in who built a bomb.
 It's gone.
 I totally predicted that.
 I go, "We're never going to find out who did this."
 Somebody blew up the Georgia Guidestones.
 Later that day,
 a construction crew came out and just knocked it down.
 And then the entire time we were told
 there was a time capsule underneath it,
 an article was released
 saying, "Oh, we opened up the time capsule
 and it was full of like, quailudes
 and it's like some other knick-knack."
 That wasn't true.
 That was 100% fake.
 That was not the time capsule
 in there. And then a couple of days later,
 they go, "Oh, no, there's no time capsule under there."
 We like knocked it down and we looked,
 there was nothing in there.
 So I mean, in that story is pretty much,
 every show often you'll see someone in the paranormal community
 kind of go, "Hey, what's up with the Georgia Guidestones?"
 Like, "We haven't heard anything about that."
 But the mainstream media is not investigating it.
 It's forced me to tell law enforcement isn't investigating it.
 It was a pretty powerful bomb.
 And they kind of ran with the,
 "Hey, look at what they buried in the 1970 time capsule."
 That wasn't true. That wasn't the time capsule.
 They never found the time capsule.
 The official report is there was
 no time capsule.
 Someone who went through the trouble of building
 the Georgia Guidestones to survive
 a nuclear war, to basically be
 in a dietary setting humanity
 goes, "Yeah, but I don't believe any artifacts
 from the 1970s or from before.
 We don't need a time capsule.
 We'll tell people those are time capsules and not really have."
 Super weird.
 This Nashville bombing thing,
 I remember it obviously was weird at the time
 we did an episode on it. We talked about it for a bit.
 And I forgot about it too.
 So when I saw this conspiracy theory
 pop up recently,
 I was like, "Okay,
 this is super interesting
 because
 in a vacuum, right,
 we've had an absence of conspiracy theories,
 really even mention of it.
 People don't even really...
 Now, this was another massive bomb
 in the city of Nashville.
 Let's go over a few quick facts
 if you don't remember.
 What are you talking about? Should I be concerned?
 It was Christmas morning. I mean, so iconic.
 Right up to the top 10 most iconic bombings.
 Christmas morning, it was 2020.
 There was a man named Anthony Warner,
 63-year-old man.
 He detonated
 a RV
 full of explosives
 outside of an AT&T facility.
 And
 it basically completely destroyed
 the building it was in front of
 and shattered windows
 up and down the street.
 One building collapsed, the 41 other
 buildings were damaged.
 There was a countdown, basically,
 so I'm kind of getting scattered here,
 but Anthony Warner pulls up outside of this
 AT&T building
 in this RV and basically
 a...
 The first report is someone is firing
 shots in downtown Nashville
 and as police respond to the area
 and people are leaving
 and it probably wasn't a lot of people down there
 anyways, it's Christmas morning.
 A recorded announcement begins playing
 from the RV saying a bomb will detonate soon.
 And then it starts
 a 15-minute countdown.
 So the police are like, "Okay, no one's
 down here anyways, it's Christmas morning."
 The police still have on there a little sleepy
 stocking cap and their new
 Christmas pajamas. They basically
 clear the streets of squirrels
 and it does the complete
 15-minute countdown and then
 it begins to play the song
 "Downtown"
 (singing)
 "Downtown"
 (singing)
 And then...
 (explosion)
 This is all caught on video.
 This is all caught on video because we have
 ATM cameras and stoplight cameras and all that stuff.
 There was talk of a missile
 like you actually...
 a missile crashes into the building
 and then the RV goes off. There was a big
 conspiracy theory about that for a while.
 That was one of the conspiracy theories.
 I didn't necessarily believe that.
 I think the explosives were in the RV
 but anyways, the RV explodes.
 It does all this damage. Only one death.
 And that was Anthony himself.
 And the story we got from
 the mainstream media was that Anthony's
 father worked for AT&T
 and he had recently died of dementia.
 And Anthony was a 5G conspiracy
 theorist. That also sounds quite
 quaint now, right? Because 5G is
 pretty much everywhere at this point.
 You don't hear that. You hear it sometimes
 connected to COVID, but
 it's not as big
 as like your eyeballs are going to melt out of your head.
 We don't see that so much
 about 5G because it's everywhere.
 As you're listening to this, your eyeballs are
 melting. You're like, "Ah, it's true, it's true!"
 Just took a while. 5G conspiracy
 theorist Anthony, that's the
 what we were told.
 And his father died of dementia. He worked
 at the subsidiary at AT&T.
 So therefore, AT&T is responsible.
 So I'm going to blow up this AT&T
 building
 and
 I'm going to get revenge. I'm going to expose
 the truth to the world. Unfortunately, it just
 basically one man died.
 And you know, the guy was
 we built a blockbusting
 bomb. I don't wish him death.
 You know, it's unfortunate that he died.
 There's other ways to get your message out.
 But, and again, did it work?
 Like again, like this whole entire thing
 has been swept under the rug.
 People don't really talk about it
 anymore. What happened?
 We figured out, because see, listen, AT&T
 is this is where I'm going to get myself
 blown up by the government. AT&T
 is in lockstep with the American
 government and they always have been.
 I don't even think that's a conspiracy
 theory, really. I mean,
 they
 were the original Google
 and at any point
 the government could say we want to know
 what this person's phone calls were. All this
 stuff about warrants and needing, oh man,
 I really wish it could have gotten that wire
 tap. But that judge said no. Oh, dang it.
 I guess we're going to just going to have to sit
 here until those terrorists strike again. That's all
 like local politics.
 Like maybe your local cop won't be
 able to wire tap your phone. And the
 judge is like, you don't have any probable
 costs. But the government is just like
 we want to listen to all the phone calls in this area.
 And the phone companies, despite what you read
 in the media, they go, sure.
 Every so often you'll see
 something pop up where they're like, we won't let
 you, we stand for freedom. And the government's
 like, errr. No. They know
 everything we're saying at all times.
 So,
 when this happened, we
 found out though, because the government is
 constantly spying on you, what we found out
 is when this AT&T building went up, it also
 disrupted 911
 dispatch services in the area.
 Nearby flights were grounded.
 It basically caused this massive
 infrastructure
 shockwave.
 Flights were grounded. You had communication
 systems within hospitals
 go down. What you figure
 would have been like self-contained.
 So, starting to see, it's very interesting. We're
 starting to see how interconnected all of this stuff is.
 Credit card machines, even
 people just wanting to stream the movies.
 Even if you weren't using an AT&T
 network, it
 created this huge ripple through the system.
 But
 everything was pretty much back online.
 Oh, and AT&T was disrupted throughout the
 country. This one little
 area here that blew this building up.
 AT&T had disruptions
 across the country, but within two days, everything
 was back to normal. I mean, obviously like
 you know,
 flight commands, they didn't ground flights for two days.
 Flights were able to get back on.
 I'm sure the hospitals got started up
 pretty quickly, got their communication systems
 back up. But you trying to stream
 spy kids for, it could have taken
 a while. That was not a priority.
 You're like, "Oh no, will they win the spy wars?"
 Anyways,
 I find this super fascinating, because
 recently I came across this conspiracy theory
 and it'd be fair. Even the guy
 who's writing the conspiracy theory is like
 "Maybe." He's not
 totally sold on this, but
 this led me to a really, really
 interesting fact that I didn't know about any of this stuff.
 There was a guy online, he goes
 by the name
 Aphrodite4120
 and he posted this and he
 is saying, possibly,
 right again, he's not totally married to this,
 but his idea is this.
 What had happened
 is that
 a rogue artificial intelligence program
 had been detected
 inside
 that AT&T building.
 And people were feverishly trying
 to keep it contained in this building.
 They're severing
 all escape routes.
 They're basically pulling T1 cables out
 of the wall.
 Knocking satellite dishes off
 the roof.
 And when they realized that they couldn't
 contain it, they said, "We need to blow
 the building up."
 So what we're seeing is something
 that's working backwards.
 And now he says, and I wasn't able to confirm this,
 he says the
 infrastructure, like all of the
 911 calls going down and the airports
 going down and the hospitals
 going down, he says, "That all happened
 two hours before the bombing."
 That was
 basically
 step two. The first step was to try to contain
 it in the building at 100%.
 If they couldn't do that, then they were going to shut off
 all communications throughout the city.
 And when they realized that wasn't going to work either,
 they were going to have to go to step three,
 which was blow up the building
 and they needed a cover story.
 Now it is interesting
 what they happen to have,
 what the government happened to have access to
 was the body
 of a 5G conspiracy theorist,
 Anthony Warner.
 Now whether he had died of a heart attack
 earlier that morning
 or the feds took him out,
 we don't know.
 Again, this is just a conspiracy theory.
 This is just a conspiracy theory.
 But the idea is they already had
 and who knows? I mean, listen, man, again,
 and
 it's not just the United States government.
 Every government does these things.
 It's just what governments do.
 They have one goal to survive.
 It wouldn't surprise me
 if governments have
 fictional databases on people.
 You obviously have all the real stuff
 you do.
 And then they just make up stuff too.
 When I die, I'm going to be like some big Harry Potter fan
 and I organized
 the live action Quidditch matches.
 I'm like, come on, bros, come on, make me a cool corpse.
 They may just have dossiers
 and they have a body
 and they go, this was this guy's grievance
 with us.
 And the media thumbs through and goes, okay,
 makes sense.
 But anyway, so they had Anthony Warner,
 they had this dead 5G conspiracy theorist
 and they basically said
 oh, he was there.
 He was blown to bits.
 Literal bits were left
 of Anthony Warner, so you couldn't really.
 And again, it's one of those things like
 even me, who
 I have distrust of the media
 in general, and I think
 most people do,
 I obviously rely on them
 for a ton of information, especially stuff
 that I'm not particularly either interested in,
 or
 have any way to fact check myself,
 because I don't live in Nashville.
 I can't drive out there
 and I'm like picking up pieces and picking up like a toenail
 and taking it back to my lab, even if I could get out there.
 I don't have a lab, I can't run DNA tests.
 So you do, I can
 kind of scratch my head and go, that's kind of suspicious.
 I thought it was weird.
 Remember there were gunshots, that's what brought
 the people to the area at first.
 To hear the countdown,
 we never found out who fired the gun.
 We assume Anthony Warner
 fired gunshots, so police would
 show, because the streets were pretty much deserted,
 everything was closed, so the police
 would show up so they could hear the countdown
 and know that this bomb was coming, but why would
 you give them the
 warning, if you were going to blow up the building
 anyways and weren't going to give some big speech,
 you weren't going to stand on the top of the RV
 and go, 5G is killing us all.
 So, who fired the gun?
 Who was Anthony Warner, did he exist?
 Everdy saying that there was this
 AI program locked
 in this facility
 and they needed, they basically
 blew it up and then came up with
 the story.
 We got the body,
 we have videotape of this RV
 out front,
 it was this guy who had
 grievance with the company.
 Now, fascinating
 conspiracy theory, does he have
 any proof? No, he's
 really just going, what if?
 The reason why I wanted to cover it
 was because I learned something
 brand new about the whole national bombing
 thing.
 Let's take into
 account, let's take the official
 story, that Anthony Warner
 blew up this 18T building
 because his father
 died of dementia while
 working with the subsidiary of
 18T. It was a retaliatory
 strike, it wasn't to
 spread the message
 of the dangers of 5G, it was to
 punish those who
 killed his father.
 So, let's take that, let's take the official
 mainstream story.
 I'm reading Aphrodite's post
 and Aphrodite keeps mentioning
 "How could you have a bomb
 that's so big it could destroy
 a 33 story building?"
 Yet, you'd still have
 DNA, you'd still have toenails and bits of flesh
 that you could match to Anthony Warner
 and he made that comment
 once or twice and I go, "33
 story building, what's this guy talking about?"
 Like, it was like a
 historic downtown Nashville
 because I'd seen the footage, I was
 very familiar with the footage
 and then I was re-watching it
 as I was reading his post and going, "Oh, this
 is kind of interesting."
 It's not a 33 story
 building, maybe at most like 4
 or 5, like this was like historic downtown
 Nashville, all the buildings are
 just those square buildings.
 One next to another.
 I'm like, "What's he talking about 33 story
 building?" The bomb went
 off on 2nd street
 and if you go to
 Google Earth today
 you can
 do a little tour down that street,
 that street is still completely closed off.
 Which is weird.
 Which is super weird, right?
 You had all the rubble for 9/11
 removed
 fairly quickly
 and some people say
 too quickly, some people say
 it should have been molten lava, but anyways
 anyways
 that's my 9/11, that's my X 9/11 truth
 are coming out, it's still
 in there somewhere. You have
 you have this whole
 block is just completely shattered
 and it's basically
 it's turned into a one way street
 and even if the footage isn't up to date
 as of today, it was
 even given them 2 years, none of these stores
 have reopened.
 They haven't done any
 major renovation or demolished
 and now if it's a historic thing, you might have
 certain rules, but if it's historic you figure they would demolish it.
 Anyways
 this all happened on 2nd street.
 If you go over
 1 street
 if you know how to do math
 if you go to 3rd street
 there is
 the AT&T building
 it's called
 the AT&T building
 and it is the tallest
 building in the state of Tennessee
 if you wanted to strike a blow
 against AT&T
 I can understand if they were on the other side of the country
 or even on the other side of the state
 you didn't want to drive an RV
 full of explosives that far
 I could totally see you wanting to hit
 like a local facility
 because the one that would be
 the truest symbol
 of tyranny
 over humans
 putting out this new technology
 that killed his father
 he would just hit the closest target
 this was 1 street away
 1 street away was the largest building in Tennessee
 it was the AT&T facility
 and it had he driven his RV
 just a block over
 this bomb
 destroyed one building
 and damaged 43 others
 that street has still not been reopened
 because of the damage
 2 years
 I double checked
 that photo was taken in June of 2022
 2 years that street
 they have had no businesses there
 had he parked that RV close
 to that 33
 story AT&T building
 glistening glass and steel
 could have done some serious damage
 he could have taken down
 a building or at least blown a huge chunk in it
 so why did he pick the little building next to it
 and not the AT&T tower
 itself it's almost as if
 something escaped from the AT&T tower
 and made it just the block away
 before some missile struck out of nowhere
 and destroyed the building
 this AI was in
 it escaped from its prison on 3rd street
 only got to 2nd street
 before it was erased from reality
 it's fascinating
 conspiracy theory
 don't know if it's true
 don't even know if I buy the missile thing
 but I find that super weird that he didn't attack the big building
 that's super bizarre
 and I didn't even know there was that giant building
 people in Tennessee were like "yes it's the tallest building"
 we can see it
 we can see it from where we're at
 I'm living down the street and I can see the building
 I just find that so weird that he didn't attack the big building
 I'm glad he didn't
 I'm not for more property damage
 from a conspiracy theory spawn
 but okay awesome
 I really love that story but we have to move on
 to something a little creepier
 I guess if you're an AT&T stockholder
 that entire story made you wet your pants
 but Jim Morphagas
 let's go ahead and toss you the keys
 to the world famous
 Carbentercopter we are leaving behind Tennessee
 take us all the way out
 to a house in the suburbs
 *imitates carbentercopter*
 Jim landed this Carbentercopter
 outside of this little girl's house
 and let me set the story up here
 this is kind of interesting
 the story was posted online
 it's a throwaway account
 by someone called throwawayliva
 and they said
 this isn't my story this is my mom's story
 but I gotta tell you a little bit about my mom
 my mom
 she
 is one of those parents who doesn't make stuff up
 technically the term she used is
 she never led us to believe
 that there was things like Santa Claus
 and the Tooth Fairy
 so my mom was not
 a fabricator
 she wasn't a liar
 basically would be the term some people would use
 but you know what I mean
 she wasn't indulging in our childhood whimsy
 so when
 throwawayliva's
 mom
 told her this story
 makes you think
 this is probably true
 this is probably true
 at the very least
 my mom
 saw something she couldn't explain
 but it was like
 stress or a dream
 or hallucination or something like that
 most
 my mom had an incredibly creepy
 paranormal encounter which
 affected the way that she raised
 her own children
 we're gonna go ahead when I'm names or locations
 for any of these people we're gonna go ahead and name
 the mother Nancy
 when Nancy was four years old one day she was hanging out
 in her mom's bedroom while her mom
 was taking a shower
 it was just her and her mom home at the time
 and Nancy was just
 watching a little television
 it was
 a Mickey Mouse show
 it was a show starring Mickey Mouse
 which tend to be the lamest one
 I hate Mickey Mouse
 so that's one cover in this story
 I was like yes, yes, it's true form
 finally I can convince the world
 and I didn't need to use an RV full of explosives to do it
 Nancy is watching television
 while her mom's taking a shower
 she's watching a Mickey Mouse show
 Nancy when she's thinking about it
 she goes I think it was that
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
 she was watching Disney Channel
 watching a little Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
 when she hears a voice go
 Nancy
 Nancy instinctively
 goes
 yeah
 now she knows her mom's
 taking a shower
 and she knows her mom doesn't normally
 sound all squeaky
 Nancy
 but she
 just instinctively is like oh someone must be calling me yes
 and there's no answer
 and she can hear her mother
 still taking the shower in the bathroom
 Nancy turns back to the television
 and continues to watch Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
 when she hears
 Nancy
 clearly hears her name again
 but this time she realizes
 it's coming
 from the television
 the
 TV
 itself is calling her name
 and Nancy goes
 the second I realized this
 Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck
 float out of the television set
 Nancy remembers this
 clear as a day
 imagine you would if fictional characters
 were walking around in your living room
 well technically I think they're just kind of floating there
 Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck float
 out of the television set and she said
 they were
 transparent like ghosts
 you could see right through them
 and Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are floating
 out of the television set
 they're floating in front of Nancy as her mom's
 in the other room completely oblivious
 to this absolutely bizarre event
 and the two animated characters
 start begin to go
 come here
 come here with us
 you liked it Michael Jackson
 Michael Jackson float out of the television too
 and Donald Duck saw
 come here
 come here with us
 come back
 she's like who are these
 dollar store versions
 where these terrible voices coming from
 a yuck yuck
 see if Goofy had come out
 I could have done a little bit of Goofy
 yuck yuck come here with us
 that's barely
 serviceable
 hey Nancy it's Yogi Bear
 come get the big
 a n***a basket
 but unfortunately she wasn't watching anymore
 bear cartoons right
 Mickey Mouse
 laughed again come here come here with us
 basically
 these two floating characters are trying to get
 Nancy to go somewhere
 and what's so interesting
 so if I was
 4 I would have been 1980 but
 but with 4 years old in 1980
 if Luke Skywalker walked
 into my living room
 and says hey man we need you
 we need you to help fight the empire
 jump into this television
 before he even finished the sentence
 I would be inside the TV
 Optimus Prime ever told me to crawl in his
 cab
 drive him around town
 I'd do it
 but what's interesting is Nancy realized
 something was wrong
 it's probably because her voice is soft
 she's like I don't know it doesn't sound like Mickey Mouse
 doesn't sound like Mickey Mouse I don't know what it sounds like
 yuck yuck
 she says she immediately gets weirded out
 once these characters begin
 speaking to her because even at the age
 of 4
 she knows that
 television characters aren't supposed to be floating
 out of the screen
 and I don't know if I knew that at the age
 of 4 but Shay did
 and she said that
 these two
 this one beloved character
 and Mickey Mouse are beckoning
 her to come into
 well they're saying come here
 come with us is she going to get teleported
 into the television
 are they going to grab her and take her to some
 hellish dimension
 these demons posing as these characters
 are the characters actually coming out of the television set
 she's trying to figure all this stuff out too
 and she's 4
 and it's happening right now
 and she doesn't know what to do because on the one hand
 cartoon characters
 on the other hand this shouldn't be happening
 and as she's trying to figure this out
 as they continue to beckon her
 to come towards them
 the mom
 steps out of the shower
 and they immediately disappear
 Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse just vanish
 they don't float back into the television set
 Mickey Mouse is shaking his fist I'll be back later tonight
 he he
 no they just disappear
 and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is still playing
 I don't think she finished the episode
 she's like that was quite terrifying
 but I wonder if Pegglay Pete
 will win the hand
 of sweet sweet Daisy
 she shut the television off
 and in fact from that day on
 she stopped watching anything Mickey Mouse related
 this is a lesson to us all we all should have done this
 she didn't watch anything Mickey Mouse related
 and
 she didn't let her kids
 ever watch anything Mickey Mouse related
 and
 I mean this is like a generational curse
 she stopped watching Mickey Mouse
 kids can't watch Mickey Mouse
 and her grandkids
 when they come over to her house
 no Mickey Mouse
 which would be
 it's not a bad tactic one Mickey Mouse sucks
 but secondly kids constantly
 want to rebel against their elders
 and your parents tell you not to get a tattoo
 you get a tattoo parents tell you not to smoke
 you start smoking
 parents says don't watch Mickey Mouse
 you're like I hate you mom and dad I'm totally gonna rebel
 you go to the Disney story
 you're like I'm gonna get all the Mickey Mouse paraphernalia
 watching tons of Mickey Mouse
 you know
 and you just like you be laughing it was a huge prank
 you could care less if they watched Mickey Mouse
 but it gave them something harmless
 to rebel against
 you with right watching all this Mickey Mouse garbage
 anyways
 no more Mickey Mouse
 in this this was no longer a house of
 mouse
 from that day forth
 it's an interesting story
 my dislike
 of Mickey Mouse is long
 and storied
 we've actually done previous episodes on it
 it's also possible
 that Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck
 did float out of the television set
 and then that's a whole other slew of questions
 was it actually
 Mickey and Donald
 I think would be the first important one
 because it could be
 demons masquerading
 as if I was a demon
 I would totally be
 a cool guy
 I would totally be like appearing at what it would be
 like these days I'm walking around
 I'm Mr. Beast I'm giving money away
 is it a demon
 who is disguised as Mickey and Donald
 which would be I mean both of these
 are terrifying alternatives
 and none of them are like well that's a little
 that's a little soothing
 is it a demon or demons disguised as Mickey and Donald
 and had they caught her
 then what
 I think the go-to thing
 is whether it's Mickey and Donald
 whether these characters
 these beloved characters are some sort of demonic constructs
 in and of themselves
 like Mickey is an actual
 demonic force and Donald
 while he is pretty funny
 and he is cool
 is unfortunately aligned with Mickey
 in this conspiracy theory
 that is actually
 and they are constantly trying to subvert
 children into
 falling into this hellish landscape
 you know that's the
 that's one conspiracy theory that is actually
 I don't know I feel like they are both so weird
 either they are demons
 disguised as Mickey and Donald
 or they are Mickey and Donald
 who are actually demons
 and so yeah
 she was right to never allow Mickey Mouse
 in her house I don't know if she watched DuckTales
 again I am a little iffy on that detail
 she might actually be much younger than me
 she might not have been born during the time of DuckTales
 because I was an adult when that Mickey Mouse
 Clubhouse was on
 so the point is
 is that I am wondering if
 if we take the story of face value
 we will have to wrap this up real quick
 but were the demons disguised as Mickey and Donald
 or are Mickey and Donald actually demons
 and every so often they are able to come out
 of the television set
 to beckon children to come to them
 we have these two possibilities
 and then the big question is
 what happens when the kid goes with them
 because I could obviously be super creepy
 and say
 she goes yeah sure
 and then they bleed her into the television set
 and then the mom comes out of the shower
 and the bedroom is empty
 and she is like Nancy
 Nancy Nancy and she is looking all over the house
 she can't find her 4 year old daughter
 and she calls the police
 the police show up they scour the area
 they are putting missing person signs
 all over the neighborhood
 it becomes a local news story
 not quite national
 and Nancy is never seen again
 but
 if you watched episode 87
 of
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
 in the background
 while Pegleg Pete is chasing Daisy
 through a hall of mayors
 for a split second
 you see the distorted face
 of a 4 year old girl screaming
 out in pain
 banging
 on one of the mayors
 her soul trapped
 in this
 cartoon forever
 right that would be super creepy
 that would be super creepy
 but
 I don't think that's it
 call me call me a little more
 stable than that I don't think she gets sucked into the television set
 because
 here's the thing
 kids disappearing in their houses
 is so incredibly rare
 and
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse was aired all over the country
 if not the world
 so I don't think
 that it's that these kids are being
 kidnapped and sucked into the television set
 you're like Jason I'm actually surprised
 that's not what you're thinking
 what's more likely
 and we'll wrap it up like this
 is that yes
 if you do go with these entities
 they don't
 canap you and take you to a hellish dimension
 they don't do something like super horror
 movie to you
 the mother doesn't come out of the bathroom
 and found her daughter just completely
 eviscerated
 single tear drop on a 4 year old's face
 as she turns to her mom and goes
 Mickey played
 oh my god you know what I mean
 obviously this stuff is great
 in a horror movie
 it's great in a horror movie
 it's super spooky but I don't think it happens
 I think that
 let's pretend that Mickey comes out of the television set
 but he doesn't do that
 Mickey and Donald basically would
 just corrupt her
 these demonic forces they don't need to do
 anything like super spooky
 any Dean Coons level horror
 they just say come here
 come here and she reaches out and she touches them
 and then they disappear the mom comes out
 but because she did
 what they said because they realized that this young girl
 is actually malleable
 they can
 convince her to do something that then through the rest of her life
 they're basically convincing her to make bad decisions
 she's some guys like hey do you want some crack
 she's like oh no I heard in school that
 cracks bad for you and then Donald Duck's like
 I don't know
 crack is delicious
 and she's like
 well Donald Duck said so
 the drug dealer's like what
 man you must already be high
 not like that
 it doesn't have to be like Donald Duck's on one shoulder
 and Mickey Mouse's on another
 you know what I mean like they would just realize
 she's easily persuadable
 they never have to show up again
 they just know that she is susceptible to
 suggestion
 so it's an interesting story
 it's one of the stories that probably did happen
 in one
 I don't think the poster's making it up
 I don't think the mom's making it up
 I think it's interesting that the mom
 never talked or didn't lead them to believe
 in these childhood
 illusions like the tooth fairy
 and like Santa Claus right she probably still gave
 the kids a dollar when they lost the tooth
 just to keep the economy going
 but they're like no the tooth fairy's not really a thing
 but I will give you a dollar
 because that's what all the other kids are getting for their teeth
 now Santa Claus isn't really a thing
 but you still get presents
 because if anyone knew
 the power of a child's imagination
 mixed with
 dark and mysterious forces
 taking the form
 from a childhood's imagination
 if anyone knew how dangerous that combination could actually be
 it would be a woman like Nancy
 she wasn't willing to indulge in her children's
 zest for fantasies
 believing in the tooth fairy
 Leopard cons
 Santa Claus because she knew that these
 could be
 pathways of temptation
 that would only take her children
 and her grandchildren
 down the darkest of paths
