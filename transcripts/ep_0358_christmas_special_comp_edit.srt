1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
 Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Today, today Santa's the host, but he changes his voice to sound

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,600
 just like Jason. I'm not gonna do that for long. First off, we got all heartwarming stories

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,120
 today. A man commits the ultimate Christmas crime, then we find out about a real life hero

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:36,320
 who became a fictional legend. Kind of weird, but it's heartwarming. And then we delve into the life

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,600
 of the real Saint Nicholas. I always knew Santa Claus was inspired by a real person,

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,240
 but I did not know that that real person fought demons today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to the Christmas special of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host,

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,720
 Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,360
 Just a quick note, I'm gonna take Christmas. You're listening to this episode on Christmas,

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
 unless you don't listen to it daily, unless you're listening to it a week from now, that's

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,040
 totally fine. But I'm not gonna record an episode tomorrow, because I had a short vacation and I

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
 said I'd sprinkle out some days off throughout the season. So I'm gonna use one of those days right

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,360
 now. So I will return with an episode for Friday. Tomorrow I'm gonna take it off, I'm gonna sit,

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,760
 I'm gonna catch up on the Mandalorian. I'm behind on that, probably catch up on It's Always Sending

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,440
 Philadelphia. I'd say catch up on the Simpsons, but I might have 10 seasons behind on that. I'm up

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,400
 to season 20. Love that show, love that show. Now, yesterday I complained most of my stories are

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,600
 really sad. Yesterday's episodes were kind of sad and I said, you know what, I'm gonna find some happy

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,920
 stories. And I did. Heartwarming stories to warm the cockles of your heart. Remember when we heard

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,640
 that when we were kids, we thought it was so funny. Now that's not funny at all. Like poop jokes are

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,240
 still funny. People getting like kicked in the nuts is still funny. I mean, depends on who's

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,680
 getting kicked if it's me, it's not that funny. If it's you, it's hilarious. And, but you know,

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,960
 like people go, "Hey, look at my my weenus." That's not funny. I never actually thought it was funny

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,320
 or as long your epidermis is showing. So it's funny how some jokes are universally funny. Somebody

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,120
 pooping their pants will always be funny. But what was the, oh, warm the cockles of your heart.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,920
 Like when you were eight, that was kind of funny, but or maybe 12. I don't remember.

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,120
 That's not funny now. So that's our first story about jokes that aren't funny. Now let's go ahead

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,080
 and move on to our first topic of the day. So let's hop on board the Carbentercopter. We are headed

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,120
 out to Colorado Springs, Colorado. Also, and I guess I should address this now because I'm sure

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,840
 some of you guys are aware of this. As I'm flying the helicopter to Colorado Springs, we're leaving

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,800
 behind Hood River. And I'm going to say, "Hey, so I know there was a bigfoot sighting in Hood River.

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,960
 It's been, oh, it's been slowly seeping into the news. There's actually footage from a highway

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,520
 security cam and ODOT cam, Oregon Department of Transportation of a bigfoot. Now, I don't know

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,360
 what it is, but we're going to cover that in depth. You're like, "No, no, no, cover now, cover now."

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,200
 "Is we're flying away from Hood River? We want to hear the local bigfoot story." "No, we're going

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,840
 to cover that tomorrow." "Wait, we're not having an episode tomorrow." You're like, "No, no, come on, Jason,

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
 why'd you tease us with that?" As I'm, now I'm hitting the gas for flying even faster away from

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
 Hood River. I'm going to cover that on a later episode. I kind of want to like go out and like

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,120
 poke around with a stick because it's within walking distance of where I'm at right now.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,520
 Bigfoot was sighted. But let's go to Colorado Springs. I look, everyone's all sulking in the

40
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 back. You're like, "Oh, man, I really want to hear about Bigfoot." And maybe Jason was like,

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 "Restling Bigfoot or something." I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, we'll talk about that later. It's Christmas

42
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,640
 episode." So unless Bigfoot's walking around the Santa Hat, we're not going to cover it. So just deal

43
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,880
 with it. You're like, "Ah, complaining the rest of the way." No, we'll cover it. I just wanted to

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,760
 get that out there because I'm surprised no one sent me that link yet. It seems like it's slowly

45
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,000
 filtering out. Veronica sent it to me. Veronica, friend of the show, she sent it to me. But it's

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,240
 weird because there's actually a picture of Bigfoot, tiny little, like faraway picture Bigfoot,

47
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,760
 but it's not hitting mainstream, which makes me think it might be true. The Bigfoot industrial

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,520
 complex may be trying to shut down the truth. But anyways, we'll talk about that later.

49
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,960
 Helicopter's landing in Colorado Springs, Colorado. So we're jumping out and you're like,

50
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
 "We're not getting out of the helicopter until we talk about Bigfoot." I'm like, "Come on,

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,960
 dude. I shouldn't even brought it up. Come on. Here, I'll swaddle you. Pick you up and carry

52
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,000
 me through Colorado Springs." And a little like, you're on my back like a little baby.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,760
 You have a little bow and arrow. So we're walking through Colorado Springs, Colorado,

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,400
 and you feel better now. You know we'll talk about it later. Now, it's 12.27 PM. It's December 23rd,

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,720
 2019. So I'm recording this on... You guys actually should be proud of me too. I've actually

56
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,400
 remembered this time to record the Christmas episode the day before Christmas. So there's that.

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,680
 So you can actually listen to it on Christmas. It's 12.27. It's Monday. It's December 23rd,

58
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,880
 2019. And a man, an old man, 65-year-old man, runs out of the bank, white beard and all. We're like,

59
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,240
 "Ooh, Santa Claus?" Well, kind of. He's allegedly holding a weapon. He runs out of the bank, stops,

60
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,200
 and then goes, "Merry Christmas!" and throws up thousands of dollars into the air, and then walks

61
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,640
 through a Starbucks, sits down at the patio, and just hangs out. Now, we'll go into the bank and

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,240
 we walk into the bank and it's just been robbed. Our suspicions are correct. That was my suspicion.

63
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,880
 I'm assuming that was your suspicion too? Just from the clues available, the old man, the weapon,

64
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,760
 the thousands of dollars in the air. And we talked to the tellers and they did get robbed. This guy,

65
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,480
 again, I'm gonna have to say allegedly, David... Or sorry, okay, either his name is David Oliver,

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:12,640
 or I misspelled it and it's... I'm pretty sure I misspelled it. Daviled. Daviled Oliver. Let me

67
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,400
 double check and see what his name actually is. Good old Daviled. Yeah, his name's David. His name's

68
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,280
 David. Good thing I double checked. But anyways, maybe if I call him Daviled, I won't have to keep

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,640
 saying it allegedly the rest of this time. Daviled does sound like an elf name. Anyways,

70
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,200
 then Daviled did rob this bank and when the cops showed up, they saw him sitting at the Starbucks.

71
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,560
 They were like, "Hmm, a 65 year old man robbed this bank through a bunch of money. There's a 65 year

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,920
 old man white beard sitting there." It's probably him. They walked up. He had an order to drink,

73
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,680
 which was a weird detail the newspaper put into the article. I was like, "So? Like, really? That's

74
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,120
 breaking news. Thanks for not... Thanks for letting me know he didn't do something." Anyways, the cops

75
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,120
 came. They arrested him. Christmas miracle, you might say. Old man robbing a bank. The story's

76
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
 a mystery on a couple different levels. One, why would you do that? There's always that thing,

77
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,080
 like, if you're ever on the verge of homelessness, just commit a crime. I do not agree with this tactic,

78
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,200
 but it's kind of a philosophy. If you're homeless or on the verge of homelessness,

79
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,880
 just commit a crime where no one really gets hurt and you'll be taken care of for like

80
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,520
 seven to ten years. It's real dicey. It's real dicey. I mean, I guess if you were... If things

81
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,920
 were worse for you on the streets than they think they would be in prison, you know, I've also heard

82
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,280
 that thing, like, you know, people always go, "Oh, you're in prison. You're gonna get raped."

83
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,600
 Apparently it doesn't... I have a lot of friends and family members who have served a long time in

84
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,520
 prison. Seven years, ten years. I have a... My cousin serving 17th of life in prison right now.

85
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,280
 Apparently, like, people do get raped in prison, but a lot of times it's prison-specific.

86
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,520
 And you can go your entire stay without, like, binging a dude or getting raped yourself, and

87
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,720
 you're like, "Jason, this was supposed to be your heartwarming Christmas episode." That's true. So

88
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,040
 we're gonna leave behind... Well, that's heartwarming to know it's not as brutal as you think it is,

89
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,040
 but anyways, that could be why I did it. There's real... This story is so recent,

90
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,600
 we don't know why he did this. And to make it even more Christmassy than it already is,

91
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,200
 man with a white beard throwing money around, giving out presents. Most of the money, people

92
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,280
 walking down the street, they saw this, they ran, they scooped up handfuls of money, they're like,

93
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,440
 "Yes! Now I can return this to the bank." And they went into the bank and they gave it back to the

94
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,600
 tellers. Some of the money is missing. They said a couple thousand dollars were missing, but they

95
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,840
 said a good amount of it, people actually scooped up and took it back to the bank. It's Christmas

96
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,600
 miracle. People saw that this guy robbed the bank, threw the money up in the air trying to give them

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,560
 some Christmas cheer, and they gave themselves Christmas cheer by returning the money. A very

98
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,280
 heartwarming story. So many Christmas true crime stories are family massacres. I made that comment

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,120
 last year as well. So let's go ahead though. We're leaving behind the Christmas miracle

100
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
 of Colorado Springs, Colorado. It'll always be remembered. Little kids are going to be like,

101
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
 "Oh, I remember! I wish I was there! I could have bought like so many Pokemon and Beyblades and

102
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,520
 stuff like that." Like that honestly will be a Christmas story. They'll make a movie of that

103
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,640
 someday. A Hallmark Channel movie. The old man who reigned money. It'll be in parentheses,

104
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,720
 but not in a strip club. Speaking of movies, speaking of movies, there's the best thing

105
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
 way I could think of. I edited out 10 minutes of other garbage. Let's go to Charlotte, North

106
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,560
 Carolina. Now I'm going to tell you this one. This story I just read about today. You might want

107
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,800
 to grab a little hanky. You might want to grab some tissue. I don't know if hanky is an American

108
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,920
 term. In some other country, it's probably something super obscene. Hankerchief. Hand.

109
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,200
 Kerchief. Whatever you want to pronounce it. Hanky. Tissue. Something. Maybe I'm building it up too

110
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:55,520
 much, but this is a rough one. But it's truly a Christmas story. April 30th, 2019. Some total

111
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:04,240
 piece of trash. Every good Christmas story starts off with that language. And I hate humans like

112
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,600
 this. April 30th, 2019. Some just human debris. Garbage. Piece of filth. Walks into

113
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,160
 University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and opens fire. Just starts shooting people. Now while

114
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,320
 this is going on, it's like five in the afternoon. People are getting ready to show these video

115
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,800
 presentations they've been working on for class. He walks in, he starts opening fire. The teacher

116
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,440
 opens its side door and is letting kids escape. The guy's just like pop, pop, pop, pop, shooting.

117
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,960
 And there's a young man there named Riley Howell. He's 21 years old. He sees what's going on.

118
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:44,160
 He jumps up. He rushes the shooter. Pop! Gets shot once. Heaps running. Pop! Gets shot again.

119
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,840
 And then hits the guy. Hits the piece of trash so hard. Actually, after the guy ends up getting

120
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,680
 arrested, he suffers internal injuries from being rammed. But at that final moment when he

121
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,800
 smashes into this dude, Riley gets shot in the head and killed there. And the shooter lays on the

122
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:11,680
 ground and someone says, "Quit shooting!" And he goes, "I'm done! I'm a big piece of trash, garbage human."

123
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,480
 He doesn't say that last part, but he does say, "I'm done." It wouldn't have been a lie if he did.

124
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,600
 The shooter was a guy named Tristan Andrew Terrell. 22 years old. The shooter gets taken to jail.

125
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,120
 They've never been able to find out a motive for it. He played guilty. He ended up killing two people

126
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:35,200
 and injuring five. One of the people was Riley. And the police said, "Absolutely Riley helped end this

127
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:43,280
 shooting." Now, some dude in Florida is reading newspaper articles about this incident, about

128
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:50,880
 this heroic act and this just piece of trash human. And I know I might be repeating piece of trash over

129
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,360
 and over again. There's more choice words I would like to use, but again, I try not to cuss so much

130
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,600
 on this show. There's this guy in Florida named James Wes Karen. And he's reading all these newspaper

131
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,240
 articles about this shooting up in North Carolina. And he notices there's a trend in these articles.

132
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,440
 All the articles about Riley Howard mention what a Star Wars fan he is. How much he loves Star Wars.

133
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,320
 So he writes to Lucasfilm and he goes, "Hey guys, you don't really know me. I don't really even know

134
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,240
 this kid." He had no connection with Riley Howard. But he writes to Lucasfilm, emails him, says,

135
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,080
 "You might want to check this out because every single article I've read about this guy talks about

136
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,040
 what a Star Wars fan he is." And I'm not saying like, make him a major character in a movie, but

137
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,440
 you know, maybe throw him something in a comic book or something like that. Even his profile,

138
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,960
 I think it was on CNN, said that his favorite thing was Star Wars, something else, and then

139
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,000
 his girlfriend. Like, Star Wars was listed as his main thing. New York Times mentioned that he had

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,560
 a big Star Wars collection. His little brother was doing, his little brother, Teddy, was saying,

141
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,440
 "He's the only, let me find the actual quote." This was the quote that little brother said,

142
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,160
 "The only 20 year old, 21 year old who would willingly fight his lightsaber with me." His

143
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,120
 little brother saying that. That is passed away brother. So it was on May 4th when James emailed

144
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,160
 Lucasfilm. So May 4th is the holiday of May the 4th be with you. It's like Star Wars day. May the

145
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,760
 4th be with you. That's when he sends this email out. So 16 days later, May 28th, Lucasfilm reaches

146
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,280
 out to the family of the Howells. They send him this letter. To the Howell family. In the wake of

147
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,640
 your recent tragedy, everyone here at Lucasfilm wishes to express our deepest condolences.

148
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:44,480
 Riley's courage and selflessness brings out the Jedi in all of us. We hope you may rejoice in his

149
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:52,240
 memory and we join you in honoring his life and example. As a small tribute. Our story group has

150
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,880
 incorporated a reimagining of Riley's name as a character in the Star Wars galaxy. We can't reveal

151
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,680
 the specific details at this time, but the character's name will appear in a forthcoming

152
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,040
 book publication later this year. Please keep this confidential until the book is released,

153
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,160
 at which time we'll share it with you. Again, all of us here extend our deepest condolences.

154
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 The Force will be with Riley and all of you always.

155
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,680
 So that is released. That's sent out on May 20th is when they give that email and they've kept it

156
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,600
 under wraps. The family hasn't revealed any of this information. Not even close friends knew

157
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,960
 about this. And what happened? This is where the story has come out now. What's funny? I know there's

158
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,640
 a lot of divisiveness over the Star Wars fandom. I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I've been in love with it

159
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,200
 since I was a little kid. I saw Return of the Jedi in the theater. I remember watching the Cyskolan

160
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:54,320
 Evert review for Return of the Jedi on television. Like, it was a you were at home that day just to

161
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,960
 watch the review to see a couple minutes of the clips. Huge Star Wars fan. Didn't like the prequels

162
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,400
 when they came out. They didn't like... I turned... I started liking the Clone Wars when that was out

163
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,760
 or what was it? Attack of the Clones or whatever. And then I haven't really watched the... I haven't

164
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,240
 seen any of the new movies. I've seen the first half of Rogue One, watched the Mandalorian, but I

165
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,280
 haven't seen The Last Jedi, Forged Awakens, none of that stuff. And I remember The Last Jedi came out.

166
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,040
 I would get in low arguments about how dumb that movie was. And you could say, "Jace, you didn't even

167
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,120
 see it." And I would be like, "Well, I read the synopsis. I don't have to pay money or spend time. I

168
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:33,200
 know every plot detail..." Because I took it as you're totally messing up this fandom, this stuff

169
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,400
 that I loved. But it's funny because between The Last Jedi and now, I just don't care anymore. Like,

170
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:47,280
 I have... I choose what I want to like in a universe. I'm no longer like, "Oh, no, that's canon and it's

171
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,280
 totally ruined." I just don't care anymore. Like, I really love the original trilogy. I think it's

172
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:58,800
 great. The prequel trilogy is okay. It's pretty good. And I don't want to watch the sequel trilogy.

173
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 And maybe I will someday. I don't know, but I don't take it personally, one, when other people like

174
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,920
 stuff. Well, I do kind of take that personally. That's a different thing. But I've sometimes

175
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,520
 I find it irritating that nerd culture has gotten so popular because I used to get beat up

176
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,640
 and get in fistfights over this stuff and now just anyone can like it. So that kind of irritates me.

177
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,520
 But that's not really my point. My point is that... What was my point? My point is this. My point is

178
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,120
 this. It's like, now I didn't like in-game. I thought it was stupid. It was boring. It took the story

179
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,960
 nowhere. But it didn't ruin Iron Man for me. It didn't ruin Civil... I don't like Civil War. It didn't

180
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,520
 ruin Winter Soldier for me. It was just dumb. It was boring. They did nothing in the whole movie.

181
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,760
 It was stupid. I didn't like in-game. The end. I mean, like, you know what I mean? I didn't get

182
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:53,280
 offended by how terrible it was. It was a shoddy movie. And... But the fact that I saw it didn't ruin

183
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,480
 Infinity War for me. Anyways, that being said, I think definitely the new Star Wars movie, there's

184
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,320
 a lot of divisiveness going on. There's a huge conspiracy theory involving Rise of Skywalker

185
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,880
 right now. We'll get into that in our next episode as well. But right now, I kind of wanted to focus

186
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,480
 on the positive. And I think this is a positive story because I'm sure as I was reading that

187
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,880
 letter, there are some of you who are like, "Yeah, but the new Star Wars sucks. So who wants to be

188
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,960
 involved in those?" Well, Riley would. Riley would. And even if you don't like new Star Wars movies,

189
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:29,520
 if you even if you think that Luke, the Jedi warrior kind of dying on a rock after trying to kill

190
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,520
 his nephew is stupid, and it was a bad story choice, Riley liked it. So sometimes we don't,

191
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,600
 just because somebody else likes something that we don't like, or because the universe goes in

192
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,520
 a different direction. When I say universe, I don't mean the actual physical universe. I mean,

193
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,560
 the canon universe of these stories. Riley liked it. And sometimes we have to remember that when

194
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:57,200
 we're in these internet arguments about how stupid, how stupid it was that Leia flies through space

195
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:05,360
 now or whatever. So let's go back here. We get the letter out. And then about a week ago, one of

196
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:14,800
 Riley's friends calls up his girlfriend and says, "Hey, you want to, this is weird. This is really weird.

197
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:22,080
 I was reading the Rise of Skywalker, the visual dictionary. And I came across this

198
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,440
 passage and the girlfriend's like, "Nerd, why are you calling me on this?" He's like, "No, no, no. Wait,

199
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,280
 wait. Hold on. Let me find it. I've dogged this section." It says, here's the section in the book,

200
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:43,200
 the Ionica, it's a sci-fi word, the Ionimaka, whatever. Jedi master and historian, Riley Howell,

201
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,800
 collected many of the earliest accounts of explorations and codifications of the Force

202
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,560
 in the Ionica, a two-volume combination of codex, correspondence, and scrapbook.

203
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,600
 Though much of its contents would later be stored in holocrons, which have since been lost,

204
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,760
 the physical books have passages written in the hands of the original sages, carefully preserved by Howell.

205
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:14,640
 And the girlfriend basically starts bawling because she realizes this is it, this is his

206
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,520
 memory. Now, Riley, it's apt that he was a historian character because

207
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:29,360
 one of the people quoted in this article was saying that he was into the lore. He was going

208
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,240
 through the Wikipedia, Wookiepedia is actually the name of it, but Wookiepedia pages read all of the

209
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,960
 books, was really into the lore and the history of the Star Wars universe. He wasn't just a fan who

210
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,640
 collected toys, he was into the obscure information. A historian would be a good character for him.

211
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,920
 And then his mother will end it with this quote from his mother, Natalie Henry Howell,

212
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,760
 is her name. And this is what she says, quote, "And I like the way they actually left his last name."

213
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,440
 I think he would really be appreciative of that because, you know, they could have just said,

214
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,240
 "Riley, Jedi, Riley." And we'd be guessing the whole time about whether or not it was really him.

215
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,720
 But they put his last name in there just to really honor him. And that really made me cry when I

216
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:27,680
 heard about it. Here's the rest of this article. "She also wept last Thursday when the whole family

217
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,680
 went to see the new movie on opening night. They brought his ashes and left a seat open for him."

218
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,080
 I think Henry Howell says he would have liked the way it ended.

219
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:51,680
 So that's the story of Riley Howell, now Jedi Master Riley Howell, a real life hero who became

220
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,000
 a legend in the universe he loved so much. It would be really cool if someone made a fan fiction,

221
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,720
 made a short film or something about Riley Howell and explored that character more.

222
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,200
 Who knows, maybe, I guess they were planning on doing Knights of the Old Republic.

223
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,640
 Maybe. Long shot, probably not. But yeah, an uplifting story. A man who gave up his life to

224
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:25,440
 save others gets to live on forever in the Star Wars universe. Let's go ahead and move on to the

225
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,920
 next story. You might have to fly the helicopter. I got something in my eye right now. I gotta get

226
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,480
 it out. So go ahead. Go ahead, take the controls. It's Christmas time. I trust you. So as you are

227
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,600
 piloting the Carbenter copter and I'm sitting in the back thinking, feeling bad about all the

228
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,680
 times you talked trash about last night, even just a couple minutes ago when I was talking trash

229
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,160
 about last night, flying. I'm just kind of hanging my feet out of the helicopter looking down a

230
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:59,600
 landscape. That is a sad story. It's a sad story no matter what you cut it. But it's truly a story

231
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,120
 of giving. It's a story of giving. You're like, Jason, shut up. I'm trying to fly the helicopter

232
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,840
 and now I'm getting stuff in my eyes too. I was like, sorry, sorry. Sorry. Okay. So you're like,

233
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:21,280
 where are we going? And I'm like, we are going to Turkey and we're going back to 300 AD. So go ahead

234
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:32,240
 and hit that button right there. We're flying over Turkey now, 380. We're looking for a man. A man.

235
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,000
 I can't really build up the suspense because I already told you in the intro who it is. We're

236
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,160
 looking for St. Nicholas. We're looking for Nicholas of Bari. Sometimes known as Nicholas of Myra.

237
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,680
 But anyways, we're looking for a dude named Nick. So we're landing. We're flying over like

238
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,520
 little Pueblo dirt houses and stuff like that. Flying over. I don't know what the houses were

239
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,640
 built of back then. I barely know what houses are built out of now. I think it's mostly wood

240
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,920
 still, right? Anyways, we land in the middle of Turkey. Maybe they had wooden houses back then.

241
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,880
 I don't think they were still like living in caves. I mean, there was obviously like established

242
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
 shitties, but I just assumed everything looked like, you know, Bible times, even though it was 300

243
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,520
 years afterwards. So we land and we're walking around and we're going to meet a guy named Saint

244
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,840
 Nick. It's the dude. His name, he's not Saint yet. He's like, whoa, spoiler alert. I'm a Saint? Apparently

245
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,040
 he's also Rodney Dangerfield. Oh, I get no respect. I got three miracles and all I do is walk around

246
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,160
 with a stick. These other people got two and people are praying to their bones. I get no respect. So

247
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:42,160
 Nicholas, it's Nicholas of Bari to the two people who listen to this show who know who Rodney Dangerfield

248
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:49,280
 is. Nicholas of Bari is this dude. I keep wanting to call him tall. He's actually like five foot six,

249
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,440
 which may be back then was tall, but I'm guessing we're all taller than this guy or at least equal

250
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,920
 to him. So we're giants in this time period. So we're walking around with Nicholas and we're like,

251
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,880
 so yes, spoiler alert, we're from the future. Nice to meet you. He was like, oh, I get no respect.

252
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,800
 I'm stuck in the present. We're like, that's okay. The joke's over. It's like, okay, we're here to

253
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,680
 explore your life. He's like, yo, okay, so let's do this. Now he's a monster. I just have to differentiate

254
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:27,280
 the voices. So Nicholas is like, first off, what I'm going to do here is there's this house down the

255
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,240
 street. Now let me say this too here. I'm going to push him aside, push Nicholas aside to stand in

256
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,280
 front of the camera. All the stories we're about to talk about, I know there's going to be someone

257
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,640
 out there, multiple people actually, who say that story is not true. That story is actually about

258
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,440
 this person and that person. Because this guy is so old, and there was no written records of him

259
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,160
 until 600 AD, people know he exists because there were like a church named after him that was before

260
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,240
 600 AD. And he was listed in documents, people know he existed. He's not a mythological figure,

261
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,640
 but he wasn't being written about until 600 AD. The stuff he wrote had been destroyed and the

262
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,080
 stuff other people wrote about him had been destroyed. Because he was in Turkey for the most part,

263
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,000
 it was getting conquered by the Muslims at a certain point. Things were just being demolished.

264
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,720
 It wasn't the best environment. Paper was frail. So I'm going to tell these stories and people go,

265
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,800
 well, actually, that is part of this old pagan myth. Maybe, maybe they got assigned to him, maybe.

266
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,880
 But these are all just fun stories about Nicholas. Nicholas, Saint Nicholas. So get off my back.

267
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,160
 Saying here, all of these stories have been attributed to Nicholas in one way or the other.

268
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,400
 However, you could easily say that didn't happen. I think you can probably say that about most of

269
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,880
 the stories I'm about to say, but historically, they've been attributed to Nicholas. So I'm going

270
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,680
 to step away from the camera now. Come here, Nick. Get back in front of the camera. He's like,

271
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,920
 what's a camera? What was that? He goes on to say, like, listen, you see that house down the street

272
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,760
 there? There's this dude. He used to be really, really rich, right? And he's not rich no more.

273
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,800
 You got no money because the envy of Satan took it from him. That's an actual quote. That's what

274
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,120
 people were calling it. How much you imagine Satan has a lot of money. You imagine that he's

275
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,800
 probably pretty well off, dude. You know, he's the corruptor of the universe. How much money do

276
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:27,520
 you have to have for Satan is jealous of you? I imagine an awful lot. But anyways, he's, he has

277
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,640
 too much money. Satan got jealous, he ended up losing his money and now he's poor. Now that sucks,

278
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,400
 but he also has three daughters in 300 AD, which is not good because you have to pay dowries

279
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,360
 to marry them off. If you can't pay the dowries, they got to go. The women got to work. You can't

280
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,480
 raise them their entire life. It's not like they could go get a job at the local market or something

281
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,920
 like that. And if they can't get married off, the only real option for them is to become freeloaders

282
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:01,600
 living off the dad. He didn't got no money. Satan took it all and or, or they become prostitutes.

283
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,280
 And Nicholas hears about this. Now, Nicholas, what we do know about him is he came from a very wealthy

284
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,280
 Greek family and his parents passed away. So he's basically like Batman. But instead of fighting

285
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:20,000
 crime, he was a devout Christian. I wonder if Batman is religious. I know Daredevil is.

286
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,240
 You know, I remember once when they were talking about Miss Marvel, she's the,

287
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,360
 she's a Marvel superhero character. They mentioned that she was the first Muslim

288
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,280
 superhero. And it's funny because I never thought about it. I go, I never really considered what

289
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,320
 religion Spider-Man was. He could have been Muslim for all I know. Like it was weird. Like once you

290
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,080
 start saying this, like you knew Daredevil was Catholic, he was kind of built into his character

291
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,560
 because he was like this Irish dude from Hell's Kitchen. But like I never really, I've, once they

292
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,280
 pointed out and said this character is Muslim, then I had to sit down and go, well, I'm sure Tony

293
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,720
 Stark's an atheist and I guess Captain America's probably like Lutheran or something like that.

294
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:10,480
 Like I never really considered any of them having a religion outside of Daredevil until they somewhat,

295
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,080
 until you explicitly pointed somebody out and said this is the first Muslim character.

296
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,600
 And I go, oh, that's weird. Anyways, what was I talking about? Oh yeah, St. Francis,

297
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:27,760
 not St. Francis, St. Nicholas is not Batman. He's a Christian. I wonder what religion Batman is

298
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,800
 not just showing, I'm just showing. So anyway, I'm sure Batman's atheist as well. I don't know.

299
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,760
 Like what would Batman be? It would be, I honestly think if anything, the most religious character

300
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,880
 in comic books, I don't know why I think this, but it would be Superman. And yeah, Superman like

301
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,120
 punches like dark side in the face and he like fights like sons that eat planets. But I still

302
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,520
 think Superman would believe in God. Like I don't know why I think that like Superman seems like

303
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,160
 the character who would probably be the most religious dude out there. I don't know why. I mean,

304
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,000
 I'm sure someone could point me to a comic book where he's like God doesn't exist, only me and he

305
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 like evaporates a bunch of bad guys. But maybe because he's so powerful, I think he would have to

306
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,920
 assume there was someone more powerful than him. I don't know. I don't know. I think Batman probably,

307
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,640
 Batman probably doesn't really care much about religion. It's funny because Batman,

308
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,440
 you're like chasing this supposed to be episode about St. Nicholas. You haven't even gotten the

309
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,760
 good stuff yet. I think Batman only thinks about beating up criminals. I think he would,

310
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,080
 I think he would probably be super shallow to talk to. Like I honestly don't think he, I love

311
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,320
 Batman. He's one of my favorite comic book characters. He's honestly one of like my favorite

312
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,160
 fictional characters. But I'm sure he's super boring to hang out with. When he's Bruce Wayne,

313
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,720
 he's pretending he's a shallow idiot. So no one catches on that he's the world's greatest detective.

314
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,640
 He would just basically talk about partying and stuff like that. Surface level sociology

315
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,760
 conversations with Bruce Wayne. Not an idiot, just shallow. But just somebody that when you talk to

316
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,960
 you're like, okay, we've talked for about an hour. That's probably, this is probably the most in-depth

317
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,840
 conversation we're gonna have. And as Batman, I don't think he, he would, he would talk to him

318
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,040
 much. And then he would just, I think that's all he talks about is beating up criminals. I think

319
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,280
 he's probably super shallow. I think Superman, you could have long conversations about stuff. I think

320
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:36,000
 he'd really be willing to, because he's so powerful that you're, everyone's an idiot to him. So he

321
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,520
 has to talk down to everybody. And he's seen things in the universe that humans can't even

322
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,840
 comprehend. It'd be like Doctor Strange. But again, I think Doctor Strange would be kind of,

323
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,360
 he wouldn't care. Like he's super smart and you're like a waste of his time. He talked to you a

324
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,520
 little bit and then say, I gotta go somewhere. Then he would just teleport into another room in his

325
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,000
 house and be really quiet until you left. I think Superman would actually take the time out to have

326
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 a conversation with you. Batman, it would probably take the time out to have a conversation with you,

327
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,440
 but he would only talk about choke holds and arm bars if you're lucky. Otherwise, he's just gonna

328
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,360
 sit and flex on you all day long and talk about how, how nice his car is and how nice his house is.

329
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,960
 Just so you leave. So then he can go, it's Sulk in his Batcave and try to find, not just Sulk,

330
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,000
 you know, also try to solve murders and stuff like that. But I don't think it would be kind of

331
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,600
 dope to talk to, but none of this he's anything to do with St. Nicholas. As we're going off in

332
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,000
 that rat in St. Nicholas, he's just standing there. He, he's invented a watch. He invented a little

333
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,080
 sundial watch. So like, are you done? Are you done? Are we gonna talk about me? Yes, we're gonna talk

334
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,400
 about you. He's like, thank you. Let me finish telling you about my miracles, not your stupid

335
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:54,960
 fictional characters, Jason. He says, listen, Batman's not real. This story's real. My parents died

336
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,240
 and they left me a bunch of money and I'm standing outside this house with three potential prostitutes

337
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,920
 living in it. These dudes, he's super mad at us. He's a saint. He's a Catholic saint. I just spent

338
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:15,120
 10 minutes talking about Spider-Man and talking to Batman and we're in the presence of a man.

339
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,960
 When I get done telling this story, you're gonna realize how this whole segment, this dude is so

340
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,000
 dope. St. Nicholas is so awesome. And the fact that I was talking about all these dumb two-dimensional

341
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,400
 drawings for however long that took, you're gonna be mad at me. I'm kind of mad at me because this

342
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,800
 guy does some crazy stuff. He's like, listen, okay, I'm standing outside this house. There's three

343
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,240
 potential prostitutes in there. I have money. So what I'm gonna do is he puts these gold coins

344
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,480
 in a bag and he throws it through the dude's window for the first daughter and bounces out.

345
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,680
 The dad the next day wakes up and he's like, what? Look it, here's enough money to pay for the dowry

346
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,840
 for one of my daughters. Marrys the daughter off. The other daughter, she meets a man. She's gonna

347
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,920
 get married. A bag of gold magically appears on the dude's floor. He's like, what? That's so weird.

348
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,080
 Like, this happened last time. I wanted to get this daughter married off. A bunch of gold showed up.

349
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,440
 Now his third daughter's marriage is coming up as well. And he goes, you know what? I'm gonna stay

350
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,200
 up tonight. I'm gonna stay up tonight. And I'm gonna see what happens. Because you would assume

351
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,480
 it's magic. A bag of gold appearing in your house before your daughter's wedding. Because if she

352
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,240
 didn't have the money, the wedding would be called off. Girl has to turn tricks. So he stays up and

353
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,560
 he sees a bag of gold, fly through a window, and he runs outside. He sees Nicholas standing out there.

354
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,640
 Nicholas goes, hey, hey, listen, don't tell anyone about this. Like, the reason why he was doing

355
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,400
 secretly, because he goes, this is the theories. This is the theories that was written about.

356
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,760
 He didn't know if the guy would accept the money because it was charity. This guy was a formally

357
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,920
 very wealthy man. Then he would basically be taking handouts. And he didn't know if his pride

358
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,520
 would get in the way of it. And then, too, he didn't want any credit for it. So he tells the dad,

359
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,160
 don't tell anyone about this. I'm just paying this off. And the dad ends up getting the third

360
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,040
 daughter married out. Now that story does eventually. That story is actually probably the one of the most

361
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,040
 historical stories involving Nicholas. Because really what they do is when they start to look at

362
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,920
 stories, because Nicholas actually starts his, oh, after his death, he becomes such a main player in

363
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:36,560
 the saints. He becomes such a big figure in the saints, in the world of Catholicism, that we see

364
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:44,160
 stories being attributed to him in the year like 1400. So they have to go back to stories that

365
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,760
 they could find in the 600, 700, 800. They think those are more likely to be true. And this is one

366
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,440
 of the earliest stories involving Nicholas. And it really, so as his legend grows, basically, well,

367
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,880
 let's take this one. Because this one, I think, really is the Santa Claus that we know of.

368
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,680
 Then you go, Santa Claus, it's funny. I took for granted that everyone knows that Saint Nicholas

369
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,960
 is another name for Santa Claus. You're like, what? I thought you were just talking about some

370
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,600
 dude throwing money around. And you know what's funny now that I say that? That was the first story

371
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,560
 we did. Guy starts throwing money around. Who knows? Maybe there were some potential prostitutes

372
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,080
 walking down the street that day, and he was able to make it. That's an interesting, weird story.

373
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,200
 Did not even plan that. What if he felt that cops interrogate him? They're like, what'd you do? And

374
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,000
 he's like, I don't know. I just felt compelled to do it. And at that time, there was this girl who

375
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,280
 was really like, I might have to become a prostitute. Wait, money. And then she scoops it out. I know

376
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,280
 this world works. But maybe, maybe. Anyways, so this is the story. This is kind of the overview.

377
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,760
 That's one of the main stories involving Saint Nicholas. He's giving, he's doing it in secret.

378
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,040
 One version of the story is he was throwing it through the chimney. And that probably wasn't true.

379
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,680
 I don't know how many chimneys they had in Turkey, but they basically, the story travels out of Turkey.

380
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,960
 He becomes a venerated figure in Catholicism. And he becomes like the patron saint of children

381
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,560
 and sailors and all sorts of stuff. And the story of him giving gifts is one of the reasons why Saint

382
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,120
 Nicholas morphed into the story of Santa Claus or Sinter Claus. And it's one of the versions that

383
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:31,120
 we have today. Now, that is all cool. That's all an interesting story. That's not what I want to

384
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,560
 talk about, even though I just did. That was kind of the intro. Because I always knew Saint Nicholas,

385
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,480
 the story of Santa Claus, was loosely based on somebody real. But I didn't know he was such a

386
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,000
 dope figure. I didn't know. So we have that. Very generous man. But let's look at some other feats

387
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,520
 of Saint Nicholas. See, to be a saint in the Catholic Church, you have to have three miracles.

388
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,920
 You have to have three miracles attributed to you. They just don't say, "Ah, you are a good dude."

389
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,960
 Like Mother Teresa, if they ever want to make Mother Teresa and have heard that they're trying

390
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,080
 to go through, they have to find three miracles she did. There's this whole thing,

391
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,360
 whole process you have to go through to be named a saint in the Catholic Church.

392
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,880
 Now, I want you to think about this for a second, guys. So our version of Santa Claus,

393
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,760
 the gift-giving thing, is based on that story. Imagine if our holidays were based on any of

394
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,680
 these other stories here. Here's some of his other miracles he had. He was at sea, he was at a boat,

395
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:38,000
 big storm came, he calmed the storm. Lame, boo, could you, that's nothing. Every year you get

396
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 like a bowl of water, he stayed around the bowl of water and someone shakes it. And the other

397
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,800
 person's like, "No, don't, don't." And then go, "That's it." That would be a lame holiday to have.

398
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,200
 That'd be a lame miracle to build a holiday around. Here's another one. It saved three

399
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,320
 innocent soldiers from execution. So people were about to be executed for a crime they didn't commit.

400
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,840
 And he shows up. It's so funny. So this dude was a priest. His uncle was like a mayor of the town,

401
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,680
 and he knew that Nicholas wanted to be a priest. So he goes, "Aye, you're a priest." He was super

402
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,680
 devout, a little bit of nepotism, but it was his calling. And so he's this priest for a while. And

403
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,560
 then like there was this thing where like the uncle died and a couple other town officials died,

404
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,800
 and the priests were like, "Oh, dude, we need a new bishop. Who should we elect as bishop?" And

405
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,080
 someone goes, "Tell you what, whoever is the first priest to walk through that door is the new

406
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,600
 bishop." And Nicholas just walks into the church and they're like, "Congratulations, Nicholas. You're

407
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:43,200
 a bishop. What? That's how they picked officials back then?" That is ripe for an Adam Sandler movie

408
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,160
 where it's basically just this dude, this shlubby guy who's down on his luck. And then there's like

409
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,280
 this diocese and they're like, "We don't know what to do. Bishop, archbishop, died. The first person

410
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,520
 who walked through that door is our new bishop." And he's like, "What?" And then like some old

411
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,000
 like third eye blind song starts playing and he's like training to be a priest. Make that movie,

412
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,360
 Adam Sandler. I think he's Jewish actually. Actually, no, I don't think he's Jewish. I know

413
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,680
 he's Jewish because he did the Hanukkah song. But still, make that movie, Adam Sandler.

414
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,360
 What was it? Oh, so anyways, he, um, not Adam Sandler. Nicholas walked through the door of the

415
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,640
 church and they go, "Hey, it's a new bishop." And he's like, "Hey, I'm a new bishop." And they lift

416
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,960
 him up on the shoulders. They dump a gatorade bucket of holy water on him. He's like, "Yeah." So,

417
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,440
 anyways, so as bishop, these three dudes are about to be executed and he's like, "Hey, stop it."

418
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,400
 And like put his hand on the sword and lowered it and let him go. That would be kind of cool. You'd

419
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,560
 be able to like carry swords around at Christmas time. That would be kind of cool. Any holiday that

420
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,880
 involves swords would be cool. But I don't think it would catch on and be kind of old after a while.

421
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,520
 Instead of the nativity scene, you just had three dudes standing, a guy with a sword walking around.

422
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,080
 So here's some cool versions though. I also should say this as well. The Council of Nicaea,

423
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,000
 right? This is how dope this dude was. So the Council of Nicaea was this thing where a bunch of

424
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,120
 bunch of priests, a bunch of dudes get together to figure out what should actually be in the Bible.

425
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:14,480
 Probably one of the biggest events to happen post the death and resurrection of Christ regarding

426
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,920
 Christianity easily, easily was a bunch of people getting together and saying, "What are we going

427
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,000
 to do with all of these stories? We're going to keep some of these. We're going to put some of these

428
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,680
 away." Like the Book of Enoch, that's when they removed it. They're like, "This is way too weird to

429
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,880
 be in the Bible. Let's put this book in." And it basically created Christianity and it wasn't

430
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,520
 just books. They were going into individual passages and editing them for clarity. Anyways,

431
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,760
 Nicholas was there. Saint Nicholas was at the Council of Nicaea. He was in one of the roll

432
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,360
 call sheets, but didn't appear in any other roll call sheet at all. Now some people say that he

433
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,240
 just kind of showed up and then bounced. Like he's like, "Ah, see you later nerds. You guys are just

434
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,160
 sitting around reading a book. I'm doing, I'm going to go pray and I'm going to talk to God. You guys

435
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,720
 can keep reading them dumb old scrolls." But some people say not that he said that, but there's another

436
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,320
 version of that. He goes to a Council of Nicaea and there's a debate over whether or not Jesus,

437
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:21,120
 God, and the Holy Spirit are one, the Holy Trinity, or that Jesus was a separate person from God.

438
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,000
 I guess you can guess which side one, because everyone talks about the Holy Trinity nowadays.

439
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,760
 But some people said, "No, no, no. Jesus was like a separate dude. He had God as one being and Jesus

440
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,600
 was a separate dude." So Nicholas believed in the Holy Trinity and this other guy believed in that it

441
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,440
 was just that Jesus and God were two separate people. And during the debate, Nicholas is listening

442
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,160
 to him and he's like, "Yeah, yeah, I understand that, but no, it's all like Jesus is God and God is

443
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,960
 Jesus, the Holy Spirit is the Holy Trinity." The other guy's like, "No, no, no, that doesn't make

444
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,520
 sense. Like, that's the two separate people." And at the Council of Nicaea, while they're debating

445
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,840
 what to put in the Bible, Nicholas punches the dude in the face, just socks this guy. And so

446
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:07,920
 that's the other version, is that he basically beat this dude up at a religious conference

447
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,440
 and they kicked him out. And that's why he's only in one roll called Sheep for the Council of Nicaea.

448
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,720
 So if he had stayed, there probably would have been way more fistfights in the Bible. They're

449
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,720
 like, "Hey, you know, this part about numbers is really cool where they're like counting all the

450
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,520
 sheep, but can we just insert the story where I go back in time and I'm beating up sheep?"

451
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,000
 They're like, "No, Nicholas, you can't keep putting yourself in the Bible." Anyways, so he was just

452
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,960
 beating people up at a religious conference, which is hilarious. Imagine a Christmas based on this

453
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,600
 story. Imagine a Christmas based on this story. This, what happened was when Nicholas was around,

454
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,400
 Christians were still getting tortured and murdered. And then, who was it? Constantine came into town

455
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,440
 and basically came into power and changed it into the Holy Roman Empire and all that stuff.

456
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,160
 And I know a bunch of historians just pulled their hair out of their head because I know I got some

457
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,640
 details wrong, but basically Christianity began to take off. It became the new thing. It became the

458
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,240
 meme that would eventually conquer entire swathes of the planet. So he was in that perfect time where

459
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,880
 he did get beat up a lot, which isn't part of the perfect time, but he suffered religious persecution

460
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,880
 and his beliefs stood up against that persecution. And then he got to get some of that sweet, sweet

461
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,880
 love from the people where people are no longer beating him up, but actually saying, "Hey, let's

462
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,080
 listen to what this guy has to say." So he began this thing where he was walking around and he would

463
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:40,080
 go to these pagan temples. He would leave the city, wouldn't just be sitting in his vestments, wouldn't

464
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,240
 be sitting all high and pretty. He would leave the city to go talk to the common folk, and he would

465
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,040
 come across these pagan structures that were built in the middle of nowhere, and he would walk up to

466
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,120
 them and he would begin to pray in front of them, because he would sense the demons inhabiting these

467
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:01,120
 buildings, and he would just sit down and he would begin to pray. In towns people are like, "What?

468
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:08,240
 Is he praying to our God? Is he praying to Hermes or Zeus or whoever is in that house?"

469
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:18,240
 And he'd be like, "Shh, praying in the house would fall apart." His prayers were so proud. You're

470
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,840
 like, "Jason, that story is probably the most unbelievable story you've told yet. Call me in a

471
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:31,680
 storm. Could just be good timing. Praying till the house blows up is probably, maybe that was also

472
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,600
 good timing. Maybe he happened to go, "Hmm, that's weird. I see termites. He's Batman. He is the old

473
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,160
 timey Batman. Maybe he was the world's greatest detective and he would walk around till he found

474
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,560
 a house that had a bunch of termites in it and go, "This house is also a shrine, isn't it?" And

475
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,440
 they're like, "Yeah, you're right. We worship termites." And he prays and the house falls apart.

476
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,680
 Or could just be a miracle. Like the place wasn't happening. You're like, "Jason, Jason, Jason."

477
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:04,240
 As skeptical as you are, are you really trying to say that maybe this dude prayed in front of a house

478
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,920
 until it fell apart? Well, hey man, it's a weird world. You know, that's the funny thing about

479
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,440
 being a skeptic. I think you can either be a skeptic or you just believe in everything. And

480
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,800
 that's not fun. That to me seems very dour existence where you don't believe in anything at all. Or

481
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,960
 you can be a skeptic like me. You can be sin-chooses and will totally mock certain beliefs and then go,

482
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,600
 "Well, maybe a dude prayed in front of a house, but at least I'm honest about it. At least I'm

483
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,520
 honest about it. It is ridiculous to think that a guy could pray in front of a house and it falls

484
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,440
 apart. That's some sort of miracle. And I embrace the ridiculousness of it. So at least I'm honest

485
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,920
 about it. At least I'm honest about my hypocrisy because I will trash-talk other weird beliefs and

486
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,160
 then be like, "Well, maybe there's one happening. Maybe a guy just was praying in it, Philip."

487
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,120
 But anyways, so even that's not the best part of the story. At one point he's walking, he sees the

488
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,640
 house, right? And he sees a bunch of demons floating around in it and he's like, "Oh,

489
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,720
 break out my praying hands!" He's getting down on his knees. And the demons start to talk to him,

490
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,920
 and this is what they say. "Do us no wrong!" Wrong, wrong. There's an echo. It's a really big

491
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,680
 house. It's a really big house. "Though we have committed no offense against thee, yet thou douse

492
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,520
 drive us from our home. It is here where we have long dwelt and led astray the people who worshiped

493
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:35,040
 us. And now where are we to go? To go? To go?" I love the fact that they admit they're like,

494
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,160
 "Yeah, dude. We were leading these dudes down the wrong path, but don't we weren't doing nothing to

495
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:48,240
 you? You? You?" Even in their summary they echo. And here's a response. So he's sitting there.

496
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,840
 So as he's sitting there, he's kind of like dusting off the ground. He's getting ready to kneel.

497
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,360
 And they're like, "Why are you coming after us, bro? Come on, man." So they

498
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:04,080
 ask, "So where are we to go?" And then he goes, he looks at him, dead pan and goes, "Go to the fire,

499
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,680
 the everlasting one, which has been prepared for the devil and his angels." Starts praying.

500
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,000
 No, no, the house blows up. Now, I think the quote's funny, one, because the demons do speak

501
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,400
 pretty proper Greek or whatever this is translated from, or whatever this is translated from.

502
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:30,400
 Also, I love the fact that he has to clarify where he goes, "Go to the fire." And then I imagine

503
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,800
 there's a long pause, the demons are like, "Huh? Which fire?" And he's like, "The everlasting one."

504
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,400
 And they're like, "Oh, he means hell. Oh, no, we didn't get that." Like, he has to be specific.

505
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,760
 I don't think you have to be specific when you're dealing with a horde of demons. Because there's

506
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,640
 not, if you say you're going to the fire, I don't think they're like, "Hmm, does he mean the fire

507
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,040
 sale? Does he mean Fire Island?" It's obvious hell. They're obviously adding that in for the reader.

508
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,200
 Someone reading this book back then, and they're like, "Go to the fire." They have to turn the page.

509
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,680
 "Oh, the everlasting one." The one, they're like, "Oh, he means hell." So anyways, he prays. Now, he also,

510
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,680
 eventually, there was a demon-possessed tree that apparently had Artemis in it. The people,

511
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:21,120
 it was super weird. So, these stories make it seem like they weren't these demons were impersonating

512
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:27,760
 Greek gods, which is an interesting thing. It's not that the demons were, it's not like he would,

513
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,760
 I was reading this on a Christian website, and it wasn't like they were saying that the Greek gods

514
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,320
 themselves were demons, but the demons were impersonating Greek gods. And I'm not saying that

515
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,880
 the Christian website I was getting from them believes that Artemis and Hermes and Zeus,

516
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,600
 but it also wasn't going so far to say the pagan gods were demons themselves. Apparently, the legend

517
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:54,000
 is, those gods don't exist at all, like the Christian version of the story is. There are no

518
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,480
 Greek gods, which I think is not a controversial statement to say in Christianity that there are

519
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,920
 no Greek gods, but it's not like Zeus was a demon. It's that these gods didn't exist at all, and

520
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,560
 these demons were inhabiting these buildings, these shrines that were built to these false idols.

521
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,720
 They would normally be built, there'd be nothing in them, and then a demon would find it in

522
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,040
 hide inside the building. And the same thing, there was just happened to be a tree that people

523
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,280
 were worshiping as Artemis, the goddess of the hunt. Now he's already been praying and making

524
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,520
 houses explode. This one, he finds out there's a demon in the tree, and he's just like done. He's

525
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,160
 so done with praying. People in town are like, "Hey, yeah, we prayed to that tree," and he looks over

526
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,640
 at it, and he sees a demon in it, and he's like, "Well, listen, prayer time's over. Wait, no, it's not.

527
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,120
 Pray to God, he still gets to pray. Prayer time's not over, but I'm going to chop that tree down." He

528
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:46,960
 picks the axe up, starts walking a tree. The demon just leaves the tree. He's like, "Oh, that was

529
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,320
 easy. Why didn't I have to pray all this time and blow houses up? I could have just carried an axe

530
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,880
 around and they would have left." And then he goes to another town. There's another tree, a demon

531
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,560
 possessed tree, and he goes, "I wonder if this will work again." Just walks up, grabs an axe,

532
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:10,960
 demon leaves. So, I think at that point, he probably realized there was a way easier way to do this.

533
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,040
 I didn't have to sit and pray and pray and pray until house exploded. I could have just carried

534
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,360
 an axe around the whole time, and the demons would have run away. However, the demons that ran away

535
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,480
 from the trees, did they end up in the everlasting fire? I'm assuming when he was praying, the houses

536
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,600
 exploded, and the demons went somewhere. So, maybe he was just getting lazy in the end, and he's like,

537
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,680
 "Ah, whatever. I don't care if this demon keeps hopping from tree to tree. I just don't want him

538
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,440
 in this town, not in my neighborhood." Now, imagine a Christmas based on that. Every year,

539
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,600
 your family gets together, just like carving a pumpkin, but you guys build a giant gingerbread

540
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:50,080
 house together. And then, you get a little like gross goo, and you throw it on it and be like,

541
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,640
 "These are demons." And then you put firecrackers in it and blow it up. Every year, instead of

542
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,720
 decorating your house for Christmas, you would build a smaller house in your front yard and blow

543
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,160
 it up. That would be way better, or maybe just if you were lazy, just carrying axe around in your

544
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,720
 front yard. And then you'd be like, "Oh, there's a demon in the tree and it left." If you couldn't

545
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,440
 afford to blow up a small house every year, that is how you would celebrate Christmas. But,

546
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,560
 that is not even his best miracle. That is not even his best miracle. Ladies and gentlemen,

547
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,920
 let me introduce you to the brine babies. Let me introduce you to why you've been

548
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:32,720
 staring perplexed at the image that has been linked on this podcast. Because as you have noticed,

549
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:39,120
 I'm sure that is not the standard Dead Rabbit logo for today's episode. For the past, what, 30,

550
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:45,120
 40 minutes you've been looking at it and going, "Get to this part of the story! I don't know what

551
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:50,960
 this image is!" And if you're not looking at the image, it is a medieval painting of St. Nicholas,

552
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:59,360
 a suspicious man lurking in the back hallway. And you're like, "That's not the most notable part

553
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,400
 of that picture. The man in the back hallway is not the most notable part of the picture." You have

554
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,720
 St. Nicholas, you have a creepy man in the hallway, and then you have three naked dudes hopping out

555
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:19,120
 of a barrel. You're like, "Jason, please tell us why this has anything to do with what the story is."

556
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:26,160
 I will, but first, let me talk about my Minecraft server. So, this is the deal. Minecraft server

557
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:33,040
 is in the show notes, but his most notable miracle is this. There was a famine coming

558
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:41,920
 through Turkey. People were starving. Now, generally when famines happen, first you eat.

559
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,800
 You're like, "Jason, just tell us what's in the picture. Don't do it. Show you a famine."

560
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:54,160
 I can just imagine people for the whole episode being like, "What is this? What is this picture?

561
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,840
 Why am I looking at it?" So, when famines strike, you're like, "Damn, Jason's really going to do

562
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,480
 this. Yes, I am." When famines strike, there's usually what happens is they eat all their food

563
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:11,120
 that they have available. Then they begin to eat their livestock, normally stuff that they provide.

564
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,720
 Like cows, if you drink the milk or chickens, you would eat the egg, but you're basically running

565
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,320
 out of food, so you just eat the chicken. Then you begin to eat your clothing. In modern times,

566
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:27,920
 you'd eat leather shoes or drywall. People eat drywall a lot during famines. Then you begin to

567
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:34,240
 eat each other. Now, this famine, they were in phase eating human meat. Now, it wasn't super open

568
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,560
 when this famine was going on. People were eating people, but you had to do it on the slide. You

569
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,640
 didn't want to sit down. I'm like, "The mailman's walking by and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not eating

570
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,840
 them in the bushes.'" But this butcher needed to make some money, needed to sell some food,

571
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:58,720
 and wanted to eat himself. So he grabs three boys and kills them and pickles them in a barrel of

572
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:06,400
 brine, and he's going to sell them as pork. Now, Nicholas is passing through town. This wasn't

573
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,320
 happening in his neighborhood because he came from a wealthy area. Like I said, he was traveling

574
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:16,560
 the countryside. He comes into town. He is Batman. He investigates this crime. He starts to realize,

575
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,920
 "Hmm, something's not up with these evil doers. I believe he's the saint. He should be the saint

576
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,400
 of rooftops." He's like standing on the rooftop all night long. He's like somewhere out there.

577
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,560
 Somebody's eating kids and I will find them. Could it be the Joker? He has to solve it. He comes into

578
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,080
 town and he's investigating the famine and trying to do what he can to feed people.

579
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,880
 And something clues him off because he's Batman. He is the world's greatest detective of

580
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:51,520
 the 300 AD. He's walking through town and he starts to become suspicious of a local butcher.

581
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:59,040
 And he goes to the butcher shop and he's like, "He puts on his infrared goggles." And he's like,

582
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,440
 "Interesting. I see someone's been here recently judging by the footprint." And then there's three

583
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,480
 little pairs of footprints added towards this bloody table. Okay, that's a little, that's a little

584
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,440
 dark. Even for me. He shuts off his infrared goggles. Butchers behind him with a knife. They're

585
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:20,800
 wrestling. Throws him over his back. Does it like a... Do you know in the new Batman movie,

586
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,920
 I thought this was so awesome. They're training Robert Pattinson on Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. So

587
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,200
 you're gonna... I'm basically learning the same fighting skill as Batman does. Anyways, throwing

588
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,000
 around arm bars, rear naked chokes, anaconda chokes. He's doing all the moves, all the moves that I

589
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,920
 know. And finally, St. Nicholas gets on top of the butcher and goes, "Now it's time to butcher you."

590
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,120
 He doesn't do that. That's stupid. He goes, he finally gets on top of the butcher, chokes him out

591
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:54,000
 completely. Falsely. Butcher's all tapping. He doesn't care. This guy's a criminal. Puts him out.

592
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,240
 Nicholas gets up and... Okay, I don't know if they actually got in a physical fight because in the

593
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,360
 drawing, the butcher is just walking in the background. I think most likely Nicholas broke

594
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,480
 into this place and the butcher walked by and goes, "Hey, what are you doing in my shop?"

595
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,360
 But it doesn't matter because at this point Nicholas opens up the barrel and sees the little

596
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:20,800
 dead boys in the... You're like, "Jayson, this is supposed to be a Christmas episode. Shame on you."

597
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:27,760
 Yes, this part's dark, but that's not the miracle. The miracle is that he found three corpses. That's

598
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:35,280
 not a miracle. The miracle is this. He then brings the three boys back to life. So they're coming

599
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:41,040
 out of the brine. He resurrects them. That is the biggest miracle that he ever did. Now,

600
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,880
 a couple different takeaways from this one. One, you have a man who can resurrect the dead,

601
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:53,360
 which is probably one of the biggest things you can do really ever. I mean, if that's in your

602
00:56:53,360 --> 00:57:01,360
 skill set, if you can resurrect the dead in your skill set, you are God. So that's a big miracle.

603
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:07,520
 I don't know how many other saints can put that on their belt, but he resurrected the dead. Two,

604
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,040
 that would be a dope haul. That would be a dope Christmas tradition. Every year, like if you're

605
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:18,160
 bad, you have to drink brine instead of coal and you're stuck in there like, "Oh man, even bad this

606
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,520
 year. Here, drink some brine." And remember all the murdered pork babies. Remember the brine babies

607
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,680
 before you go and go, "I don't want to be a brine baby. Well, then you should be better next year."

608
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,520
 If you're bad, you're a brine baby. That would be awesome. And the fact that you would have,

609
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:40,080
 like, imagine having your Christmas story involve cannibalism and children being pickled and turned

610
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:45,680
 into pork and then having to sit down at a table eating meat with your family. Maybe we

611
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:52,160
 would have vegetarian holidays. I don't know. I'd like to imagine this. Listen, you're a kid,

612
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,600
 you get murdered by a butcher, you get pickled, you get brought back to life. And my first,

613
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,120
 my first, when I read this story, I thought this would be my first thing. I'd pop out of the barrel

614
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:09,840
 and I'd be like, "Awesome. Thanks. But can you unpickle me? Like, here's the thing. You imagine

615
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:16,400
 these kids were pickles at that point. Like, when you're brought back to life, are you restored to

616
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,720
 your point the moment before you die? Like, or are they, were they permanently pickled? Weren't

617
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,680
 these poor boys permanently pickle boys? Brine babies? Were they walking around town? They're

618
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:35,200
 super green. They're all wrinkly. How did that work? I would assume, because see, now we're asking

619
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,960
 a whole bunch of questions. Like, if your head got chopped off and a saint put your head back on and

620
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,600
 brought you back to life, you would assume that now you, your head's not going to roll off every time

621
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:51,360
 you turn to your body too quickly. But, it's like being stabbed and having your wound healed and come

622
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:57,040
 back to life is one thing. Having leprosy and not losing any body parts or having like a disease

623
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,600
 where you're internally damaged and then having that disease cured and coming back to life,

624
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:08,480
 that's, but you, they were killed, they weren't killed in brine. They were killed and then put

625
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,000
 in pickle juice and then brought back to life. So, their injuries were healed. Were they still

626
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 pickled? Is my question. And you're like, Jason, you're really nitpicking this one because these

627
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,360
 kids came back from the afterlife. It wouldn't matter how wrinkly their skin were or the fact

628
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,560
 that they smelled like vinegar up until their late 80s when they finally died. I'm still curious,

629
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,000
 though, because I would have been like, hey, thanks a lot, dude, for bringing me back to life.

630
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,680
 First off, you could have been here, you could have been here about a day earlier. Stop the whole

631
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,080
 thing. But I appreciate you bringing me back to life. But also, please unpickle me. Like,

632
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:48,000
 what's that part of the process? Secondly, you know, no case of the kids come back to life. They

633
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,160
 jump out of the brine. They may be pickled. They may be not. They're immediately starving to death

634
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,880
 because they're still a massive famine hitting the area. But I'm assuming, I'm assuming that the

635
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,480
 kids were real fed. I'm assuming there's some other minor miracles. At one point, he made a

636
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,760
 bunch of wheat. They took a boat and they unloaded like a ton of wheat off the boat. And then the

637
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,080
 boat went to its main destination and still had all the wheat on it. So he could multiply food and

638
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:18,880
 stuff like that as well. He ends up having all these miracles about him. He passes away. He becomes

639
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:27,760
 such a major religious figure that he becomes one of the only non-warrior saints that was worshiped

640
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:35,760
 during the Crusades. People were stopping by his church. Now, we still got one more super bizarre

641
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,160
 story to talk about Saint Nicholas, because at this point, he is Saint Nicholas. In the year

642
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,480
 1,000, I think it was 48. So when he died, people knew this dude was legit. He has all these magical

643
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,640
 powers. These three little brine babies show up at his funeral. They're like, "Yeah, it was us. It was

644
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,840
 us." People are like, "Yeah, we know it was you." He smelled like vinegar and they're like, "Ah,

645
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,880
 shut up. He brought us back to life." So people knew this guy was legit. They start the saint process

646
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:07,760
 pretty early on for him. But when you're a saint, your bones become like holy relics. Now, his bones,

647
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:15,600
 when we look back, there was this story that they secreted a rose water smelling liquid

648
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:23,600
 that people attributed to being mana or myrrh. And by drinking the liquid, you could get super

649
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:30,720
 power, not super powers so much, but like supernatural abilities. Very, very vague stuff.

650
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:37,440
 And you're like Jason, old, timey superstitions, whatever. The Muslims ends up invading the

651
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,120
 area that his bones are interred in. And these dudes are like, "Dude, we can't let

652
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:46,320
 them get these bones." They don't have enough time to take the whole skeleton, so they take his

653
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:52,880
 major bones. So I'm assuming ribcage, skull, shoulder blades, stuff like that. They couldn't get

654
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,440
 all of them though. So they take as much of his body as they can, take it out of the country,

655
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,480
 bring it back to myrrh, which is why he's also known as Saint Nicholas of Myrrh or Nicholas of Myrrh.

656
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,280
 They bring his bones out there, and the legend continues. People go, "It's so weird,

657
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,680
 like when they bring the bones to the church, they're like, why are your hands so wet?" And they're

658
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,480
 like, "Dude, this is totally trippy. His bones keep shooting out water. It's almost like a super

659
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,880
 choker, but a skeleton." And so they begin bottling his, they said, "Every year you can get like a

660
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,920
 flask of his liquid that's coming out of his bones." And they would mix it with a little bit of holy

661
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,160
 water and they'd sell it. They'd have these little glass vials, a little picture, little tiny

662
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,000
 Saint Nicholas on it. And if you flipped it over, there's three little tiny brain babies on the back.

663
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,280
 And people were like, as time went on, people go, "Oh, that story's just completely ridiculous. There

664
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:50,160
 has to be a logical reason for that." Because it is true. There is a liquid coming out of his bones.

665
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:58,720
 And so in the 1950s, the 1950s, they had to do a reconstruction on his, and at this point,

666
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,960
 they've gotten the rest of his bones out of Turkey. There was some naval fleet going through

667
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,720
 during the Crusades and they're like, "Stop. We got to go to this church and get the rest of this

668
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:12,000
 dude's bones." And they've done all sorts of tests on the bones over the years, because he's one of

669
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,640
 the biggest saints out there. And when they test the bones, they go, "These bones definitely came

670
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:22,320
 from the same person. It looks like the skeleton was about 70 years old, 73 years old, which is when

671
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:28,160
 we know around the time that Saint Nicholas died. Looks like his nose got broken while he was still

672
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,400
 alive. We think that could have been while he was being tortured." So they really do believe that

673
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,080
 this is the skeleton of Saint Nicholas. And it has pretty good, what's that thing called, when you

674
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,280
 kind of have like a chain of command or a chain of custody? It has pretty good chain of custody.

675
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,760
 No one's really disputing that these aren't the bones of Saint Nicholas. What people were wondering

676
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,800
 is, why are they leaking water after all these centuries? And so when they pop the tomb open,

677
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,920
 they're going to do a reconstruction on it. They see that there's water in the tomb. And people go,

678
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,400
 "Oh, that makes sense." Like the old stories are probably fake, but there was probably some ground

679
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,000
 water in his actual tomb. And the water that's been leaking out is, you know, like kind of gross

680
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,360
 spring water kind of mixed with corpse. People have been drinking it for a couple hundred years.

681
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,320
 It's not going to kill you. It's just a little tiny drop that solves that. And so they put the

682
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:22,160
 bones on this like linen cloth while they're working doing the reconstruction on the tomb. And then

683
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:28,160
 when they come back, the cloth is wet and they're like, "Oh, that just must be residual water from

684
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,560
 the tomb." But while the bones were out of the tomb that was being reconstructed, the bones kept

685
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:41,520
 leaking water. And they've done tests on it and they say it appears to be water. It appears to be

686
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,360
 water. But they can't explain why it's coming out of the bones. And to this day, apparently, I tried

687
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:53,440
 buying this online, but I don't think you can. Apparently, to this day, you can go to visit

688
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,400
 his bones and then there's like a gift shop to the left where you can buy a little vial that has

689
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:04,560
 a drop of the liquid that comes out of his bones. So still a miracle. Now here's my thing. Would you,

690
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:10,480
 if someone says, "Hey man, I got this little toe bone and it's from a saint." And if you chew on it

691
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,360
 or you turn it into a powder and drink it like a tea, you'll get superpowers. I would probably do

692
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,640
 that. I'd probably do that. If someone goes, "Here's a liquid that's leaked out of a toe bone."

693
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:26,400
 Drink it. I don't know if I would drink it. I mean, I'd be like, "First off, what are the superpowers?"

694
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,400
 The toe bone, I would do that just for bragging rights. Be like, "Oh dude, I read about a saint

695
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,440
 in a history book." I'm like, "Haha, totally ate that dude's toe bone." Like I would totally be down for

696
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:44,240
 powdered toe bone. But if it wasn't powdered, I don't know why I have...

697
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:49,760
 I don't know why. It's grosser that it's a liquid. This is what I'm saying. If someone was like,

698
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,280
 "Here, you take this toe bone, you just hold it up and you shake it and a bunch of liquid comes out

699
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,920
 of it and you drink it." You'll get superpowers. I don't know if I could do that. I actually,

700
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,320
 okay, let me phrase it. I couldn't do that, but I don't know if I would enjoy it. My first question

701
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,000
 would be like, "What superpowers?" And they're like, "Well, you can astral travel." I'd be like,

702
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,160
 "Nope." It would have to be something good like flight or invisibility or something. Something,

703
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,920
 super strength, the ability to turn myself as strong as a toe bone. I'm like, "Ugh."

704
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,840
 Whenever someone punches me, I'd just become a toe bone, a giant toe bone. And then I'm like, "Haha,

705
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:26,640
 you thought you defeated me?" And then I beat him up. My fists turn into giant toe bones. If I could do

706
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:34,640
 that, I would drink the liquid, but otherwise probably not. And let's end this story like this.

707
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:41,600
 Because every good thing has a dark side. That's not true. There's a lot of things that are just

708
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:49,840
 good, like puppies or cats or pancakes. But sometimes good things have bad things. So with

709
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:56,560
 that vague answer, we are going to leave behind the bones of St. Nicholas. And we are going to travel

710
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,800
 one more time back in time to the 1700s. Because, see, people really, really loved St. Nicholas.

711
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,400
 They really loved those little vials. They believed if you take a drink of that bone juice mixed with

712
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:15,680
 some holy water, good things would happen for you. And so for one woman, it became a weapon of mass

713
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:23,440
 destruction. In the 1700s, there was a woman named Teofania di Adamo. And she is credited for creating

714
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:30,320
 a drink known as aqua tofano. It was a little tiny vial. Had a little picture of St. Nicholas on it.

715
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:40,560
 Filled with water and a drop of the juice of Nicholas's bones. However, she just had a bottle

716
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:49,680
 of water. And instead of the Nicholas juice, just a tiny bit of arsenic or any other flavorless poison.

717
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,200
 And she would give it out to women who were having trouble with their husbands,

718
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:00,400
 businessmen who were having trouble with their partners. Anyone for any reason who could afford

719
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:08,720
 some aqua tofano would come to her. She would hand them a little tiny vial decorated with one of the

720
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:16,080
 most venerated saints in Catholicism. And they would give it to someone as a gift. Here, drink and

721
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:26,640
 be merry. Have some bone juice. 600 people are believed to have died because of aqua tofano.

722
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:35,680
 Including Mozart. So remember, dear listeners, as you're opening your presents this year for

723
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:43,280
 Christmas, that the person giving you those presents may not be a jolly man from the North Pole.

724
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:50,960
 May not be a figure based on a real life saint who performed some amazing miracles.

725
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:59,520
 It may be from a human, a human who hates you, a human who wants nothing more than to poison you

726
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:06,400
 and end your existence on planet Earth. So if you happen to get a vial of liquid as a present,

727
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,240
 even though you asked for one, exactly what I wanted, mom, you say as you hold up the tiny vial

728
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:19,280
 of liquid filled with bone juice and holy water, be careful before you drink it. Because even though

729
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:29,440
 this is Christmas, a time of joy and cheer, it can also be a time of murder, a time of darkness,

730
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:40,640
 a time of paranormal conspiracy and true crime. And who knows, if you fall into one of those categories,

731
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:46,960
 you may end up being covered next year on Dead Rabbit Radio's Christmas Special.

732
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:54,000
 MWAH! It's basically that ending is more fitting for a Halloween special,

 we're just gonna roll with it. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is gonna be your email address. You can also
