1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Two skeletons found in a forest full of mysteries.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 And then we take a look at Bloody Mary.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Urban legend, vengeful spirit, psychological game for young girls,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 or is the truth somewhere in between all three of those?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 We'll find out today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm the host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. I'm still feeling really lazy.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I woke up about... hey let me check my clock.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I woke up about five, six hours ago and have just kind of been putting around.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Putting around, you know what I think it is too?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I started playing this video game again.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I really think, and I can't speak for everyone's experiences with video games,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 but for me, video games seem to really sap my enthusiasm to do other things.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 It's like a flash game. It's this card game called Elements that I play on the internet.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 It's like a free browser-based game and it just like... blah.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I mean, I enjoy it, but I think it saps my energy,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 so I think I have to take a break from it for a while.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We got a lot to talk about today though.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 We have a lot of stuff to talk about today.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 First story is a story that I have dubbed "Forrest Child Skeletons"

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 because I didn't really come up with a good title, but let's see if I can come up with a better one now.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I will call it, I'll be like the Crip Keeper. I'm gonna call this story, "Sticks and Bones."

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 We're going to Vancouver. We're going to Canada.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Specifically, we're going to a little forested area known as Stanley Park.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Or as I like to call it? No, it's joking. We're going to Stanley Park, Vancouver.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 The year is 1953 and there are two hikers moving.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 It's funny because hikers, I don't think I'd ever want to be like a professional hiker

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 because they always stumble across bodies.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Whenever you read these stories about bodies being found, it's like two hikers are in the wood.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 One hiker was in the wood.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 A group of hikers, "Hey, why be a hiker?"

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 This is like just part of...

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 You're hiking to enjoy nature and not to find little skeletons.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 But anyways, these hikers find little skeletons.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And the children skeletons, to be precise.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 They're not just like adult humans that have shrunk.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 They're actually children skeletons, which makes it sadder.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 A bunch of little bones.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And then, to make it even more sad, they had like aviator helmets.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Oh, like they were playing and pretending to be like pilots and stuff.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 They had like little kid clothes.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Little helmets.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 They were probably out like being like, "Now this is what I call pod racing. What's that mean?"

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I don't know, but weeee, and they're just like having fun.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And then they died. Terrible. Terrible.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Both bodies too.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 The first thing you would think, well, maybe it was an accident,

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 but both bodies were covered up by a raincoat.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So whoever left the bodies there...

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Like, so, well, somebody left the bodies there.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So not like two kids in aviator helmets who were running around in the woods.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 They both tripped on a log and broke their necks and just died.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Somebody left them there.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 When the cops get there, that's the scene.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Two skeletons, two little skeletons, two little aviator helmets.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 So that's heartbreaking.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And a raincoat covering them.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And a single woman's shoe.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Now, obviously this becomes a big story because obviously the age of the victims,

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 plus the mystery of it, like how did this happen?

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 It's not like the two kids fell out of a bus and got ran over.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 It was like, "We got these two skeletons. We gotta figure out what's going on."

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And they're little skeletons. Little kid skeletons.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So they look at the skeletons, they observe it, and they go,

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 "One skeleton's a boy, and one skeleton's a girl."

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So the police, I mean, this was a huge effort.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 It is back in 1953, if I didn't say that already, 1953.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So the police are going basically through every missing case

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 where there is a brother and a sister or a boy and a girl.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 They can't find anything.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 They're talking to people who are at the park that day,

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and people are like, "Yeah, you know, I did see like a woman and two boys go into the woods,

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 so then they would try to track down this woman,

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 and she'd be like, "Oh no, they're right here. Here's Heckel and Jekkel, my sons."

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Like, every lead was dead end, but they looked for years to try to solve this case.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So they're thinking, "Okay, these kids probably died.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 It's in 1953 we found the bodies. They're the skeletons.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 We have this raincoat, this shoe, and these aviator cats."

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 We think the crime probably took place within like a year or two of us finding the bodies.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 We think that that's our goal.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 So that was kind of where their window was for looking for missing kids.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 They started going to schools and saying, "Do you have any kids missing?"

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 In the area, people were like, "Well, you know, we got tardy kids,

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 but we don't really have a boy and a girl missing."

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 This went on for a long, long time.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Now, stories were like people, witnesses would come to the police and they would tell a story,

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 and the cops would be like, "That doesn't fit the window that we're looking in.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 That doesn't, we don't think that crime happened then."

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Because otherwise, they're just people are going to be like,

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 "Yeah, two Egyptians were running through the woods. Like, you have to have like a window."

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But then two things came up. Two things popped up that kind of made the cops go,

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 "Uh, we probably could have handled this a bit better."

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 In 1998, they do a DNA test. So DNA is now readily available.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 They do a DNA test. They find out that it's not a boy and a girl.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 It's two half-brothers. They're both boys and they both have the same mom.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 So now the cops are like, "Every time we investigated a boy and a girl,

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 it was basically a waste of time."

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And then, I don't know why it took them so long to figure this out,

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 and then they figured out that the shoe, the woman's shoe, was only sold before World War II.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So now they're like, "We really screwed the pooch on this thing."

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And what's interesting is one of the reports they got when they were looking into this case,

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 a couple came to the cops and said, "You know, we were at that park back in 1944."

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And the cops immediately were like, "Ah, that's too far back, but go ahead and tell your story."

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 They said, "We were at that park in 1944 and we saw a woman..."

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 We're just hanging out, hiking, doing our thing.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 "A woman runs out of the bushes, screaming, crying uncontrollably, just runs past them."

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And they said, "We thought it was weird for multiple reasons.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Not just that an adult woman came and was screaming out of the bushes.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 We thought she needed help, but she just kept running."

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 But they said it was also weird because the weather was really bad.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 She didn't have a coat on.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And we noticed she only had one shoe.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 So is it possible that they saw the woman who had murdered...

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Most likely, if they're half-brothers, most likely they were killed by their mother.

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 That was the woman who was leaving the scene.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Did they catch a glimpse of the murderer?

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Were they there the day those two little boys got murdered?

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And their bodies just were laid there somewhere in the forest for nine years before they were discovered?

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Or was it just happenstance?

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Was it just some...she screams through everywhere.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 She runs the best buy with no jacket and one shoe just screaming.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Is it two totally separate events?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 The thing is, nobody knows, it's still considered an unsolved mystery.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Here's what's creepy.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Most likely, that woman went on to live a fairly normal life.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Went to church, met another man, got pregnant, had another kid.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Like this woman, unless she ran straight off and jumped into a river and they never found her body.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 This woman most likely reintegrated herself into normal human society.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And the whole time she was sitting at PTA meetings or making cookies for her new kids,

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 or lying on her own death bed 30 years later surrounded by her family.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 She knew she left two boys to rot in the middle of the forest next to their aviator helmets.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Absolutely bizarre.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And nobody else would have ever known or ever guessed in her normal life that she could commit such a barbaric act.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 She just lived on as those boys were exposed to the elements, slowly decayed, and just became two unknown skeletons lost in the woods.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 So on that happy note, on that cheery note, let's go ahead and move on to the story of Bloody Mary.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Now I started talking about Bloody Mary a bit yesterday because I forgot what topic I was covering.

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But let me go over that again briefly.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Bloody Mary, I think I have a love/hate relationship with her.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I think it's more of a love/scar relationship with her.

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I think depictions of Bloody Mary in movies, she's always kinda hot actually.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Now I'm talking about Urban Legends Bloody Mary, that movie where she died in college.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I'm not talking about the stories where she's a creepy little girl like Samara,

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 but I don't know, they've always depicted her as kinda like this edgy goth scene hanging out in your bathroom.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I can almost imagine, I can smell the clothes cigarettes while I'm in there.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Like just some sort of edgy chick, which I've always been kinda into.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But maybe that's why I get that, maybe it's from my fascination with Bloody Mary.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I've personally never done Bloody Mary, just like I've never used the Ouija board.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 The last room I want haunted in my house is my bathroom.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 It's where I go to kinda chill, and it's funny, even though I live by myself,

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 the bathroom is a very relaxing spot.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 When you live with someone else, the bathroom is the most relaxing spot in the house,

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 but even when I'm by myself, like the bathroom's very relaxing.

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 That's the last place I want haunted, one for that, because I want to be able to chill out in my bathroom.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Two, the last place I want a ghost to get me is in a shower,

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 where I basically no longer have the ability to fight.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I can fight in every room in my house, except a shower, because it's all wet and slimy.

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Well, probably shouldn't be slimy if I wash it more often, but you know, it's wet.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Anyone can beat you up in a shower. I don't care who you are.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Okay, maybe that guy from Eastern Promises could hold his own in a shower, but I wouldn't be able to.

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I'd much rather have a ghost attack me. Here's the rooms that I want to get attacked by ghosts in.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 A living room would be cool, because I'm fairly familiar with it, and it's surrounded by weapons.

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I got something, I got like a box knife to my right there.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I have a club down to my left, and I see an umbrella in the corner,

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 and I have a whole wall of sticks and clubs and baseball bats by the door, because self-defense.

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So I'm pretty cool in my living room.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 My bedroom, I don't have a big problem with fighting ghosts in my bedroom,

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 but I would hate to be sleeping, and it goes start messing with me,

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 because then it's going to be able to get in that first strike.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Like, at least in a living room, I'd start to see stuff levitate towards me,

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 and your light bulbs go out and stuff like that, and I'd be like, "It's here."

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And then I could start grabbing my weapons and start flailing at nothing, hoping to hit something.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And then in the bedroom of its like though, because it's pretty much going to get first blow.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Usually when I'm in the bedroom, the lights off, so it's going to have an advantage to the dark.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I've thought a lot about this, you can tell.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I wouldn't want to fight a ghost in my kitchen, only because if a ghost can turn lights on and off,

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 and turn faucets on and off, it would make sense it would be able to turn the stove on and off.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So it could just turn the stove on when I'm not looking, when I'm washing my dishes.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And then it just punched me once and I fall on the grill, and I'm like, "Ahh! Ahh!"

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 I mean, again, like, a ghost could push me over in my living room when I'm pretty good,

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 maybe it could levitate like a knife to come after me,

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 but I think I'd be pretty, pretty well able to like block a knife.

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 A flying knife through a ghost, not saying like Chuck Norris with a knife,

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I would see it coming, unless I guess it was floating behind me,

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 but I think I'd hear like, "Oooooooh!" as it would come through the air.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 But if it just turned on my stove, or what if I didn't know my stove was on,

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and I go, "I just laying on my stove, fucking idiot!"

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I put my hand down. I put a can of that, you know, that "shh" that spray you put on,

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 what's that stuff called? The grease?

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 I have this butter flavored grease, I spray my frying pan with some stuff to stick to it.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I stuck that can on a grill on my stove the other day,

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 and I go, "That is probably the dumbest thing I could have done."

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Like, anything could have accidentally happened, I could have turned this on and blown up,

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 but anyways, we don't want to fight a ghost in my kitchen.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Definitely don't want to fight a ghost in my bathroom.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 That's a long about way of saying, "That's one of the reasons why I've never done Bloody Mary."

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 "Oh, basement would be terrifying to fight a ghost in a tube, luckily I don't have a basement."

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Because they would just grab you as you were walking down the stairs,

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 just hand would come out, and again, first strike.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You want to have first strike when you fight a ghost is what I'm saying,

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 but anyways, don't want to haunt my bathroom.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 The story of Bloody Mary, it's funny because nobody knows where this legend comes from.

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 It kind of just popped up in the consciousness of America, and it's fairly worldwide at this point.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 But the farthest thing to really trace it back is the 1950s.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Now before that, there was a... they think that it was related to an old parlor game,

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 which is a way that a young woman could tell who she was going to get married to, or if she's going to get married at all.

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 This was an old game, this is hilarious, this is an old game from the early 1900s.

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So it would make sense that if it started off, let's say, 1910, by the 1950s, that it evolved to Bloody Mary.

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 The 1900s, they would tell a young girl, "Hey, you want to know who you want to marry?"

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And they're like, "Oh yes, I do, I do, I do."

211
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Okay, so you have to walk up a flight of stairs backwards. Okay, that's doable.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 In the dark, holding a candle in a mirror.

213
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I think the end result of the game is it's Darwinian, that any girl who's dumb enough to do this game doesn't pass on her genes to other people,

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 because walking up the stairs backwards in the dark is hard enough.

215
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Carrying open flame, not a good idea while you're doing it.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But they say if you walk backwards up a staircase holding a candle in the dark, and look in the mirror, you'll see one of two things.

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Either a man will appear behind you, and you'll be like, "Oh, my true love. Oh, my heart's a flutter."

218
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Or you see a skull behind you, and that means you will die before you find your husband.

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And then I'm assuming shortly after that you just fall down the stairs and catch on fire.

220
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 So that was an old game that was played.

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Mirrors have had a long history of being used in fortune telling.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 There's been superstitions with mirrors, obviously break a mirror, seven years bad luck,

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 but you're supposed to cover up mirrors in the presence of dead people so their souls don't get trapped in the mirror, things like that.

224
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 But from that old superstition about walking backwards upstairs, we don't really see any evolution of it,

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 even if it's even connected. What we see is the story of Bloody Mary popping up in the 1950s.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, for those of you who are four years old and never heard the story of Bloody Mary,

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 tons of origins, but these are pretty much the basics.

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 You go into a darkened bathroom, have a candle, or not, but the candle helps to the actual illusion.

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 We'll talk about the science in a second.

230
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 But anyways, if you go into a dark bathroom with a light off and you say, "Before I say this,

231
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I hope you're not listening to this podcast in your bathroom with a light off."

232
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Just, just, just, put it out there.

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 If you're in the bathroom with your light off and you say, "Bloody Mary, bloody Mary, bloody Mary."

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 You will see Bloody Mary standing in your mirror, searching how she's looking at you from the mirror.

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Now, there are a lot of variables. That's kind of the basic overview.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 There is a lot of variables. Sometimes you say it three times, she appears behind you.

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So you are looking at your reflection of the mirror and you don't see her in the mirror, you see her standing behind you.

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Sometimes she comes out of the mirror, sometimes she attacks you, claws your eyes out, mutilates you, or you simply vanish.

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 These are all variations of it.

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Sometimes she possesses you, sometimes she replaces you, which I don't know if there's much of a difference there.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I think Bloody Mary really is a game for young girls.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 You do see guys play it from time to time, but it really is a game for young girls.

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I believe it did come from the original Walking Up the Stairs backwards game.

244
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I think that it's primarily a game that girls play and that's why some of the stuff plays into things like,

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 if possesses you, replaces you, if I got possessed by Bloody Mary, she would be sorely disappointed with her life.

246
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 She's like, "I went from an eternal realm of malevolence to this."

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And she's like, "Damn it, she's like cleaning up my apartment, she's scrubbing my dishes, she's like Jason said he washed his dishes on his podcast, he doesn't wash his dishes."

248
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 She's like, "Oh my God, he sleeps in this bed, she would be sorely disappointed and if she replaced me, that would be even more bizarre because then she would come out of the mirror as me?"

249
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Like a figure possesses me, she goes into my body, but is it like a shallow howl thing where if she comes out of the mirror, is my body gone?

250
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And people see her as me, again she'd be sorely disappointed.

251
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 These are the different variations of the story and there's also different ways you can summon her.

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 You can say Bloody Mary three times or sometimes you have to say it twelve times, which I would just get bored at that point.

253
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I'd be like, "Ah, Bloody Mary."

254
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 You can say, "I killed your baby, Bloody Mary."

255
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Ooh, that's a little harsh.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 That's a little rough.

257
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So that's, I didn't hear that version until I researched this story.

258
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 "I killed your baby, Bloody Mary."

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 That's like telling a yo mama joke to a cryptid, like that's really deep.

260
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Or, here's an odd version, there was, it's funny actually, I think this is retconned because they don't know how old the Bloody Mary story is,

261
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 but apparently back in 1787 there was a Scottish poet named Robert Burns who mentioned Bloody Mary, so the history is real wonky on this.

262
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 He says you can summon her by holding a candle, looking in a mirror, and eating an apple.

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So, that's weird.

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Like, why an apple?

265
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 I mean, I guess, all of it's bizarre, all of it's bizarre, but it's such a bizarre, like, to me that's such a weird detail.

266
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 And the fact that this Scottish poet was doing this, probably like, "Gee, that seems like..."

267
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And it's funny because, I've talked about this before, with rituals, how did they figure out what phrase to say three times or twelve times or whatever?

268
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 How you couldn't accidentally say, "Ah, Bloody Mary."

269
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 "Ah, Bloody Mary."

270
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 "Ah, Bloody Mary."

271
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And then wouldn't it be something you discover on accident?

272
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And a ritual would have, like, what if you only said it one time, what if you only said it two times?

273
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I could imagine somebody accidentally eating an apple with a candle in front of a mirror.

274
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I think that is something that was probably quite common back in the day.

275
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I could see someone accidentally walking into a dark bathroom in 1787, going, "Where did I put my..."

276
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Not my cell phone, 'cause I don't know the address.

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 "Where did I put my leather-bound book?"

278
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And then he takes a bite out of an apple, in the bathroom he looks up and there's a girl.

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I could see that accidentally happening.

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 But I don't think anyone has ever accidentally walked into a bathroom going, "I killed your baby, Bloody Mary," and then a ghost popped out.

281
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 So that's why I'm always a little suspicious of rituals.

282
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 But that's another way you can do it, apparently.

283
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Have a candle, eat an apple in a dark bathroom.

284
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Some people say that Bloody Mary is based on Mary I, who killed a bunch of Protestants, and interestingly enough,

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 she lost a lot of children and they think that's why the "I killed your baby, Bloody Mary"

286
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 is a reference to her specifically.

287
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Some people believe it refers to Elizabeth Bathory, the known as the Queen of Blood,

288
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 who supposedly sacrificed a bunch of urgins and bathed in their blood and stuff like that.

289
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 She believed they would make her eternally young.

290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 We'll probably do another story on that, but she's fairly well known.

291
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 They made a movie about her starring Freaky Muniz.

292
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 So it's like, I don't know if I'm gonna cover that, but she's one of the origins, supposedly, of Bloody Mary.

293
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 The other one is a woman named Mary Worth, which, depending on which legend you hear,

294
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 she was either a witch killed at the Salem Witch Trial, or the version that I always heard of Bloody Mary.

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So we've kind of talked about all this stuff.

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 The version I heard of Bloody Mary was this.

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 There was a young woman who was super vain growing up.

298
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 She was basically one of the plastics.

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 She was the hottest chick in town.

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 She's super vain, but she suffers some sort of horrible accident.

301
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I think it had something to do with a ghost turning on her stove and she fell on it.

302
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 But she suffers some sort of horrible accident.

303
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Her loved ones wouldn't let her see her newly disfigured face because they knew she would go into shock.

304
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 So they covered up all of the mirrors in the house, but Curiosity got the best of her,

305
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 and apparently she just couldn't feel her lumpy, deformed face.

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Curiosity got the best of her.

307
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 One night when everyone was asleep, she walked--

308
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Again, this is what I heard as a kid.

309
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 She walked into one of the rooms and--

310
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 not just any room, a bathroom with a mirror, and she took the cover off,

311
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 and she saw her hideous face, and then she jumped into the mirror.

312
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 This story terrified me as a kid, by the way.

313
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 She jumped into the mirror and she vowed to kill anyone who ever mentioned her name or something like that.

314
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 I think I first heard the story of Bloody Mary when I was like 6, and it terrified me.

315
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 But again, I was like, "Oh, she's kind of hot."

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Not the disfigured part, but--

317
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 And it always terrified me.

318
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It was a very big game growing up when I was a kid in the 80s,

319
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 that there was this girl in the mirror that if you went in the bathroom and said "Bloody Mary" three times,

320
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 the version story I heard was she would come out and she would claw your eyes out for looking at her.

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 There was a story that I always heard growing up.

322
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 So I never did it. I had a bunch of friends do it and stuff like that.

323
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It really terrified me.

324
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And a lot of times when they tell that story, the girl in that story's name is Mary Worth.

325
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Now, it is a true urban legend.

326
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It seems like every neighborhood has their own version of this story.

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 How it works, who to call, not how it works, how to call her, what she does to you.

328
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But there are certain elements that are always the same.

329
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 One, it's always a young woman.

330
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 It's a girl. It's never a man. Other than Candy Man, which you wouldn't have was, that's fake.

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I'm not like "Bloody Mary's real" well, she might be, but it's always a young woman.

332
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 There's always a mirror involved.

333
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Those seem to be the two elements that are always the same in America,

334
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 because we're going to go to another example here and then I'm going to wrap this all up.

335
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I know this sounds really rambly, but there is a hypothesis that the nerds have put out.

336
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 You know, nerds just can't let anything just be weird and wacky.

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 A bunch of nerds got together and they said there has to be a psychological reason

338
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 why Bloody Mary is so prevalent in American society.

339
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 They said as they smoked their pipes, not noticing the smell of clove smoke coming from their bathroom,

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 as Bloody Mary can't wait to hear what they have to say.

341
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 They say "Bathroom is a pl-" I'm not making this up.

342
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 I came across this a couple different times in my research.

343
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 The bathroom is a place where a lot of girls have periods

344
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 and the blood is mysterious and it's this time of transition and they're scared

345
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 and it means they're becoming an adult and that is why Bloody Mary takes place in bathrooms and involves blood.

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Like, "Thanks, okay nerds, you can leave the room now.

347
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 It's time for everyone else to hang out."

348
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Like, I get that they want to try to explain that away, but that really seems like a stretch to me.

349
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I'm sure somebody got, like, that was their dissertation or something on, like,

350
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 the origin of Bloody Mary and the psychological effect on young women and going through puberty.

351
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 I'm sure that that was somebody's big brouhaha- like, that was somebody's big, like, moment to come up with this theory,

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 but I don't really think it holds water.

353
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Now, to be fair, I don't know much about women's- actually, that's not true.

354
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I did have to take a class in college and we discussed the history of menstruation,

355
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 but it just doesn't wash from me.

356
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 It just doesn't- that theory doesn't wash from me. It seems like they're overreaching it.

357
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I think that it is.

358
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Kids don't like bathrooms anyways.

359
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 It's the one room in the house where you- I mean, you kind of have a love-hate relationship with bathrooms,

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 because it's the one room in the house where you kind of have a little bit of peace and quiet,

361
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 but it's also the one room in the house where you are always alone

362
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 and it's always lit differently than the rest of the house.

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It's generally a little bit cleaner than the rest of the house, in my experience at least.

364
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It has a different- it doesn't- a bathroom seems removed from the house.

365
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And I think as an adult, you kind of- you kind of get it.

366
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You kind of get that it is a different room.

367
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 It doesn't have all the carpeting and all of the same comforts that every other room has.

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But as a kid, it seems like an alien room.

369
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 It seems like a room that is simply there, as opposed to everything else in your house.

370
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 It has kind of warm and comfy and stuff like that, and bathrooms are very cold and sterile.

371
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And I think that's the reason why it takes place in the bathroom,

372
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 is because it is an alien environment to everything else you're pretty much used to.

373
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 It's also really hard to keep warm in there.

374
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Like, there's just a lot of factors that make bathrooms kind of creepy,

375
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 but the lighting is always really stark too.

376
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 There's usually one light. You shut it off, you're in pitch black.

377
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 When you're in other rooms, you can shut a light off.

378
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 There's light coming from the hallway and things like that.

379
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 So, this is the question, really.

380
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Oh, and let me tell this real quick here.

381
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I do want to say this here real quick, and then I'll wrap it up, because the episode is running a little bit long.

382
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 The story of Bloody Mary, as far as I know, is mostly based in the United States.

383
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 However, other countries have their own versions of it.

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And the one I found that was really fascinating was they have one in Japan.

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Now, of course, Japan has to be weirder than everybody.

386
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Japan has Hanako-san, or Tori no Hako-san, which means Hanako of the toilet.

387
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 The last place you want to be trapped as a ghost is in a bathroom.

388
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I covered a couple episodes back. There was a ghost of a little boy trapped in a women's burger king bathroom.

389
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 I've actually discovered many more ghost trapped in bathrooms. We'll be covering those later.

390
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 But not only is this ghost trapped in the bathroom, her name, like, we have Bloody Mary, they have Hanako of the toilet.

391
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 It's in your name that's gross.

392
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Anyways, briefly, she was either killed in a World War II air raid, tragic, or just murdered, just murdered by a psychopath.

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I mean, that's equally tragic, but it doesn't have that historical importance.

394
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 If you go into a school or a office building or something like that, you go to the third floor, and then go to the third stall in a girl's bathroom.

395
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 You knock three times and say, they'll say, "Are you Hanako-san?"

396
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And then your hair or voice go, "I'm here."

397
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And then you open the door and there's a little girl in a red dress.

398
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Or, see, even they have variations in their legend, which I always think is interesting, and it's really based on which province, which area of Japan you're hearing the story from.

399
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Either you open the door, there's a little girl in a red dress sitting on a toilet, which would be terrifying.

400
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Or, so that happens, or a bloody handprint will appear on the door.

401
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 I would much prefer that versus a girl, a little ghost girl sitting on a toilet.

402
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Or, a white hand will reach out from underneath the stall and grab you.

403
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Ugh. That's creepy.

404
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Or, you open the door and there's a three-headed lizard that eats you.

405
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Out of those, I would much prefer anything but the white hand.

406
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 That to me seems... The white hand and the little girl sitting there seem the creepiest.

407
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 The three-headed lizard ate me. At least I'd be like, "This is a death that maybe only eight other people on the planet will have.

408
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I am honored to be your food." Like, I could... I'd be fine with that versus the other two horrifying images.

409
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 But here's... Here's why you stuck around with me so long ranting about urban legend.

410
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Is Bloody Mary real? I think she can be.

411
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 In the sense, we've talked about things like hyper-siduals before where belief can create reality.

412
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 We've talked about tulpas recently. I am... A long time ago, I made a reference to something called a "eagor" or an "ergore"

413
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 where it's a thought form that is created by mass consciousness.

414
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 I honestly believe that so many people believe in Bloody Mary that she can be real.

415
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 That if she wasn't... If there wasn't a vengeful spirit living in a bathroom mirror before 1950,

416
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 there most likely is one now.

417
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Bloody Mary is the queen of ghosts. Bloody Mary is the first ghost story most people hear,

418
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 and they fear her all their life.

419
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And then maybe they played the game when they were kids, and they heard something after they did the ritual.

420
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 They heard a knock or something fell over or they saw some distortion in the mirror.

421
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Which actually, if you stare at a mirror long enough, and this is the science part, real science,

422
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 if you stare at a mirror long enough, your brain will start to try to make patterns and detect movement where there is none.

423
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 You will see your own face start to shape shift. Your eyes will get big, your mouth will move, you'll look monstrous.

424
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 That is a... At least science says that is a visual trick that is easily replicated, either in no light or very, very low light.

425
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 If you stare at something long enough, you will start to see it move and distend and things like that.

426
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 It's very easy, it's totally easy to explain, you can replicate it.

427
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Bloody Mary or not, look at your reflection in dark room, you will see your face start to move.

428
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 It's a known principle. It's basically the equivalent of seeing shapes in clouds.

429
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Or actually maybe you're probably seeing a ghost.

430
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 But you know, the point is... My point is this, is that you're an adult, you believed it when you were a kid,

431
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and maybe you tried it, maybe you did it, maybe you heard kids who tried it, and yeah, and then I saw a bloody Mary standing behind me

432
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 in that bathroom and that fear sits on you and you go, "I'm never gonna do it."

433
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Maybe you did it and you saw something behind you, you had a bit of that trick of the light and you ran out of the room crying,

434
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 or maybe you didn't and you didn't see anything. And you think, "It doesn't exist, she's not real."

435
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 But you continue to, no matter what, as a child, you continue to hear stories of bloody Mary throughout your childhood.

436
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And then you end up having kids, and one day your kids are talking about bloody Mary, like, "No, I don't want to do that."

437
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And you're like, "What are you talking about?" And they're like, "My big brother, he's trying to make me do bloody Mary,

438
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 but I don't want to do bloody Mary." And you're trying to get this fight resolved between your two idiot children,

439
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 who are trying to force each other into a dark bathroom. And you're mad because this is a stupid argument,

440
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 but in the back of your head, you remember that fear. And it lives and it lives on.

441
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And it is something that is so universal that you can say, if you tell somebody, if you mention bloody Mary to some people,

442
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 and they may go, "Yeah, the cocktail," but in the back of their mind, they have that vision of that young girl standing in that mirror.

443
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I don't care, one of those things that is completely universal. And I think there is so much focus and so much belief,

444
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 and more importantly, so much fear in this entity. It exists. And if it doesn't, in the sense of "bloody Mary,

445
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Mary Worth," disfigured face or whatever legend you have, any demon or ghost worth its salt,

446
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 or they hate salt, but any demon or ghost worth its not salt alternative would assume that form,

447
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 because they know how much people fear it. If she didn't exist before the 1950s, if she didn't exist, if the story is not true,
