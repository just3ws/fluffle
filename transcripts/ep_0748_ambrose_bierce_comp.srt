1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 It was a normal drive until the insectoids showed up.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:15,700
 And then we finished Missing Persons Week with a story of not one, not two, not three, but more than that.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,700
 It's four or five, I don't remember, I don't remember the total.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,300
 But we end Missing Persons Week with a whole bunch of missing people.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,200
 People waving goodbye to their family and then disappearing into thin air.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,600
 A man going out to get some water from a well is never seen again.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,100
 If you can disappear in front of a dozen witnesses, you have to ask yourself, is any place safe?

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,600
 Find out today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:53,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,900
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I really, really mean that.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,300
 Hope you guys have some fun plans for this weekend.

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,100
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our Patreon supporters.

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,000
 Everyone give it up for Stefan Wallner-Strom, Legacy Patreon supporter.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
 Give him a big round of applause.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,800
 Stefan, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode for today.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand not everyone has the money.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Some of you guys just hate Patreon.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,200
 Some of you guys don't want to give any money to Patreon.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
 I totally understand.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,200
 The other way you can support the show is spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,300
 Talk about it to your friends, talk about it with your family.

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,100
 We even have flyers in the show notes.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,100
 You can print out and post them up around town.

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,800
 That actually always gets us new listeners.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,100
 Really, really appreciate that when you guys get the word out.

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,000
 Stefan, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,800
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,300
 We are headed all the way out to Nevada.

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 It's June 1994 and there's a young couple, a husband and his wife,

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,800
 driving down a road in the middle of nowhere.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
 It's slightly raining.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,200
 The windshield wipers.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,300
 Wiping away the rain and then maybe a bird in the distance.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,700
 They see in front of them an accident on the side of the road.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,000
 They see the unmistakable red and white flashing lights of an ambulance.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,100
 They see a lot of them.

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,600
 And for whatever reason, they think they can stop and help.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,500
 Now, I've obviously pulled over in a lot of car accidents.

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,400
 But when there's emergency personnel there, I'm not like out of my way.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
 Out of my way, EMTs.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
 I know how to stitch up this.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,800
 I'm throwing up all over the guy. It's super disgusting.

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,500
 They're like, "Sir, you threw up in the middle of that incision."

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,800
 I'm like, "Oh, sorry."

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
 I know my place.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,100
 Like, I've obviously pulled over and seen a lot of car accidents

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,600
 and I've unfortunately seen a couple people die

49
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,300
 because I got there before the medics did.

50
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,600
 That's happened more than once, unfortunately.

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,900
 But once I see them, I'm like, "They got this handle."

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,200
 They totally got this handle.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,500
 I'm driving a medical supply truck.

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,900
 They're like, "We need more guys."

55
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,300
 And I'm like, "Dum-dum-dum-dum."

56
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,500
 Just driving past them like, "Sir, sir."

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 Anyways, these people figure out, "Let's pull over and we'll help them."

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,100
 I saw a couple episodes of Doogie Houser.

59
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,900
 I can totally help stitch this dude up.

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,100
 So as you're getting closer to these lights and they start to pull over,

61
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,500
 they see no ambulances.

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 They see no emergency vehicles.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 What they see is described as a soda can, a giant soda can,

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:34,000
 lying on its side with little landing legs holding it up.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,300
 It's a creamy color with a red halo hovering above it.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,400
 The wife begins screaming.

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,000
 And the dude driving the car is really trying to take everything in.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
 This is not what he expected to see.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,500
 He expected to see several human casualties.

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,600
 Now he's looking at what can only be described as a UFO that's landed.

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:08,100
 And his wife is screaming and he looks over and approaching the car are two insectoids.

72
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,700
 My favorite types of aliens.

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,700
 These guys rarely show up in stories.

74
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,800
 A lot of grays, a lot of Pleiadians.

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
 Those are the Nordics.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,100
 Those are just boring human looking dudes.

77
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,000
 Reptilians, but insectoids bro.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,700
 So insectoids, they don't get enough love.

79
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,800
 So these insectoids start walking towards the car and these insectoids are even more creepy.

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,200
 Because as they're getting towards the car, the dude's looking and he realizes only their heads are insect like.

81
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:43,300
 They're insect heads on totally human bodies.

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,700
 Little mandibles clicking against each other, brain drops flashing against giant bug eyes.

83
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,900
 Not only does the story have insectoids, the story has the other thing I love about alien stories.

84
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,100
 Firearms.

85
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,800
 Because this dude living in Nevada is armed.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,100
 And as he sees these two insectoids coming towards him, these insect heads and they're just human bodies wearing these jumpsuits.

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:17,200
 And he pulls his gun out and starts shooting at them.

88
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,600
 Now I'm assuming that he has to shoot past his wife to hit them.

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,200
 But you know what?

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,800
 She can get her hearing checked later.

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,400
 She can go and she can go to the ear doctor and get some hearing aids put in.

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,200
 Because listen, it's man against alien and your eardrums.

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,900
 Your eardrums might be a casualty on this floor.

94
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,100
 Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

95
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,100
 He opens fire and the aliens start running like they would.

96
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,500
 And they peel out.

97
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 Dude, the humans are like, "Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

98
00:05:45,500 --> 00:06:05,000
 Dude, the humans are like, they're driving away. And as they're leaving the area, they look in the review mirror and they see nine more insectoids kind of emerge from the darkness standing around this craft staring at them as the humans drive off into the darkness.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,800
 I got this story from thinkaboutadox.com, one of my favorite websites.

100
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,500
 And they got it from a website called UFOs and Aliens Online.

101
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,400
 And it's interesting because there is an other, I know some of you guys probably thought, oh, he told the story before.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
 Lost somewhere in the Dead Rabbit Archives.

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,100
 I know we've talked a lot about episodes that people say I recorded that I didn't record.

104
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,400
 This episode I actually recorded.

105
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,900
 Lost somewhere in the Dead Rabbit Radio Archives.

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,700
 If you guys remember the episode, I'd love to know what it is.

107
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,800
 I covered a story similar to this.

108
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,500
 I think it was on the East Coast where it was a young couple driving down the road and they saw what looked like a car accident.

109
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,800
 And they were abducted.

110
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 It was the same type of thing.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,500
 They saw the emergency lights and they pulled over and they got pulled out of the car.

112
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,400
 It was super creepy.

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,700
 It was super creepy.

114
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
 And someone wrote me like a year ago and said, I need to know what episode that was.

115
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,500
 They wanted to introduce it to their friend.

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,400
 I'm sorry, I didn't write down your name.

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
 I can't give you the shout out.

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 But if you tell me who you are, I'll edit in a name right here.

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,500
 But until then, if you still hear that blank, they never got back to me.

120
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
 It's creepy story.

121
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,300
 And this one is the flip side of that.

122
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:21,300
 Where the same thing, it looks like emergency vehicles and you pull over and this time the dude had a gun and open fire and the aliens ran away.

123
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,400
 It's an interesting ploy for aliens to use emergency vehicles because what are we trained to do when we see emergency vehicles?

124
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
 Slow down.

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,800
 Very, very easy to abduct someone at 20 miles an hour as opposed to 60 miles an hour.

126
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,500
 I'm assuming.

127
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 I've never done it.

128
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 I've never been hanging off the back of a semi.

129
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,300
 I'm like, oh no, he's going 65.

130
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,000
 This plan is foiled.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,500
 I just imagine it's easier.

132
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,400
 But creepy too, because also you have this intrinsic thing you want to help.

133
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,700
 And it's really a way to kidnap you.

134
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,200
 There's that old urban legend.

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,400
 I remember this is one of those creepyposses that really scared me back in the day.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:06,800
 Who knows if this is true, but there's that story where as you're driving down the road, you'll see like a body in the road.

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,300
 Like you'll see like maybe a car crash and someone's like slumped out of the car and another person looks like they flew out of their windshield.

138
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,100
 And you're in the middle of nowhere.

139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:21,500
 You just see this car crash and they say whenever you see that just drive around the bodies, leave the area.

140
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,900
 Because you're like Jason, are you really telling me to see all these bodies in the middle of nowhere?

141
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,100
 This guy's like, help me.

142
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,400
 If not me, help my child.

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,900
 They're still in the car.

144
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,400
 That got dark.

145
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,600
 Don't don't don't help them because the idea this urban legend I've heard is this you don't help the bodies.

146
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,500
 The one guy thought it seemed weird.

147
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:50,400
 He just had to drive around the bodies and then as he was driving away, he saw a bunch of people get out of the bushes nearby and the two bodies on the ground.

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
 They stood up and they walked away.

149
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,100
 So the idea was they were going to get attacked by Satan worshipers.

150
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,700
 Now, I don't know if that's true.

151
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
 It sounds true, right?

152
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
 It sounds super spooky.

153
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,200
 I guess there's a difference between true and super spooky.

154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 It sounds super spooky though.

155
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,500
 Because there is this thing about killing good Samaritans.

156
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,600
 Ted Bundy did it.

157
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,300
 A lot of times he'd say, hey, my arms in a cast.

158
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,800
 Can you help me move my bike?

159
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,600
 And then the women who would help him put the bike on the roof rack on the hood of his car.

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,300
 Those are the women he killed.

161
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,800
 He didn't kill the people are like, you're gross, broken arms.

162
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
 That's lame.

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,700
 I only talk to I only talk to men who have all their bones working.

164
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,500
 So yeah, interesting story.

165
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,300
 The aliens might be doing the same ploy as that urban.

166
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,000
 The aliens read that urban legend.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
 They're like, oh, that's super spooky.

168
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,600
 They're telling that story on Halcyon five and they're like, oh, by the light of the Jim Jam crystal.

169
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,300
 Aliens are beating their pants and they go, you know what, let's try that next time.

170
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,600
 We're on earth and we have in human bodies with insectoid heads.

171
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,000
 Let's see if this urban legend helps us.

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,200
 Little did they expect they were doing it in Nevada.

173
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,700
 One of the most heavily armed states in the union.

174
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,400
 Stefan, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbon helicopter.

175
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,800
 We are leaving behind Nevada.

176
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,500
 We are headed all the way out to Quincy, Illinois.

177
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:18,200
 This is the story or series of stories I teased on Monday's episode and ran out of time and we're tackling it now.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,000
 This will be a really interesting way to round out the week of missing persons week.

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,900
 It's November 1878.

180
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,700
 Some guys like playing the fiddle.

181
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,100
 It's old timey music.

182
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,700
 There's like a deal with a banjo and he's like, it's old timey times.

183
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,900
 It's 1870.

184
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,500
 It's modern day to us.

185
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,300
 It's modern days.

186
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,700
 November 1878 to us.

187
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,200
 But in Quincy, Illinois, it's just a quaint little town.

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,700
 And he puts his banjo down and he goes, well, that's what everyone believed before the story of Charles Ashmore.

189
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,400
 And he winks.

190
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 He gives you a wink.

191
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,900
 He puts his hands on your knee.

192
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,400
 It's like, would you like to know more about Charles Ashmore?

193
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,100
 He starts massaging your thigh.

194
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,700
 I thought you would.

195
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,300
 He snaps his fingers and now we're standing outside of this farm.

196
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,700
 And Charles Ashmore is a 16 year old boy and he's like, you know what I need to do for the family?

197
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,400
 Get water because we're all super thirsty.

198
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,100
 The mom's dying of dehydration.

199
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,600
 You know what?

200
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,300
 That's my job.

201
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,700
 I'm going to go down to the spring to get some water.

202
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,100
 And everyone's like, buy Charles.

203
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,900
 And they're like waving to him as he's walking to the spring.

204
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,700
 They're watching him walk away.

205
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
 Which makes no sense.

206
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,500
 And that's going to be a common thing with these stories.

207
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,100
 You're like, huh, there's a lot of little details that you go, what?

208
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,300
 Like how bored are you?

209
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,100
 When's the last time someone's, when's the last time someone goes, hey, I'm going to take out the trash.

210
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,800
 And you're like, all watch.

211
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,100
 They're like, what?

212
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,300
 And you're like standing outside the door and they're like, huh, what's going on?

213
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,500
 They're making sure you're not having sex with those garbage bags like that weirdo in Britain.

214
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
 And you're like, well, you're like, take it.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I wanted to have sex with this garbage bag.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,500
 And you're in a way, you throw it away and then they're watching you walk back.

217
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,300
 You're like a job.

218
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
 Well done.

219
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,200
 Who watches people do chores?

220
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
 That's so bizarre.

221
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
 But anyways, Charles Ashmore.

222
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,700
 It's 1878.

223
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,000
 What else are you going to do?

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 You don't have Netflix.

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,900
 So you just watch people do stuff.

226
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,700
 He walks out there and he goes to get the spring water and they're just standing on the porch.

227
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:23,500
 Playing with the banjo, but then like a couple hours faster, the guy hasn't returned.

228
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,600
 He's just going to the spring to get some water.

229
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,700
 So the dad and the oldest daughter, Martha, go, we better go out there and see what's going on.

230
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,400
 He might have fallen into the spring.

231
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,700
 So they're walking out there and they actually see his footprints in the snow.

232
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,400
 It's November.

233
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,200
 It's 1878.

234
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
 So it's snowing.

235
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,200
 I probably should have had that detail earlier.

236
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 I just assumed you knew Illinois weather pattern in November.

237
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,800
 It's snowing.

238
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:55,100
 So they see these footprints leading out into the spring and then all of a sudden his tracks just stop.

239
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,800
 Well, that's weird.

240
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,100
 Well, maybe he stopped walking.

241
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,000
 Maybe he jumped.

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
 Maybe he's spring heel jack.

243
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,700
 So they continue walking towards the spring and it's totally iced over.

244
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,800
 They expected him to go and smash the ice to get the water and then bring it back.

245
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,000
 So the fact that it's totally frozen over means he never got to the spring.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,500
 Four days later, he still hasn't shown back at home, but they need water.

247
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,100
 I don't think they've gone four days without water, but I'm positive they didn't go four days without water.

248
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,200
 They would have all died.

249
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,400
 But it was four days later when the mom was getting some water when she hears.

250
00:13:31,400 --> 00:14:01,400
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

251
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:14,200
 Charles talk about making the world a better place, but it has to start with ourselves and they're like, what?

252
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,900
 You've clearly gone insane.

253
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,200
 You need to drink more water.

254
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
 You don't drink any water in four days.

255
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,300
 She's like, listen, no, I haven't been drinking water and I'm not going insane.

256
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,700
 I can hear our son.

257
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,500
 He's speaking gibberish.

258
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 Now, the family thinks she is nuts, but they also start going out to the well and they start to hear a "uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

259
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:08,600
 And over time, it grows more and more faint until eventually by midsummer, the voices heard no more.

260
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,800
 Now, I found the story from a list of missing people stories from the sun.

261
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,700
 Now, I found that story.

262
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:22,200
 I was reading a list of missing people from the sun, which is a British tabloid.

263
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
 It doesn't have the most verifiable news, right?

264
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
 But I was I read that story.

265
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,800
 I'm like, that's so bizarre.

266
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,000
 Someone goes missing, but it's right in our wheelhouse, right?

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
 Right in the dead rabbit radio lore.

268
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,900
 This is something we'd look at.

269
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,100
 And then I found more information on it on ghostlyworld.com and earthcronicles.com.

270
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
 I was like, oh, it's really interesting stuff.

271
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:50,100
 But as I continue to look into the story of Charles Ashmore, I found the story of David Lang.

272
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,500
 Staphon fired that carbonicopter.

273
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,300
 We're headed to some near county, Tennessee.

274
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,600
 It's September 23, 1880.

275
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,900
 And David Lang is walking through a field and his wife is watching him.

276
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,300
 Go ahead and rewind.

277
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,700
 Go ahead and rewind five minutes to hear my rant about white people, watch other people.

278
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,600
 He's walking into his field.

279
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,400
 His wife is watching him and their kids, George and Sarah, are playing in the front yard.

280
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,500
 Just then three other people ride up on their horses.

281
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
 They're coming to visit David Lang and the family.

282
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,200
 And all of a sudden Mrs. Lang lets out a blood curdling scream.

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,300
 As she's screaming, the men who just rode up are frozen in place.

284
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,700
 Jaws dropped eyes wide.

285
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,800
 They saw it too.

286
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,700
 David Lang vanished, completely vanished in front of all of them.

287
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,000
 Now imagine how shocking that would be.

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
 I mean, that would be earthshattering.

289
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,000
 We talk a lot about missing people on the story.

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,300
 We've covered stuff like that before.

291
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,600
 We have this story recently where the guy turned around.

292
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,300
 45 seconds he turned back and the woman had completely disappeared.

293
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,000
 It was a true story.

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 100% true story.

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,900
 I'll put it in the show notes.

296
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,100
 It's terrifying.

297
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,500
 This happens right in front of them.

298
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,300
 He just disappears.

299
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,600
 They think sinkhole.

300
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,200
 They go check.

301
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,100
 There's nothing there.

302
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,600
 And he's never found again.

303
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,600
 Years later, a circle appears in the soil where he stood.

304
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,000
 It was about 15 feet in diameter.

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,900
 Nothing grew there.

306
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,500
 Insects wouldn't even crawl there.

307
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,700
 And once George and Sarah entered the circle and they heard the voice of their father.

308
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:39,600
 They did not say he sounded like Michael Jackson, but they heard the voice of their father when they stood in that circle.

309
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,500
 Now this story was traced back to a story written by Stuart Palmer,

310
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,200
 who interviewed Sarah Lange, one of the children in 1931.

311
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,300
 And this article was titled How My Father Disappeared.

312
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,900
 But at this point, I'm having some real alarm bells going off in my head.

313
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,300
 Not just why people are watching people walk away, but these stories are completely fantastic.

314
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,600
 And that doesn't mean they're fake.

315
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,300
 But sometimes things can seem too good to be true.

316
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,200
 And as I'm continuing to try to find more meat to these stories,

317
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,500
 because they seem to be pretty well documented.

318
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,000
 You have names, we have rough dates, we have time period.

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,100
 I keep looking into the story and I find the story of Oliver Lurch.

320
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,200
 Stephanie know the drill.

321
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
 Let's hop on that carbonic copter.

322
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,000
 We're headed out to South Bend, Indiana.

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,900
 And once again, we pick up our maestro with a little banjo.

324
00:18:31,900 --> 00:19:00,900
 [Singing]

325
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,900
 So anyways, this song goes on and on.

326
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,600
 I'm dancing.

327
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,300
 I'm like, "Who?

328
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,000
 Keep playing.

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,600
 Encore.

330
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,100
 Encore."

331
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
 He's sitting on your lap.

332
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,300
 We're headed out to South Bend, Indiana.

333
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,200
 And it's Christmas Eve, 1889.

334
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,600
 And there's a huge party going on at the Lurch House.

335
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,300
 The banjo guy's playing there.

336
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,800
 Everyone's having a great time except for you.

337
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,900
 Oliver Lurch is 20 years old.

338
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,800
 He's making moves on this girl named Lillian Hirsch.

339
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,700
 He's like, "Hey, baby.

340
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,000
 How about you show me some ankles after this party?"

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,300
 It is 1889.

342
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,400
 After all, the closest I've gotten to a woman's vagina is

343
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,300
 when I helped a cow give birth.

344
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
 That was the best pick-up line back then.

345
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,800
 And that joke was worth having to add an explicit tag

346
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
 to this episode of the podcast.

347
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,500
 Anyways, Oliver Lurch is trying to hook up with Lillian Hirsch.

348
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,800
 So Oliver Lurch is trying to hook up with Lillian Hirsch.

349
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,700
 She's the daughter of an attorney.

350
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,600
 And you know what?

351
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,900
 The night's going on.

352
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,700
 What do the people need?

353
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,900
 Say it with me now.

354
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,800
 Water.

355
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,100
 Everyone needs water because apparently they're partying so hard.

356
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,800
 So Oliver Lurch--

357
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
 This is just--

358
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
 The stories are so weird.

359
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,600
 Oliver Lurch goes, "I will go get water."

360
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,000
 If I'm hitting on a girl, dude, if I'm hitting on a girl

361
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,500
 and you're on fire, you're getting your own water.

362
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,100
 I don't know if this guy thought that he would impress her

363
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,700
 with a bucket of water,

364
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,800
 because if that's the case, anything would impress her.

365
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,100
 But if you're--

366
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,100
 You know, if you're spitting game, you don't want to go

367
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,700
 and get water.

368
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,900
 But anyways, he does.

369
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,100
 It's a different time.

370
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,600
 It's 11.30 at night.

371
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 He walks outside to go get some water.

372
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,800
 About five minutes later, they hear him screaming.

373
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,600
 No!

374
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,300
 Ah!

375
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,000
 Ah!

376
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,600
 Ah!

377
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,300
 He's screaming and everyone runs outside.

378
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,800
 It's 1889, so it's pitch black outside.

379
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,900
 They hear, "Help!

380
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,800
 Help me!

381
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,400
 Help!

382
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,100
 Help!

383
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,400
 Help!"

384
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,100
 They look into their darkness.

385
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,600
 They don't see him.

386
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,400
 And that's when they realize his voice is coming from the night sky.

387
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,100
 "Help!

388
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,200
 It's got me!

389
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,400
 It's got me!

390
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,100
 No!

391
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,900
 Help me!

392
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,400
 Help me!

393
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,200
 Lillian!

394
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,600
 What I've gotten to third base at least, yeah!"

395
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,100
 His voice becomes more and more faint

396
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,200
 until it is no longer heard and people start thinking,

397
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,100
 "What in the world was that?"

398
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,200
 That was the least thing I expected, right?

399
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
 I expected I'd come to this party, hang out,

400
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
 listen to this cool banjo player,

401
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,000
 but then I didn't expect that guy to fly away.

402
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,200
 Like, that's either the worst party or the best party, right?

403
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,000
 I guess it determines on whether or not you're the one flying away,

404
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,900
 or if you know that guy.

405
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,300
 You're like, "I didn't know that guy.

406
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
 Great party.

407
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,700
 Great party."

408
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
 But if you knew him,

409
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,400
 if Lillian Hirsch was planning on pulling up her skirt a little bit that night for him,

410
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,500
 she would be devastated.

411
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,800
 They begin searching the air,

412
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,400
 because this is the idea.

413
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,900
 They think that a bird got him.

414
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,600
 Like, either how big is this bird,

415
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,500
 or how small is this man?

416
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,200
 But they begin searching the roofs of houses

417
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,500
 to see if...

418
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,300
 like, it dropped him?

419
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,400
 But they can't find him,

420
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,700
 and some people begin to stay there,

421
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,300
 and other search parties are going out,

422
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,500
 and then eventually they hear his voice again

423
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,200
 in the sky just a little bit more.

424
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
 Help me! Help! They got me still!

425
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,600
 Ha ha! It's still going on!

426
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
 And then it fades again,

427
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,500
 and then it was never heard of again.

428
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,900
 And they had footprints leading from his house to the well,

429
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,600
 so they know he got as far as the water,

430
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,300
 but then never seen again.

431
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,700
 This story was actually reported in one of the really best...

432
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,900
 If you had to stop listening to this podcast for any reason,

433
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,800
 if you were ever given a choice between listening to Dead Rabbit Radio

434
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,700
 or reading 40 in Times,

435
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
 pick 40 in Times,

436
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,700
 because that is the Bible of paranormal research.

437
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
 Like, I grew up on 40 in Times.

438
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,900
 It's a great magazine.

439
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,500
 40 in Times covered it.

440
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,600
 Bazaar Victoria covered it.

441
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,100
 This story was originally published all the way back in 1904.

442
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,200
 That's as far back as we can trace it,

443
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,800
 so it's not too far from the 1899 story.

444
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,700
 And in the 1904 story,

445
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,100
 it had a sworn statement of 10 people saying,

446
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
 "We were there. We saw this happen."

447
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,300
 And then after it, from 1904, it was republished in 1906.

448
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,900
 I found that version of the article,

449
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,100
 and in that version is where they started talking about the Eagle Theory.

450
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,200
 A big eagle came down and swooped him up.

451
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,100
 It goes on from there.

452
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,700
 You can find versions of it from a 1947 Australian newspaper.

453
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,200
 So the story had been around for a long time,

454
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,600
 but what's interesting is each article plagiarized the one before it.

455
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
 And they're passing it off.

456
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 Each journalist was saying that they were telling it for the first time.

457
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 It turns out they were just copying this story from years or decades earlier.

458
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,100
 And the 1904 article, the initial story,

459
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:07,500
 was also plagiarized from a fictional story written by Ambrose Beers.

460
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,900
 Ambrose Beers, to all you English nerds out there,

461
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,800
 you immediately went, "Oh, my favorite author."

462
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,700
 Or just some guy I read in college.

463
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,900
 Ambrose Beers wrote the pilot episode of The Twilight Zone.

464
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,700
 You're like, "Jayson, that's...

465
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,800
 That is unequivocally not true."

466
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 It kind of is.

467
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,600
 So Ambrose Beers wrote an occurrence at Al Creek Bridge,

468
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,100
 which was turned into the pilot episode,

469
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,900
 or the very first episode of Twilight Zone, or one of the episodes.

470
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,200
 Maybe it wasn't the pilot episode.

471
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,900
 The point is, is that an occurrence at Al Creek Bridge

472
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,300
 is something everyone reads in college,

473
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,000
 or maybe high school, depending on where you went.

474
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,700
 If you haven't read it, it's a really cool story.

475
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,000
 I'm not going to give it away.

476
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
 But it's really, really cool.

477
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
 And it was one of those stories that I will admit

478
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,100
 kind of went over my head,

479
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
 and my English teacher had to explain it to me,

480
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,400
 and then I went, "Whoa, dude!

481
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,100
 Oh, my God, it's totally awesome."

482
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,900
 It's a really good story.

483
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,100
 Ambrose Beers is an old-timey author.

484
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,300
 He wrote lots of stuff,

485
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,100
 but you do study him in English classes in America.

486
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,700
 But at the time, he wrote so much horror...

487
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,300
 I didn't know this.

488
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,500
 He wrote so much horror that he was considered alongside

489
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 the ranks of Poe and Lovecraft.

490
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,300
 He wrote some really, really creepy stuff.

491
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,700
 He wrote this story.

492
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,800
 He wrote the story of the missing person disappearing

493
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
 into the night sky.

494
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,500
 And I'm looking into this and I go, "Well, that's weird."

495
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
 So it's a no-infictional story that's being published,

496
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,600
 even by 40 in times,

497
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,100
 is publishing these stories as if these are weird events.

498
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,600
 Like, isn't this wacky?

499
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,100
 And then it turns out, as I'm researching this more,

500
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,300
 he wrote the story about Charles Ashmore,

501
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
 the very first story that we covered,

502
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,900
 the guy going to the spring to get the water

503
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
 and then just disappearing.

504
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 It was a short story written by Ambrose Beers.

505
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,000
 This isn't an obscure author,

506
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,600
 but he wrote these creepy stories in old-timey times.

507
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
 And over the course of history,

508
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,000
 they've been absorbed into the paranormal world.

509
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,700
 He wrote another story called "An Unfinished Race,"

510
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,400
 which also popped up in a bunch of my research.

511
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,800
 It was not listed as a fictional story.

512
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,300
 He wrote a story. I'd come across this and list of weird disappearances.

513
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,400
 There was a guy who ran a race.

514
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,900
 He's running with a bunch of other people and he tripped

515
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,200
 and then disappeared in front of all the spectators,

516
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,500
 in front of all the runners.

517
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 He tripped and fell into nothingness.

518
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,600
 It was called "An Unfinished Race."

519
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,300
 That story also gets reported in the world of the paranormal.

520
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:43,300
 And I wasn't able to verify that he wrote the story about Sarah Lange,

521
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
 but it's possible that he did.

522
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,000
 And that was the one where it was the fake--

523
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,700
 it was possible that the interview was fake

524
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,400
 and it was a fictional story under a pseudonym.

525
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
 I wasn't able to verify that.

526
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,000
 He may have written the other one.

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 So you're like, "Jason, so that's interesting

528
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,100
 because we know you don't cover creepypastas.

529
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,400
 I don't cover creepypastas."

530
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,500
 So why would you tell us four stories that were fictional?

531
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,300
 Did you know we're fictional?

532
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,300
 Because of the way everything ends is why.

533
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,000
 Like, as themselves, those are interesting stories.

534
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,500
 It turns out they're not real.

535
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,400
 They are reported as real, though.

536
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,600
 Most creepypastas reported as creepypasta.

537
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,900
 That term is used to signify this is not true.

538
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,900
 But these stories are reported in mainstream paranormal publications.

539
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,400
 And while I was researching them, I was thinking,

540
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,000
 "This seems so good to be true. I'm finding these like this."

541
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,600
 And there's constantly these lists that will list multiple of these.

542
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,400
 But I was able to trace at least three of them back to Ambrose Pierce.

543
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,600
 The reason why I wanted to talk about them, one, is because people do confuse them.

544
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,700
 But then, of course, right?

545
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,900
 Of course this is the way the story ends.

546
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,500
 On December 26, 1913, we're back to--

547
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,900
 this is 100% true.

548
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,000
 We're not-- this is not a fictional account.

549
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,100
 This was reported in actual newspapers.

550
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:15,000
 In December 16, 1913, Ambrose Pierce himself disappeared without a trace.

551
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,500
 Now, there's different versions of what may have happened to him.

552
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,800
 Because, again, this was a famous author.

553
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,600
 And he studied today for his impact on English literature.

554
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,900
 He's not some obscure guy.

555
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,100
 So historians, English professors, want to know what happened to this guy.

556
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,000
 There are some theories, but he's-- he just vanished.

557
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,100
 Some people believe that he got shot in Mexico.

558
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,900
 Other people said, "No, he never even went to Mexico."

559
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,700
 Some people say, "No, that's not true. He never was in Mexico."

560
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,100
 Around that time, he should have been on a tour of a Civil War battlefield.

561
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,900
 So we don't even know where he was in his final days.

562
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,800
 We do know, though, that he just disappeared without a trace.

563
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:02,700
 The reason why we say December 26, 1913 is that is the date on the last letter he ever wrote.

564
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,300
 The last letter he ever wrote was dated December 26, 1913.

565
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:17,700
 And he states in the letter, quote, "As to me, I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination."

566
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
 So he seemed to have a motif in his stories.

567
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,600
 He seemed to like to write these short stories about people just vanishing into thin air.

568
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,100
 And it's interesting that he himself vanished into thin air.

569
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:36,200
 Did Ambrose Beers end up making himself the star of his last story?

570
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,500
 He loved stories where people disappeared.

571
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,800
 And he wrote them so well that they're still read over a hundred years after their publication.

572
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,900
 And not only read, but believed.

573
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,500
 People tell these stories as if they were real.

574
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,300
 And to an author, is there really any better compliment than that?

575
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,500
 Your stories are so timeless.

576
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,400
 People believe they're real, no matter how outlandish they may seem.

577
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:12,200
 Ambrose Beers not only left us with some great literature, but a mysterious puzzle as well.

578
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,600
 One that has not been unlocked for over a hundred years.

579
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:23,600
 And I'm sure that's just the way he intended it.

580
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,300
