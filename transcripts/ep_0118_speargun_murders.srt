1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
 Today, we take a look at one of the most gruesome topics we've ever discussed on

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:14,160
 Dead Rabbit Radio. No joke, I questioned whether or not to even do this episode.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,200
 Today we cover the speargun murders on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,340
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,040
 day too. I think today's episode is only gonna be a single story like yesterday's

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,840
 episode. Speaking of yesterday's episode, the vampire sex cult of Yerba Buenae.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,440
 That one, I was listening back to it as editing it. I was laughing, which is kind

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,000
 of self-indulgent when you laugh at your own stuff, but I was laughing and I was

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
 thinking, oh dude, this episode to me, I thought it was very fun to record. It was

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,480
 very entertaining and as I was editing it, I was like, oh yeah, still got to do

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,560
 tomorrow's episode because this episode is probably one of the most disturbing

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,840
 stories we've covered here on Dead Rabbit Radio. It definitely did very

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,720
 disturbing to me and there may be people out there who go, oh that's not so bad. I

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,600
 saw this movie or I read this article or something like that, but there's a

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,840
 particular gruesomeness to this story that I don't think I've ever encountered

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,240
 in my journeys through the internet. 100% true story. It's a true crime story.

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,680
 Everything's been documented. There's no conspiracy, no spooky ghosts. This is just

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,200
 a look at pure human madness. Now I will say, there's no sexual abuse or rape or

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,640
 anything like that. That's not, because that is kind of its, oh we've covered that

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,640
 a couple times. This is just a look, an insight, and it's just how cruel a human

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,480
 can be towards another human. So that being said, I imagine for a lot of you

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,680
 this will be the end of the episode. So play outro music, Dead Rabbit Radio,

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,600
 Gmail.com, hit us up on Twitter, Facebook, but for those of you who want to stick

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,440
 around and if you guys jump out right there, that's totally fine. I hope you

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,080
 guys come back tomorrow. I'm not, I want to let you know and I've never done this

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,480
 before because I think it's that haunting, but for those of you who are still

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,040
 with us, we're gonna go ahead and get started here. Now quick quick introduction,

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,520
 real quick introduction. I did actually have a podcast that I started back in

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,880
 like 2003-2004 and I didn't remember the title of it, but I actually titled that

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,960
 podcast Dead Rabbit Radio as well. And that's not a lark, but it's a long story.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,680
 I'll explain it some other time. I want to get into the story, but when I was, that

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,480
 story, that podcast was more political and weird news. This one's not political at

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,400
 all, just all kind of weird news. Anyways, I've recently been consolidating all of

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
 my computers, all of my hard drives and stuff like that. I had a bunch of like

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,480
 externals that I bought, you know, 10 years ago and I'm like, I never use it,

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,880
 let's get the documents off here and trash it. And I've done that with a laptop,

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,680
 there was just sitting in a box. And in that process, I found a folder that I had

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,560
 titled New News and it was all links to articles, generally around the time

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,240
 limit of probably about 2004-2005. So I was basically bookmarking stuff back

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,180
 then and it's just all saved in these folders. I was actually downloading the

42
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,440
 web pages themselves, so because I was always afraid this stuff would get

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,800
 memory-hold and a lot of it has. Now, a lot of it's political stuff and I've

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,400
 just been deleting that because nobody cares about the Bush administration

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,760
 anymore. There's a bunch of weird news in that and you'll see that popping up,

46
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,560
 especially right now when we're doing the shorter episodes. But one of the things

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,800
 I found was this article and I saw the headline and I was like, well that's

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,000
 intriguing. I don't remember that at all and I read it and it's haunting that this

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,960
 happened. And I, you know, yesterday's episode I go, how could they not have made

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,800
 a movie of this crazy vampire sex cult? There's a reason why they would never

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,720
 make a movie of this crime. And again, you guys may think I'm hyping it up a lot,

52
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,520
 but just wait till we get to it. Let's go ahead and jump in here. It might sound a

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,880
 little bit louder right now because I just moved my mic ahead. I just need to get

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,680
 comfortable. So it's 2004. Oh, and I should let you know there's probably not

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,360
 gonna be a lot of jokes in this one because it's pretty grim. 2004. We're in

56
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,000
 Melbourne, Australia. Australia is a continent. I'm sure you guys know about

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
 that. It's full of dangerous animals and stuff like that. I have a couple of

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,280
 friends from Australia actually, but it tends to be like, I think people, I

59
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,080
 pictured it's kind of an ideal place. Kind of like New Zealand is kind of like, it

60
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,400
 seems like a big old hobbit home. I think people look at Australia as just kind of

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
 like, there's wallabies and kangaroos dancing around, and my crocodile done

62
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
 these doing stuff. If you're over the age of 30, you know who that is. Yahoo

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,640
 Sirius is dancing around. I think he was from Australia. But anyway, so just kind

64
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,640
 of a harmless nation overall. Even though it's populated by a bunch of

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,160
 descendants of convicts, it's they tend to not have like a ton of scandals like

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,080
 other countries would. We're gonna travel through the country of Australia

67
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,400
 and we find ourselves in Melbourne. We'll take the Jason Jalopy for this one

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,160
 because we actually need a little bit of light, a hardiness. So we're going down

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,240
 the road. There's like two umbrellas hitting each other, steam shooting out

70
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,800
 of the back. It's just making a little ton of noise. It doesn't have, anyways,

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,240
 forget the Jason Jalopy. I'm getting stuck on the description. We do end up at

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,400
 the home of John Sharp. And John Sharp is married to Anna. And it's not the best

73
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,960
 marriage in the world. There's friction, but what marriage is perfect? What

74
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,800
 relationship really is perfect? What complicates things is they have a

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,680
 daughter named Gracie. And Gracie has a thing known as hip, dip, dip,

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,520
 dip, placia, dip, placia. So little baby's born, little hip, hip problem. The baby's

77
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,000
 like, oh, you little cane. But they did have to get the baby a brace. So she, and

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,840
 she only had to wear it for the first three months. Oh, sorry, first three years.

79
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
 Huge difference. The baby had to wear it for the first three years. So little baby

80
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,200
 born with a bad hip, and then they had to get a little hip brace for it for the

81
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,920
 baby. And so eventually the baby would only have to wear it for three years, but

82
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:29,000
 still it was hard. It's hard for a little baby. And Gracie was like crying a lot.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,400
 She couldn't sleep. She had a hard time sleeping. I mean, a baby's born into the

84
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,040
 world and they're immediately in pain. That's pretty jacked up. So Gracie's

85
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,120
 like, oh, my hip. And there was her first words actually. I shouldn't make jokes,

86
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,720
 but I can't help it. Okay, so anyways, Gracie eventually loses the brace. Not

87
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,960
 like she lost it, but they took it off of her. And, but the problem was, was she

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,520
 still had some difficulties sleeping through the night, crying a lot. She,

89
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,760
 she had to be fed. I don't know why, because it was just a hip thing. But she,

90
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,480
 she had some developmental stuff. And that put a lot more stress on John and

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,040
 Anna's relationship on their marriage. Hey everyone, this is Jason from the

92
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,720
 future. I'm actually recording this as I'm editing the episode. Hopefully I don't

93
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,640
 have to do this more than once in this episode, but I made a mistake. She had,

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,880
 she did have to wear the brace for only three months. She was only 20 months old.

95
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,880
 At some point I thought she was six for some reason. I think I mentioned she's

96
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,040
 six several times later in the episode, but so she only had to wear the brace

97
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,240
 for three months. She's 20 months old. There we go. That's our, that's our

98
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,200
 pro, hopefully last clarification on this episode. Enjoy the rest of this, this

99
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,640
 horrible, horrible story. Did I say it started off in 2004? That's not true. It

100
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,320
 actually starts off earlier. 2004 is when everything happened. So we're actually

101
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,160
 right now, we're in the year 2003. And John Sharp, he's in like his 30s I think.

102
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,960
 He's sitting there and he's talking to his wife, when Danny goes, "You know what? I'm

103
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,800
 gonna buy a spear gun." She's like, "What?" He's like, "Yeah, I'm gonna buy a spear gun. I

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,880
 just, you know, want to like shoot stuff with my spear gun." The wife doesn't

105
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,360
 really think anything of it. That conversation probably never happened,

106
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,800
 but anyways the point is he actually did go and buy a spear gun and in hindsight

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,840
 it was weird because he never showed any interest in spear fishing. And he would

108
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,120
 take the spear gun, he bought a spear gun in two bolts, and he went out and he

109
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,760
 would go in the backyard and he would just shoot stuff with his spear gun. He

110
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,720
 was practicing using it basically. Crank it back, put the bolt in, pull the

111
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,880
 trigger, shoot an apple off a kid's head or something like that. Pull the

112
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,000
 bolt back, shoot, you know, shooting ducks and stuff. Shooting kangaroos.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,080
 Anyways, so everything is not perfect, but it's not murder my wife bad until

114
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,280
 Annie gets pregnant again. And at that point John is like, "I can't do this. I

115
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,080
 absolutely can't do this again. Like, we have this little girl who was in total

116
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,160
 pain and I couldn't sleep and she's still having all these difficulties and

117
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,720
 now we're gonna have another baby. I just flat out can't do this. Now a normal

118
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,800
 person would either man up and say, "I can't do this but I have to do this and do

119
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,120
 it anyways." Or just leave, just bounce, just be like, "Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna go

120
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,680
 to New Zealand. It's only like, what, 20 miles away or whatever. I'm just gonna

121
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,280
 rowboat over there." And just bounce. Like, those are really your only two options

122
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,440
 if you want to be... One is obviously grosser than the other, but you can stick

123
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,680
 around and suffer silently and just deal with it. Or you can be a deadbeat dad and

124
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,200
 bounce out. Both of those options are far preferable to the one John picks. So now

125
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,760
 we're in 2004. March 21st, 2004. John highly practiced with his speargun, wakes

126
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,800
 up one night, his wife's sleeping in bed next to him. He goes to the closet, he

127
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,120
 goes to the speargun supply room, and he receives a speargun and he's two... his two

128
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,520
 bolts and he walks into the bedroom. His wife's sleeping there. Just centimeters

129
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,560
 from her head, he pulls the trigger. And the first bolt goes right into her skull.

130
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,920
 But she's still breathing. So he brought the other bolt with him. You know, you

131
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,160
 always have to have a backup, right? Puts it in, pulls it back, thwup! Second bolt goes

132
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:33,320
 in, kills her. And he's like... "Breathe as a sigh of relief, throw some towels on her

133
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,880
 body, and just sleeps on the couch." Now, right there, that's the sign of a sociopath.

134
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,800
 Like, you know, I mean, he might have been internally freaking out. He most likely

135
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,920
 steeled himself to make that decision to kill her, and he'd probably practiced it.

136
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,520
 Since he bought the speargun, I think it's pretty widely accepted that he bought

137
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,040
 the speargun to commit the murder. To commit the murder. Can you imagine sleeping

138
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,840
 and having a metal rod jammed through your skull? And it didn't kill her. The

139
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,120
 first... the first rod didn't kill her. He had to shoot the second rod into her

140
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,400
 skull as well. But you think that he... it must have been a crack shot for it to just

141
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,720
 go in and devastate enough for the brain that it didn't immediately wake her up.

142
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,280
 The next morning, he tries to pull the bolts out, and they're stuck. Because, you

143
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,000
 know, it's evidence. You got a bunch of evidence. You got, you know, what are they?

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,760
 Like, 12, 12 inch long metal rods that can easily be traced back. Oh, look at

145
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,520
 someone. This wife got killed by a speargun. Who bought a speargun recently, the husband?

146
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,800
 He has to retrieve him. He can't get him out. He can't get the bolts out. All he

147
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,640
 can do is unscrew them. So he's holding his wife's skull and he's unscrewing it.

148
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,480
 So the sharp tip is still left inside of her skull. He unscrews the shaft. So now

149
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,000
 he just has the shaft. So it's basically blunt on both ends. Because the

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,120
 little arrowhead, or the little point, is inside a skull. He had to unscrew them.

151
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,640
 And he had to do both of them. And then he... buried her body in the backyard.

152
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,560
 Shallow grave. Because he has other plans for that. He has to, you know, actually

153
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,400
 get rid of the evidence. And then a few days after that, he goes and he buys a

154
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,160
 brand new bolt. So again, don't want to hype it up too much, but if you want to

155
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,640
 bounce out now, cue the actual music.

156
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,640
 Get a rabbit radio gmail.com, is your email address.

157
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,640
 No harm, no foul.

158
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:37,000
 March 27th, 2004. John Sharp widowed, sitting in his home now. So it's what?

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,080
 Six days later. So no one's really noticed the wife is dead.

160
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,340
 The wife is gone. He's sitting in his house, it's late at night. He's drinking

161
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:52,000
 whiskey and Coke. He later said he had to do that to calm his nerves. He goes and

162
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,560
 he gets his speargun out of the speargun supply closet. And the bolt with

163
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:05,200
 the tip on it goes into his daughter Gracie's room. Little kid. Little kid.

164
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,360
 Sleeping. And he takes his speargun and he does the same thing. He puts its

165
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:19,520
 centimeters from her head, pulls the trigger. Gracie immediately wakes and

166
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,240
 begins screaming at the top of her lungs with a spear rod, a spear gun rod, sticking

167
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,560
 out of her skull. John obviously panics. This little girl is screaming out loud.

168
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,160
 She's just been shot in the head by her father with the spear gun. What's he gonna

169
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,320
 do? What's he gonna do? He runs back to his speargun supply closet, gets the two

170
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,440
 blunt speargun rods that he used to murder his wife. They don't have the tip,

171
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,800
 they're just blunt. Loads one up in his speargun, points it at his daughter as

172
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,920
 she's looking at him, fires again. She's still crying. Screaming. He loads the other

173
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,520
 speargun rod up. The broken speargun rod points it at her, tears streaming down

174
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:16,920
 her face, pulls the trigger again. Still screaming. He then holds his daughter

175
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:25,000
 down and has to pull one of the rods he previously fired out of her skull,

176
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,320
 reload the speargun and shoot her one last time, killing her. Jesus Christ, can

177
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:45,480
 you imagine how disgusting of a human being that you have to be to do that? To

178
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,800
 do really any element of it. To kill your child, to shoot them while they're

179
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,120
 sleeping, to shoot them multiple times while they're looking at you, to pull a

180
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,320
 projectile out of their body, to shoot them again, to use the same arrows you

181
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:11,480
 use to kill your wife six days later and then imagine little Gracie. I hope she

182
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,000
 didn't really know what was going on in those last minutes of her life as he's

183
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,920
 running to and fro and grabbing extra bolts and pulling one out of her head.

184
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,680
 Inhumanity. Inhumanity. And we can talk about stuff. We, a lot of times we'll talk

185
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,680
 about inhumanity on a global scale and then sometimes, you know, like starvation

186
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,920
 or death camps or mass shootings and things like that. And that's all tragic,

187
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,400
 obviously. And then we can also look at murders and abuse and things like that.

188
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,640
 And that's tragic as well. I honestly don't think I've come across, I read a

189
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,800
 lot of true crime, a ton of it. And I think this is one of the most gruesome

190
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,360
 ones I've come across. I've read other stuff that could give it a good run for

191
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,320
 its money, but what pushes this over the edge is simply the age of the victim

192
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,280
 and the relationship to the perpetrator. Four times in the head with a speargun.

193
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,600
 Two of them were dull and one of them was pulled out of your head. But he's

194
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,320
 not done. So now he has these bodies. He covers her face up because he

195
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 doesn't want to look at her because he's a coward. Shooting women in

196
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,960
 their sleep. And this is what I always talk about, serial killers and stuff like

197
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,840
 that. I always pick weak targets because they're weak. They're weak people.

198
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,280
 "Oh, I'm gonna go kill 30 women. Hey, Ted Bundy. Good job. Good job. Yeah, go kill a

199
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:42,720
 bunch of co-eds. Go try killing some MMA fighters and cowards." Anyways. He takes

200
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,160
 his wife, digs her back up out of the ground, chops her body up, throws her in

201
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,560
 the garbage, takes his little infant daughter, takes her to a dump, tosses her

202
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,820
 in the garbage. Perfect crime. I'm sure he was just so full of himself. He

203
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,160
 was gonna get away with it. He begins sending out emails to her family from

204
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,760
 her saying, "I'm leaving John. I've met a nice guy in this other city far away."

205
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,240
 And the family immediately becomes suspicious. They're like, "This isn't

206
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,960
 like her daughter. She's never mentioned anything. She's mentioned being unhappy

207
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,680
 with this guy, but she never mentioned another man before or anything like that."

208
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,760
 Cops begin to investigate. He ends up being going on the news saying, because at

209
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,000
 this point he's like, "Well, she went to this other town and the cops in the other

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,900
 town are like, 'We can't find her,' so then there's a missing person's case for

211
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,820
 this mother and this daughter." He's one of those idiots who goes on television

212
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,180
 crying, "Please come back home and if you took my wife and kid, please let them go.

213
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:47,340
 I just love them so much." Nation was all into this kidnapping. What happened to

214
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,380
 this mother and her daughter? And she was pregnant. What's going on? "Oh, no, please,

215
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,820
 help me find, you know." Doing the whole sob story. The cops weren't buying it,

216
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,360
 though. Just getting really, really suspicious eventually on June 22nd, so

217
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,960
 just a couple months later, he was arrested for murder. And that's where

218
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,800
 we get the account of the murders. He confessed to it and he was basically

219
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,560
 saying, "Well, you know, I was just having me and my wife were having

220
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,800
 difficulties and I just kind of broke one night." But then his family apparently

221
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:29,340
 said that he had a history or had in the past committed child sexual abuse. So the

222
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,420
 theory, and I know I said it didn't happen, I know I kind of gave that

223
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,860
 spoiler, I said it wasn't gonna happen in this story, but it's just kind of a

224
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,780
 footnote in this particular story, that he had possibly been abusing Gracie,

225
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,860
 that he had possibly been abusing Gracie and that Anna had found out. That

226
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,940
 might have been the actual motive for the murders. And I was saying that before

227
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,240
 with the mass shooters, like they'll go off and do this crazy stuff and be these

228
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,720
 killers, but you know, still don't want to get known as a pedophile. You know, so

229
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,680
 I mean, that's definitely possible. That he was molesting Gracie and

230
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,120
 found out he had to take care of it. So gross, he still didn't have to do it.

231
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,400
 He didn't have to molest her in the first place. He didn't have to get married if

232
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,840
 you're a disgusting person. There's a whole bunch of stuff that's going on here.

233
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,280
 He's in prison for life. Got sentenced to prison for life. He's in protective

234
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,800
 custody because the inmates want to kill him. So he's basically in a cell

235
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,180
 by himself. The end. I mean, I know it's not something that we typically cover on

236
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:31,180
 Dead Rabbit Radio. Tends to be a little more jokey. Tends to be a little more

237
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,660
 mysterious. But sometimes you are just... And again, I was reading this article that

238
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,660
 was written in 2004. I have links below. I found actual links other than my saved

239
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,020
 webpage, but I'm reading this article and I'm thinking, you know what's insane? Is

240
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:57,160
 this is so brutal and cold and vicious and I forgot about it. Everyone forgot

241
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,000
 about it. Like at the time when I downloaded that webpage, I am a hundred

242
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,200
 percent for sure that I was like, oh my god, this is the most vicious crime I've

243
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,920
 ever heard of. And then 14 years later, I'm surprised when I read the details

244
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,600
 again. And I'm sure at the time there were these specials and these dateline

245
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,900
 NBCs and these exposés, you know, what's going on, and people just don't

246
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,220
 remember this story anymore. And I talked on... I touched on that on an earlier

247
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,180
 episode about a school shooting everyone's forgotten. Where the guy

248
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,660
 broke into the school and molested a bunch of girls and then opened fire. And

249
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,300
 that was the worst school shooting you've never heard of. That was a long ago

250
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,540
 episode. I think it was episode 40 something. We just get so overwhelmed by

251
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,080
 the inhumanity that goes on around us that we forget these horrible horrible

252
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,720
 things. And you're like, well Jason, thanks for reminding me of it. There's a

253
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,640
 strong possibility that I don't release this episode. Or at least don't release

254
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,560
 it when it's scheduled. I'm gonna have to sit back and edit it because it is a

255
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:15,180
 heavy one. It's almost like too heavy. I don't know. Yeah, we'll see if this one

256
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,740
 gets released.
