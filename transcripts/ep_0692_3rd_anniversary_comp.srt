1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 It is here, the third anniversary special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,140
 We're going to talk about some crazy stuff this episode.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,440
 First off, Dead Rabbit Radio lost media.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,080
 Is it possible that if you tuned in on the first half hour of an episode being dropped,

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,920
 you heard a different episode?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,160
 Then we're going to take a look at some questions submitted by you, the listener.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,160
 I didn't know I submitted a question.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,720
 We're going to talk about stuff, stories that are too disturbing for Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,360
 Have I ever infiltrated a gang?

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,840
 And, do I think I'm currently being stalked by the federal government?

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,600
 Find out these questions and more on the third anniversary special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:56,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
 And yeah, this is it.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
 This is the third anniversary.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,120
 Can you guys believe it?

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,280
 It was June 13th.

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,080
 When I came home, I was out walking.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,800
 I was listening to that song Fireflies by Owl City.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,000
 And I said, that's a weird connection.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,280
 I said I'm going to start doing my podcast today.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,200
 Cause I had been thinking about doing a podcast for a long time.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,760
 I used to have a podcast back in like 2006 called Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,040
 It lasted like four episodes.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
 I have those episodes too.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
 I might release them sometime.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,920
 They're just so cringy.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,560
 They're super, super cringy.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
 But let's go ahead and get started here.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,880
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're going to have to get going.

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,160
 This show is edited.

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,760
 This is an edited podcast.

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,440
 As really a good podcast should be.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,080
 A lot of podcast people just sit down and they start talking and you can just make it

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,480
 so much tighter if you go and you start removing bad jokes.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,080
 That's my big thing.

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
 Jokes that just failed.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,320
 They just fall flat.

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,480
 They're super awkward.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
 And I edit this show.

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,280
 I don't edit out me mispronouncing stuff.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,000
 I don't edit out as probably as much as I should, but there's a certain, you still want that

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,480
 certain flavor to the show.

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,120
 The show, the show, the show is pretty absurd, right?

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,960
 Those all make edits after the episode comes out though.

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,400
 That's a neat thing about podcasts.

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,800
 You can kind of go in and edit them afterwards.

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,480
 You're kind of George Lucas-ing them.

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,480
 Case in point, there was an episode I did called the Yuba County Five.

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,160
 That was the name of the episode, but that's what it was about.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,320
 I really, really liked that episode, but in the episode I told a joke where I just started

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,760
 dropping the F-bomb and start using all these cuss words.

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,360
 And it hits you like a brick in the face.

56
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,360
 Because even though I cuss in real life, I really watch what I say on the show because

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,680
 the reason why I do that is because I know people listen to podcasts at work.

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,680
 People have also said they listen to them with their kids, but mostly it's the...

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,360
 I didn't think that would ever happen.

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,280
 It's mostly because I love to listen to podcasts at work and you can't listen to podcasts

61
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,280
 that it's cussing all the time.

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,480
 But that episode, I thought the joke was funny.

63
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,400
 I didn't think it was bad, but it just hit you.

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,280
 It came out of nowhere and I figured some guy's probably working on that Chuck E. Cheese

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,200
 listening to the podcast as Boss walks into that moment.

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,080
 So I went in and I removed that joke like a year after the episode came out.

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,440
 Like a bunch of people had already gotten fired.

68
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
 I removed it.

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,800
 But there is one episode that I made a change 30 minutes after it came out.

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
 Listen to this.

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
 [Music]

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:38,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

73
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 I'm having a great day.

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,480
 I hope you're having a great day too.

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,160
 We have a lot of stuff to cover today.

77
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,840
 I'm just gonna jump right into this.

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,880
 Our next story, what we're gonna do is we are going to talk about Or Miss.

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,640
 Now that's from episode 86, The Big Foot Massacre, where I covered a theory on the conspiracy

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,120
 theory iceberg that the Patterson Gimlin tape was actually a tape of a bunch of big

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,280
 foot spoiler alert being massacred.

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
 You listen to that clip I just played.

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,200
 I do the intro.

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,760
 And then you hear me go, "Next up," and I start a story.

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,680
 There is a full 10 minutes missing from that episode.

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,440
 The episode clocked in at around 22 minutes, which is very, very short even back then.

87
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,560
 22 minute episode.

88
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,000
 There's a whole story missing from that episode.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,960
 Now I can't tell you what it is for legal reasons.

90
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,240
 This is a really interesting story.

91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
 This is super interesting.

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,320
 So episode 86, it's really, really early on in the show.

93
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 And I gotta be real careful about how I talk about this because this person could still

94
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,280
 come after me, but we'll keep it in a nutshell here.

95
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,400
 I can't reveal who it is here either, but I had covered a story on that episode.

96
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
 One that people had requested.

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,520
 Okay, it wasn't like a story I had stumbled across.

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
 One that people had requested.

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,020
 I covered this story.

100
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,360
 I did the episode.

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,320
 I uploaded it, and then I'm just scooping off playing video games.

102
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
 I get an email.

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,200
 My phone alert goes off.

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
 I look at it.

105
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,440
 It's a legal threat to take the story down or I'm gonna get sued.

106
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,440
 Now this is before Forrest Finn, which I also got a ton of legal threats over the Forrest

107
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,440
 Finn story, but here's how you gotta navigate through life.

108
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,640
 You gotta pick your battles and you gotta trust your gut.

109
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,800
 And I read this email from this person, and basically they say, "You gotta take this step

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
 for a couple reasons."

111
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,760
 They did validate, 'cause you guys listen to the show.

112
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,040
 This is no one's first episode.

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,000
 If it is, go listen to another one, 'cause this one's all behind the scenes stuff.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
 I'll present a thing.

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
 I'll go through a theory.

116
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,080
 We'll put on our conspiracy cap and I'll kind of come up with a weirder theory than

117
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,200
 that.

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,080
 One of the theories was spot on.

119
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,400
 This person said, "Yes, that is what is going on, but I'm not this thing."

120
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,360
 You said, "I'm not this weird thing," you said, 'cause they were thinking the conspiracy

121
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,680
 cap thing was legit.

122
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
 Take it down.

123
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,240
 You gotta take it down.

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,120
 Now I knew I was gonna get requests like this doing shows.

125
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,760
 I knew that this was gonna happen, but this is where the following the gut thing came

126
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
 in.

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,360
 I read this email and I thought, "Not only will this person follow through on this threat,

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,880
 I have a gut feeling they can.

129
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,680
 They have the money or the time or both to get legal representatives involved to come

130
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,560
 after me."

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,080
 So I emailed them back my response that I give people all the time.

132
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,200
 Yeah, sure, whatever.

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440
 And I removed it.

134
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,400
 There's maybe 30 people who heard that episode unedited.

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,320
 It was up for about a half hour and then I went in, I clipped it out of the podcast itself,

136
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 and it made the episode 10 minutes shorter, and I removed the YouTube video.

137
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,600
 Never heard from them since.

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,200
 And you go, "Jason, well what's to stop someone from you covering the story tomorrow and someone

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 because again you feel that gut feeling whether or not this person will actually go through

140
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
 with it."

141
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,000
 Because when I was getting those lawsuits from the Forrest Finn people I was like, "You

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
 bozos.

143
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,640
 You absolute nimrods."

144
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,960
 And I doubled down and I tripled down.

145
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,840
 I ran the Forrest Finn thing into the ground, dug it back up and then rode it around some

146
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
 more.

147
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,360
 This one I felt was legit and I was the first person to cover this topic, but I was in the

148
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,480
 last and a bunch of other people got sued because they didn't follow their instincts.

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,640
 I remember a year or two later I was on something else, I wasn't even looking into that story

150
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,280
 because I was like, "Yeah, sure, whatever."

151
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,960
 And someone got bonked for it.

152
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,800
 A couple people got bonked for it because they were following up on their legal threat.

153
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 So whatever.

154
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,440
 And it's funny you go, "Jason, aren't you like a paranormal researcher isn't it about

155
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,600
 revealing the truth and stuff like that?"

156
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,760
 It is, but you gotta pick your battles and always say, "Can I tank the hits?"

157
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,920
 This is really weird.

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,280
 We're in this weird spot with the show.

159
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,560
 As far as podcasts go, we're in the top 2% of all the podcasts in the world.

160
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,960
 This show is a huge hit in the podcast world.

161
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,280
 I think in any given time when you look at America, we're in the top 100 true crime podcasts

162
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
 and you go, "How many true crime podcasts are there?"

163
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,440
 There's a ton.

164
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
 But that listenership is 21,000 people.

165
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,040
 21,000 people.

166
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,880
 That's pulling from the YouTube audience and that's pulling from the people who listen

167
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
 to the podcast.

168
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
 21,000 people.

169
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,280
 That's not huge.

170
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,120
 When it comes to the channel getting completely taken down or the podcast getting taken down

171
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,640
 or someone coming after me illegally.

172
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,320
 In the world of podcasting this show is a huge hit.

173
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 It's phenomenal.

174
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
 I'm so grateful.

175
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,160
 But as far as someone coming after me and can I tank that hit, got to choose your battles.

176
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,680
 That's actually a good segue into our first user question.

177
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,880
 This one's from Nikolai Mishkin on YouTube.

178
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,600
 Thank you so much for submitting this.

179
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,840
 The question is, will you keep the show going until the end?

180
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
 He'd love to hear.

181
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
 Nikolai would love to hear.

182
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,700
 90 year old Jason talking about high strangeness and things like that.

183
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,040
 That depends on you guys.

184
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
 This is the thing.

185
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,720
 The show needs to grow.

186
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
 I'm so grateful.

187
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,080
 Three years ago that first episode came out we had 14 people download it in the first

188
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,720
 week.

189
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,920
 Now in the first week an episode I drop gets 2000 downloads.

190
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,560
 It's phenomenal.

191
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
 That's massive.

192
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
 But the show needs to grow.

193
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
 If you want the show to stick around, it needs to grow.

194
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,360
 I have a lot of stories that I want to cover that I can't because I can't tank the hit

195
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,800
 if it goes sideways.

196
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,960
 That's just the bottom line.

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,400
 We need to grow the audience so I can cover more topics that I'd like to cover.

198
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,600
 There are people who hate this show who talk about it all the time online.

199
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,080
 They hate it.

200
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
 Right?

201
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,160
 If you really love the show, go to Reddit, talk about it on Reddit.

202
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,520
 Don't show up the X board.

203
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,560
 I'm not saying that because that needs to be like a research board and let the people

204
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,840
 have these French theories.

205
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,520
 No one else to post about them.

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
 Post them on there.

207
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
 Don't show up the X board.

208
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,960
 But go to Reddit, talk about it online, talk about it to your friends, print out the flyers.

209
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,400
 You guys need to get the word out because the show needs to grow.

210
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,160
 It needs to grow and that's how it remains sustainable.

211
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,480
 I remember there was one guy a long time ago who goes, "I don't want the show to get big.

212
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,560
 I want it to be small so it doesn't change."

213
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
 That's not how it works.

214
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,280
 What happens is if the show stops growing or starts shrinking, it will change.

215
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,480
 It will change because then I have to go, "Am I doing something wrong?

216
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,280
 Why do I have a thousand less listeners this quarter as opposed to the last quarter?

217
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
 What's going on?"

218
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,600
 That's just an odd way.

219
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,800
 I understand the logic behind it.

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,640
 It's like you don't want your band to go national because you're afraid it's going to go to

221
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
 their head.

222
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,800
 But we're at episode 695 in.

223
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,280
 The show is dialed in.

224
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,640
 There's such a formula to it.

225
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,520
 So don't worry about that.

226
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,680
 Worry about.

227
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,840
 We go three quarters and the show is losing listeners.

228
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
 It's like a weightlifter.

229
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,200
 I like the weightlifter analogy.

230
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,880
 You start off your benching 100 pounds and then eventually you keep working.

231
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
 You're doing your best.

232
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,760
 You're able to bench 300 pounds and someone walks up and goes, "You should be grateful

233
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
 with you can bench 300 pounds.

234
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,920
 How many people can bench 300 pounds?"

235
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,040
 But no, you have to keep pushing forward.

236
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,760
 And eventually if you keep doing the same exercise over and over and over again and you

237
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,800
 can't increase your bench, you can't get to 310, you have to do a new exercise.

238
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,120
 You have to figure out a new way to approach it.

239
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
 And that's a good segue into our next question actually.

240
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,320
 This is from Wiselhorn or Weiselhorn.

241
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,960
 I think it's our normally pronounced name.

242
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
 Patreon supporter.

243
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
 Thank you very much for supporting the Patreon.

244
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,520
 Weiselhorn's question was, "What are some interesting stories that you had a cut due

245
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,960
 to them being too depressing or disturbing?"

246
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,040
 And that's a great question and there's been a lot of them.

247
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,720
 I've toyed around with the idea of doing a true crime podcast.

248
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
 Strictly true crime podcast.

249
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,280
 Whether or not it was on the side or it was an evolution of Dead Rabbit Radio, which I'm

250
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,600
 not planning on doing anytime soon, but I was thinking about that because I have this huge

251
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,960
 backlog of stories that are too depressing for Dead Rabbit Radio.

252
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,960
 And it's interesting because when I started doing the podcast, the podcast that I had

253
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:44,360
 in my head was less goofy than the podcast turned out to be.

254
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,000
 Looking back, I thought the show was going to be more serious.

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,280
 That first episode is so goofy and I didn't know it at the time, but it really set the

256
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,080
 tone for the show.

257
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,080
 And if you listen to some of those early episodes, you can tell I'm trying to find my feet.

258
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,280
 And to me, I didn't know it at the time, but to me, one of the key episodes, I don't remember

259
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
 which episode it was.

260
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,480
 It was like in the first 10.

261
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,000
 I tried telling a really spooky true crime story about a man breaking into a house and

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,840
 it was really self-serious because I was still trying to find the tone.

263
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,200
 And I realized, I recorded it and I realized, I wish I had kept this episode, the raw audio.

264
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,600
 I deleted it early on.

265
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,440
 I was deleting the raw audio because I didn't have space on my hard drive.

266
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,920
 And I realized after the episode, I made all these errors.

267
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,840
 The episode that errors is me laughing so hard at this story because of all these errors

268
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
 I made.

269
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,960
 So even when I was trying to be super serious, it just didn't work.

270
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,760
 I just thought the show would be more serious.

271
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,840
 I thought the show would be darker than it is.

272
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,240
 This is one of those things that you learn over time.

273
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,000
 There's a place and a time for the dark stuff.

274
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,960
 And there's stuff that's just too dark for the show.

275
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,480
 And there was one week I did where it was like disturbing week or something like that.

276
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
 You guys complained about it.

277
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,240
 I got a lot of emails.

278
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,480
 Because you can have a depressing show, you can have a dark show, you can have a serious

279
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
 show.

280
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,880
 But when you have a show that's light hearted, then all of a sudden it's telling these really

281
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,600
 heart-wrenching stories.

282
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,280
 Then Tuesday is the same and then Wednesday is the same.

283
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,680
 It really kind of bums you out.

284
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
 That'd be the same thing as if you go to watch a Mickey Mouse cartoon and then there's an

285
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,120
 episode where Mickey Mouse is like drowning his nephew.

286
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,360
 It's like you don't expect it.

287
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,400
 Now again, you could be watching Adult Swim and you could be watching a whole night of

288
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,760
 animation and some of it's more serious than the other.

289
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
 There's places and times for this stuff.

290
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,040
 And I do tell some kind of dark stuff.

291
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,360
 But I have stuff that's way darker than anything I'd talk about on the show.

292
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,040
 I remember there was one story I wanted to cover for a long time.

293
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,960
 I think I finally got around to it.

294
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
 Fast forward.

295
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,440
 Fast forward for a minute.

296
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,800
 I think this is disturbing even though you don't know what it is.

297
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,360
 The one about the kid who wanted to show that autism was a serious condition and more attention

298
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,680
 had to be paid to autism.

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,280
 He suffered from autism so he picked up a three year old and threw him off a building.

300
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
 It's like a museum.

301
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,800
 It's like one of those open air museums or like three or four story museum and he just

302
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,080
 picked this kid up and he was standing next to him and threw him off of the ledge.

303
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,120
 The kid survived.

304
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
 But he was horribly messed up.

305
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
 Stuff like that.

306
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,280
 There's a lot of true crime stuff.

307
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,320
 I came across a story today that I'm not going to share with you.

308
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,920
 The story detailed the sound.

309
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,440
 The sound that made when this action took place.

310
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
 It disturbed me.

311
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,960
 I read it and I read more true crime than anything.

312
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,080
 And so I have to make determinations about what to share with you guys.

313
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,560
 This is really what it comes down to.

314
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,640
 I'll read stuff.

315
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,600
 And I'll go this is a really interesting true crime story but doesn't add anything to the

316
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,080
 overall dead rabbit radio catalog.

317
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,720
 Like it's a horrible true crime story.

318
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
 What does it add though to it?

319
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,400
 Is there something I can take away from it other than the world can be horrible sometimes?

320
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,160
 And that's what a lot of true crime stories are.

321
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,880
 And I actually have three or four listed in my notes here that I was going to mention.

322
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,280
 They're just horrible.

323
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 They're horrible things.

324
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,520
 I think the thing with the young man with autism, he threw the dude off the roof.

325
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,520
 I think the reason why I talked about that was because I went into, because more information

326
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,400
 to come out about his search terms and how he was trying to plan this out.

327
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,880
 Like we could start looking at the judicial system side of it and trying to cover it up.

328
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,200
 I'm pretty sure I covered that.

329
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
 I'll have to go back through.

330
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,640
 I think I did it on a live episode actually.

331
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,440
 But the point is, is like if I can find something that kind of relates back to law and order

332
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,720
 or some sort of social thing.

333
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,360
 If it's just a human being walking into a room and doing something atrocious to another

334
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,880
 person and that's the whole story, I tend to leave those out.

335
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,600
 I do save the articles because I may do a true crime podcast someday.

336
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,120
 That is that.

337
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
 That just is that stuff.

338
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,880
 And you would be expecting it when you'd be like, "Alright, what am I going to do?"

339
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,040
 You're about today.

340
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,160
 But if it's just popping in between stories of meth addicts masturbating in Starbucks

341
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,280
 and children pooping out eggs and all that stuff, like it's just so jarring.

342
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,400
 And I was getting complaints.

343
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,280
 And the thing is, is like I knew it was jarring too.

344
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,720
 It's not like I said I'm never going to cover them again, but I thought there's a place

345
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,880
 in the time for these.

346
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,760
 And if I'm going to cover them, there needs to be a reason.

347
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,120
 It just can't be, "This world's horrible.

348
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
 This is a horrible world."

349
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,880
 I don't believe it's a horrible world, but that's kind of, those episodes like cussing

350
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,080
 can just hit you and you don't expect it.

351
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,360
 You're expecting to hear something creepy, maybe something disturbing, but there's a

352
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,680
 difference between the dog and the kitchen story disturbing and something horrible happening

353
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,200
 to like some seven-year-old who was like eating cereal and some guy broke in the house.

354
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,240
 There's two different levels of disturbing.

355
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,920
 I want to segue from that real quick.

356
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,360
 This actually wasn't a user question, but it's something I wanted to talk about.

357
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
 I'll talk about it real brief.

358
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,920
 I'll try to keep it brief, dude.

359
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,600
 There's a story that I've wanted to cover since really the early days of Dead Rabbit

360
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 Radio.

361
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,280
 I'm almost too much of a fanboy to cover it.

362
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:33,880
 It might be my favorite story that combines like true crime and conspiracy and like paranormal.

363
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,360
 You guys are going to laugh.

364
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:44,160
 I can't even talk about it because I will, I'll just go on forever balloon boy.

365
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
 Balloon boy.

366
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
 You remember balloon boy?

367
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,120
 It was Falcon Heaney, that guy, Richard Heaney built that ceramic, not ceramic, that won't

368
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,120
 fly the aluminum balloon and it flew away and the helicopters were chasing it and they

369
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,720
 thought that Falcon Heaney was on board.

370
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,360
 It was a huge news story and it turns out that Falcon Heaney wasn't on board.

371
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,280
 You're like Jason, that's really out of all of these episodes.

372
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,520
 Everything you've covered, I love that story.

373
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,840
 My research probably about as much about balloon boy as I have, 9/11 was an insight.

374
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:31,240
 I love balloon boy and weird coincidence, the Heaney boys released a rap album that stated

375
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,040
 that 9/11 was an insight job.

376
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,080
 The story is so bizarre.

377
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,880
 The Heaney boys became musicians, they're still musicians, Richard Heaney tried having

378
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,640
 this television show, it was like myth busters but it was like a paranormal myth busters.

379
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,440
 Then he became a superhero known as aluminum man and then he invented this really cool

380
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,760
 invention that turned your truck into a half of a transformer.

381
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,200
 It's, I'm so fascinated by the story of balloon boy.

382
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,280
 I want to do a full on segment on him but this topic is so sprawling and since I'm such

383
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:18,880
 a fan boy of it, I'm so fascinated because it's so, I think it has to do with people's

384
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:27,800
 obsession with fame and then science, those two things combining and then conspiracy theories

385
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:34,240
 like Richard Heaney wanted to get a television show called side detectives so he could build

386
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:41,920
 a bunker so him and his family could survive the 2012 global catastrophe.

387
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,440
 That's so fascinating to me.

388
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,280
 That's so fascinating to me and I want to cover it, I pretty much covered it now.

389
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,960
 But I mean I could honestly go, there's so, just the superhero story alone where he became

390
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,040
 aluminum man and started his own rock video.

391
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 Fascinating.

392
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,160
 There are some times where I'm researching or working or something and I go, I need a

393
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
 Heaney break.

394
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
 I'm not even being ironic.

395
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,160
 I'm not even being ironic and I will go and I will watch interviews with Richard Heaney

396
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,240
 and again I'm not, it's one of those things like I don't want to come across like I'm

397
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,680
 making fun of a guy.

398
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,480
 I find it fascinating.

399
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,600
 It's not one of those things like I'm watching a slow motion car wreck.

400
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:27,720
 I'm so fascinated by him as a character and yeah it's so bizarre.

401
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,220
 Balloon boy.

402
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,240
 I remember once tops baseball cars.

403
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,320
 I'm not a baseball fan.

404
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,640
 I'm not a fan of sports although I am a fan of going.

405
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
 This is so weird.

406
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,480
 I'm a fan of going to live sports.

407
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,640
 Not really watching them.

408
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,680
 I get bored but there's a certain energy when you go and you're surrounded by a bunch of

409
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,920
 people who are there to watch something.

410
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
 It's different than a movie.

411
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,240
 I find sports pretty boring to watch.

412
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,200
 Basketball I can watch in person.

413
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,480
 Football I can watch in person.

414
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,320
 Baseball it's kind of boring but anyways tops baseball cards was doing this giveaway where

415
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,120
 you bought a pack of baseball cards and inside of it was a bunch of junk.

416
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,560
 Right a bunch of baseball cards.

417
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,680
 They're like oh Mickey Man a rookie guard.

418
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,800
 Some of these packs had little pieces of the balloon from balloon boy and I wanted one

419
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 of those.

420
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 I still look on eBay.

421
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,520
 I can't find them anywhere.

422
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,840
 The cards I couldn't find the cards being sold around me when they came.

423
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
 I tried man.

424
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,400
 I'm obsessed with the balloon boy story.

425
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
 It's fascinating.

426
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
 I find the whole saga super fascinating.

427
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,240
 I could watch deep dive documentaries on that dude for days but again I'm too close to the

428
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
 story.

429
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,920
 I have my stuffed balloon that I go to bed with every night.

430
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
 I would like to cover it someday.

431
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,280
 My thing is like I got to get a lot of requests for stories.

432
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,640
 I'm so thankful for those requests because we got a lot of good stuff out of them.

433
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:58,520
 But when people request stories that are popular my go to response is what can I add to it?

434
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,360
 By me retelling it how does that add anything to it.

435
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,480
 There are some stories that no one's ever heard of right.

436
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,760
 So I don't have any problem covering those but like something with the balloon boy if

437
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,560
 I was just telling you the story of the balloon boy in the allotted time that I have on the

438
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,080
 show.

439
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,360
 Can I really add anything more other than the fact that I really like the balloon boy?

440
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,320
 Or is it something that I could find a documentary and do with Dead Rabbit recommends you to

441
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 watch it yourself.

442
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,160
 That's what I have to ask myself by my transforming it in any way.

443
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,920
 It's so funny because Nikolai Mishkin and Charlotte Rene both asked the question about

444
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
 the time limit.

445
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,160
 They wish we had longer shows.

446
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,600
 And the reason why that's basically Charlotte kind of hit the nail on the head.

447
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,820
 Those range between 30 and 40 minutes and that means I've recorded an hour worth of

448
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
 stuff.

449
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,440
 For every hour I record it takes 2 hours to edit.

450
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,160
 So when you listen to a 40 minute episode there's 3 hours of work into that.

451
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,000
 If I record an hour worth of stuff there's probably an hour and a half worth of material

452
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,040
 which takes me 3 hours to edit.

453
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,480
 So I spend already 4 to 5 hours a day doing the show.

454
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,600
 The reason why the episodes are as short as they are is because of that and it is for

455
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,720
 your guys as well.

456
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,880
 Because yes it is awesome to have a nice long episode.

457
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
 The shows used to have a hard limit of 35 minutes.

458
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,040
 I actually increased it to 40 minutes.

459
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,020
 So I have added the episodes are longer now than they used to be but I don't want them

460
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,480
 to keep getting longer because not everyone has 40 minutes a day.

461
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,200
 I know most people listen to the show and they're driving the car, they're washing their

462
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,240
 dishes, they're doing their homework, they're listening to every other word.

463
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,720
 I'm totally fine with that.

464
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,080
 But I also don't want it to be like this thing that just keeps getting longer and longer.

465
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
 Everybody is the soul of wit.

466
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,120
 Keep it short, keep them wanting more and it's less for me to edit out.

467
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,280
 Let's hit a couple more of these questions real quick here.

468
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,240
 Splaccatorious sent over this question.

469
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
 Patreon supporters, Splaccatorious.

470
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,720
 Has your time producing the show caused any changes in the way you view a specific phenomenon?

471
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,040
 Do I look at aliens differently, ghosts differently, things like that?

472
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,240
 It's an interesting question, a pretty short answer.

473
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
 Yes.

474
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
 Yes.

475
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,520
 I'm way more into alien encounters now than I was before I started doing the show.

476
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
 Like way more into alien.

477
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,280
 Because when you first hear stories about UFOs, it's just lights in the sky.

478
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,720
 Which is interesting in a, like without any background information, there's a light in

479
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 the sky.

480
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,840
 That's kind of weird, what can it be?

481
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,400
 But that's boring overall.

482
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,800
 Like outside of it being an extraterrestrial visitor, it could really be anything that's

483
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,920
 unidentified.

484
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,800
 You would hear stuff like Betty and Barney Hill abduction conspiracy theories, stuff

485
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 like that.

486
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,960
 But for the most part it was great aliens abducting humans.

487
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,760
 Doing the show we were able to talk about aliens abducting bears.

488
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
 Right?

489
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,560
 Aliens that abducted a bear, the sheep slayer, the creature that came down and was killing

490
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,400
 all the sheep and the woman had to run out with.

491
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,680
 I think it was a whip and was fighting it, or the alien had a whip, whatever it was.

492
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,720
 Yes, all those episodes of being the show notes, that's really fascinating to me.

493
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,880
 Like I now go out of my way to find really cool alien encounter stories.

494
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,680
 Close encounters are the third and the fourth kind.

495
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,040
 Before I was just kind of like, eh, Bigfoot hasn't really changed that much.

496
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,280
 I still think that it's maybe a 50/50 shot whether or not he exists.

497
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,640
 I wasn't a huge fan of his growing up.

498
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,400
 I was a bigger fan of Balloon Boy than Bigfoot.

499
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
 I do find him interesting.

500
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
 There just doesn't seem to be a lot in the mythos.

501
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,160
 We cover him when he does weird stuff like wear clothes or walk through portals, things

502
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
 like that.

503
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,480
 Ghosts, ghosts I've always believed in, hasn't really changed my viewpoint on ghosts.

504
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,360
 There was an interesting question too by Splaccatorious.

505
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,600
 Are there any dangers or pitfalls in approaching the paranormal with too much skepticism?

506
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,100
 It's boring.

507
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,480
 I think that's the biggest pitfall.

508
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,240
 This show, it's funny because as the show progressed, if you go back and listen to early

509
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,920
 episodes, I was way more skeptical.

510
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,360
 And the reason why I stopped focusing on that wasn't because I became less skeptical.

511
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,720
 It's because that's not entertaining.

512
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,600
 There are some stuff that is debunkable, like Vril, the Nazi soul juice that they're using

513
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
 at Power UFOs.

514
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
 100% debunked.

515
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,520
 The aluminum wedge, the tooth, the, what was it called, the tooth of Iude or the wedge of

516
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,240
 Iude, which is this aluminum wedge that apparently traveled back in time.

517
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
 Full out debunked.

518
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,480
 The Cooper family photo, I saw that on the Explored the other day.

519
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
 Full out debunked.

520
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,240
 And I think it's fascinating when you can look at these stories and debunk them.

521
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,040
 But when you're talking about like ghost encounters, alien encounters, cryptids and stuff like

522
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,280
 that, it's no fun to tell a Bigfoot story and go, "But we all know Bigfoot's not real."

523
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,440
 There's never been any proof that he's existed outside of a couple of footprints and blurry.

524
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
 That's not an entertaining podcast.

525
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,280
 And it's not really, it wouldn't even be entertaining to have a conversation with your friend where

526
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,600
 you're like, "Dude, you want to hear this crazy story and tell the story?"

527
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,920
 And they go, "Yeah, but that didn't happen."

528
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,440
 And you go, "Well, yeah, it might not have happened.

529
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,920
 The Falcon he might not have been on the balloon."

530
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,080
 But it was just, yeah.

531
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,480
 So I think the big thing with being too skeptical is just boring.

532
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,120
 I think you can have an open mind and go, "Yeah, you know, Bigfoot might be real."

533
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
 Right?

534
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,640
 I didn't bet money that he was real, but I loved learning about him.

535
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,560
 I love learning the weird stuff about him.

536
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,600
 Again, like wearing pants or walking through portals.

537
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,400
 Christian and Tommy Davidson, both longtime Patreon supporters, had a question about what

538
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,000
 happened with the conformers.

539
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,720
 This is an interesting story.

540
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,000
 And this is kind of a segue from what we were talking about.

541
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,440
 Conformers, man, the show notes are going to be full of episodes.

542
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,880
 The conformers was an episode I did a long time ago.

543
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,640
 And I think it was the only topic I talked about on the episode.

544
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,600
 The conceit of the storyline is this, is that there are two people.

545
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,800
 It was Clay Pickering and his brother.

546
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,200
 I don't remember his name.

547
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,360
 Falcon, Falcon Pickering?

548
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,720
 I don't remember.

549
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,640
 They put forth this story that there is only one race of aliens.

550
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
 They're called the conformers.

551
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,000
 They're a silica-based alien race.

552
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,640
 They sound like it's pebbles in a bucket when they're talking.

553
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
 They're super vicious.

554
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
 And they're also, if you know this detail, I think they're also highly religious.

555
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,840
 It was this weird combination of things.

556
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,440
 They're the only alien race that exists and they smell, they're super stinky.

557
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,080
 I had heard about this, I think I heard about them on the Mysterious Universe podcast a

558
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,600
 long time ago, but these guys were super vicious aliens.

559
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,360
 They're the only ones that were out there.

560
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,160
 And because it was the truth, whenever you talked about them online, stuff would get

561
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,280
 erased.

562
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,040
 And while I was researching the story, stuff was getting erased.

563
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,360
 While I was looking into it, websites were going down.

564
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,120
 They weren't in the wayback machine.

565
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,320
 Like I had taken notes, I had read them, I had kind of absorbed the information, but

566
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,400
 when I went back to go add them to the show notes, the websites were gone.

567
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,320
 Like within a matter of the month I looked at them.

568
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,560
 Very, very interesting episode.

569
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,600
 But this is the same thing with the Eradas story.

570
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,360
 I still see that pop up in conspiracy theory circles.

571
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,720
 Did you know if you used the word "Erada?"

572
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,400
 I know I'm probably pronouncing it wrong, but there's this word.

573
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,040
 You use it, your website gets taken down and the thread gets taken down and people get

574
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,360
 banned off of Reddit and people are constantly talking about the story and they never get

575
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
 banned.

576
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,760
 I did a full episode on the Eradas story.

577
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
 It's still up.

578
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
 I think I even labeled that story.

579
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,520
 In jest, I knew there was nothing behind the mystery, but this might be the last episode

580
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,600
 of Dead or Abra Radio.

581
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,840
 The whole thing about the Conformer story was that you can't talk about it.

582
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:54,320
 It gets erased and that story was like episode 70 or something like that.

583
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,520
 Maybe a little bit after 100.

584
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,080
 It's been a long time.

585
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,600
 So the episode's still up, the podcast is still up, I'm still alive.

586
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,160
 So that idea that if you, I don't know what the timing was with the stuff being taken down

587
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,480
 while I was researching it.

588
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
 That was weird.

589
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,840
 I really thought about the Conformers too when I was staying at a haunted house recently.

590
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:19,960
 I didn't know it was haunted, but outside of my place, someone, a friend of mine recorded

591
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,800
 this weird noise that I said it kind of sound like little pebbles in the bucket.

592
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,000
 So maybe the Conformer show, it seemed like a magical fairy.

593
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Could it have been anything?

594
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,640
 It was just a weird noise.

595
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,840
 So the idea was, did the Conformers visit my place?

596
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
 They made a mess of it.

597
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,360
 I'm like, ah, it's so stinky.

598
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,600
 My eyes are going from side to side.

599
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,120
 I'm the stinky one.

600
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,040
 I'm the one who's stunk this place up.

601
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,280
 Interesting story.

602
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,760
 I think it holds as much weight as pretty much any alien story.

603
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,200
 It has the same pitfalls, i.e. no proof.

604
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,280
 It's just kind of people talking about it.

605
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,480
 But it's fascinating nonetheless.

606
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,200
 It does kind of run in, basically when you set up a story that says this is the only

607
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,840
 story that's true, all the other alien stories are fake.

608
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,920
 It kind of puts up an insurmountable wall of other evidence against it.

609
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,680
 All these other, what were these other people seeing if yours is the only story that's true?

610
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,040
 But it's still a fascinating story.

611
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
 I still bump into it from time to time.

612
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,920
 I wish it was more popular.

613
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,160
 I wish it was a more popular story.

614
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:23,720
 I think it has the interest level to be a bigger conspiracy story, but it's just not.

615
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,600
 This episode is going to go a little long.

616
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,160
 This episode is going to go a little bit long because it's kind of the third anniversary

617
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
 special.

618
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
 I got a couple other questions to go through.

619
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
 I want to start with these.

620
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,360
 These are kind of more personal questions.

621
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,680
 I thought this was interesting.

622
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,000
 Backdoor Burglar sent this question because I talked a lot about when I was growing up

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,760
 in Orangevale, California, there was a lot of skinheads, a lot of white supremacists,

624
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,400
 and there was like a gang called the Pecker Woods, and then you had other white supremacy

625
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,040
 gangs in the area and stuff like that.

626
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,240
 Backdoor Burglar asked me this question.

627
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
 I thought it was interesting.

628
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,720
 Did I ever have to quote blend in with Orangevale skinheads to avoid a dangerous situation?

629
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,000
 I'm going to give you guys a piece of advice here.

630
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,500
 Hopefully you'll never have to take it.

631
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,440
 Hopefully you'll never be in a situation where you'll have to remember this piece of advice.

632
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:15,520
 Never, ever pretend to be in a gang that you are not a member of.

633
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,800
 That is one of the worst things you can do.

634
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:25,560
 It is literally better to take the butt kicking than pretend you're in a gang that you're

635
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,560
 not a member of.

636
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,760
 If you do that, let me tell you this story.

637
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,640
 One day I was visiting my cousin in jail.

638
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,800
 He's now in Sacramento and my cousin had just been arrested.

639
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,160
 I was taking the metro train, the light rail, and coming back from county jail.

640
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,720
 I'm taking it and I get on and sitting in the little train car that I'm in is this giant

641
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
 blood gangster.

642
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,800
 Not like a giant anthropomorphic puddle.

643
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,880
 It's this giant blood gangster.

644
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,360
 It's like six foot two.

645
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,320
 He's sitting there with his girlfriend.

646
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,800
 She's dressed in red.

647
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,920
 He's in head to toe red.

648
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,440
 He has a pit bull on a chain.

649
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,880
 I just walk by, sit down.

650
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,080
 I'm like maybe sitting a couple seats away from him, if that.

651
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
 We're just going on the train.

652
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,040
 I remember just thinking about my cousin.

653
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,440
 This was when he killed a guy.

654
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,640
 This was when he was just recently arrested for killing a guy.

655
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,800
 This story's 12 years old, but at the time he had just been arrested for killing this

656
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
 guy.

657
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,480
 He was in prison, in prison, in prison, in jail.

658
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
 Eventually he was found guilty.

659
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
 He was sent to prison.

660
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,480
 I'm taking the train back and I'm just thinking about my cousin.

661
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,040
 The light rail makes it stops.

662
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,880
 The light rail stops at the station and another blood gets on the train.

663
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,320
 I'm sitting there and I see this other blood get on the train.

664
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,280
 This guy's like six foot three.

665
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,520
 He's one inch taller.

666
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,480
 The guy sitting down, dressed in head to toe red.

667
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,480
 His girlfriend, head to toe red and he has his pit bull on the chain.

668
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
 He gets nervous.

669
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:05,280
 I remember sitting there and I thought, if the six foot two gang member is nervous, you

670
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,940
 better be nervous.

671
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,720
 The other blood gets on the train and he immediately, to the guy sitting down with the pit bull,

672
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,800
 to the guy with the pit bull, challenges him.

673
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
 Where are you from?

674
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,640
 The dude sitting down responded with a certain street name.

675
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,720
 The other blood goes, you know so and so and so and so.

676
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,400
 The guy sitting down goes, yeah, that dude does this.

677
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
 What about this guy?

678
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
 You know this guy.

679
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,320
 The other guy goes, oh, yeah man.

680
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,600
 They sat down and they chatted the rest of the ride.

681
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,800
 I sat there and I knew what was going on.

682
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 If that dude sitting down got one question wrong, there was going to be a massacre.

683
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,440
 He was challenging him.

684
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,600
 He wanted to know where he was from, what neighborhood he was representing.

685
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,960
 If there was some guy sitting on there and he thought it was all cool and yo, I'm a blood

686
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,880
 and that dude walked on, that would have been a totally different situation.

687
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,920
 That guy was ready to fight that dude with the pit bull.

688
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,840
 So short answer to this question, no.

689
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,520
 Never ever pretend to be in a gang that you're not a member of.

690
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,960
 That is actually the worst crime.

691
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,560
 It's the same thing as stolen valor, right?

692
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,920
 People in the military, they go, hey, I fought for these medals.

693
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
 I lost friends.

694
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,600
 I lost brothers and sisters.

695
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,320
 And you're pretending to be one of us.

696
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,400
 So in valor, you'll go to prison, right?

697
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,600
 If you pretend to be in a gang that you're not in, you're treated far worse than if you

698
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,040
 were a civilian or if you're an arrival gang.

699
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,760
 And Rudy Jazz, and this kind of goes into the same thing, Rudy Jazz, and I think Tommy

700
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,000
 Davidson mentioned it as well, more wild stories from my youth.

701
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,920
 I think it's funny because those kind of go into the thing I was talking about disturbing

702
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,800
 stories in the sense that there's a time and a place for them.

703
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,720
 Yeah, there'll be more stories about crazy stuff I did when I was a kid, but you don't

704
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,600
 want the podcast to just be that.

705
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,360
 I really like to space those out.

706
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,240
 The personal ghost stories, I even space those out and those are more on theme.

707
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,840
 But when I talk about stuff that it's about me, you really gotta space it out.

708
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,080
 Otherwise, it's just too much.

709
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
 You know what I mean?

710
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,120
 That's a nice side dish.

711
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,240
 That's a nice little appetizer, but you don't want to get it all the time.

712
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,680
 Let's do three more questions here real quick and then we're going to wrap it up.

713
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,760
 Nick Buston, Guston, Patreon supporter, always tuning in for the live episodes, really really

714
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,040
 great him and his girl, love the show, Dead Rabbit Radio.

715
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,480
 As this question, do you believe you're on a watch list or tracked by any government agency?

716
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,040
 I've had interactions with the FBI, I've had interactions with the CIA, they owe me $1,000.

717
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,400
 If I mention that before, that riles me up every single time.

718
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,120
 The CIA got in the middle of a business thing, it was totally legit.

719
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,160
 They owe me a thousand, at least a thousand dollars.

720
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,840
 I should start charging them interest.

721
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:00,440
 But anyways, anyways, I think I've talked about that on the show before.

722
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,240
 You've never mentioned that the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency owes you $1,000.

723
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,920
 Well they do.

724
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,000
 I wasn't doing nothing with them.

725
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,560
 It's not like they had some terrorist group coming after me thinking I know anyone in

726
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
 the CIA.

727
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,840
 They got in the middle of a business that I was part of.

728
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
 I had a contract.

729
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,120
 It was totally legit.

730
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,400
 It was 100% legal.

731
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,680
 The CIA came in and they shut it down.

732
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,000
 They're like, Jason, the CIA does not shut down legal businesses.

733
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,080
 Listen, I can't prove that the CIA owes me $1,000.

734
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,720
 Because that's kind of hard.

735
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,080
 It's not like they give you receipt.

736
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
 But they owe me $1,000.

737
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,520
 But anyways, do I think, Jason, don't avoid that.

738
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,600
 I want to know why you think the CIA owes you $1,000 and why they would shut down your

739
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,600
 "legitimate business anyways."

740
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,640
 Do I think I'm on any sort of government watch list?

741
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:07,320
 I'm sure I'm on the same watch list that everyone else is.

742
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,560
 I would say that.

743
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
 I would say that.

744
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
 I'm sure there are.

745
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,280
 I'm sure the podcast has popped up from time to time.

746
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,520
 Every so often keywords are said and it's getting taken up by Carnivore, which I don't

747
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,400
 know if that's still the name for it, but Carnivore during the Clinton administration

748
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:31,480
 was this program that consumed all media and all phone calls and then looked for keywords.

749
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,640
 Back in the Clinton administration, that was a huge conspiracy.

750
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,480
 Now I say that to you, you're like, yeah, obviously.

751
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,800
 We know that's true.

752
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,080
 We know that happens.

753
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,600
 So I'm sure that there are people...

754
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,560
 Do you see here's the thing, I think I've probably popped up on certain watch lists and

755
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,520
 stuff like that, but do I think they're watching me?

756
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
 No.

757
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,040
 I hope they're listening to the show.

758
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
 You know what I mean?

759
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,400
 I think I want more people to listen to the show.

760
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,160
 If it turns out that every week the CIA holds a meeting and they listen to an entire week's

761
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,280
 worth of episodes, that'd be dope, right?

762
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,960
 Because then they're enjoying the show and they're having a good time.

763
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,360
 But I've had interactions with the FBI long before and positive interactions.

764
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,320
 Long before I did Dead Rabbit Radio.

765
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,440
 I've had a couple times where I've had to meet with FBI agents.

766
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,320
 I think I guys told you that's one where I found that really cryptic website that had

767
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,040
 all these codes.

768
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,320
 And I just happened to be at a place where the FBI was at.

769
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,920
 You're like, Jason, you got to give us more detail here.

770
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,360
 I passed the codes on long to them.

771
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,480
 This was after 9/11 and they're looking at them and they're like, yeah, this is what

772
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,920
 we need people to do.

773
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,240
 There's just too much stuff out there because this was like 2002 and it was these coded messages

774
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,280
 going back and forth that looked like they were planning some sort of attack.

775
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,240
 So I've had interactions with the feds like that.

776
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,200
 The IRS, okay, if I'm on any watch list, it's the IRS.

777
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,760
 I need to get that stuff sorted out.

778
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:06,760
 But yeah, as far as like federal, NSA, FBI, CIA watch list, the CIA is on my watch list.

779
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,680
 I'm watching for my thousand dollars.

780
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,120
 But other than that, I'm sure that I'm on the same.

781
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,320
 Maybe I'm on some special thing.

782
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,720
 I don't think so really.

783
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,960
 I really don't think so.

784
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,600
 And what's funny is that's a perfect lead into our next question because I'm super paranoid.

785
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,080
 So for me to go, I don't think the FBI has a dedicated division or they have an agent.

786
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,160
 I think they probably do have people that listen to conspiracy content.

787
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
 And that's what I'm saying.

788
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,400
 Like I may pop up every so often in this wheel when I talk about Hillary Clinton's shape-shifting

789
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,160
 pants at Guantanamo Bay.

790
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,000
 It probably does trigger something and someone probably listens to the episode or goes to

791
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,400
 some sort of AI.

792
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,640
 He's like, "Ha ha ha ha ha."

793
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
 He's just laughing.

794
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:51,080
 But I don't think I'm on any sort of like watch list as far as how we would traditionally

795
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
 think.

796
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,320
 I don't think I'm on like some sort of Ruby Ridge level warning system.

797
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,440
 But I am very, very paranoid person.

798
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,680
 So moving on to that, we have this YouTube comment from Nitin Kitten 2014.

799
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,160
 Have I ever considered doing a meetup like a big one?

800
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,920
 I've had people say, "Hey man, I'm traveling through your town.

801
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,360
 I'd like to hang out."

802
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,200
 And I'd love to do that.

803
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,160
 But you guys got to understand, I'm super, super paranoid.

804
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,400
 Like it doesn't really come, that's one of those things like the Dead Rabbit Radio, that

805
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,840
 is authentically me, but there's, everyone has different sides of the personality.

806
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,680
 I don't think the paranoid part of me, I don't think the person who grew up in bad neighborhoods

807
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,160
 comes across the lot on the show.

808
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,720
 I've thought about doing, I'm thinking about doing a meetup when I go to visit family in

809
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
 Sacramento in July.

810
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,880
 I'm taking three weeks off in July, like I do every summer.

811
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,200
 I'm going to go visit my family down in Sacramento.

812
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,880
 I'm thinking about doing a meetup in Citrus Heights.

813
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
 That would be really cool.

814
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,120
 I think it would be awesome.

815
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,000
 But again, I'm thinking when I announce that I'm going to be in a location, the CIA is

816
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,960
 like, "Oh, you think we only took $1,000 from you, eh?"

817
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
 You know what I mean?

818
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,840
 I do have a paranoid streak in me.

819
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
 There are people that I've pissed off.

820
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:15,360
 You might find it hard to believe, but I've pissed off people long before the show.

821
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,920
 People who would really like to know where I'm at ahead of time.

822
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,480
 I don't know, maybe they're all gone by now, who knows.

823
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,080
 But that's another thing, like there are legitimately people out there, not like forest fanatics

824
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,160
 or stuff like that.

825
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,840
 There are legitimately people out there who would love to know that I'm going to be at

826
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,120
 Citrus Heights on July 18th at 3 p.m.

827
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,080
 That's the thing.

828
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
 That's the thing.

829
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:51,600
 I gotta be careful about announcing my locations, because there's people out there who want

830
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
 to come after Lil JJ.

831
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,920
 You didn't know that was my street name, Lil JJ.

832
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
 There are people out there.

833
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,760
 So I gotta be careful about this stuff, but I really would like to do a meetup.

834
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,440
 I think we have time for one, but I love this question.

835
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,720
 Stuart Meatball sent me this question.

836
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,720
 In all honesty, how did you manage to drop the pain pills and the weed?

837
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,920
 That's a really interesting question.

838
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,560
 A long time ago, listeners of the show know I used to drink a lot when I was in colleges

839
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,920
 to smoke weed from basically 21 to 25.

840
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,160
 I was drinking and smoking every single day.

841
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,920
 On the episode Solar Plexus Clown Gliders, I mentioned I injured my back and I was prescribed

842
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,000
 240 Vicodin a month.

843
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,280
 This is back in 2004, something like that, 2005.

844
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,440
 I was on them for a couple of years.

845
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,200
 The pain pills, I connected them to a physical pain I was suffering.

846
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,680
 And when you stop taking pain pills, you get horrible, horrible diarrhea, your leg's hurt,

847
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,840
 you can't sleep, you're super sweaty.

848
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,400
 They're going through withdrawal, but I never saw myself as being mentally addicted to pain

849
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
 pills.

850
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,960
 I was physically dependent on them.

851
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,920
 But with the nicotine, I had a harder time giving up nicotine than I did weed or alcohol.

852
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,880
 And I think one of my big vices is because I'm over, I'm actually, I'm now as slim as

853
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,520
 I was when I was in college.

854
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,360
 I'm actually now back at 275.

855
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,280
 That's how much I weighed in college.

856
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,280
 But food.

857
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,440
 I didn't throw food in there, Stuart and me, but like that's a big thing that people get

858
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,440
 addicted to, but don't think about it.

859
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,440
 Now, I recently did an episode about hypnosis therapy and the key takeaway to that was if

860
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,400
 you don't know how to treat it in real life, don't try to treat it with hypnosis.

861
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,280
 So I take this into account, I'm not a substance abuse therapist, right?

862
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,160
 I'm not a skilled technician in this.

863
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,040
 But I think if you're struggling with, as I go on to give you advice, I think if you're

864
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,960
 struggling with substance abuse, I think you need to think.

865
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
 And I think this is important.

866
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,600
 Alcohol is a bit different because alcohol, you can become physically dependent on, you

867
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,000
 get the shakes, people can die from alcohol withdrawal.

868
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,360
 But marijuana, right?

869
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,240
 Pain pills, you go through three or four days, you're off the pain pills.

870
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,280
 Like, you're addicted to pain pills, you go three or four days, the withdrawals are over,

871
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,320
 you're done.

872
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,860
 You're done with that.

873
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,960
 After that, you have a mental addiction to them.

874
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
 Weed?

875
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,640
 There's no physical addiction.

876
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,640
 Crank?

877
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,780
 There's no physical addiction with crank.

878
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,860
 It's a mental addiction.

879
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,280
 Your board is what it is.

880
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,360
 Your board.

881
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:40,420
 So if you know, if you can, if you're having issues with pain pills and you go those three

882
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,160
 or four days, you talk to, they're out of your system, congratulations.

883
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,020
 You are no longer physically addicted to that drug.

884
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,140
 But it's the mental addiction you have to them.

885
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,780
 It's the boredom.

886
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,620
 That's what gets crank addicts.

887
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,180
 That's what really wipes them out, is the boredom.

888
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:05,980
 Because you spend so much time scoring the drug, using the drug, talking about the drug,

889
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,260
 having friends who do the drug, scoring the drug, using the drug.

890
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,220
 This becomes the cycle of your life.

891
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,600
 So when all of a sudden you have a ton of free time and you're sitting there in your

892
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,320
 house, you're bored out of your mind.

893
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:27,600
 You are literally no longer addicted to that drug once all the withdrawals are over with.

894
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,080
 But you're addicted to the feeling of it.

895
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,560
 I'm still addicted to the can of chew in my pocket.

896
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,560
 You know what I mean?

897
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,240
 The shape that it made in my pocket, the sound of the can opening.

898
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:45,780
 I'm addicted to walking to the gas station just to buy a can.

899
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,380
 But the physical addiction to nicotine is long gone.

900
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,380
 I haven't used nicotine and I don't even know how long it's been.

901
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,900
 The physical addiction is gone.

902
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,900
 If I start using again, it's because I'm bored or because I want the memories of how good

903
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,140
 I felt on it.

904
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:06,940
 If you're using drugs responsibly, if you're smoking marijuana or having a beer after work,

905
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,320
 like you know what responsible use is.

906
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,100
 So you also gotta figure that out as well.

907
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,500
 But when you're doing it to cope with something, that's what you know.

908
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,500
 You know.

909
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,760
 That's why it's so important for someone to go, "I'm addicted to this thing."

910
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,680
 Other people can't really say it to you because you do know.

911
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,240
 You actually know it a while before you admit it to yourself and you're just fighting it.

912
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,240
 But think about this.

913
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,520
 Think about this.

914
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:41,060
 Since January of 2021, I have given up nicotine, I've given up caffeine, I've given up sugar.

915
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:47,540
 I've lost 33 pounds since March.

916
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,500
 If I can do it, you can do it.

917
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,620
 That's 100% true.

918
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,180
 Maybe a longer process.

919
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,260
 Maybe more involved.

920
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,140
 You may need to seek counseling or join a group.

921
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,920
 But if I can do it, you can do it.

922
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,800
 Once you go past that physical thing and you realize you're not mentally addicted to the

923
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,280
 drug, you're mentally addicted to everything that came along with it.

924
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,040
 You're bored.

925
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,640
 You're bored at that point.

926
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:22,360
 Again, that doesn't account for some drugs do have, like alcoholism, is lifelong.

927
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,760
 That is a different topic.

928
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,080
 But when it comes to stuff like pain pills, when it comes to stuff like marijuana use

929
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:34,660
 or nicotine or caffeine, the other day, when I say I don't have any caffeine or any sugar,

930
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,820
 I'll have a pack of M&Ms every once in a while.

931
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,700
 I used to eat them all the time.

932
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,780
 And I used to have caffeine every single day.

933
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,340
 I always had 10 caffeinated beverages a day.

934
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,460
 Yesterday, I drank a coffee like a Konamoka smoothie.

935
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:56,260
 I cleaned my entire bedroom because I had gone so long without any caffeine that one

936
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:02,400
 basically mocha, what are they, Frappuccino type thing, I cleaned my entire bedroom because

937
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,400
 that's how caffeine should work on the human body.

938
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,400
 It gives you pep.

939
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,200
 You shouldn't need it every single day.

940
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,920
 But again, it's funny.

941
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,320
 My friends drink.

942
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
 My friends drink alcohol.

943
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,560
 They drink caffeine.

944
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
 They smoke cigarettes.

945
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,560
 I don't judge.

946
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
 I don't care.

947
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,160
 As long as you can do it responsibly.

948
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,080
 But if you want to make the change, think about, am I doing it?

949
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:29,820
 Am I thinking about smoking weed right now because I have a physiological addiction to

950
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,380
 weed or because I'm bored?

951
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,020
 And it's because you're bored.

952
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,700
 Because you think about all the times where you just sat back and smoked weed and the

953
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,660
 world became dull or the world became more colorful or those cartoons on adult swim became

954
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,580
 10 times funnier.

955
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,580
 Those were the things.

956
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,220
 When I quit smoking weed, I remember for a while television was boring because I used

957
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,300
 to sit and watch television and smoke.

958
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,040
 I used to watch adult swim all night long and smoke and being like, dude, you can only

959
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,560
 get Futurama if you're stoned.

960
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,840
 So when I stopped smoking weed for a while, I was like, oh, television's not as good as

961
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,760
 I remember when I was stoned, but I just worked past that.

962
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,560
 But yeah, that's the key.

963
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,640
 That's the key, I think, is are you physically addicted once you get past that physical addiction?

964
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,840
 You got it, man.

965
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,160
 You guys got this stuff, dude.

966
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,360
 You're strong as all these other people who have quit this stuff.

967
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,760
 I know now it's going on a little bit longer, but you're as strong as all these other people

968
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,920
 who have ever quit this stuff.

969
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,220
 You're stronger than that.

970
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,340
 So if you want to, you can do it too.

971
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,660
 So you guys will be fine.

972
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,980
 So guys, that is it.

973
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,300
 That will wrap up our third anniversary special.

974
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,300
 I hope you guys liked this.

975
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,820
 It's actually so funny because going back to what Charlotte and Nicolai were saying, I

976
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,820
 actually have a bunch of more stuff I can talk about, but I've kind of run out of time.

977
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,020
 I don't want to take up too much time.

978
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,660
 But guys, I'm so glad you guys loved the show.

979
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,900
 Thank you for everyone who submitted their questions.

980
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,740
 Let me give a shout out to Fernando Loyola.

981
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,740
 Bob Ross.

982
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,740
 Blitz Neo.

983
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,740
 Cecil.

984
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,740
 Quesol Cotto.

985
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,740
 God Rilla.

986
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,800
 I actually got two more questions coming in here.

987
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,860
 One from Anaia on YouTube and one from Alexandra on Facebook.

988
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:03,860
 Alexandra Watts.

989
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,640
 Thank you for all the questions that were submitted that I didn't get to.

990
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,360
 And I got a bunch of other stuff I could do behind the scenes stuff, but you know, I'm

991
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,360
 super sweaty.

992
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,360
