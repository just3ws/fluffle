1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 You've all heard of the Loch Ness Monster, but that's a weakling compared to what comes

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,460
 out of North Korea.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:17,240
 And then we take a look at a bizarre tale of ghost activity from old timey England.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,840
 Was a man really pursued all over town by the demon of Sprayton today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:35,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,080
 I hope you guys are having a lot of fun.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,120
 Let's go ahead and get started with our episode.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
 First off we're going to give a shout out to one of our legacy patrons, someone who's

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,160
 been supporting the show for a long time.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,160
 I gotta say thank you to steroids and crack cocaine.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,720
 Steroids and crack cocaine.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,440
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,480
 You have kept me up all night, kept me working hard.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,840
 You made me sell my car for steroids and crack cocaine.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,920
 I wonder, can you get addicted to steroids?

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,560
 Hey Jamie, look that up.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
 Pull that up on the view screen.

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 I want to see if we can get addicted to steroids.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,120
 Is that possible?

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,160
 You might be able to get addicted to the benefits of steroids, but I'm not, you notice I'm not

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,800
 asking that question about crack cocaine.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,760
 Oh you know what, speaking of that, so long time listeners of the show, i.e. if you've

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,000
 been listening for just past two weeks, have learned that I've become addicted to the subreddit

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 about drugs.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,400
 There's a subreddit for opioids and there's subreddits for heroin.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,880
 I found a subreddit for PCP.

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,080
 It doesn't get updated that often, because I think everyone's on PCP.

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,600
 Let's go ahead and actually go get started with the episode.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,520
 Steroids, I was trying to think, why did I go off on that tangent?

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
 I forgot.

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,960
 Our Patreon guy, steroids and crack cocaine.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,640
 Let's fire up that carbonicopter.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,680
 We are headed out to North Korea.

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,880
 Now we're in stealth mode, obviously.

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
 The Hermit Kingdom does not like visitors, especially ones from the United States, who

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,520
 aren't named Dennis Rodman.

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
 We're flying out there now.

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,880
 Tip of the hat to Stealthy Steve.

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,880
 Stealthy Steve is the one who brought up the whole idea about North Korean cryptids and

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
 got me walking down this path as it is.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,560
 So again, thank you so much for helping out with North Korea Week, which is what this

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
 is.

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
 We're headed out.

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,840
 Bring that helicopter low steroids.

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,240
 We're flying over a giant lake.

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,800
 It actually sits on the border of China and North Korea.

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,120
 And it's a crater lake.

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
 So it used to be like a big old volcano or something, a regular old mountain that got

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,000
 hollowed out, a bunch of beavers came in, and then crashed in.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,960
 Or is a crater lake when an asteroid hits the earth and makes a big crater?

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,080
 I'm pretty sure it's when a volcano collapses.

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,880
 Actually, I'm 100% sure in this case because there's something else that involves a volcano,

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,520
 but crater lakes in general, I think, can be either one, right?

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,160
 But anyways, it has nothing to do with it.

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,240
 Bring that helicopter down.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,040
 We are flying down to Heaven Lake.

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,520
 That's what it's called.

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 Very, very sweet.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,280
 Now, there's an old-timey legend.

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
 It's not that old.

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 It's just a couple decades.

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,920
 But Kim Jong-il, previous ruler of North Korea, Kim Jong-un's father, legend has it.

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,880
 Imagine having a legend that's just like 40 years old.

66
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,100
 But I guess, you know, that's what they do.

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,400
 Legend has it that Kim Jong-il was born at Heaven Lake.

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,680
 And it's interesting because they want to keep tying the current North Korean regime

69
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,520
 into old legends of the three kingdoms.

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,520
 So they can say that North Korea is the best Korea, that this is Korea.

71
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,920
 South Korea is some sort of bastardization they need to be reunified because we keep

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,120
 finding all this proof.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,960
 These old kings are related to the North Korean rulers.

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,520
 So it's no surprise that Kim Jong-il's birthplace is supposedly a place called Heaven's Lake.

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,860
 And when he died, the lake was frozen over.

76
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,840
 Not like he died and the ice went shh, froze.

77
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
 Because that would just be creepy.

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
 No, no, no.

79
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
 It was already frozen.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
 He died.

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,800
 And then the ice cracked, quote, "So loud it seemed to shake the heavens and the earth."

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,680
 The globe itself mourned for the death of Kim Jong-il, producer of the Godzilla movie,

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
 Pulgasari.

84
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
 That was yesterday's episode.

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,040
 We talked about the monster movie that the director was kidnapped to make.

86
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,940
 And it was a Godzilla movie, Godzilla knock-up.

87
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,260
 It was a good movie.

88
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,820
 Forgot to add this detail.

89
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,060
 The special effects are really good.

90
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,300
 The movie came out in 1985.

91
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,180
 The special effects are really good.

92
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,500
 They're so good because Toho Studios actually worked on it.

93
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,060
 See what happened was some people at Toho were given a job offer to make a movie in

94
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
 China.

95
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,460
 They said sure, and they hopped on a plane.

96
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,140
 The plane landed in North Korea.

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,660
 And they're like, oh no.

98
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,540
 They meet a director who, at this point, a lot of people assumed was kidnapped.

99
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,180
 Some people believe he went over there normally.

100
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,720
 But Toho's studio employees are like, well, what are we going to do?

101
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
 We're here.

102
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
 So they made these special effects.

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
 It's a really good rubber suit.

104
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,360
 Actually, there's a shot of the ending of Pulgasari and he looks terrified.

105
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,720
 And that's the first time I've ever seen a muppet look that scared.

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,400
 Very, very good work on Toho's studio's part.

107
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,320
 They were allowed to leave after the movie was done.

108
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
 The director and his wife had to escape.

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
 But if you guys are interested in that, you didn't hear yesterday's episode, check that

110
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
 out.

111
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
 If you didn't know, that's fine.

112
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
 We're not going to talk about it anymore.

113
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
 The lake.

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
 The lake.

115
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
 We are at Heaven's Lake.

116
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,540
 Now, Loch Ness Monster, monster in the lake.

117
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,860
 Then there's like Bessie and Ghostie and Mucci and all this stuff.

118
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,660
 There's always some stupid named monster in some stupid lake.

119
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,340
 I don't like lake monsters.

120
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,340
 They're lame.

121
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,460
 Oh, no, I saw a log.

122
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,980
 You want to know what the Loch Ness Monster was when I tell you this.

123
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,180
 It's totally going to ruin that famous photo.

124
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,260
 It's an elephant taking a bath.

125
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,300
 That famous photo from a long time ago, like the 20s or whatever, there's the lump and

126
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
 then there's the neck.

127
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,960
 It's an elephant taking a bath.

128
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
 100%.

129
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
 That's what it is.

130
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
 There was a circus in town at time.

131
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,640
 It's an elephant taking a bath.

132
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,040
 But anyways, Loch Ness Monster, I used to believe it was real.

133
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
 I don't believe it's real.

134
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,320
 That photo is not a monster.

135
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,480
 It's an elephant taking a bath.

136
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,240
 So I'm not a huge fan of it.

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,640
 But this lake, Heaven Lake, we're not talking about one lame neck monster that actually

138
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,040
 looks like an elephant trunk.

139
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
 No, dude.

140
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
 North Korea brings it for real.

141
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,300
 In the 7th, there's footage.

142
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,340
 Blurry footage, the only kind of footage of cryptids, but a Chinese cameraman takes

143
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,140
 footage of six separate monsters swimming around.

144
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,820
 For 20 minutes, he was videotaping this thing.

145
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,900
 Six monsters swimming around in the lake.

146
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
 Six.

147
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
 Pfft.

148
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
 Loch Ness.

149
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,060
 They're one sighting.

150
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
 I should say this.

151
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,100
 So there's six of those in all, in total, in this lake.

152
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,960
 Three different sea monsters, not 20 different sightings.

153
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,760
 20 different sea monsters have been seen in this lake.

154
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,560
 One of them had a four foot long neck.

155
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,320
 Which isn't that impressive, really.

156
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,440
 I mean, the neck's not even as big as I am.

157
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,280
 But anyways, that's not impressive.

158
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,760
 What is impressive, I guess a four foot long neck is impressive on something that's not

159
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,880
 a giraffe, but its head looked like a human's head.

160
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,000
 That's creepy, right?

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,040
 Just like you're watching this giant creature from the past giant four inch long neck and

162
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,440
 then your neighbor Barry's head on it.

163
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 That's spooky.

164
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
 In 1962, a bunch of people were hanging out at heaven lake.

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,880
 Hundred people, to be precise, apparently.

166
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,180
 Maybe there were 200 people and only 100 people saw this, but 100 people saw this.

167
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,540
 Two sea monsters.

168
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
 Floating around.

169
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,660
 And a dude's like, "Wait a second."

170
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,260
 He pulls out his telescope.

171
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,880
 They're chasing each other.

172
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
 What?

173
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
 That's spooky, right?

174
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,200
 Again, see, that's the thing like, I know you guys might sound like I'm being super

175
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,880
 sarcastic.

176
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,760
 Sea monsters just float.

177
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
 Sea monsters are fine.

178
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,080
 Like giant squids, monsters in the ocean, I'm fine with that, because those are probably

179
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
 real.

180
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,600
 But you go to the Loch Ness and you see a monster pop up.

181
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,120
 Their chiring economy is based around tricking people into thinking that there's a creature

182
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
 there.

183
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
 So of course they're going to believe it.

184
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,600
 Just like if there was a town that can make money off the Blair Witch, they're going to

185
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,060
 tell you the Blair Witch is real.

186
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,140
 But anyways, big old monster, even if there was a monster in Loch Ness.

187
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
 So?

188
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,900
 Like, it doesn't do anything.

189
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,060
 It just floats there.

190
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
 It just floats around.

191
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,660
 You're like, "Jesus, it's a dinosaur."

192
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,180
 It would prove so much stuff about science and evolution.

193
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
 So would a book.

195
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,460
 Like, you know what I mean?

196
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,220
 Like, yeah, there's a big old sea monster floating around in a lake.

197
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,420
 That's not impressive to me.

198
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
 Is it eating?

199
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
 This is my first question.

200
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
 Is it violent?

201
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
 Is it eating people?

202
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,040
 First off, first question, is it real?

203
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,540
 And if it's real, what does it do?

204
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
 And they're like, "Well, it only eats Comquat."

205
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,240
 Well, then it's stupid.

206
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
 That's a stupid...

207
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,900
 That might be an interesting thing for you, nerd.

208
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,460
 But as far as like a sea monster goes, that's like...

209
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,640
 It's not even a monster!

210
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,340
 Monster implies violence and/or terror.

211
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,340
 Right?

212
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,420
 Now, rhinos, I would consider a monster.

213
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,480
 I mean, they're technically a real-life animal, but I'm not going to go anywhere near rhinos

214
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,820
 and stuff like that.

215
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:05,700
 But I would much rather, if someone said, "Do you want to go and see two rhinos fighting?"

216
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
 Like, you physically be there, but they're in a cage.

217
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,340
 It's like a UFC cage match.

218
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:16,320
 Would you rather see two rhinos fighting or a lame waterlogged dinosaur?

219
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,060
 You see the tip of his eyeball.

220
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,860
 What would you choose?

221
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
 What would you choose?

222
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,860
 Right?

223
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
 You'd choose the two rhinos.

224
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
 Unless you were lame.

225
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,980
 So anyways, these guys are chasing each other.

226
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,220
 See, Heaven Lake, it would be cool to go there.

227
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,580
 I mean, if I wasn't going to become a political prisoner or be forced to make movies.

228
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,900
 But I wouldn't mind going to Heaven Lake because your chances are higher.

229
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
 There's 20 different monsters.

230
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,340
 They're fighting each other.

231
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,660
 And this is something Loc Ness never did.

232
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,500
 This is something Nessie never did.

233
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,140
 In 1903, it was the first sighting.

234
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,460
 The creature, one of them, because again, there's 20 different ones, this buffalo.

235
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,460
 Buffalo.

236
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
 Okay?

237
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,620
 They already look freakish.

238
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,860
 It runs out.

239
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,980
 There's three people hanging out on the beach.

240
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,580
 Just enjoying their time in 1903.

241
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,340
 They're like, "Oh, this is so nice.

242
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,540
 There's nothing else to do but just sit here because there's no television, no internet,

243
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
 nothing."

244
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:17,060
 And then a buffalo-shaped creature jumps out of the lake onto land, roars, which is interesting

245
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,180
 and a little suspicious because there would be no reason for a sea creature to roar.

246
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,620
 But anyways, it roars whatever.

247
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,140
 I guess I can accept the idea that there's monsters in this lake but not that they could

248
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
 roar.

249
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,540
 It jumps out and roars.

250
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,180
 It begins charging these people.

251
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,420
 Now again, it's 1903.

252
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,620
 There may not be anything to do, but everyone's got a gun.

253
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,180
 It's a good old days.

254
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,940
 And a dude straight up, "Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop," puts six bullets in this creature's

255
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,700
 belly and then just turns and swims back into the water.

256
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,900
 That is a monster story.

257
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,100
 I don't want to hear about Loc Ness.

258
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,420
 You want to know what the very first--this has become.

259
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,260
 I'm glad that I'm anti-Scotland pro-North Korea on this story.

260
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,500
 You want to hear the very first sighting of Nessie?

261
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,700
 This will change a lot of people's minds if the elephant thing didn't change your mind.

262
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,600
 The very first sighting of Nessie, the very first documented sighting.

263
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,220
 A Christian missionary had gone to Scotland to preach to the natives up there and they're

264
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,180
 rowing across the lake and the Loch Ness monster appeared.

265
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,740
 You're like, "Well, Jason, that's legit.

266
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,700
 It doesn't matter if they're native Scottish people or Christian missionaries."

267
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,380
 And then he, in the name of Christ, compels the creature to leave them alone and the creature

268
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,900
 fearing the word of God swims away.

269
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,500
 That's not true, right?

270
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,460
 And if it was true, then that's a demonic entity.

271
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,500
 It's definitely not a dinosaur.

272
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,380
 There was never a time where you'd be--I never saw that part in Jurassic Park where the T-Rex

273
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,580
 is coming towards the car and they all start making the sign of the cross and he goes,

274
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
 "Hah!"

275
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:02,620
 So either Loch Ness monster is a demonic entity, and that story's true, or it's a dinosaur

276
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,420
 and it devoured everyone on that boat or just swam away and it was perfect timing.

277
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
 Look it up.

278
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
 I'll have it in the show notes.

279
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,500
 That's the very first sighting of Loch Ness monster.

280
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,580
 People may go, "Oh, the natives."

281
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,980
 That was the first recorded sighting of Loch Ness monster.

282
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,460
 They prayed it went away.

283
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,340
 It's either a demon or it's totally made up.

284
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,460
 But you know what's not made up.

285
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,700
 You know what?

286
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,900
 You know what I believe in is these reports from North Korea that it has more monsters

287
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,100
 per capita than any other lake ever.

288
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:40,100
 Again, how do you believe in that story if that's the first sighting of the creature?

289
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,500
 So anyways, let's go ahead and move on.

290
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,260
 That was a weird segment.

291
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,780
 It was oddly hostile too.

292
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,780
 Let's go ahead.

293
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,380
 I do not like lake monsters, but Heaven's Lake is pretty dope.

294
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,220
 Let's leave it.

295
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,860
 There's just utter silence in the carbonicopter.

296
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,020
 Even the blades don't want to make a sound as we're taking off.

297
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,900
 Steroids and crack cocaine is kind of looking over the shoulder.

298
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,580
 This is not muttering in the corner.

299
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,620
 "Oh, Loch Ness, I hate you so much.

300
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,660
 I'm going to wrap my hands around your giant demonic neck and strangle you."

301
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,620
 Steroids is like, "Uh, you okay back there, Jason?"

302
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,100
 I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

303
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,460
 Just don't fly over any lakes.

304
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,620
 You might end up in one."

305
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,780
 He's like, "Uh, we're flying."

306
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,740
 Now I'm just sitting in the darkened corner.

307
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,660
 We're flying off in the carbonicopter.

308
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,020
 We're staying away from lakes.

309
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,260
 We're headed to-- for all I know, Spritan is full of lakes, but we're headed to a little

310
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,780
 village in England known as Spritan.

311
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
 Spritan.

312
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,940
 And this story is called the Demon of Spritan.

313
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,740
 But I better pick a pronunciation and stick with it.

314
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
 The Demon of Spritan.

315
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,780
 It's November 1682, so let's land that carbonicopter.

316
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,700
 Let's put on our old, timey clothes.

317
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,660
 We've got some powdered wigs to walk around in.

318
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,180
 Got canes, little jackets with coat tails.

319
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,860
 But anyways, they were going to meet a man.

320
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,180
 His name's Francis Fay, 20 years old.

321
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,180
 And he works for Philip first, which is a great name.

322
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,740
 He's a landowner.

323
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,900
 So we got Francis and Philip hanging out, doing old timey stuff.

324
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,500
 Now Francis is walking around the property, and then one day he sees Philip's dad, Papa

325
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 Furs.

326
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
 What we'll call him?

327
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,220
 Papa Furs walking around the property.

328
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,060
 Now Francis kind of stops in his tracks.

329
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
 What?

330
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,860
 Because he knows that Papa Furs has been dead for a couple years now.

331
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
 But that's him.

332
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,300
 That's Papa.

333
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,860
 Dressed the same, carrying the mole stick.

334
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,940
 He had this giant stick that he used to smash the heads open of moles.

335
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,580
 Now the one's on your back, but you know, the one's that digs through your yard.

336
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,180
 And he turns around and he sees Francis, and he goes, "Ah boy.

337
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,260
 So glad to see you here.

338
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
 Yes.

339
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,300
 But I'm going to stop doing this voice because it gets annoying.

340
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,980
 I have a mission for you, Francis.

341
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,780
 You see, I have some unfinished business.

342
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,020
 There's two dudes in town that I each owe ten shillings to.

343
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,700
 And then my sister I owe 20 shillings to.

344
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,980
 I need you to repay them.

345
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,940
 Which, to be fair, is the perfect way to settle your debts, right?

346
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
 Die.

347
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,580
 Because a ghost and make someone else pay them off.

348
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,900
 But Papa goes, "Francis, listen.

349
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,380
 You got to do this otherwise I'm going to haunt you.

350
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,340
 You got to pay this money, otherwise I'm going to be super spooky.

351
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,780
 I got this giant stick.

352
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,300
 Now I may look like a ghost.

353
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,500
 I may look kind of see-through.

354
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,660
 But trust me, this stick can do some damage."

355
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,300
 Francis goes, "Well, you're going to give me the money?"

356
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
 "No!

357
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
 No, I'm not going to give you money.

358
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
 It's ghost money.

359
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
 I gave it to you.

360
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
 It just disappeared.

361
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
 Turned an ectoplasm in your pocket.

362
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,860
 You got to pay him back and then I won't haunt you anymore."

363
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,900
 Now Francis is probably thinking a couple things.

364
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,980
 One, I don't have 40 shillings right now or for a while.

365
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,940
 Two, I didn't ask for this.

366
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,980
 I was just walking through the house, right?

367
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,180
 I just happened to know this guy and I turned the corner and he's sitting there with a giant

368
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
 stick dead.

369
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,540
 Now he's speaking to me, "Pay 40 shillings to people."

370
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,700
 And then Papa first goes, "Oh, and just a word of warning.

371
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,260
 Like I might be a spooky ghost because I got this giant stick and I just threatened you.

372
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,740
 But my ex-wife is way spookier."

373
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,860
 Now Francis goes, "That doesn't make sense.

374
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,860
 He knew Papa first when he was alive and he knew his wife and he goes, "What?

375
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,140
 Your wife's super nice, dude.

376
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,500
 She might have been nice, but she's not nice now.

377
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 She's horrible."

378
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,980
 Yeah, whatever.

379
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,460
 So Francis goes, "That's probably just, you know, divorce isn't even good in the afterlife.

380
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,460
 He's probably just bitter.

381
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,980
 But I'll stay away from her grave.

382
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,780
 Like what's he going to do, right?

383
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,340
 Try not to attract the attention of a crazy..."

384
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,460
 Actually, and he was like, "Nah, she was a pleasant woman.

385
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,860
 I think he's just kind of running his mouth."

386
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,820
 But he is able to get the shillings.

387
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,740
 He goes to the first guy in town and goes, "Hey, Papa first wants you to have these 10

388
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
 shillings."

389
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
 Dude's like, "Oh, that's sweet."

390
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,140
 Goes to the second guy, "Papa first wants you to have these 10 shillings."

391
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
 "Ah, that's awesome."

392
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,620
 He goes to Papa's sister and says, "Papa first's ghost visited me and wants you to know that

393
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,180
 he feels bad that he didn't pay you back.

394
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,180
 Here's 20 shillings."

395
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,540
 Now the sister goes, "I'm not taking that money.

396
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,940
 That's something that the devil would do.

397
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,380
 I'm not taking that money at all."

398
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,740
 Francis is like, "Dude, I'm going to be haunted for eternity if you don't take these stupid

399
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
 20 coins."

400
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
 And now I'm not doing it.

401
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
 It's just a dorn.

402
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,700
 He goes back to Papa first and says, "Hey, man, she's not taking this money.

403
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,460
 Can I keep it?"

404
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,100
 And Papa's like, "No, you can't keep it.

405
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
 Use it.

406
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,660
 Buy her a ring.

407
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,860
 And then if she accepts that, I won't hunt you anymore."

408
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,260
 And he's like, "Ah, that's probably a good idea."

409
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
 So he goes.

410
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,900
 He buys her a ring worth 20 shillings.

411
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,580
 He goes back to her, gives her the ring.

412
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,180
 She accepts it.

413
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,620
 Moral of the story, women love jewelry.

414
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,020
 So he does accept it.

415
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,620
 So his mission is done.

416
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,700
 He is now totally fine with Papa first.

417
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,220
 He's no longer going to be haunted.

418
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,660
 He's leaving the sister's house.

419
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,460
 He's riding back to Sprighton.

420
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,300
 And as he gets into town, multiple witnesses saw this, as he gets into town, the ghost

421
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:02,260
 of Papa first jumps onto the back of the horse, scaring both Francis and the horse.

422
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:09,100
 Papa first then wraps his arms around Francis, jumps off of the horse, still holding Francis.

423
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,100
 They fly into the air, crashing onto the ground.

424
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:19,020
 Off a moving horse, I must remind you, which is incredibly dangerous.

425
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,820
 Incredibly dangerous.

426
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,620
 Now people in town are like, "What in the world?"

427
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,940
 They just see him basically go from riding a horse to watching a spectral figure of

428
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,900
 the damned jump on the horse, grab him, and they both go flying off.

429
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,180
 He crashes into the ground.

430
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,660
 Then the ghost jumps back on the horse.

431
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,100
 The horse takes a jump, jumps 20 feet.

432
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
 Not straight up.

433
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
 Don't get ridiculous.

434
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,460
 20 feet horizontally.

435
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,860
 That is not the demon of Sprighton.

436
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,900
 Papa first is not the demon referred to in this story.

437
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,620
 After Francis is like, "What in the world just happened?"

438
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,740
 I did what he said.

439
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,100
 I paid everyone off.

440
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,340
 He said he wasn't going to haunt me anymore.

441
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,580
 He almost murders me.

442
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,700
 Almost murders my horse.

443
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
 What's going on?

444
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,660
 But Papa first is never seen again.

445
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,220
 Now all of this is cataloged in old town records.

446
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,540
 There was a letter written back when this was a contemporary event in the village of

447
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
 Sprighton.

448
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,100
 I know it's pronounced differently each time.

449
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
 I'm sorry.

450
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,820
 But this was contemporary records.

451
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,700
 This was written back then about these crazy events that was going on.

452
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,940
 But that's not even the beginning.

453
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,380
 That's not what they're referring to when they talk about the demon of Sprighton.

454
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,540
 That's his ex-wife.

455
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,220
 Because after this is all done, she shows up.

456
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,300
 He's a shapeshifter.

457
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,980
 So most of the time she'll just appear as a woman.

458
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,940
 But she would sometimes appear as a dog that would breathe fire.

459
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
 This is a weird thing.

460
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:02,780
 It kind of shows the weird physics difference between our reality and ghosts.

461
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,020
 This story's weird in that aspect.

462
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,140
 Francis and a bunch of other people are hanging out in the house and the ghost of the ex-wife

463
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,620
 shows up and shapeshifts into a horse.

464
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,100
 Which is not something that Francis wants to see anytime soon.

465
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,300
 So now there's a horse in the house.

466
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,180
 The horse then jumps out of a window.

467
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,900
 Now obviously the window, it's interesting because it's big enough for a horse to jump

468
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,980
 through but it's made up of individual window panes.

469
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:45,860
 So when the horse jumps through the window, only a single pane breaks.

470
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,420
 Interesting then it just ran away.

471
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,260
 She was known to tear off Francis' clothes.

472
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,700
 He'd just be walking doing his job.

473
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
 "Oh it's so fun being a servant.

474
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,820
 So I don't have to go into the horse table."

475
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
 "Ah!

476
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
 Ah!

477
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
 My clothes!"

478
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
 "It would rip his wig off his head."

479
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
 "Ah!

480
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,820
 Give me that!

481
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
 Give me that!

482
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,820
 I need that!"

483
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,820
 "I'm going to be a judge in a couple hours now!"

484
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,420
 It would also rip off other people's clothes but all of the torment seemed to be focused

485
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,380
 on Francis.

486
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,500
 To this point, so other people would come to the house and get their wigs start flying

487
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 around.

488
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,900
 Maybe their sleeve would get ripped.

489
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,660
 Francis one day was walking through the house.

490
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,620
 The woman, the demon, grabbed his head.

491
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,180
 Tell me if this isn't a nightmare.

492
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,580
 This is something that I hope never happens to me or really anyone ever.

493
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,260
 Graps him by the head, pulls him to the ground, is dragging him across the floor.

494
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,860
 So he's kicking and screaming.

495
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,620
 His hands are trying to grab at a force that isn't really even there.

496
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
 He just feels pressure on his head.

497
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,700
 He's slowly being dragged across the floor as he's screaming for help.

498
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,540
 And he's kind of able to look a little bit.

499
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,900
 He's being dragged towards the bed.

500
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,060
 Now there's a gap.

501
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:58,220
 It's not a very wide gap between where the bed is and the wall.

502
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,500
 And that's exactly where his head is going.

503
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,940
 And he feels these hands, these cold icy hands, powerful strength pulling him towards that

504
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:15,340
 gap and then begins to squeeze his head in between the wall and the bed.

505
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,900
 This isn't your futon.

506
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,620
 This is an old timey bed where the lightest materials were iron and oak.

507
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
 The bed was not budging.

508
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,420
 And neither was the wall.

509
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,740
 His head is getting wedged into this gap.

510
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,660
 And he's screaming for help.

511
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,740
 Eventually, I'm sure other people in the house, they're like, "Oh, what's, is this

512
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
 wig?"

513
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,660
 Is he screaming about his stupid wig getting pulled off again?

514
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,660
 They give him a couple minutes.

515
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,020
 They're like, "Hey, he's still screaming.

516
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,020
 Maybe his clothes got ripped off."

517
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
 I don't know.

518
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
 He's been screaming a long time.

519
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
 They run upstairs.

520
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,620
 They see his head stuck.

521
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,140
 It takes several of them to get his head unstuck.

522
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,060
 Again, they're not moving the bed.

523
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,300
 The bed probably weighs more than all of them put together.

524
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,140
 This is a very nice estate.

525
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,300
 This guy has a bunch of servants.

526
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,900
 These are all servants working here.

527
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,780
 So again, it's not just like some three little bears' bed.

528
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,780
 We just...

529
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,780
 Not like their beds are garbage either.

530
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,260
 They were actually probably pretty well made.

531
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,180
 I wonder what the Papa Bear did for work.

532
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,700
 But anyway, obviously, you can afford a house.

533
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,100
 But anyways, that's another topic.

534
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,340
 I'll do some research on that, how much fairy tale characters are made.

535
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,900
 They finally get his head pulled out.

536
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:30,140
 Now, because of his fright and the multiple injuries to his head, they call for a doctor.

537
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,460
 Doctor gets there and he's all like, "Ugh, messed up."

538
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,460
 So the doctor does what doctors do best back then, bloodletting.

539
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,500
 So they go, "Okay, we're going to cut your head.

540
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,740
 We're going to relieve some pressure."

541
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,140
 Because the dude was jacked up.

542
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,300
 It wasn't like this guy.

543
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,980
 They're like, "Oh, what a hypochondriac.

544
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,220
 He just loves having his blood pulled out of his body."

545
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,700
 No, he got his head put in a wedge, basically.

546
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,740
 It's that scene from Casino, except instead of a vice, it was a bed from the 1600s and

547
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,940
 a giant wall.

548
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,980
 They give him some bloodletting and you know, you cut, you let some blood out, you cut,

549
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,700
 you let some blood out, stuff like that.

550
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,260
 Now, they're cutting his arm, which is weird.

551
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,020
 You think you would have relieved the pressure where it's coming from, but they cut his arm.

552
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,500
 I'm not a bloodletting specialist.

553
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 And it didn't work.

554
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,620
 So I guess it doesn't matter where you do it.

555
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,100
 But anyways, they were cutting his arm, letting blood out and stuff like that, like air out

556
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
 of a tire.

557
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,740
 And then they bandage his arm up and the doctor goes, "Well, I think you'll feel better now."

558
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,380
 The bandage is then unfurl from his arm.

559
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,580
 Wrap around his neck and start strangling him.

560
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,340
 As the doctor is still there, he just put the bandages on this dude.

561
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,460
 "Oh, better.

562
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,460
 Here's your bill."

563
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,820
 And then of course the servants and the doctor have to help him not get suffocated by possessed

564
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,620
 bloody bandages.

565
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,500
 Now talk about a quick de-escalation before this thing really gets bad, before it gets

566
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 worse.

567
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,180
 Before this thing really gets bad, his shoelaces come to life and start moving around the floor

568
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,580
 like an eel, which in that case, I'd be like, "Oh, thank God, that's all that's happening,

569
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
 right?"

570
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,660
 Like if all of a sudden your shoelaces popped off and they started doing the...

571
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,180
 Dance, you'd be shocked.

572
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,740
 I'd be shocked, it'd be terrifying.

573
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,020
 After having my head pulled into a tiny little compartment and then strangled with my own

574
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,060
 bandages, I'd be like, "Oh, that's so cute.

575
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
 That's so cute."

576
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,460
 Also a barrel of salt walked away that happened to just...

577
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,180
 Just wobbled and moved into another room.

578
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,300
 And that's convenient haunting because maybe they wanted the salt in that room, right?

579
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,140
 Maybe somebody put the salt in the wrong place.

580
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,260
 Maybe everyone argued who brought the salt and set it down there in the first place.

581
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,300
 So now it's in the other room, that's perfect.

582
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,260
 But of course, things don't end that way.

583
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,580
 Francis is walking outside one day.

584
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,620
 Now this ghost is quite powerful.

585
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,620
 This is almost like something you'd see in a loony tune, which cartoon?

586
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
 An invisible force.

587
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:03,060
 He's walking through the field and a hand grabs the back of his coat, lifts him off the

588
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,820
 ground, and he flies away.

589
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,660
 Now he's flying through the air like if someone grabbed you by your belt or by your waist

590
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,420
 and is just holding you up one handed.

591
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,380
 So his arms and his legs are dangling.

592
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,580
 He's screaming for help.

593
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,420
 Not a single servant hears him.

594
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,220
 Or maybe they did and they were just really, really tired of dealing with this stuff.

595
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,300
 But after about a half hour, they go, "Hey, wait a second.

596
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
 Where's Francis?"

597
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,700
 And the guy who heard it's like, "Uh, I have a feeling he may have been kidnapped

598
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
 by a ghost."

599
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,780
 They start looking for him.

600
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,860
 They find him at night, waist deep in a bog.

601
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
 And he's dazed.

602
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:46,860
 [Singing]

603
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,740
 Just singing a song in the dark forest, waist deep in a freezing cold swamp.

604
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
 Oh, great.

605
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
 Francis, dang it.

606
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
 I got dinner cooking.

607
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,660
 I got to come out here and get you.

608
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
 What's going to attack us?

609
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,940
 Is that who you're going to attack us?

610
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,380
 You got some bandages on we don't know about?

611
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,580
 They don't take him to, because he's definitely like, something's wrong with it.

612
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,060
 The lower half of his body is frozen.

613
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,660
 Not like a big block of ice like Encino Man, but it's just cold to the touch.

614
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,460
 You don't have to be Encino Man to have a medical emergency.

615
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,420
 That's a little tip from Jason Carpenter.

616
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,860
 They take him to a major town.

617
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,180
 They take him to the closest town.

618
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,540
 So they're going to be seen by a doctor right now.

619
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,100
 And the doctor puts him in a little hospital room and goes, "Oh, yep, I've seen this before.

620
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
 We got to take out blood.

621
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
 That's how we're going to do this.

622
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
 We're going to take out some blood.

623
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
 Slice."

624
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
 They're doing some bloodletting.

625
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,260
 Now the next day, some of his friends, the remaining friends that he has.

626
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,860
 Sure, a lot of friends have left him during this.

627
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,180
 Remaining friends that he has show up.

628
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
 He's sitting there.

629
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
 His legs are feeling better.

630
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,980
 He has bandages on his arm instead of around his neck, the way it's supposed to be.

631
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,940
 But he has a cut on his forehead.

632
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
 He has a gash.

633
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,980
 They go, "What?

634
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,260
 That wasn't there last night.

635
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,340
 Like, you were in a bog.

636
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
 You're waist deep.

637
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
 You're singing some crazy song.

638
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
 How'd you get that gash?"

639
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,220
 And Francis looks at him just dead-eyed.

640
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,060
 Francis is just so done with it at this point.

641
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,900
 He looks at him and goes, "Dude, I'm sitting here in the hospital room, right?

642
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,060
 I've got these bandages.

643
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,420
 I keep looking at my bandages every 20 seconds."

644
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
 Did it move?

645
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
 Did it move?

646
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,020
 And then a bird.

647
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:27,780
 A bird flew into my hospital room with a rock in its mouth and then threw it at me.

648
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
 Threw the rock at me.

649
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
 Not just dropped it.

650
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,740
 Straight up like cranked its neck back to get some momentum and threw it at me and threw

651
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
 it at me so hard.

652
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,540
 Put a gash in my forehead.

653
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,260
 And the friends are like, "That is ridiculous."

654
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,260
 And Francis is like, "You'll find the rock in here."

655
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260
 What's weird is the friends looked all over the hospital room.

656
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,780
 I don't know if that's the proper term back then.

657
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,620
 I think it was just a room that a doctor had been in.

658
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,020
 But anyways, they look all over the room.

659
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
 They find no rock.

660
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:58,500
 What they find is a piece of bronze.

661
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,940
 So this bird didn't come from the bird.

662
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,500
 It didn't, even if it was an accident.

663
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,580
 It's not like the bird was like, "Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp."

664
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,180
 Sees a rock, picks it up, it's flying, and then goes, "No, I don't want this," and throws

665
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
 it.

666
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,420
 It was a piece of bronze.

667
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,340
 It was a super heavy metal that a bird was flying around with and threw at this dude

668
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,860
 and cut his head.

669
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,060
 This letter, this article in the town records that talks about this whole thing, the letter

670
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:27,860
 ends like this, quote, "This is a faithful account of the contents of a letter from a

671
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:34,300
 person of quality in Devin, dated 2nd of May 1683.

672
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:42,460
 The young man will be 21 if he lives to August next."

673
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,820
 So even the person writing this record is like, "This dude is not going to be 21 years

674
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,820
 old, dude.

675
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,580
 This dude is toast.

676
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,580
 Something is going to kill this guy."

677
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,340
 And the thing is, we don't know how this story ended.

678
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,120
 We don't know if he made it to be 21.

679
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,500
 We don't know if the demon would continue to be sighted.

680
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,180
 It's definitely seemed to be focused on him.

681
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,740
 It wasn't like a town demon that these legends would still continue, but apparently this

682
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
 stuff happened.

683
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,100
 Now, again, there's obvious that this could, let's look at some rational explanations.

684
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,260
 This is an internet hoax.

685
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,760
 I've found this letter in a couple different places and things like that, but it's always

686
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
 possible that it's a hoax.

687
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,060
 We've got to address that.

688
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,820
 But it's also possible that it is a true account of a young man who just happened to be walking

689
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,620
 through the house one day, ended up owing a bunch of people money, and even after taking

690
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,100
 care of his obligations got attacked by not one, but two ghosts.

691
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,420
 One, a demonic entity that's pulling people into gas.

692
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:45,500
 Unless you've seen horror movies, or, again, crime movies, or read about in newspapers,

693
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,060
 having your head wedged into a space that's too tight.

694
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:55,380
 So the next time you are walking through your house, be careful what hallway you look down.

695
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:01,660
 You may see a former employer standing there, and you may also be requested to go through

696
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,660
 these events.

697
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,620
 However, if you thought what he went through was bad, imagine having to go to people's

698
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:14,020
 houses and owing them money during a worldwide quarantine, or even worse, being attacked

699
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:20,060
 by a ghost in your own house when everyone is isolated.

700
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:27,720
 If your head got wedged into an impossibly tight space, would anyone ever hear your cries?

701
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,540
 Or when the quarantine is lifted and things return to normal?

702
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,820
 Would people wonder what happened to you?

703
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:44,780
 Would someone eventually do a welfare check and find your body squeezed into a tiny spot?

704
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,820
 It would leave a lot of questions.

705
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,380
 Some would never be answered.

706
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:59,460
 But we would know that maybe you were also visited by a demonic ex-wife.

707
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,700
