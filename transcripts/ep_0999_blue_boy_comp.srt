1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
 "Would you attend a university that openly admits that some of their dorms are haunted

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,160
 by a dead child?"

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,840
 They put it in their brochure, they talk about it a lot, it's kind of weird.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,360
 And then we travel to Algeria to attend a wedding of a young couple.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,880
 When the soon to be bride is sobbing all day long, her father thinks that it's just wedding

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,940
 day jitters.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,840
 Little does he know that she's been possessed by a demon.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:45,080
 "Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,360
 I hope you guys are staying warm because I'm not.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,640
 I'm actually in the haunted closet recording this episode wearing thermals, a jacket and

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
 a little fuzzy hat.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 It's so cold and this episode will last exactly as long as I can stay warm.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,000
 But someone who's always warm, warm hearted at least.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, let's give it up for one of our Christmas

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,880
 livestream contributors.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,440
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for vexing.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
 Woohoo!

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
 Yeah!

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,160
 Walk on in, walk on into Dead Rabbit Command vexing.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,800
 Really, really appreciate all your support.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,040
 The Christmas livestream was awesome yesterday.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,040
 They had so much fun hanging out with you guys.

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,000
 Vexing you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,040
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand and really do.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,720
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
 That helps out so much.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,480
 Also had a ton of fun with yesterday's Christmas livestream.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
 That was really fun.

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,720
 I love hanging out with you guys and if you guys aren't aware, I did drop the full audio

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
 tracks for the intro and outro music.

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,240
 Atlantis attacks and Bella Royale.

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,520
 You guys have been asking for them for about four years and if you go to deadrabbitradio.lipson.com,

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
 you can actually download the tracks onto your hard drive.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
 They're up on YouTube.

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,080
 You can listen through your podcast app but you can download them if you go.

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
 They're totally free.

40
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,360
 You can go to deadrabbitradio.lipson.com to download them to your hard drive.

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,200
 A lot of fun.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
 We're coming up to episode 1000.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
 Don't know if I'm going to do anything special?

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
 Probably not.

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
 Probably not.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800
 Probably just being on the episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,200
 But to me that is special because I love this show.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,560
 Vexxing, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:39,640
 Fly us all the way out to good old California.

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,760
 California, the land of surf and sun and not 17 degrees weather and ice storms which

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,960
 is what's happening where I'm at.

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
 We're in California.

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,720
 Specifically we're headed down to San Rafael.

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,360
 We're going to visit the Dominican University of California.

56
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
 This is really interesting.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
 A lot of times I peruse the website theshadleands.net.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
 It's just a repository of ghost stories.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,240
 It's how I spend my Saturday mornings, honestly reading the news, then hopping over there,

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,760
 hopping over to thinkaboutadox.com, trying to find good material for you guys.

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,480
 And I came across this story very brief.

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,640
 Like most of the stuff on theshadleands.net it's generally just a couple sentences.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,720
 In San Rafael there's the Dominican University and at that school there is a ghost known

64
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,640
 as the blue boy who supposedly drowned in a bathtub.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:45,320
 It goes on to say some students say they have seen wet footprints near the site of the haunting.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,560
 It's a pretty generic description.

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,440
 It doesn't describe life after death.

68
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,760
 It doesn't describe a haunting vision of what awaits us all.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
 But other than that it's on the ghost website.

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,320
 You see a lot of that stuff.

71
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,680
 If you saw that appear on the New York Times you'd be like, "Wait, what?

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,840
 But as far as on the ghost website."

73
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,980
 Now here's this really caught my eye because I read tons of ghost stuff all the time.

74
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:17,080
 This caught my eye because I myself have seen a blue boy ghost.

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:23,120
 And it was hands down one of the most terrifying paranormal experiences I've ever had.

76
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
 I've talked about it before on the show so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail about

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 it.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,000
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,480
 Just for context, I've seen what I can only describe as demons and demonically possessed

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 people.

81
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,980
 I've seen shadowmen.

82
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,580
 I've seen these huge black two dimensional dogs walking down the street.

83
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,980
 These are all in previous episodes.

84
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
 I'll put those episodes in the show notes as well.

85
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,980
 You're like, "What?

86
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
 This is my first episode, dude.

87
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,980
 Are you like a huge meth head?"

88
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,540
 No, I'm not that.

89
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,420
 But I've seen things of that meth head see.

90
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,140
 I've seen all sorts of crazy things in my life.

91
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,540
 But the blue boy was the scariest of them all.

92
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,080
 I remember I was driving through Orangevale, California.

93
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,760
 That's where I used to live.

94
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,240
 I used to go ghost hunting all the time.

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,760
 Gas was 98 cents a gallon.

96
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,560
 Oh man, it was beautiful.

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
 Drive around.

98
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
 Me and my buddies, we'd drive around.

99
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,560
 We'd go to haunted places.

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
 But anyways, I was doing this one by myself.

101
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,240
 I was driving down this road in Orangevale.

102
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,800
 I don't remember the exact name of the road.

103
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,360
 I could find it on a map, but I'm not gonna.

104
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,000
 It's too cold and I don't want to spend time looking it up on Google Earth.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It's in the Orangevale area.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 It's pretty small.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,540
 It's a couple streets past Hazel.

108
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,900
 It's going down this residential neighborhood.

109
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,700
 And I was all by myself.

110
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,660
 It was probably like 2, 3 in the morning.

111
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,420
 And I see...

112
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,140
 All of a sudden it was in front of my car.

113
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,460
 Like I want to say it stepped in front of my car, but that wasn't the case.

114
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,660
 All of a sudden, something was in front of my car.

115
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
 It was about...

116
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,660
 I'm really bad with kids' ages, but I'd say the kid was maybe like between 7 and 9.

117
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,280
 I see a boy, a blue boy, standing in the middle of the road.

118
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
 And it was very interesting.

119
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,760
 I mean, that's interesting in and of itself, right?

120
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,160
 This is the problem when you get jaded when you're researching paranormal stuff all the

121
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 time.

122
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,840
 You're like, "Hmm, on a scale of 1 to 10, that's a 5.

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,640
 A phantom of a child standing in the road."

124
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,920
 It was more interesting than that.

125
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
 I saw him.

126
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,360
 He was dressed in clothes, right?

127
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
 He wasn't wearing caveman clothes.

128
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,180
 He wasn't necessarily wearing pioneer clothes.

129
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,260
 If I had to guess the time period of the clothes, I'd say somewhere between the 60s and the

130
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
 90s.

131
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,900
 He's wearing like a shirt and jeans and stuff like that.

132
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
 Pants, maybe.

133
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
 Slacks.

134
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
 Here's the thing.

135
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,540
 I wasn't too interested in what he was wearing.

136
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,380
 I'm driving down the road all of a sudden.

137
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,220
 I'm just trying to classify it in some way.

138
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
 I'm like, "What?

139
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,580
 Those shoes don't fit you, young man."

140
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,420
 I'm driving down the road and all of a sudden this boy is standing in front of my car and

141
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,240
 I hit it.

142
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,400
 I hit this boy.

143
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:09,600
 What happens is he basically passes through my car as you would imagine a ghost to do.

144
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,440
 I'm driving and this blue boy is now standing in the middle of this road.

145
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,720
 Let me finish describing him.

146
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
 I'm kind of getting off track.

147
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,120
 I guess I'm going to spend more time talking about this than I thought.

148
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,760
 It's hard to tell a short version of the story when you ran over a ghost because it's more

149
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
 than that.

150
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,700
 I'm driving down the road and this boy, his skin is blue, his clothes are blue.

151
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,700
 But there's also this blue glow attached to him.

152
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,300
 It's almost like there are shades of blue that make up his clothes and his face and

153
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,780
 his hair.

154
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,020
 His blue-ish.

155
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,020
 You could tell that at one point when he was alive, it was probably black hair or dark

156
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
 brown hair.

157
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
 Now, how's the blue?

158
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
 It's tint.

159
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,000
 It's like someone took an X-Acto knife and cut out reality around him.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,440
 There's this blue, a lighter blue kind of outline around him.

161
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
 This glow.

162
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
 It's super interesting.

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,400
 You could see it would be like someone just etched it out and what you're seeing behind

164
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,000
 him is a bright blue shining through.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 He's glowing blue.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 He's blue.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,500
 I hit him with my car and I remember I'm driving and it just happened so quickly.

168
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,720
 Let me stand my fingers better than that.

169
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,780
 Happened like that.

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:35,760
 I drive through him and I look in my rear view mirror and now he's sitting in my backseat.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
 I freaked out.

172
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 I kept driving.

173
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,280
 It happens so instantly, but I remember it kind of taking my breath away a bit.

174
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
 I see him in my backseat.

175
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
 Then he disappeared.

176
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,120
 It wasn't like I didn't then drive to my grandma's house and I was like, "Well, welcome home."

177
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,920
 He's still sitting back there and he's like, "No, I want to go to Dairy Queen first."

178
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,120
 I was like, "Ah."

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
 I hit him.

180
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,140
 He appears in the back in the rear view mirror and then he's gone and I drive home and I

181
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,340
 think it was the next day or a day later.

182
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,780
 I mean, obviously terrified me.

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,740
 When I go back home, I think it was the day or two later.

184
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
 I don't recall.

185
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,540
 This story would have happened back in the late 90s.

186
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,780
 I drove back out to that area to kind of get an idea of what it looked like during the

187
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,220
 day and there was a creek.

188
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:27,760
 I thought, "Oh, this could be true or it could be part of the imagination process."

189
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
 You don't know.

190
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
 With paranormal research, you just don't know.

191
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,280
 I got the feeling that he had drowned in that area.

192
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,520
 Now, it would be kind of hard for a nine-year-old to drown in a creek.

193
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
 Not impossible.

194
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
 Don't test it.

195
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,280
 Don't be like, "Jason, I went out of five nine-year-olds.

196
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,120
 I kidnapped three of them drowned."

197
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,720
 Yes, you are right.

198
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
 Don't test it.

199
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
 It wasn't like a tiny creek.

200
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,140
 It wasn't a raging river, but I just had the idea that this kid died in this creek.

201
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,140
 I don't know.

202
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,140
 Maybe he got hit by a car and fell in the water and he's unconscious and he drowned.

203
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,140
 I don't know.

204
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,420
 It's disturbing either way, but anyways.

205
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,260
 That little jerk, that little blue boy haunted me for a long time.

206
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,660
 Like I would see him around me.

207
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,140
 I was terrified of him.

208
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,400
 It was a malicious spirit.

209
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
 It was definitely not something you'd want to hang around.

210
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,560
 I remember I worked at Godfather's Pizza back in the day.

211
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
 It got so bad.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,120
 I worked at Godfather's Pizza back in the day and I was talking to my friend Jackie

213
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,400
 and I think Josh was there and then our boss, Jeff maybe?

214
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
 What's his name?

215
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 I don't remember.

216
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
 Jerry?

217
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,880
 Anyways, we're sitting there.

218
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,200
 We're talking at Godfather's Pizza and I see the little boy, little blue boy.

219
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
 Wasn't a customer?

220
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,700
 Wasn't just any nine year old that was freaking out.

221
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,820
 I was like, "No!"

222
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
 I see him raw.

223
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,340
 It was the weirdest thing the way paranormal activity happens.

224
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,100
 They're not tied down to our physical laws.

225
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,580
 I see him basically, there was a little hallway back where the bathrooms were.

226
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,260
 I see him right there.

227
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,380
 We're probably a good like maybe 10, 15 feet away from this hallway at least in the bathrooms.

228
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,560
 I see him kind of standing at the entrance of that hallway and then in a heartbeat he

229
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,840
 was right in front of me.

230
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,080
 Like my mind perceived him running but the time he just instantly was in front of me.

231
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:34,960
 I'm standing there with friends and my boss and all of a sudden I scream.

232
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
 I go, "Ahh!"

233
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,620
 They saw a ghost, they saw a ghost right at me.

234
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,060
 It was like 8pm.

235
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,340
 It wasn't even that late.

236
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
 I was terrified.

237
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,860
 I was like, "This is the type of spirit that can ruin your life."

238
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,140
 This is the type of thing where you're like trying to deliver pizzas and he's like tripping

239
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
 you.

240
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
 You're like, "Oh!"

241
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
 Well even he doesn't even have to trip you.

242
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,140
 He doesn't have to tie your shoelaces together.

243
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,060
 He just appears in front of you.

244
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,380
 You're carrying pizzas and he's like, "Boo!

245
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,080
 You're gonna throw your pizzas."

246
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,440
 And that's just pizza related.

247
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,080
 Imagine if you were applying for another job because you got fired, you get drop in pizzas.

248
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,840
 You're in an interview for a job and the blue boy is standing behind the boss and he's

249
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,080
 like, "Nah, ah, ah, ah, don't hire this guy."

250
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
 Like what?

251
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
 Come on man, give me a chance.

252
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,880
 Let me get a job here.

253
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,160
 He's like, "No, don't hire him."

254
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,600
 And the boss will be like, "Who are you talking to?

255
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,040
 I will give you a chance."

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,520
 Why do you keep looking over my shoulder?

257
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,840
 Why have you peed your pants three times?

258
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,980
 In a 15 minute interview, I was like, "Oh, the ghost."

259
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,880
 This ghost could really mess with you.

260
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:47,620
 If he's making you scream in public, a grown man, scream in public, what else could he

261
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
 have done?

262
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,420
 Eventually I stopped seeing the blue boy.

263
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,580
 I really should look up, I'm gonna find that street because I will have to be in the cold

264
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,660
 here for a second because it's not fair.

265
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,460
 Let me see if I can pull it up here real quick.

266
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,100
 Because it's not fair to tell a story like that and go, "Ugh, I don't remember where

267
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
 it took place.

268
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
 Really?"

269
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,800
 Let me find my grandma's house and then I'm gonna kind of goof off.

270
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,820
 So I think it was...

271
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,400
 I can give you like a street or two.

272
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,560
 I know there's a lot of people in Sacramento who listen to this podcast.

273
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
 It's funny.

274
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
 My grandma's house looks great.

275
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,800
 The people who took it over are really good.

276
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,720
 I think, okay, so there's...

277
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,080
 It was one of three streets.

278
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
 I can put it on that.

279
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,160
 It was Philbert, Chestnut, or Walnut.

280
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,560
 But anyways, yeah, if you're out in that area, you can draw...

281
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,040
 I mean, it's such a rural...

282
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,860
 It's such a rural place.

283
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
 I'm pronouncing the word rural.

284
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,780
 I'm saying rural like country if you guys can't understand and everyone's like, "Of course,

285
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,340
 we can't understand."

286
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,380
 Chestnut or Walnut.

287
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,860
 And you would be able to identify it.

288
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,660
 You just drive down and on the right hand side, you'll see a creek.

289
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,820
 When I see a creek, it wasn't just like a little stream of water.

290
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
 There was a bridge.

291
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,180
 There was like a straight up like black top bridge with a metal railing built around it.

292
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,240
 It was enough of a creek that you have to build a structure over it.

293
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,320
 It wasn't just like some kid in cut off jeans catching crawdads type of creek.

294
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,560
 Anyways, so yeah, I don't think it was Maine.

295
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,040
 100% don't think it was Maine.

296
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,240
 But if you live in that area, go ahead and drive on through.

297
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,320
 Knock on every door and go, "Do you know about a kid who died here and get arrested?"

298
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Trying to find my ghost.

299
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
 It's creepy.

300
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,400
 So let's get back to this ghost story though.

301
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,100
 When I read about that, I go with the blue boy drowned in the bathtub.

302
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,820
 I was like, "Dude, that reminds me of my blue boy."

303
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,940
 And when you are a paranormal researcher, you want to find patterns.

304
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,580
 Because then it does start to build.

305
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:48,140
 You can start to kind of really investigate it as a phenomenon rather than a one off event.

306
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:55,220
 If only one cow was ever found mutilated, you would just be like, "Well, this is weird."

307
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,800
 The reason why cattle mutilations is a topic in the UFO community or the conspiracy theory

308
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,600
 community is because we can look at these patterns and we can go, "Okay, it's not just

309
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
 one cow.

310
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,840
 It's been thousands of cows over the course of around 120 years.

311
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,640
 Cattle mutilations have been going on since almost the turn of the century.

312
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,840
 What could be causing this?"

313
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,080
 Now we have a phenomenon.

314
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
 We have a bunch of them.

315
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,160
 But anyways, the blue boy phenomenon, I was like, "Okay."

316
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,300
 And it would make sense when you drown.

317
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,260
 They say you turn blue.

318
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:34,340
 I had to actually look at a couple photos of drowning victims or drowned victims.

319
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,820
 As I was getting ready for this segment, it wasn't the best part of my research.

320
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,820
 When you have any sort of oxygen deprivation, you can turn blue.

321
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,220
 Your lips can turn blue.

322
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,540
 It's part of what's happening when you're dying.

323
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,860
 They don't necessarily look blue.

324
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,300
 They look more purple when you see a dead body that's drowned.

325
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,480
 It can take a blueish appearance.

326
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
 We have two basic...

327
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
 Now we have a phenomenon, right?

328
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,400
 We have two blue boys.

329
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,960
 But let's take a look at this one.

330
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,400
 This is what's so interesting about this story.

331
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,600
 We have this little paragraph in the Shadowlands.net and I'll tell you right now, most of the stuff

332
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,120
 I find on the Shadowlands.net that I want to cover, a lot of it's just basic ghost stuff.

333
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,440
 Weird stuff that I want to cover.

334
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,400
 A lot of times I will then try to dig in more.

335
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,840
 I just don't want to read a paragraph to you and move on.

336
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,340
 I've had to do that because I haven't been able to find anything else sometimes.

337
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,820
 I'll find a really cool ghost story and I'll say this is the only thing I can find.

338
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,300
 Let's talk about it.

339
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,140
 That happens all the time.

340
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,780
 This was one that I expected the same thing.

341
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,300
 I was just like, "Let's talk about this blue boy.

342
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,020
 It's a phenomenon now because I've had this similar experience."

343
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,020
 I was able to find so much information about this ghost and what's even weirder is the

344
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,160
 information comes from the university.

345
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,680
 The information, most of the information we get is from Dominican University, which is

346
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,280
 a Catholic college in San Rafael, California.

347
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,160
 So apparently part of the college is a place called Meadowlands Hall.

348
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,320
 It's this 30,000 square foot mansion that used to be owned by the De Young family, which

349
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,200
 was a wealthy family back in the 1800s.

350
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,700
 This mansion was built in 1888.

351
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:26,940
 The college was founded in 1901 and pretty much next door and then eventually they purchased

352
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,340
 the Meadowlands mansion in 1918 and became part of the college.

353
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,620
 They didn't just get the mansion, they also got a ghost attached to it.

354
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:42,180
 Most of this information I found on Dominican University's walking tour site on their alumni

355
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,180
 site.

356
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,060
 They really, really like telling this ghost story.

357
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,840
 It's so funny because so many other colleges, so many other private and public institutions

358
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,720
 are like, "Yeah, we don't really believe in ghosts."

359
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,640
 These people, they're like, "Dude, you wanna hear something spooky?

360
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,400
 Let's put this on our main website."

361
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 The story goes like this.

362
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,480
 Back in the 1800s, the De Young family had a son with some mental health issues.

363
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,920
 And it's the 1880s, what are you gonna do, right?

364
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,480
 Feed him some mercury and hope he gets better.

365
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,460
 They didn't have a lot of treatments for people with mental illnesses back then.

366
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,860
 So according to the Dominican University's website, what the De Young family did was

367
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,180
 keep him in the house all the time, because he would be an embarrassment if it got out

368
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,300
 to this kid how crazy he was.

369
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,780
 Now they don't say what he had.

370
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,380
 We don't know if he was just a little rambunctious like a Dennis the Menace type character.

371
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,380
 Or if he was like a wrong turn hillbilly crawling on all fours and barking.

372
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
 We don't know.

373
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,760
 Even between Dennis the Menace and inbred mutated freak, this child existed.

374
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,960
 So this little boy, we don't have a name for him.

375
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
 This little boy locked in his house all the time.

376
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,480
 It's a mansion though, if you're gonna be trapped anywhere, which will be trapped in

377
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,080
 a 30,000 square foot mansion.

378
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,720
 It's not really a prison at that point.

379
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,640
 Well one day, the family was out doing something that would be a prison, right?

380
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,040
 Your family's like, "Let's go have a picnic in the crazy kids."

381
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,720
 Like, "Me too, me too."

382
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,260
 And they're like, "Wrong turn, why don't you stay in the house?

383
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,700
 We will go outside.

384
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,820
 You stay here, 'cause it's dangerous outside."

385
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
 What?

386
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
 Yeah, it's dangerous outside.

387
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,060
 We're brave, we're brave enough to handle the danger, but not you.

388
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 Not you, WT.

389
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,300
 So then he's scuttling around the mansion.

390
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,540
 Well apparently, you can't leave like a crazy kid running around the mansion all by himself

391
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,660
 when the family goes to come back in.

392
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,300
 It's a home alone situation.

393
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
 He's throwing anvils at them.

394
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,960
 So there's a nanny who takes care of this little kid.

395
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,400
 So on this particular occasion, while the entire family had left to go have fun without

396
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,280
 this little boy, the nanny was giving him a bath and she just snapped.

397
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,080
 Like whatever this kid was up to, it was just too much.

398
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,720
 This particular day, the nanny's like, "I can't take it, I can't take it."

399
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,600
 So she drowned this boy.

400
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,860
 She held him under the water until he stopped breathing.

401
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,940
 I don't know what drowned means.

402
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,340
 I don't know what drowned means.

403
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,340
 Anyway, she kills this kid.

404
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,340
 She immediately feels bad about it, which I imagine you would.

405
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,620
 Like especially if it's in a situation like that where you just snapped.

406
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,380
 You'd been down too many wrong turns too many times and you snap and you drown this kid

407
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,180
 and she immediately felt bad about it so then she hung herself.

408
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,520
 Which I imagine for the family coming back home, they're like, "What a delightful picnic.

409
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,960
 God, we should have brought that mutated freak along."

410
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,880
 Well, maybe next time honey, and then they walk in the door and they find a drowned boy

411
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,360
 and a hanging nanny.

412
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,040
 Now I don't know, Jason you were laughing a lot.

413
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,600
 This kid being drowned.

414
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,920
 I don't know if this story is true, it is posted on the Dominican University's website.

415
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,280
 They do use a lot of times where it's like, "Legend say" or "The old stories" would

416
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,120
 have it, but it's possible that this kid actually was murdered and in that case I shouldn't have

417
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,920
 laughed and laughed so much.

418
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,880
 Anyways, this boy's dead, the nanny's dead and to this day people still see the blue

419
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,960
 boy because the mansion was turned into a dormitory.

420
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,360
 I mean, that's awesome, right?

421
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,200
 Even if you're living in a mansion, you're like, "I feel like a wrong turn mutant."

422
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,880
 Oh man, this is so awesome in here.

423
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
 They're like, "What are you talking about?"

424
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,360
 And they're like, "Legend say."

425
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,200
 Let me start telling you the story.

426
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
 No, they have it as a dormitory.

427
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,840
 I guess at one point it was also like an assembly area.

428
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,160
 I'm sure it's kind of gone back and forth.

429
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,400
 I don't know what it is used as today.

430
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,720
 Either way, dormitory or assembly area, people have seen sightings of the blue boy ghost.

431
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 Some of these are pretty benign.

432
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 I mean, this is terrifying.

433
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
 Don't get me wrong, you'd have a heart attack if you saw this.

434
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,760
 But people say when they're walking down the hallway or they're in their room and there's

435
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,760
 like a corner, it's kind of darkened, lights are off.

436
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:21,360
 You walk into your room and they sit around the corner, you would see a bluish glow.

437
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,720
 So you wouldn't directly see the boy but you would see him standing behind the corner.

438
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,680
 You would know he's there because in the darkness you would see this bluish glow right behind

439
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
 the corner.

440
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,800
 So, I mean, that's terrifying.

441
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,560
 This ghost definitely knows what to do to make it scary.

442
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,840
 If you walked into a room, well, actually both of these are quite terrifying.

443
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,640
 If you walked into a room and you saw a blue boy standing there, I guess that's actually

444
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,320
 more scary than not seeing it.

445
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,000
 But he's standing around the corner.

446
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,040
 Yeah, I mean, imagine if you walked in and you go, "I think there's a skeleton behind

447
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
 that corner."

448
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,120
 Where he's just walking in and there's a skeleton dancing on your bed.

449
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,720
 You'd be like, "Okay, I'm not sleeping in my bed tonight."

450
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,040
 He stands behind the corner.

451
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:11,360
 Also people have remarked that their bathrooms will get locked while they're not in them.

452
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,280
 And that sucks, right?

453
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,240
 You really gotta go to the bathroom.

454
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,760
 Super inconvenient, right?

455
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,400
 Because you only think about going into the bathroom when you need to be in the bathroom.

456
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,880
 You gotta pee or poop or put on makeup, I guess, maybe, or two or three at the same time.

457
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,800
 But bathrooms are generally not a place you go just out of a whim.

458
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,840
 So getting locked out of it would suck.

459
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,720
 But again, that's not like...there's worse things that could happen to skeletons dancing

460
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,480
 on your bed.

461
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,080
 Also though, like the main story is they'll say you'll see wet footprints around the area.

462
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
 That's creepy.

463
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,680
 We're talking about a manifestation.

464
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,720
 We're talking about leaving physical evidence, which is rare for ghosts, to be able to do

465
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 that.

466
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,160
 But wet footprints around the area.

467
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,880
 But all of that stuff is terrifying, but it doesn't even compare to the power level

468
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,720
 that a ghost would need to have to do this next one.

469
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,280
 And this next one, I believe I found on the alumni website, the alumni Facebook page, the

470
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,640
 bathtub that he was drowned in.

471
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
 They kept it.

472
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,760
 I don't think anyone else took a bath in it.

473
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,360
 They're like, "Oh, it's your bathtub, little Billy."

474
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,960
 They're like, "No, no, no, my brother was just drowned in that."

475
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
 I'm sure they got a new bathtub.

476
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,480
 I'm sure they got a new bathtub at some point, but they kept the old bathtub because this

477
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
 was old-timies.

478
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,440
 I'm sure that bathtub was super expensive.

479
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,480
 It probably cost like $20 in old money.

480
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,880
 So they kept the bathtub, but they took it up to the attic, which I'm sure was probably

481
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,120
 wasn't easy carrying this big old 18th century bathtub up the stairs.

482
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
 I would have made money to watch that.

483
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,840
 They take the bathtub upstairs and they turn it over.

484
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,840
 So the bathtub is still stored in the attic and it's flipped over.

485
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:11,200
 But even with that, sometimes you'll go up into the attic and you will see water pouring

486
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,760
 out of the bathtub.

487
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,240
 So it's like some had, it's not hooked up to anything.

488
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,200
 The water is still pouring out from somewhere and because the bathtub's flipped over, it's

489
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,080
 just spilling all over the floor.

490
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,760
 Or ceiling, really, because it's in your attic.

491
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,120
 It's your ceiling if you're walking around downstairs.

492
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,640
 You know, like above your head, you'd get a ton of water damage, which would be the

493
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,160
 least of your worries because there's a dead boy.

494
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,800
 There's a dead boy floating around.

495
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,080
 I mean, that takes, we have ghosts that turn on water faucets.

496
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
 That's super common.

497
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,600
 And a long time ago, I found that website that said, "The reason why ghosts are always turning

498
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,680
 on water faucets is because being dead makes you thirsty."

499
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,560
 Which is a creepy idea.

500
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
 Super creepy.

501
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,960
 I would hope that being dead is like the most comfortable thing in the world.

502
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,720
 Not that you're like, "I'm parched and I'll be parched for a million years."

503
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,760
 The other idea is the reason why ghosts turn on the water fountains is because they can

504
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,360
 transmit their energy easier through water.

505
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,880
 We do see a lot of cultures combine water and running water with the paranormal.

506
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,880
 And that the bigger body of water or the more flow that water has, the more violent the

507
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,520
 spirit can become.

508
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,720
 The paranormal ghosts in particular and water have very, very close connection.

509
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,840
 So the idea is they're turning on the water, it's basically allowing, it's giving them

510
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,200
 more energy to pull off of.

511
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 The other thing, the skeptical answer is just the water's faulty and that's something that

512
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,160
 can easily turn on.

513
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,920
 That's water and like, cause a lot of times water and lights are being affected by ghosts

514
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,000
 and they go, "Those are two things that can, are pretty easy to just over time not work

515
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,160
 correctly.

516
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,480
 Your lights turning on and off is just bad wiring and your water turning on and off is

517
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 just pipes.

518
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,960
 It's an issue with pipes.

519
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,160
 The handle isn't turning itself.

520
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,960
 It's just the mechanisms are starting to get bad and the same thing we would call a leaky

521
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,120
 faucet over time it will just leak and leak more.

522
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,240
 So those are the three options.

523
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,880
 But when you have a bathtub that's not hooked up to anything and it's interesting that it's

524
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 turned over.

525
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,040
 You can understand the logical reason why you would turn a bathtub over so a bunch of

526
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,200
 raccoons don't make a house in there.

527
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,600
 But I'm wondering if originally the bathtub was upright in the attic and it kept filling

528
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,680
 full of water.

529
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,040
 So to prevent that they go, "Well let's just tip it over.

530
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,160
 I mean this thing's obviously haunted.

531
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,880
 Let's tip it over and the problem is it's still filling up with water.

532
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,600
 The water now is just instantly spilling all over the floor."

533
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,640
 Now it's possible that Dominican University, they love these ghost stories because they're

534
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,880
 fun and whimsical.

535
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,320
 I mean they're not super whimsical.

536
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,120
 It involves a child being murdered and then suicide.

537
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,000
 It's possible that they don't...

538
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,080
 Well I was going to say it's possible that they're playing these stories up for spookiness

539
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,840
 sake but it's interesting because most of these places downplay the stories.

540
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,440
 Sometimes during Halloween they'll have a ghost tour at this university or this hotel

541
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
 or something like that.

542
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,240
 But we've come across a ton of institutions, whether they're cities, like what's that one

543
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,520
 in Connecticut.

544
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,520
 It's a weird, it's like dark forest.

545
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,680
 It's a place called like dark forest or something like that.

546
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
 I'll put the episode on the show notes but...

547
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,720
 Or Stoll Cemetery in Kansas.

548
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,960
 They will actually have police arrest you if you're out ghost hunting in these areas.

549
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,880
 They have signs of saying there are no ghosts, stay away or you'll get arrested.

550
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,040
 Some of these places have really, really strict trespassing laws.

551
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,840
 Some of these institutions, they go there are no ghosts and Dominican University seems

552
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,760
 to be playing it up which makes me think they're having a laugh or they do believe in it.

553
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,960
 Maybe they've seen, maybe the deans like, "You know what?

554
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
 I've seen the blue boy a hundred times.

555
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,160
 We're putting it on the website.

556
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,040
 I'm tired of people saying that it's not real.

557
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
 It's real.

558
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,600
 And maybe if we put it on the website people will believe me.

559
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,720
 A fascinating and terrifying story indeed.

560
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,880
 That went a little bit longer than I thought but I think we have time for this.

561
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,840
 Vaccine, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous Carpenter Coptter we're

562
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
 leaving behind.

563
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,720
 Santa Rafael, wave goodbye to that blue boy.

564
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,880
 He's not following us under any circumstances.

565
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,600
 Fly us all the way out to Algeria.

566
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:57,040
 And I want to give a shout out to Bad June.

567
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,520
 Bad June, Patreon supporter, very active in the Patreon Discord.

568
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
 Sent me over this story.

569
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,680
 It's absolutely fascinating.

570
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,880
 And this story was posted on Twitter by someone going by the name STW and then some sort of

571
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,160
 pink bird at Madrid guy or no that's not his name.

572
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,880
 At Magery guy.

573
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,160
 At Magery guy.

574
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,440
 We're going to Bled Algeria and we're going to attend a wedding.

575
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,040
 You wore your formal wear right?

576
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,600
 I always wear my formal wear when I'm hunting ghosts.

577
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,240
 We're walking around a little blue boy.

578
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
 He's the ring bearer.

579
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
 We're like get out of here.

580
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
 We told you you can't follow us.

581
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,680
 We're in Bled Algeria and we're about to meet this young woman.

582
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,840
 She's in her 20s.

583
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,040
 We don't have anyone's name.

584
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,720
 Apparently the person who posted this, this was his cousin I believe.

585
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,440
 Yeah, cousin.

586
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,520
 So he is directly related to the participants in the story but he didn't give any names.

587
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
 Let's go ahead and call her Sarah.

588
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,280
 So Sarah is this young woman she's in her 20s and she's about to get married to a wonderful

589
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,760
 man.

590
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
 She loves this guy.

591
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,320
 She can't wait to start her new life with him but it's the day of the wedding and Sarah

592
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:16,720
 is crying.

593
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,480
 You know her dad's watching this and he's like oh my poor little girl.

594
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,440
 My poor little girl's crying but you know wedding day jitters is what he figures.

595
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,000
 She's just crying because she's about to start a new life.

596
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 I'm just going to say goodbye to her family.

597
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,440
 This is natural.

598
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,440
 After the ceremony it's time for Sarah to join her new husband at his house but she

599
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,720
 becomes incredibly ill.

600
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,360
 She says I don't want to see anybody.

601
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,920
 I want to be left alone.

602
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,880
 Oh Sarah you've got to go to this house.

603
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
 You've married this guy.

604
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,040
 It's time to go home with him.

605
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,960
 No, I don't want to be around anybody.

606
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,080
 I don't want to go to that house.

607
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,960
 I just want to be left alone.

608
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,840
 That would be odd enough.

609
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:12,040
 It's quite the personality change but she also begins to talk to herself and not just

610
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:21,920
 talk to herself which again is alarming but she's saying crazy things.

611
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,200
 Now the pink bird guy doesn't tell us exactly what the crazy things are.

612
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,360
 Like is it two teapots are standing on my head?

613
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,400
 That type of stuff like lyrics from They Might Be Giants or she's like saying I'm going

614
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
 to cut myself open.

615
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,320
 I'm going to bleed dogs.

616
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,200
 I'm going to turn to town, bled Algeria into what its name is.

617
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,440
 They're like no Jason you're clearly mispronouncing the name of that town.

618
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,960
 There's not a place in the world called bled.

619
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,640
 Anyways, we don't know what crazy things she's saying but some time is passing and she's

620
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,040
 still just muttering to herself.

621
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
 She hasn't gone to the dude's house.

622
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,040
 She's still staying at her old home apparently with her parents.

623
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,640
 They start to realize that something's really wrong with Sarah.

624
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,640
 They start to believe that she might be possessed.

625
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,160
 Or maybe not if outright possessed under the influence of darker forces.

626
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,360
 So they consult an amam.

627
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,960
 They bring them in and they go hey something's up with their daughter she's acting super

628
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,560
 weird.

629
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,880
 And he talks to her he's doing this investigation and he does come to the conclusion that yes

630
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,800
 there is a dark spirit attached to her so what they do is what's called a rakia or

631
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,080
 it's a counterspell is one way to put it.

632
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,240
 It's also would be the equivalent would be an islamic version of an exorcism.

633
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,480
 They do a rakia and this is so fascinating.

634
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,880
 The story is so weird.

635
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,720
 I love stories like this.

636
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,760
 Ba June thank you so much for sending this over.

637
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,240
 I love stuff like this.

638
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:18,920
 What she has attached to her so in the English language we have the demon which is a fallen

639
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,360
 angel someone who's cast down by God during the war the rebellious war of Satan and one

640
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,640
 third of the angels against God.

641
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,920
 Those angels and Satan were sent to earth and that is what we call a demon.

642
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,720
 In the islamic tradition there's a thing called the jinn and it's not a direct correlation

643
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
 between the two.

644
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:46,600
 The jinn have some differences that Christian demons do not and this is a big one.

645
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:53,200
 This is a big one apparently in the islamic tradition the jinn can choose to follow a

646
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,000
 particular religious faith.

647
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,640
 That's fascinating.

648
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,640
 We covered something that a long time ago we covered a story where I think it was the

649
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,640
 prophet Muhammad was confronted by these jinn and he converted them by speaking the

650
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:17,320
 words from Allah he converted them to Islam and these jinn then became islamic and they

651
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,680
 were saved.

652
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,840
 In the Christian tradition that's impossible the demons have committed the unforgivable

653
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,880
 act of rebelling against God and while they do have free will in a sense because they

654
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,320
 chose to fight in that way they're pretty much the bad guys they're the henchmen background

655
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:46,200
 characters in this whole saga between God and Lucifer and Jesus and all that stuff.

656
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,720
 I've never come across any stories in the Christian faith of demons and I've wondered

657
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,160
 about that I think we did an episode on that.

658
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,560
 Could a demon accept Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior and then go to heaven?

659
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,600
 And I've asked ministers that I ask the weirdest questions to people all the time.

660
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,720
 Is that possible?

661
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,200
 When the islamic tradition it's not a theory that we actually have versions of that so

662
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:19,600
 the jinn now in Algeria there no one as a noun or j'noun one of the two it's spelled

663
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:26,000
 J-N-O-U-N it's the same thing as a jinn I don't know if the J is silent but anyways

664
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,280
 I probably can check that out but June said hey do you need any help translating this

665
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,240
 I'm like nope I probably did I probably did I was like I'll just use the translator

666
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,440
 there Google translate it'll be good anyways there's a different version the same different

667
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,880
 name for them in Algeria in typically they're known as jinn's in Algeria they're known

668
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:56,080
 as j'nouns or nouns anyways what's fascinating about this is that this spirit I'll just use

669
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,440
 the word jinn because I know how to pronounce it this jinn that is attached to Sarah is

670
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:14,980
 he's Jewish it's a Jewish jinn it's a Jewish jinn it's a Jewish demon it's not a demon

671
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:22,960
 from Jewish theology it's a jinn who follows the religion of Judaism and it is attached

672
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,440
 itself to this young girl Sarah fascinating we're not even done we're not even done we're

673
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,640
 not even done anyways this a mom says okay listen this Jewish jinn is attached itself

674
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:43,400
 to Sarah we're gonna do this Rockia he probably pronounced it correctly we're gonna get rid

675
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,840
 of it and they do and she actually starts to feel better but he goes listen he goes

676
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:54,680
 the way that this works is that somewhere there is a bewitched item someone is like someone

677
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,800
 set out to put this on her and we have to find the bewitched the cursed item and destroy

678
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,400
 it to completely get rid of this the jinn could come back to get her through investigation

679
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:17,560
 the imam says the item is a cake he saw he saw I will eat all the cakes I'll find out

680
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,640
 where the curse is they're like oh we shouldn't have gotten the hungry imam to show up he says

681
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,600
 the curse is hidden in a cake and apparently there are these little again probably translation

682
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:34,120
 errors the cupcake type things the bridal party we're gonna have these cakes called Mac

683
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:42,240
 Rodos Mac Rods anyways it's these time there's 300 there's 300 of them at a point it's not

684
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,120
 like there's just one wedding cake and you're like okay guys everyone grab a fork let's

685
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:54,120
 find this curse there's 300 cakes and one of them is cursed one of them has to be destroyed

686
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,120
 the reason why you know it's cursed because inside it's wet it's moist and wet on the

687
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,320
 inside and these cakes shouldn't be like that so the people the people the family of the

688
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:13,960
 bridal party begins to crush these cakes they're trying to find the wet one and they don't

689
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:22,040
 they go through all of them and none of them are wet so the girls doing a little bit better

690
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,440
 I mean I'm sure that is a relief when there's a demon no longer attached to you but again

691
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,880
 it might come back well you also got to do all your regular stuff you can't be like oh

692
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,040
 I'm not coming into work today boss my daughter got possessed by a Jewish demon so you know

693
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,680
 and they're like Johnny Johnny you've used that excuse three times this week when is

694
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,040
 the demon leaving your daughter you got to get back to work you have to go and do the

695
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:52,560
 normal stuff well the mom the mom of the bride she had borrowed stuff from people for the

696
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,400
 wedding right you're not going to go on by a plate that you're only going to use once

697
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,760
 she actually had borrowed a plate from a neighbor and she had to go return it to the neighbor

698
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,000
 and she goes so weird she goes I need to give this plate back to my neighbor but I don't

699
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,920
 want to bring it back empty because she let me borrow it I want to give her something

700
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,920
 how about how about these cakes how about these undisturbed cakes that for some reason

701
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,880
 we didn't find earlier I'm going to stack a couple of these cakes up on this plate and

702
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,320
 go give it to my neighbor so the mom puts the cakes on the plate and she begins walking

703
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:34,360
 down the stairs and she falls she she hella pales down the stairs and she gets to the

704
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:44,880
 bottom and she's sitting there and she goes that shouldn't have happened like 100% like

705
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:58,240
 something tripped me and she immediately begins to go through the cakes on the plate now again

706
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,560
 it could be a translation error when they said they destroyed them all earlier maybe

707
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,520
 they were just checking the middle this time she's actually breaking the cakes open and

708
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,720
 she breaks one of the cakes open and it's wet and moist in the middle so that was the

709
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,800
 cursed cake and she knew it when she fell down those stairs she knew that what she didn't

710
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:27,240
 just trip not like she didn't know where she was going something tripped her and she broke

711
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,800
 that cake open right there and then the daughter started feeling much much better like before

712
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,120
 she was on a slow road to recovery but now she was getting better what's interesting is

713
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:47,480
 that Matt madry guy says she's not 100% she still talks to herself but she's getting

714
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:55,080
 better which is interesting because you imagine getting possessed by just having something

715
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,240
 in your body that's not supposed to be there would leave some lingering effects like even

716
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,120
 though the demon got exercised from her she's still suffering neurological damage like she's

717
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:12,160
 not communicating with whatever it was but you would have to imagine it would cause if

718
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:22,960
 not permanent damage long term damage and it's a good thing right that they found that

719
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,800
 cake if they had they just thrown the cakes away and not destroyed it I mean eventually

720
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,080
 I'm sure a crow crow would fly by and eat it at a garbage dump or something like that

721
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,680
 but this would have gone on longer and the gin most likely would have repossessed her

722
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,160
 so it's fascinating story cursed I mean obviously a skeptic can go issues have suffered from

723
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,520
 some sort of mental illness all that stuff right it's possible but in the world of paranormal

724
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:54,000
 we're gonna wear our conspiracy caps and look at this as what it's being said to be it's

725
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,240
 a demonic possession of a young woman now why it chose her what's interesting is it

726
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,240
 seems like she was targeted some of the stuff some of the things we have to fill in who be

727
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,400
 which during the first place I don't think it was the gym was just floating around like

728
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,040
 someone maybe a jealous rival or whatever targeted her but she was the one that it was

729
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,360
 coming after that's fascinating but what I love about the story about June when he

730
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,320
 sent it over he posted it on the discord he added this and we're gonna wrap it up like

731
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:30,680
 this and what a crazy possibility bad June says quote the poster meaning madriguy on

732
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:38,880
 Twitter the poster explains that while a lot of people were surprised the gin was Jewish

733
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,440
 they're using the word down but just because they still don't know if I know how to pronounce

734
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,840
 that the poster explains that while a lot of people were surprised the gin was Jewish

735
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,200
 gins are like people and have religious affiliation so that that's an interesting point we've talked

736
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,440
 about that before in the podcast but check this part out this part is nuts this next

737
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,680
 part is nuts I love doing this show I'm so glad you guys enjoy listening to it the poster

738
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,480
 explains that while a lot of people were surprised the gin was Jewish gin are like people and

739
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:16,680
 have religious affiliations which can be problematic for example if the gin is Muslim you can't

740
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:28,360
 use the Quran to fight it because it would just make him stronger dude that's crazy that

741
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:35,120
 is nuts and we've talked about this and even people who are just passing like have a passing

742
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,080
 interest in the paranormal or just their out and out skeptics they'll say like well what

743
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,440
 if the ghost was Jewish and then you're using the Bible but he doesn't believe in the Bible

744
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,080
 then it wouldn't work or vampire like why does a crucifix affect a vampire what if the

745
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,680
 vampire was Jewish it's kind of like a joke it's kind of like a meme but this is the answer

746
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:02,680
 like if you have a Jewish spirit a Jewish demon who's decided to go down the path of

747
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:12,040
 Judaism and it possesses someone in Israel for example and you bring a rabbi out to exercise

748
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,040
 that spirit by reading those verses that that demon believes in they're like oh yeah no

749
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,760
 I love that verse that verse is what helped me convert to Judaism what are you talking

750
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:30,120
 about that's awesome it makes me stronger or if you had a Muslim demon and you were reading

751
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:37,320
 from the Quran he's like oh no yeah thanks dude that just made me stronger super fascinating

752
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:44,160
 and that does jive with what we know of it's so interesting because gin and demon is it

753
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,160
 just a translation thing is it are they the same being like some times it seems like they

754
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,480
 are sometimes it does seem like they are the fallen ones that are meant to deceive us but

755
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,200
 gin seem to have way more self-awareness and way more freedom to do what they want to do

756
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:09,360
 demons are basically stock characters now we have demons in the Christian theology what's

757
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,480
 interesting so when a lot of times people talk about like the Grand Ark Bishop of Hell we

758
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,000
 have all those creatures like ball Barith and zippy do or whatever there's all sorts

759
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,040
 of weird ones out there game G game G I think was a donkey if I remember correctly that

760
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,960
 we wrote them around in an episode we have all that all came very very late in Christianity

761
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,480
 like 1514 1516 century when Catholic monks and Catholic priests were supposedly communicating

762
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:45,120
 with demons to write these grand lists of demons in Protestant religion none of that stuff

763
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:52,480
 is real none of it like you will never you may because in a couple times in the Old Testament

764
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,040
 I'm not going to go on and on about this because I don't want to talk about the Bible I watched

765
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,920
 the listenership just plummet but when you look at the Old Testament there are very few

766
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:08,000
 names of demons mentioned Molok is mentioned by name and Bales above I believe is mentioned

767
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,080
 by name Lucifer there's even questions if Lucifer and Satan are the same person Satan

768
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:19,440
 technically means adversary so it's a catch all term but Lucifer was an actual being but

769
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,680
 there's no sense we know that like when Jesus showed up demons were afraid of Jesus but

770
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,340
 there's no sense where they're actually have any sort of free will or they can make decisions

771
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:39,560
 for themselves they're just lackeys so that we don't know if the gin and the demons are

772
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:46,160
 one for one comparison a demon in Christian theology may have zero free will I've heard

773
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,120
 a lot of people say that and that's why they were jealous of humans because humans had

774
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:58,560
 free will because that was really the war between Lucifer and God God loved humans more than

775
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,880
 the angels and Lucifer goes we're your greatest creation he's like no you're not they are

776
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,000
 that's what really started this whole thing but to have free will to rebel against God

777
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,520
 you would need to have free will it's all it's all messy right it's all messy you have to

778
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,360
 go through all this fascinating stuff but could a demon decide to follow the works of

779
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:27,320
 Jesus Christ like truly say you know what I think he was a pretty good guy and actually

780
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,720
 believe he was a son of God and if that's the case if he possessed someone and a priest

781
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,400
 came out to exercise that demon from that body would the Catholic rites of exorcism

782
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,480
 only make the demon stronger you go Jason well if he's following the path of Jesus

783
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,920
 Christ why would he be possessing people in first place I would say there's a lot of

784
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,560
 Christians that do horrible stuff right just because you're a Christian doesn't mean you

785
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:59,920
 never sin or you don't thirst for power you don't do evil things tons of people of religions

786
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,920
 still do evil things against their religion so I don't I mean it's fascinating story it

787
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:14,200
 really does make you wonder about the nature of these creatures gin demons like what are

788
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:22,680
 they can they do they have the free will to start following religion see I've always

789
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:29,560
 thought that made me hopeful that if even they could go wow I was wrong this was the

790
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:35,920
 wrong thing for me to do I'm gonna start worshiping God again there's hope for them then there

791
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,920
 truly is hope for anybody that's how I always looked at it I never thought that I would

792
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:47,280
 give them superpowers I never thought that if you had a demon go you know what I kind

793
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,200
 of like this whole Judaism thing I'm gonna roll with these dudes for a while I think

794
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:58,360
 it would make them immune to exorcism from rabbis it's absolutely fascinating stuff and

795
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:04,080
 bad June thank you so much for sending over like I love this type of because it's a theory

796
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,880
 and a spooky story wrapped in a one it's something we've never heard of before we've heard inklings

797
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,400
 of it we had that story we covered about the gin who converted to Islam we're like oh that's

798
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,720
 cool there's hope for even the ones who have been thrown down from heaven from the dark

799
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,000
 forces there's hope for them but again I didn't think that then super but you're like yeah

800
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,920
 and if that's the case we didn't have a sort on that too I said what if you had a demon

801
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,000
 from another religion go to a continent where that religion isn't practiced I thought it

802
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,440
 would be harder to exorcism but it turns out it's the inverse if you had a demon who believed

803
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,960
 in the religion of that culture like truly believed in it they weren't an Easter and

804
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,600
 Christmas only demon they went to church all the time well could that's an interesting

805
00:50:52,600 --> 00:51:00,840
 question too could a demon who followed Christianity go to church like would it be able to walk

806
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:08,520
 above consecrated ground it's fascinating stuff and what an awesome story to lead into

807
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,160
 episode 1000 because it's stuff like this that makes me love doing this show and it's

808
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,560
