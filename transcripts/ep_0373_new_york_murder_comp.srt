1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 Did a small village in Ethiopia actually have such a close encounter?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,080
 People died?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
 And then we traveled to Brooklyn the year is 1979

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,160
 and two detectives are investigating a pair of ritualistic murders.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,160
 But depending on the time of day, the detectives enter the apartment.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
 Reality is wildly different today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:35,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,040
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,880
 Let's go ahead and move on with our first story though.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,920
 So for our first story, hop in the Carpenter copter.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,000
 We are going for a ride.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
 We are flying out to Ethiopia.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,760
 Ethiopia.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,280
 So we're going all the way over there.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,640
 Imagine me making that noise for eight to ten hours.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,080
 However long the trip is.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,520
 We're going back to 1970 Ethiopia.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,880
 Specifically the village known as Salai Dario.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,320
 This one is a brief one, but it has some weird implications.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,440
 The helicopter, we appear back in time.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,080
 We're flying.

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
 We're looking for a place to land.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
 Land.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,240
 Hop out.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
 And right when we get there, we see everyone in town just kind of milling about.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,480
 This is August 7, 1970.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,560
 People are just kind of walking around, minding their own business.

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,440
 There's not much to do.

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,640
 It's 1970.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,520
 Music sucked.

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280
 There's no such thing as video games.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
 Pong might have been around.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,480
 Plus we're in Ethiopia, so I don't think they were really

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,600
 clamoring for the latest entertainment system.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
 They were more worried about another regional war breaking out.

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,080
 They're standing in the village.

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,960
 They're not just standing there.

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,920
 They're doing stuff.

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
 Washing and like hawking goods and all that stuff.

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
 One side of the village, there's a forest.

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,440
 And you see people kind of stop.

43
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,640
 And they're like, huh?

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,040
 What?

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,280
 What?

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
 And they're kind of looking off towards the forest.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,520
 And basically what's getting everyone's attention is a noise.

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,880
 Everyone's kind of looking around.

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,600
 They're like, what?

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
 Where's that coming from?

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,080
 We don't have any machinery that big here.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
 It's really loud.

53
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,600
 And people kind of start to realize that it's coming from a forest nearby.

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,880
 And the noise is getting louder and louder and louder.

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,840
 To the point that people can't really even talk over each other.

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,240
 It's okay.

57
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,560
 I don't, that might be an exaggeration.

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's louder though.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,920
 It's so loud their ears start bleeding.

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,560
 It's loud.

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,040
 Okay.

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,160
 Now I'll admit that I exaggerated a bit there.

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 The point is loud noise come from the forest.

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,960
 Nobody knows what it is.

65
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,960
 Then this big red ball starts to kind of float out of the forest.

66
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,520
 Now that sound of it accelerating or taking off.

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:00,480
 It's not going up another sky and getting like a little twinkly dot.

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,240
 It's headed right towards the village.

69
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,480
 Now this is an interesting UFO encounter because what happens is it's so scary.

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 Basically people weren't like, hmm, well based on the height of that tree,

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
 it would have to be at least 150 feet.

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
 People really weren't trying to pay attention to what was going on.

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
 They're trying not to die.

74
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,440
 So we don't have any measurements of this thing, but what it's described is,

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,440
 is a big red glowing ball that immediately begins to come charging towards the village.

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,360
 And the first thing it does is as it gets close to the buildings, these houses,

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
 they're all brick and mortar houses here.

78
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
 It doesn't change direction.

79
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,480
 It begins to smash in a house after house after house like Superman.

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,320
 Just like bashing through stuff.

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,000
 It then leaves town.

82
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,800
 Then turns around and starts coming back.

83
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,680
 And now the first time people were a little worried and a little mystified as to what was going on.

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,600
 But the second it stops and starts headed back, it's no longer a mystery.

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,520
 It's, it's death incarnate.

86
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,000
 It's coming back.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
 Now this thing is so hot.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
 Asphalt is bubbling.

89
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,000
 So good luck running.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,360
 I mean, I guess you could just run on the dirt, but actually that's interesting.

91
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,080
 Remind me, you can't because you're, you're just listening to this,

92
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,280
 but I'll try to remind myself.

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
 The asphalt is bubbling.

94
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,120
 utensils are melting, but oddly enough, nothing catches on fire.

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
 The heat is incredibly intense.

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
 It can melt things, melt metals, but you match someone's like, oh, I just got braces today.

97
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,920
 In total pain.

98
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,800
 The thing, I wonder what happened if you got braces right before Hiroshima.

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,920
 That one has sucked.

100
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,080
 Well, so what did the, the, you know, just the nuclear bomb is at it.

101
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
 Anyways, the thing spins around.

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
 It comes back the other direction and hits a giant stone wall.

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,720
 It's almost like this thing wanted to destroy stuff.

104
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,200
 And then after it smashes into a stone wall, it just flies out to the tree line.

105
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
 It disappears.

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
 And then people kind of make their way out of the rubble.

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,040
 Some guys just face is covered in soot.

108
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,240
 He's like, that was close.

109
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
 That was comically close.

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
 All I do is like my face is covered in soot.

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,320
 That's nothing.

112
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
 But then he looks and there's like a bunch of really injured people.

113
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,280
 Eight people got injured because of this attack incident.

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
 One little girl was killed.

115
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
 So this is the thing.

116
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
 I've heard one estimate that the event lasted 10 minutes long.

117
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,720
 So the ball from the point of the noise first starting to the ball leaving was a total of 10 minutes.

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,040
 It's interesting that there's no estimation of how big this thing is.

119
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,960
 There's no description of it other than a red ball.

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,920
 10 minutes is a long time.

121
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,560
 It could have been making noise for nine and a half minutes and then was 30 seconds for it flying around.

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,120
 Who knows?

123
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
 But that's the thing.

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
 There's not a lot of details.

125
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,800
 There are, however, photographs.

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
 So this is where it gets weird.

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
 So I could, this story took place 50 years ago,

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,800
 I could take a photograph of a pothole from 1970 and have two people kind of stare and look into the pothole

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,520
 and bring it to you and say, hey, this is proof that aliens landed.

130
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,640
 And they totally left a pothole in my front yard and homeowner's association trying to make me fix it.

131
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,160
 And I was like, no, Suri.

132
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
 I could do that.

133
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
 And some people would believe it.

134
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,800
 Honestly, I'm starting to learn a lot of people would believe it.

135
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
 If I was trying to pull a scam or some sort of internet hoax,

136
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,040
 I could find photographs of someplace in Africa with a smashed house and go,

137
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,880
 aliens attacked here and come up with this narrative.

138
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,240
 But this one was actually investigated by Jacques Vallee and J. Alan Heineck.

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
 They're both huge UFOologists.

140
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
 Heineck worked with Blue Book and Jacques Vallee.

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
 He's an expert guy in UFO.

142
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,200
 We talked about him earlier in the week and I think actually Ms. Brown's this name,

143
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,240
 but he's the one who believes that aliens are interdimensional and they appear as the other

144
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,120
 of society.

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,880
 So in old times, they were fairies and then as our technology advanced,

146
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,800
 they became they're all they will always be more advanced than them where we're at right now.

147
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
 That's kind of how they appear.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 It's some sort of other entity.

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
 So that adds a little bit of credibility to it.

150
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240
 And I always think it's interesting when these stories that seem fairly simple,

151
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,040
 no aliens walking around, no message of universal brotherhood or cleanup environment or nothing like

152
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,800
 that, just a phenomenon that comes out of nowhere.

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,200
 And again, it's interesting a forest, which is kind of where

154
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,080
 faithful can supernatural things tend to live.

155
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,080
 Something shoots out of the forest, smashes the town and then goes back into the forest.

156
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
 Very, very simple story.

157
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,320
 It's quite obscure.

158
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,440
 Not a lot of people know about this one, even though it resulted in somebody dying.

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
 One, it happened in Ethiopia, so that's not going to get a lot of coverage.

160
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,480
 Probably didn't even get a lot of coverage then in the news because it was so bizarre and

161
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,520
 they used to not media, used to hate covering UFO stuff.

162
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,080
 But even now, it's just kind of been lost to time.

163
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
 Very, very bizarre UFO story.

164
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,920
 And it's one of those things like if UFOs were abducting people and doing studies on them,

165
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,800
 that's terrifying.

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,240
 But if they're shooting out of the woods and destroying human civilization, that's an act of war.

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,000
 So yeah, it's definitely one that I think should be investigated more.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
 But at this point, it's 50 years old.

169
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
 How much more could you really look into?

170
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,680
 And I guess you could travel out there if that village is still there.

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
 But I'm sure they, I don't think you'd be able to go,

172
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
 hmm, based on the way, I'm sure they fixed the houses.

173
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,240
 I don't think a forensic team can go out there and be like, oh, look, it does look like a red orb.

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
 But yeah, so interesting story nonetheless.

175
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,440
 Let's go ahead though and move on to our next story.

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,920
 Now for our next story, we're leaving behind Ethiopia.

177
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,640
 They're like, can you help us repair our stuff with your magical helicopter?

178
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,200
 We're like, what?

179
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,000
 Can't hear you.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
 Helicopter's not even on yet.

181
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,320
 You're like, Jason, you jerk.

182
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,200
 I was like, we can't mess with the timeline hitting the switches.

183
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
 They're like, come on, dude, please, please.

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
 All of our forks are melted.

185
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,480
 We just want to eat some ego waffles and I'm like, what?

186
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,200
 I can't hear you.

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,960
 Then I turn on the helicopter, fly away.

188
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,120
 So now we're going to go nine years into the future, not 2029,

189
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,520
 but nine years into the future from 1970.

190
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,320
 You're all excited.

191
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
 You're like, yeah, I want to know.

192
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,400
 I want to know the future.

193
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,120
 I'm like, nope, we're in the year 1979, three years after I was born.

194
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
 So imagine a three year old Jason pooping his diaper for the rest of this.

195
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
 Was I wasn't wearing diapers when I was three?

196
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
 I don't think I was.

197
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,720
 Three year olds don't wear diapers, right?

198
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
 Doesn't matter.

199
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,320
 Just don't.

200
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
 So don't imagine me in a diaper or don't.

201
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,800
 Yeah, that's gross.

202
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,600
 Don't imagine that.

203
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
 Anyways, helicopter.

204
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
 We're flying over West Patterson, New Jersey.

205
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,560
 Nowadays, it's known as Woodland Park, but back then it was West Patterson, New Jersey.

206
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,600
 So we're in West Patterson, New Jersey, December 16th, 1979.

207
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,520
 There's a boy walking his dog.

208
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,680
 Is there anything more wholesome than that?

209
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
 He's walking on the street with his dog.

210
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,280
 We're pretending to jog.

211
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,720
 We're just standing in place waiting for him to make this discovery.

212
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,400
 We're both wearing Adidas track suits.

213
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,040
 We're the ones that inspire the mob to start wearing them.

214
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,160
 I bet you didn't know that.

215
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,360
 We're wearing our Adidas track suits and we see this boy walking.

216
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,160
 We're jogging in place and he's looking at us.

217
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,960
 He's like, that's weird.

218
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,920
 Why aren't those guys moving?

219
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,280
 It seems like they're pretending to jog.

220
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,480
 But then he turns and he looks on the opposite side of the road and he sees two lumps just laying there.

221
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
 Now it's New Jersey.

222
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,920
 The mob is basically constantly dumping bodies.

223
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,640
 This kid was probably savvy enough to go, I'm not going to go see what's in the lumps.

224
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
 I'm pretty sure I know what's in the lumps.

225
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,040
 This six foot tall and five foot six lump, pretty sure what's in them.

226
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,000
 He goes home.

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
 Parents call the police.

228
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,080
 Cops show up.

229
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,320
 Howard Green, 51 years old.

230
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
 Carol Marin, 33 years old.

231
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
 A couple found dead on the side of the road.

232
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
 Cops throw them in the ambulance.

233
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,320
 Take them to the hospital.

234
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
 Doctor goes, yeah, they're dead.

235
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
 Take them to the morgue.

236
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
 And at the morgue, they begin doing their autopsy.

237
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
 Autopsy doctors like putting on their gloves.

238
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
 Now we're in the autopsy room.

239
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,600
 We're wearing a disguise.

240
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,080
 We're both autopsy doctors and they keep asking us to hand them tools and we're like,

241
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
 they're like, can I have a scalpel?

242
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,520
 We give them like a Phillips screwdriver.

243
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,520
 But it's New Jersey, so they just assume everyone's incompetent over there anyway.

244
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
 So no one even gets that we're imposters.

245
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,680
 We're watching this coroner doing these autopsies, right?

246
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
 And he's cutting these dudes open.

247
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
 And this is what he comes up with.

248
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,400
 He's like, look it.

249
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,720
 We noticed that Howard's head, either the left side of his head was bashed in,

250
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,840
 probably by a bat, some sort of blunt object.

251
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,640
 Pipe maybe?

252
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
 Imagine Donkey Kong coming after this guy.

253
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,520
 Wait, did he use pipes?

254
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,480
 What gruesome world is that?

255
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,080
 Donkey Kong, Mario's trying to save that chick.

256
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,520
 And then Donkey Kong swings a lead pipe and just collapses in school.

257
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
 What get Mario had pipes?

258
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,240
 It doesn't matter.

259
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,800
 Pipes.

260
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
 The coroner licks it at us and he's like, who the hell is Donkey Kong?

261
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,400
 Because it's 1979.

262
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,880
 He doesn't know.

263
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,840
 Guy's head is bashed in the left side of the head.

264
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,520
 And here, look at this.

265
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,040
 He starts poking Carol's wound as well.

266
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,080
 Bashed in left side of the head.

267
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,800
 Now, if you look at this, I'm going to show you this.

268
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,760
 Oh, also listeners, don't be eating anything right now.

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I guess you might have clued in that this is going to be an autopsy segment,

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,520
 but yeah, don't eat anything.

271
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,480
 The coroner goes, now look at, the one of the left side of the head was bashed in so much,

272
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,320
 the eyeball popped out.

273
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
 This is all relevant.

274
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,640
 This isn't just me being gory.

275
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,000
 The eyeball popped out.

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,160
 And then they stabbed the other eyeball out on both bodies.

277
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,960
 So both bodies, left side of the head smashed in, both bodies, eyeballs removed.

278
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,880
 Both of them had their ears sliced, not cut off,

279
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,360
 but sliced like a tip off the top.

280
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
 And here's the weirdest thing.

281
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,160
 Doo, turns on a light.

282
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
 We have the light on the whole time.

283
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,640
 This is a special dramatic light, like a spotlight.

284
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,400
 In each hand, so both Howard and Carol, both of their hands, and all four of their hands,

285
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,920
 there's a clump of hair.

286
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,800
 So if I get murdered, and I'm going to try to pull out somebody's hair, right,

287
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,400
 I'm like, oh no, I'm fighting Jason Statham.

288
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,280
 He has no hair.

289
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,520
 I can grab a clump of hair out of someone other than Jason Statham.

290
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,520
 And then when I die, which is unrealistic, but just for the sake of the narrative,

291
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,040
 when this person actually kills me, and then the cops can go, oh, we have hair,

292
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
 they can test.

293
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
 So that would be your initial thing.

294
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,400
 Oh, but what were they fighting, Sasquatch?

295
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,760
 How did they both get clumps of hair in both hands?

296
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,120
 So people start to go, this must be some sort of ritual.

297
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,240
 Like the bodies were not only killed, they were both killed with a blow to the left side of the head.

298
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,640
 They both had all their eyes cut out.

299
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,200
 They both had their ears sliced.

300
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
 And now in each hand is a clump of hair, a total ritual.

301
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,080
 The clump of hair you would imagine was done post-mortem.

302
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,400
 Because it wouldn't be like, hey, put your hands up.

303
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,760
 I've got this gun to you back your head.

304
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
 Okay, now I'm going to put hair on your hands.

305
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,400
 You'd be like, what?

306
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
 What are you talking about?

307
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,280
 No, no, hold the hair on your hands, and now you're holding it,

308
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,400
 and then they're slicing your ears.

309
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,840
 You're like, ah, can I drop the hair?

310
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
 They're like, no, keep holding the hair.

311
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,680
 I'm assuming the hair was put in post-mortem.

312
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
 And this is always an interesting distinction.

313
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,120
 When the bodies were found, depending on who you get your news from,

314
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,840
 either there was no blood in the body, or almost no blood in the body.

315
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,800
 Huge difference.

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,760
 And that's why like, catamethylation stuff, people always go,

317
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
 the bodies were completely drained of blood.

318
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,840
 And then when you look at the initial reports,

319
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,600
 the reports in the mainstream media, they say almost drained of blood.

320
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
 Huge difference.

321
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
 Massive difference between almost and all.

322
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,240
 What's almost?

323
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,840
 30% of the blood's drained, 80% of the blood's drained,

324
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,320
 90% of the-- what's almost?

325
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
 All means there's not a single drop.

326
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,120
 Not a single drop.

327
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,200
 And when you look at catamethylation stories,

328
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,360
 you go back to the original stories as they were published in the 1980s.

329
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
 Almost all the blood.

330
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,080
 Same thing with 9/11.

331
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,680
 There's a big difference between freefall speed and near-freefall speed.

332
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,640
 One means the buildings were brought down by internal explosions.

333
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,120
 The other one is they were brought down through structural damage.

334
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,640
 Near-freefall speed is not the same as freefall speed.

335
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,760
 They're not even close.

336
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,200
 Almost all the blood is not close to all of the blood.

337
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,320
 Almost all the blood is realistic.

338
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,640
 All of the blood, not a single drop of blood in the body, is fantastical.

339
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,200
 But anyways, so the point is, is that these people didn't have a lot of blood in them.

340
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,760
 And I think we're obviously going to go from that monologue.

341
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,400
 They had almost no blood in them.

342
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,520
 But they did have some blood.

343
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,640
 Because again, what do they do?

344
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,680
 Pull it out each vein and just, you know,

345
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,600
 spit the blood out and then put the vein back in and then pull out an A-order and go

346
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,320
 *burps*.

347
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,600
 There was blood in the body, obviously, but there was less blood than was to be expected.

348
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
 So who were these people?

349
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
 Well, he was a cab driver.

350
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,600
 She was a secretary, not his secretary.

351
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
 They were in a relationship.

352
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
 They were dating.

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,400
 And apparently one of the theories was that Carol was either a hobbyist, freelance,

354
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,280
 investigator of the paranormal, kind of like this show, or like you may be as well.

355
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,280
 Or she was a more of a journalist.

356
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,600
 Or she was just curious about a group known as the OTO, which is a very, very famous church.

357
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,840
 It's the Ordo Templi Orientus.

358
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,560
 It's Alistair Crowley's church.

359
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,640
 And she was asking people around New York about it, walking up to people on the street,

360
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,000
 "Hey, do you know about OTO?"

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,400
 She was taught, I don't know if she was doing that, but she was definitely,

362
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,480
 okay, before I say definitely, this is one of the stories,

363
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,280
 one of the scenarios as she was investigating this church.

364
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,360
 There's this author named Maury Terry.

365
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,880
 Maury Terry.

366
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,240
 He wrote a book I read years ago called "Ultimate Evil."

367
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
 You guys might actually be into it.

368
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,240
 I remember it really scared me actually as a kid.

369
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,360
 It's called "Ultimate Evil," the truth about the cult murders,

370
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,640
 son of Sam and beyond.

371
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,480
 I read it when I was probably like 14 or 15 years old.

372
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,240
 It really goes into the mindset of the 80s and the satanic panic and how cults.

373
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,840
 We were talking about that on yesterday's episode.

374
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,760
 Or two episodes ago, about how cult satanic panic, all this stuff was taken over.

375
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:50,880
 But he basically, his claim is that almost every serial killer is actually an agent of his satanic

376
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,440
 cult.

377
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,960
 The son of Sam specifically was just a member of a larger group of serial killers that were

378
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,800
 all working for the advancement of Satan and his unholy plans.

379
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,920
 And son of Sam went to jail, but the cult is still out there.

380
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,200
 Very, very common, very common conspiracy theory.

381
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,720
 But it's funny because I read it and I remember it really kind of disturbed me.

382
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,320
 And you can buy it now.

383
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,360
 It's like 30 bucks.

384
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,320
 It's a collector's item.

385
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,760
 It was a very, very well, if I remember correctly, well written book.

386
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,520
 A little out of my age range when I was reading it, but I definitely recommend picking it up.

387
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,920
 He says he got a letter from an anonymous source saying, it says this, "Dear Maury Terry,

388
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,760
 please look into this double killing.

389
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,440
 Carol was asking people about the OTO a year prior to the murders.

390
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,360
 I can't accept that the people responsible for this are still walking around free."

391
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,640
 And then it kind of goes on and saying this is why it's anonymous.

392
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
 And that's the thing, walking around free, no one's ever been caught for this crime.

393
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,240
 So that's all fairly typical.

394
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,120
 It's horrible.

395
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,240
 Two people murdered, never being caught, possibly some sort of ritual slain.

396
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,520
 These are things that we see that are common.

397
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
 That's not why I wanted to cover this story.

398
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
 That's not why I wanted to cover the story.

399
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,320
 I wanted to cover the story because the investigation is flat out bizarre.

400
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
 You can, this can be attributed to one of two things.

401
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,560
 This can be attributed to their Satan worshipers in high level places.

402
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,400
 There's like evil Satan, not like Church of Satan, people who just use Satan as a,

403
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
 as like basically a placeholder to kind of troll Christians and it's just a humanist religion.

404
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,840
 I'm not talking about those guys.

405
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,600
 I'm talking about like what you think of when you think of a Satanic cult,

406
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
 an evil human worshipping cult.

407
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
 This story can be played out.

408
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,240
 You can think about it this one or two ways.

409
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,880
 One, that there are Satan worshipers in high levels of power that are stymying this investigation from the get-go.

410
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,360
 Or something darker.

411
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,880
 We'll get to darker in a second.

412
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
 First off, these two bodies are found obviously murdered.

413
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
 There's no question that this is a suicide or a murder suicide.

414
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,960
 This is obviously a case where these people have been murdered.

415
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
 We know they live in Brooklyn.

416
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,800
 Their bodies were found in West Patterson, New Jersey.

417
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,720
 Some time passes.

418
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
 This is reported in the news.

419
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,760
 The police show up.

420
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,400
 They do the bodies.

421
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
 They do the autopsy.

422
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,080
 A little bit of time passes and then the police realize no one's investigating it.

423
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,280
 Because the police in Brooklyn go, "Oh, this is a New Jersey case.

424
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
 West Patterson police will take care of this."

425
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,720
 The West Patterson police go, "Well, yeah, yeah, we found the bodies here,

426
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
 but Brooklyn must be investigating this."

427
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
 We're not, and nobody investigated this for a couple of days.

428
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
 Which is absolutely bizarre.

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,560
 I get it.

430
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,080
 I remember once my car was stolen,

431
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,000
 and I lived right on the boundary of Sacramento Metro Police and the Sheriff's Department.

432
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,440
 And it took me maybe three hours just to get someone to come out,

433
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
 because they kept saying, not our jurisdiction.

434
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,640
 I was right on the line.

435
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,320
 I get that for a stolen car.

436
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
 But two people brutally murdered.

437
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,640
 No question they were murdered.

438
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,280
 And people, they weren't even following it up.

439
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,680
 Assuming the other group was following it up and just going about their business.

440
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,760
 And the prosecutor's office, too, was kind of like,

441
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
 "Oh, I'm sure someone's looking into it."

442
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
 So totally starts to fall through the cracks.

443
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,360
 Now, you can't always assume, a lot of times,

444
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,320
 a lot of times, incompetence is mistaken as evil.

445
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,640
 Right?

446
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,680
 A lot of times, people do stuff that you can go,

447
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,880
 "What? You're being sinister."

448
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,920
 No, they're just stupid.

449
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,520
 Like, that's a stupid decision to just assume someone else is investigating a double murder.

450
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,600
 For all you know, it's going to be a wave of crime.

451
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,800
 It is a satanical, you don't know.

452
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,840
 But eventually, the two police departments realize that the other guy's not investigating it.

453
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
 They better investigate it.

454
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
 They better find out what's going on.

455
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
 So after a couple of days, we have Detective James Devereux.

456
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,560
 And he's in Brooklyn.

457
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,240
 He's investigating this case.

458
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
 Now, the first thing he does is he goes to the apartment.

459
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
 He knows where Howard lives.

460
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,840
 They're living together.

461
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,720
 They were a couple.

462
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,760
 He goes in the apartment,

463
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,040
 opens the door.

464
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,080
 There's satanic paraphernalia all over the place.

465
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,040
 Books.

466
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,080
 Probably Ouija board.

467
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
 I mean, that's a pretty generic term.

468
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,080
 But I'm not going to say that there was like, you know, a decaying lamb skull.

469
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,440
 Like a flayed body.

470
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
 But definitely books.

471
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,320
 Probably some dark candles.

472
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,520
 Maybe Ouija board.

473
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,480
 Things like that.

474
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,040
 Satanic paraphernalia is how it's described.

475
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,480
 And books as well.

476
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
 But he's not really worried about these people's choice in literature.

477
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
 The place is bathed in blood.

478
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
 Blood on the wall is blood on the floor.

479
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,080
 Now, obviously, probably should have gotten here earlier.

480
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
 May have been able to get some prints.

481
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,040
 But no one else had been in the apartment.

482
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,480
 He says there's blood everywhere.

483
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,600
 A definite crime scene.

484
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,440
 Now we know where these people were murdered.

485
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,320
 It's right here.

486
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
 He then begins to interview residents.

487
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,200
 And there was a couple suspects, but none that would lead to the level of brutality.

488
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,720
 One was that the landlord, the place was rent controlled,

489
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,800
 and the landlord wanted more money for the rent,

490
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,240
 but he couldn't charge more rent.

491
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,920
 So he may have killed a couple.

492
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,400
 That and people have always been like, that's,

493
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,160
 that may be the case, but that's a pretty flimsy,

494
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,240
 sure, I want an extra $500 show.

495
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,920
 I'm going to ritulously murder.

496
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,200
 And where do you get the hair?

497
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
 Like, you know what I mean?

498
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,640
 Like, it definitely seemed like it was an organized cult hit.

499
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,560
 The other one was one of the neighbors said that he used to drain the blood from mice as a hobby.

500
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,160
 He did it to impress his girlfriend.

501
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,400
 And he was a suspect for a while because, you know, the killing of mice.

502
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,640
 But his alibi was he was on a quote hitchhiking holiday.

503
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,080
 He wasn't even in town, which tip to you if you are a killer looking for an alibi,

504
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,800
 being a hitchhiker is a terrible alibi.

505
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,440
 But he had been tracked down.

506
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,800
 This neighbor had got tracked down 20 years later by the media and said,

507
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,240
 hey, because every show often this anniversary comes up and some reporter goes,

508
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,240
 what this case has never been solved and they try to track these people down.

509
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
 And he goes, I wasn't there.

510
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
 I was on a hitchhiking holiday.

511
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,800
 I was out of town.

512
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,560
 I was never arrested for it.

513
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,760
 I definitely didn't do it.

514
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,920
 I did drain the blood from mice, but I didn't.

515
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,680
 There's a huge difference between that.

516
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,040
 What if the hair in their hands were mice hair?

517
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,480
 But I don't know.

518
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,080
 That would be like just tiny fibers.

519
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,720
 You wouldn't even know.

520
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,120
 He's cleared the landlords cleared the Brooklyn like cold case division.

521
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
 They're not investigating this either.

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
 So that's weird.

523
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
 So then you go, hmm, maybe it's like it is like this satanic group that's being like,

524
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,520
 don't investigate this.

525
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,880
 Someone else is investigating this.

526
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,960
 Just let it drop last drop and every show often a journalist pops up or a podcast pops

527
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,680
 up that covers it.

528
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,240
 But again, that's not even the weirdest thing because the idea of someone controlling the

529
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,800
 strings behind it, as much as a poo poo on something as high level as the Illuminati,

530
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,480
 I think that's definitely possible at a city or county level, maybe state worldwide.

531
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
 No, it's absolutely ridiculous.

532
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,680
 There's just too many factors and too many different governments and too many thought

533
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:48,640
 processes going on, but a city level Illuminati 100% believable county level Illuminati,

534
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,600
 you betcha.

535
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
 The world, it's a little bit more difficult, but now we're going to go.

536
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,600
 We have that was all the Brooklyn investigation.

537
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 The West Patterson Police Department though, his name was Joseph Lambert.

538
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,480
 He ends up being interviewed years later by journalists who are talking about this story

539
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,360
 still.

540
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,160
 And Joseph Lambert goes, he's goes, oh yeah, yeah, I remember that horrible story.

541
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,680
 What do you want to know about him?

542
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,560
 The journalist is kind of talking about it saying, oh yeah, you know,

543
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,560
 he said that he went into the apartment and then he interviewed all these people in the house and

544
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,160
 and Detective Joseph Lambert goes, no.

545
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,400
 I went to that apartment.

546
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,160
 I went to that apartment.

547
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,920
 I don't know if I went to the apartment shortly before or shortly after,

548
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,400
 but in the course of the yes, we did drop the ball on it.

549
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,680
 We thought they were taking care of it.

550
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,280
 But once I realized that no one was investigating it, I went to the apartment and that apartment was

551
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,320
 spotless.

552
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
 I wasn't a drop of blood on the place.

553
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,320
 There are no books, no satanic books, nothing like that.

554
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,800
 I walked down the apartment, processed it.

555
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,040
 They didn't look like anyone was murdered there.

556
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,880
 Didn't look suspicious at all.

557
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
 I don't think they were murdered there.

558
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
 I think they were probably murdered in other location.

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,720
 Could be in ritualistic, could have been mob, could have been a whole bunch of stuff.

560
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
 But yeah, the case has gone cold.

561
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,040
 We never caught the people.

562
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
 Nothing like it's ever happened again.

563
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,880
 It's a tragedy, but that dude is not accurate.

564
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,400
 That didn't happen.

565
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
 So you go, Jason, isn't that proof

566
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,280
 that there was a high level thing like this intrepid Brooklyn police officer kicks down a door,

567
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,480
 sees his blood, seals all this stuff, reports it to a superior.

568
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,160
 It gets up to the satanic cult and they're ringing their hands going like, oh no,

569
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,560
 all secret hideouts have been found and they send down a clean crew and they

570
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,240
 remove select books from the library and clean every single drop of blood up and do all of that

571
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,920
 before another cop just happens to stumble in there or anyone else.

572
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,440
 And the apartment complex is notices a bunch of people coming in and out with bloody

573
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
 boxes full of books.

574
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,280
 I'm going to have an alternate solution, a darker reason behind this.

575
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,280
 One, I don't think the OTO had anything to do with it because they've been investigated.

576
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,400
 I can guarantee you a thousand people are looking into them right now.

577
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,080
 They are normie tier conspiracy level stuff.

578
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,400
 OTO, people are always looking into them.

579
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,120
 So if you, if they wanted to spend their time taking out everyone who ever investigated the OTO,

580
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,440
 they would have to buy stock in bullet companies and they would make a fortune because you'd have

581
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,000
 to do it all the time.

582
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,680
 So I don't think they had anything to do with them.

583
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,120
 Could be an offshoot, I don't know.

584
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,720
 But I think that these people were ritualistically murdered.

585
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
 I do think these people were murdered in a ritualistic way, absolutely.

586
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,680
 But here's my theory.

587
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,320
 They were killed and it was, a ritual was performed while they were being killed.

588
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:37,280
 And what that ritual did was make this murder unsolvable because not only did it basically

589
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,120
 change, assuming both of these detectives are telling the truth.

590
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,480
 It basically shifted a room, the reality of a room, where one person can walk in and it is

591
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,400
 full of blood and satanic paraphernalia and someone else can walk into that room

592
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
 and it's the exact opposite.

593
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
 Not full of blood and no satanic paraphernalia.

594
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,520
 It creates some sort of, the ritual creates some sort of psychic wave

595
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,640
 that makes everyone go, "Ah, someone else is handling it.

596
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,840
 Someone else is handling it.

597
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,800
 Someone else is handling it."

598
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,480
 And to this day, the Brooklyn Cold Case Division just doesn't even investigate it.

599
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,080
 Ah, it's nothing.

600
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
 It's definitely something.

601
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,520
 Two people brutally murdered and never been solved.

602
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,320
 And to this day, people aren't looking into it.

603
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,280
 The only people who are looking into it is the occasional journalist.

604
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,000
 Imagine if you had that ability.

605
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,040
 Imagine if you had the ability to not only kill people in such a way,

606
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,400
 perform a ritual during the murder, that it would make it impossible for you to be caught

607
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
 for that crime, to even be suspected.

608
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,440
 Whenever someone kind of looks into it, they just kind of forget.

609
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,920
 People of importance, at least.

610
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,720
 You see, the journalists would be allowed to remember,

611
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,560
 podcasters would be allowed to remember, so we could keep talking about the story.

612
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,040
 Maybe this is part of the ritual as well.

613
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,920
 But I just find it very interesting, the idea that two people can walk into a room.

614
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,720
 Even if it's a couple days apart, you shouldn't have that radical of a difference.

615
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,920
 Without some notable activity taking place.

616
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,480
 An apartment full of blood, and then an apartment with no blood in it.

617
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,800
 That just doesn't pass the smell test.

618
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,160
 One of them may be lying.

619
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,640
 One of the detectives may be part of this conspiracy.

620
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,240
 Again, I don't think so.

621
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
 I think the most odd thing about the story is this.

622
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
 We know these people were murdered.

623
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,680
 That's a fact.

624
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,480
 They appear to have been murdered in a ritualistic way.

625
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
 I don't really think you could argue that.

626
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,080
 The hair in each hand, each wounds are the same.

627
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,840
 The slicing, the 30 stab wounds.

628
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,720
 I don't think I mentioned that.

629
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,360
 The each body was stabbed 30 times after having their head smashed in.

630
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,120
 Very, very ritualistic.

631
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,080
 And I think the ritual, they were being killed for a specific reason.

632
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,600
 Maybe they were getting too close to investigating an offshoot of the OTO.

633
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,400
 Maybe they had stumbled across some other colt.

634
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,480
 Maybe their paranormal research took them to a very, very dangerous place.

635
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,320
 So they were murdered.

636
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,320
 But I think the ritual of the murder wasn't like the mob saying cut out their tongue so

637
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,000
 they said too much type of thing.

638
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,920
 Put on our conspiracy caps for a second here.

639
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,120
 Our fantasy hats.

640
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,000
 Two amateur investigators looking for the truth.

641
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,160
 Stumble across a colt.

642
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,160
 In the 1970s, there were colts everywhere.

643
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,160
 But this colt actually knew a little bit of the truth.

644
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,200
 A little bit of the secrets of the dark magic.

645
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,680
 The secrets that so many other colts looked for.

646
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,320
 They realized the perfect way to take out their enemies.

647
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,680
 If they are killed performing this ritual, they could get away with murder.

648
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,320
 Slice the ears.

649
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
 Goug the eyes out.

650
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,920
 Bash in the left side of the head.

651
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,640
 This ritual made it so law enforcement investigators were searching

652
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,440
 through a cloud.

653
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,320
 Oh, someone else is looking into it.

654
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,680
 Someone else will take care of it.

655
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,200
 What? Wait, no one's doing that?

656
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,760
 That's weird.

657
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,440
 Why did I assume?

658
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,280
 Oh, yeah, no, no, I'll take care of it, Sergeant.

659
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,000
 I just assumed someone else was taking care of it.

660
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,360
 And you could have evidence literally disappear,

661
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,680
 depending on when you entered a room.

662
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,040
 Confusion.

663
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,240
 Chaos.

664
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,160
 Mystery.

665
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,480
 A ritual that was successful because the killers were never caught.

666
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:32,640
 And in this world where dark magic is a reality, and a killer or group of killers can take two lives

667
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,400
 and make it so confusing for the investigators that they just give up

668
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,120
 who's to say that killer isn't still operating out there, but has now perfected it.

669
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,280
 To the point that the ritual can be done so precisely that they can take a human life

670
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,560
 and within a day or two, people won't even remember the victim existed.

671
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,120
 Someone may have stumbled across one of the dark secrets of the universe

672
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,720
 and become a practitioner of wicked magic.

673
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,040
 Highly unlikely.

674
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,640
 But what if our skepticism is only because the rituals work?
