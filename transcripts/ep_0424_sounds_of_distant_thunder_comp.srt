00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 A bizarre incident happening off the coast of Venezuela starts a world of conspiracy theories

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,360
 involving Antarctica and empty cruise ships.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,160
 And then we take a look at the story of a man who one night was riding his bicycle home.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,800
 And he sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at him from the darkness.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,240
 The next thing he knows, he's being forced onto a craft of alien origin today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,920
 [Music]

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,720
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day. I hope you guys had an

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,680
 awesome weekend. I have had an amazing weekend. First off, I want to give a shout out to our

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,840
 newest Patreon, Ori. Ori, everyone. Of course, I can barely pronounce the name. And luckily he

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,960
 goes, "It's okay if you mispronounce it." Ori really appreciates you supporting the Patreon. Really,

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,880
 really helps out a lot. Ori actually has a really cool episode coming up soon. He sent me a theory

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,360
 that he'd been working on. Sounds pretty cool. And I've been going through that. We'll be covering

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,320
 that later. Also, if you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that's all right as well.

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,480
 Just help get the word out about the show. Spread the word online, among your friends,

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,040
 whatever. However you can do it, that helps out a lot as well. Second piece of news,

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
 this is why you always should watch the livestream, guys. This is why you should be there for live

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,320
 television. Because Friday night, we did the movie night, and you won't believe what happened.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,480
 I'm halfway through it. No, I'm probably 10 minutes into it, 15 minutes into it. Just get done doing

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:48,080
 the first movie, Housewife, and then live. I totally choke because I realize I have nothing else to

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:56,080
 say about any of the other four movies. At all. So, the movie club's over basically. And the thing

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,040
 is, is like, listen dude, the first week I think we lucked out, because we watched four really good

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,880
 movies, and then Mandy was like, still pretty decent. I could talk about it. This one, I was

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,720
 picking movies and watching them, and even as I was watching them, I was like, I don't really have

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,520
 anything to say about this movie. It's just kind of a basic movie. Even the baby was just, it was

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,600
 weird, but it's not something I could really talk about. Then I realized, I don't even know how to

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,880
 run a movie club. I've never even been a member of a movie club or book club. I was just kind of

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,120
 picking movies at random when we were watching them together, but at the end of the day, I was

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,000
 like, I don't have anything to say about this stuff. And so, about 15 minutes in, I'm like, uh,

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
 oh, and also it took a nightquill before it all started, because I had a cough, so that didn't

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,800
 help. Uh, this movie was like, colorful, and had like good guys and bad guys and, uh, themes.

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,080
 And I'm like, kind of just looking at the clock, being like, uh-oh. Like, if I'm running out of

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,560
 stuff to say now, 15 minutes in, then I got four more movies to talk about. This is going to be

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,360
 rough. And it was pretty rough. To be honest, I probably won't upload it to the podcast. It cost

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,520
 me extra money. Just doing that last movie club cost me extra money to upload that to the podcast,

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,600
 but this one's still available on YouTube. If you want to see me in a snazzy Hawaiian shirt,

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,400
 in a slick haircut, check it out. Otherwise, you're not missing anything. I really appreciate the

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,800
 people who did show up to watch the livestream. Really, really appreciate that. But going forward,

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
 I don't think we're, we'll still do livestreams, but we're not going to do the movie club. It just,

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,240
 it just didn't work out. You know, you got to try stuff out, and maybe if we had picked better

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,280
 movies the second week, we would have done a third week, but the movies this week,

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,360
 there was just really nothing to say. So, having said all that about having nothing to say about

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,480
 other things, let's move on to something I do have something to say about, our first topic. This

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,880
 story is really weird, and it's funny because I read about it the other day, and I go, "Whoa,

45
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,640
 there's something to this." Okay, everyone, let's go ahead and get started with the first story.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,080
 Actually, took a shower. I recorded that first fart. Went and took a shower. I feel so good.

47
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,400
 My friend Sabine brought me Easter presents, dude. I got some candies. I can't eat them because

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,680
 I'm on keto. I'm the only person who gets candy and goes, "Huh, candy?" Because I can't eat it,

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
 but she brought me some pickles. What? I can eat that, dude. Let's go ahead and get started with the

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,440
 episode. Okay, I'm freshly showered, and let's go. I'm also wearing my gold finger hat, my gold

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,960
 finger hat autographed by all the members of Goldfinger. I'm going to have something in the

52
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,880
 show notes. Go to their Facebook page. They're doing live performances. They're all at their

53
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,400
 own houses, though. It's pretty cool if you're a Goldfinger fan, and if you're not a Goldfinger fan,

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,920
 why aren't you a Goldfinger fan? Ori, let's start off in the Dead Rabbit Robo. You know what? No,

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:39,840
 Ori. Let's start off in the Dead Rabbit Dreadnought. Camera angle of quick cut. You're like, "Jason,

56
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,800
 you have to describe what the cameras are showing before you describe the edits. It's a giant boat.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,240
 You guys play Age of Empires, you know? Or if you know about history, it's those giant, like a

58
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,440
 tree mirror. Is that what they're called? It's this giant boat. And as all those oars and the oars

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,800
 are powered, like we're not rowing the oars. We're too cool. People of lame podcasts,

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
 lame other lame podcast, they're rowing us and we're on the deck. We are looking out and it's

61
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,720
 like super cool. All these edits and stuff like that. The Dead Rabbit Dreadnought. It's this massive

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,560
 ship cutting through the waves. Ori, you're at the helm. You're steering it. Let's head off to the

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,120
 waters surrounding Venezuela. This story is actually interesting because it popped up and then

64
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,200
 disappeared. There's a website called the Maritime Executive. And they really covered the story in

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,880
 depth. And a lot of this information I got from an article written by Mia Bennett. So really,

66
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,200
 really appreciate the legwork you put in on this, Mia. It's an interesting story. It seems to be

67
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,840
 fairly short. Some of you guys may have heard of this. On March 30th, what happened? It's kind of a

68
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,400
 wacky naval news story. And even Mia was like, "Yeah, people kind of dismiss this as just some weird

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,920
 story, but there's a lot of stuff going on." The RCGS Resolute. This cruise ship is floating according

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,160
 to them in international waters. According to the Venezuelan government within Venezuelan territory.

71
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,760
 It's a German-owned ship flying a Portugal flag. In Portugal and Venezuela, no bueno. They don't

72
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,400
 like each other. You like that? A little bit of Spanish, bro. And I pronounced it correctly. So

73
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,960
 what happened was on March 30th, this Coast Guard ship from Venezuela comes up to the Resolute.

74
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,960
 Now, the Resolute had said the day before, "Listen, guys, we're in international waters

75
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,200
 and we're quote not under command," which is a maritime code, meaning we don't have the ability

76
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,280
 to maneuver. We're dead in the water, so we could float in any direction. Stay away from us.

77
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,560
 Stay away from us. But on March 30th, when the Venezuelan Coast Guard shows up,

78
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,120
 they say, "Oh no, these guys are clearly within our territorial waters." The Resolute is saying,

79
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
 "We're making repairs." The Coast Guard goes, "You have to get your boat out of here. You're not

80
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,600
 allowed to be in here." Portugal, Venezuela are not friends right now. There's all these

81
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,160
 financial disputes and everything going on. The Resolute says, "We got to call in our boss before

82
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,640
 we leave." The Coast Guard gives them a little bit of time, but then decides, "No, no, no, no, no,

83
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,520
 so they open fire on the cruise ship." Now, they're not trying to shoot the crewman. The cruise ship

84
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,240
 has about 32 people on it. There's no passengers. It's just crew. The Coast Guard vessel has 44

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,280
 sailors on it, so it's not a tiny little dinghy boat. Now, our giant dreadnought is just kind of

86
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,000
 floating off in the distance, cutting waves, still coolly looking edited, all these camera

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,200
 shots, all these miserable podcasters, rowing in the bottom. I wish I listened to Dead Rabbit more

88
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,680
 often, but they don't, so that's why they're down there rowing. Dead Rabbit dreadnought still

89
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
 cut water out there. Back to the real story, back to what's going on. The Coast Guard starts shooting

90
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,200
 out the cruise ship. When that doesn't work, they go, "Well, if you can't maneuver the boat,

91
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,400
 we're going to crash into your boat to make you point out going out into international waters."

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,920
 Then you don't have to maneuver, bro. Just hit the gas pedal. So they do that. The Coast Guard ship

93
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:02,400
 pokes like, it doesn't poke. It rams the cruise ship at the bow to move it. I think it's the bow,

94
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,880
 right? The front of the ship pushes it, pushes it, pushes it, but it's not really working because,

95
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,040
 one, it's a cruise ship versus a boat that's not built to, you know, be a tugboat or a ram.

96
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:22,560
 Two, the Resolute, it was built to do tours around Antarctica. So it had an ice breaking ability,

97
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,600
 had a heavily reinforced bow, bow, heavily reinforced front of the boat. So after about

98
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,160
 three or four pushes, the Coast Guard ship starts to take on water. It starts to sink. Now maritime,

99
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,200
 I don't know if it's maritime law, but definitely maritime tradition is, if a boat is sinking,

100
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,560
 no matter their port of call, every boat must come to try to rescue them. That's why you'll have

101
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,400
 boat sinking, like a Nazi ship gets sunk by a U.S. sub and then the U.S. sub will surface and rescue

102
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,120
 who they can. It didn't happen all the time in war, but in peacetime, it's definitely supposed to

103
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,000
 happen. If you have a Russian ship that starts to sink, you can't have America be like, "Nah,

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,360
 nah, nah, nah, nah," and everyone's like, "No, like you go to rescue them." It's maritime code. If not

105
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,400
 law, I don't know if it's actually, you can be troubled for it. According to the Venezuelan Navy,

106
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,600
 as the ship is taking on water and they're like, "We're sorry for shooting you, we're sorry for

107
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,560
 shooting you," the ship starts sinking, the cruise ship, the Resolute shuts off their emergency

108
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:29,200
 beacon and slowly, now has the ability, slowly sails away into the night. So President Maduro

109
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,760
 of Venezuela called it an act of terrorism. He's trying to get Portugal to be accountable for this.

110
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
 He's trying to get the cruise line to be accountable for this. Another ship did show up to rescue the

111
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,240
 44 sailors, so no lives were lost on either side. So right there, that's an interesting story, but

112
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,320
 Mia Bennett points out some odd things that are going on. One, the Resolute was one of three ships

113
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,480
 that did this tour around Antarctica, two or no longer in service. Financial problems.

114
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,680
 Add two different ports. When the Resolute pulled into port, it was arrested, which is a term,

115
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,800
 it doesn't mean like the boat, "Bad boys, bad boys, what you want?" It wasn't like taken down

116
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,080
 and got booked, but that means that it was kept there and COPS authorities stormed the ship and

117
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,480
 says, "This ship can't leave until you pay your debts." That happened in Canada, it also happened

118
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,080
 down in South America as well. Tickets on this thing was $20,000 to go on a tour around the

119
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,480
 coast of Antarctica. This last journey of this Resolute ship, they ran out of fuel and they

120
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,560
 dumped all their passengers off in Buenos Aires and said, "Bye, see you guys later, we're leaving,

121
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,240
 onk, onk, sorry, no refunds, what are you saying, you want your money back? No, it's too late,

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,600
 we've sailed too far away, we can't hear you anymore." So people were suing this company,

123
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,360
 you had creditors after this company, the boat kept getting impounded, company declares bankruptcy.

124
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,120
 So why is it floating off the coast of Venezuela, giving a command to "Don't come near us" and

125
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,920
 then is later seen within Venezuela territory? Well, the conspiracy theory in Venezuela, and this

126
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,240
 is interesting because all the little points that don't really make sense, there's a conspiracy

127
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,320
 theory going among the population of Venezuela that this boat was full of mercenaries coming to

128
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,400
 overthrow the president of Venezuela. Now obviously there's no proof of that, but it does allow people

129
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,360
 to kind of connect the dots. One, you have a boat outside of their territory that gives a command,

130
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,040
 "Don't come near us." You have a cruise ship that's bankrupt, but it would be the perfect disguise to

131
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,160
 smuggle people into the country. Cruise ship just shows up, bunch of people disembark, wearing Hawaiian

132
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,720
 shirts, straw hats, carrying M60s, you know, just like a normal day, a normal day, everyone's like

133
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,840
 strapped up. Basically the expendables for summer break. It would just, you could just walk into the

134
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,120
 country. That's also the reason why people think they didn't help the sailors, because even though

135
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
 they were shooting at them, there wasn't a war going on, they shut off their emergency beacon

136
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,240
 and then are able to sail away. Right now they're in Cacaco, Caraco, Caraco, it's a Denmark owned or

137
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,760
 Denmark-governed little island in the, there, right there. I'm pointing right at it on a map, dude.

138
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,360
 You guys totally should see it. My fingers are right there. So they were able to leave. People said

139
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,480
 that's the reason why the Coast Guard wasn't rescued by them, was because there was a bunch of soldiers

140
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,040
 on the boat. Nobody knows. That's the thing about conspiracy theories. They're really easy to make

141
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,120
 up, really hard to prove or disprove. Now it could be a coincidence that, you know, the boat's,

142
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,480
 you know, flies the Portugal flag and they do stall out in the territory of their enemy. It's

143
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,760
 definitely, it's possible, right? But that's a conspiracy theory currently going around Venezuela.

144
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,560
 We will know if eventually the president of Venezuela does get overthrown by a bunch of people

145
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,440
 dressed as tourists, drinking Mai Thais, carrying AK-47s in one hands and a little gift bag in the

146
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,920
 other. Let's go ahead and move on to, actually I didn't plan on this story, but I find this story

147
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,160
 interesting. I've talked about this for a while because I do a lot of stuff. I really like observing

148
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,280
 subcultures. Long time listeners of the show have heard me talk about that a lot. I've recently

149
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,000
 discovered one of the most bizarre, it's a subculture I've always been aware of, but it's

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,840
 not something I knew was so readily talked about. We're leaving behind the dead rabbit Dreadnaught.

151
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,720
 Ori, take us up in the Carbentercopter. We're flying out to any town USA. Any town USA. So we're

152
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,680
 going to Reddit for this story. And this story we're going to meet a man who one day is gardening

153
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,960
 in his yard. This is a story of paranormal activity is how he describes it, paranormal

154
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,280
 activity. He's gardening in his yard and he gets a notification on the phone. Like what?

155
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:58,240
 Pulls his phone out, looks at it. It says Facebook has the leadager photo due to community guidelines

156
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,080
 and it has a little picture of the photo. It's a picture of his genitals. Now he freaks out because

157
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,400
 he didn't post this photo. He knows 100% he didn't post this photo. He took the photo and he sent it

158
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,880
 to a girl he was dating. But he didn't post it on Facebook. What? That's insane. He would never do

159
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,920
 that. Never do that. And he's sweating and he's thinking that he goes I have all my business

160
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
 clients on Facebook, I have all my friends, members of my church are on Facebook. Did someone see this

161
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,720
 and report it or was it immediately flagged and he's panicking? And then he realizes that it was

162
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,560
 immediately flagged. So it didn't go through. And this is where he ends his Reddit post. This just

163
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,200
 seems so weird because there's many events like this but not as bad that have been happening for

164
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,880
 the past two days. Is anyone else experiencing stuff like this? He's asking the Reddit community in

165
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,760
 this thread. And then he has a too long didn't read. Here's his too long didn't read. This is how he

166
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,000
 ends off the Reddit post. Coming down off meth and things keep happening that are unexplainable.

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,120
 There is a community. Okay and so this is weird, right? So this dude is basically he's high on meth

168
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,360
 and a dick pic appears on his Facebook feed which he didn't do. He thinks that a paranormal activity

169
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,640
 did this, right? Also in this post he goes you want to know what else is weird guy fellow meth

170
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,880
 users? You want to know what else is weird? I posted this on my Reddit. Took a nap, woke up.

171
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,960
 The post was gone. This is paranormal activity. I found his original post. I go oh I want to see

172
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,960
 what else this guy posted. He posted the same thing like two hours earlier. A little more detail

173
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,840
 but the same story. There is a Reddit community called RMeth. A subreddit I guess is the term meth.

174
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,480
 It's all just meth. I didn't know this existed. I didn't know this stuff was allowed. I mean

175
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,520
 that might sound super naive but I thought Reddit was more policed than that because I'm always

176
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,600
 hearing about them shutting down subreddits. But there's one where people just it's so gross dude.

177
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,000
 Like I'll be scrolling through it and I can I feel like it damages my soul just going to

178
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,280
 the subreddit because I can smell them. It's so gross like you go to it and I'm scrolling through

179
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:24,800
 and I can almost smell the BO and that that chemical that formaldehyde smell. It's so gross.

180
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,160
 And there's multiple photos of just like dude check out my meth pipe. Check out the I'm learning

181
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,960
 all this stuff. Crackback. Sounds like a terrible thing, right? Someone goes what happened to you?

182
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,520
 Oh I got cracked back. You would think oh no do I need to take your hospital? Apparently that's

183
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:46,160
 something they like where your your crack or your it's crank it's meth but it's supposed to shatter

184
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,800
 like glass or something like that. Super gross. And I've also been going to this other one because

185
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,360
 what happened was Mike I've looked at them a while back. I couldn't believe they existed. This

186
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,120
 subreddit existed. And then I thought I wonder how drug and alcohol abusers are dealing with this

187
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,280
 because I see articles about people going relapsing because you know there's their AA groups are gone.

188
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,400
 Meth community is doing fine. I totally went on to the subreddit for meth. They're not having

189
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,280
 problem with it at all. They're like oh yeah dude I got enough Tina for this weekend blah blah blah

190
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,120
 blah. Opiates. There's a subreddit for opiates. They're not having a really good time. And I guess

191
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,200
 it kind of makes sense because I've had friends that have done meth and they're absolutely miserable

192
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,720
 to be around. They're completely insufferable. But when they don't have meth they just slow down

193
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,000
 and are pretty depressed. When someone doesn't have heroin they're they basically have the

194
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,800
 coronavirus. And that was one thing I saw a lot on the opiates board where people were like

195
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:54,720
 am I going through withdrawal or should I go to a ICU? Because your bones hurt. You've got a fever.

196
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,120
 You're sweating. Your legs are shaking. Horrible nausea. Sometimes you're throwing up. So that's

197
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,480
 a lot. At opiates they're like my heroin dealer. He can't get anything. Nothing's coming. Some people

198
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,440
 are like oh I got my dark web supply and stuff like that. But again some people might be trolling.

199
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,520
 You can never tell. But the meth users seem to be taking all this in stride. The heroin users are

200
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,080
 having a really hard time with this. And then there's another one. There's AA on Reddit which is

201
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,920
 awesome that you can have the support. There's another subreddit called crippling alcoholism

202
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,240
 where they celebrate drinking. And those people are like they're doing fine too because they're

203
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,400
 like I don't have to work. Or I'm working at home and I'm just drinking all day and I'm like oh my

204
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,360
 god. How do these subreddits stay up? I mean I'm not a huge fan of censorship. But if you're

205
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,400
 going to be shutting down these other subreddits for various reasons then I think people saying

206
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,400
 hateful stuff versus how to best indulge in your meth habit. Like someone calling someone else a

207
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,800
 name or calling someone some race a name or some gender a name. Whatever. Telling people that these

208
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,360
 are the multiple these are the best ways to end. So many of the posts on opiates are like

209
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,240
 I might snort my heroin but I'll never inject it. And other people are like yeah you will.

210
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,560
 Yeah you will. And I'm like why is this such a bizarre subculture. But the meth yeah and the

211
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,960
 thing is too the meth originally I was subscribed to the Reddit subreddit meth. I had a hard time

212
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,160
 telling like I there would be like shadowmen are chasing me and I'd be like is that from a paranormal

213
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,320
 subreddit I'm following or the meth oh it's the meth subreddit. Like so many of it is shadowmans

214
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,080
 and phantom camera pictures. There's such a huge connection between the meth and fetamine community

215
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,480
 and the paranormal community that it kind of raises a bit of an alarm really. But yeah I stopped

216
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,000
 subscribing to subreddit. I did go back to subreddit. I did go back to the meth one recently

217
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,320
 and the opiates and I was thinking what other drug users would be absolutely miserable now.

218
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,280
 But it's funny there's no subreddit I could find for crack. Because the last thing when you're on

219
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,000
 crack I don't think you own a phone. Like when you are so into crack you're on there subreddit.

220
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,960
 I don't think you have access to the internet. I think you've sold the internet for crack you

221
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,160
 have nothing. But to my friends out there who do have substance abuse issues I really hope you

222
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,000
 guys are getting through this very well. It's not I hope you guys want are being really good on your

223
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,480
 recovery. It's a super stressful time. Super stressful time but now's not the time to go back.

224
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,400
 Because a lot of drugs and alcohol and stuff like that when you go through withdrawal or if you

225
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,960
 mess up that you will have symptoms similar to the coronavirus and then you just issued a whole

226
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,600
 thing. So guys stay strong during this whole time period. You know I know that it's probably rough

227
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,160
 if you are dealing with those issues. But we are all here for you. All of the dead rabbit listeners

228
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,920
 are here for you. If you guys are struggling with that just keep going. We're going to get through

229
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,160
 this together. For those of you who don't have the substance abuse issues who have issues with like

230
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,360
 say food or just laziness or despair or depression we're all going to get through this. We're all

231
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,880
 going to get through this. And it's not paranormal if your genital pics get put on Facebook. You

232
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,400
 probably did it in a meth binge reddit guy. But I hope that you get help too. I hope that you find

233
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,800
 the help you need. I'm not telling the story to mock you. I'm telling the story to just kind of get

234
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,360
 it out there. That one there does seem to be a big connection between the meth and meth community

235
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,000
 and the paranormal community. I'll have to really kind of think about that and see what that means.

236
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,080
 But two I don't really think it's something that should be celebrated. I find it bizarre. This might

237
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,320
 sound a little preachy. I just find it bizarre that these subreddits are tolerated on Reddit.

238
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,720
 But they are. And if you want to take a deeper dive into the world of drugs without doing them

239
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,160
 you want to take a look into those subcultures. You can find them on Reddit but just be aware

240
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:02,560
 the meth somehow the meth reddit stinks like it literally stinks. I don't know how it works

241
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,840
 but you can smell it. Let's move on to our next story. That technically wasn't planned. I had

242
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,440
 notes on it but I was going to save that for a later episode. Ori, let's go ahead and fire up

243
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,320
 that carpenter one last time. We are leaving behind any town USA. We're headed out to Mexico.

244
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:27,840
 Now we're going back to the year 1986. It's May 30th and I got this story from thinkaboutitdocs.com.

245
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,000
 It's easily becoming one of my favorite websites. You also got to check out Vertigo22's website.

246
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,760
 I'll put that website in the show notes as well. Very, very well written stuff about all these

247
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,320
 conspiracies. Check his stuff out as well. I'm going to go back there to look for some more stuff.

248
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,440
 But let's go ahead and fly on down to Mexico right now. And this was on thinkaboutitdocs.com.

249
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,720
 The source they got it from was a group called or magazine called OVNI Contacto or Contacto OVNI.

250
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,000
 It's a Mexican UFO group. So we're headed down to Mexico. The story takes place in 1986. It's May

251
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 30th. We're going to hop on our bicycles now. We're little BMX bandits. We're doing tricks.

252
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Spinning the handlebars. I hate bicycles. I almost said the F word there. I've had so many bicycle

253
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,240
 accidents in my life. Like really bad ones. I could do a whole episode just about bicycle accidents.

254
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:25,040
 I'm not, but I hate bikes. Anyways, that being said, we're riding. I'm walking. I don't like

255
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,000
 skateboards either. I'm flying. I'm hovering a foot off the ground. I'm on a hoverboard.

256
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,800
 You're on a bicycle. And we're going down the street. And also coming down the street

257
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,000
 is Carlos. He's a young dude who's leaving his parents' house and he's headed home.

258
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,880
 Now it doesn't say how old he is, but I would imagine if he's headed to his house early 20s.

259
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,160
 If he's still riding a bicycle early 20s. He figures, I could take the main road. There's

260
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,040
 a lot of traffic. This is in Colonia, Anno de Juarez, Mexico. So I think that's what the colony

261
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,040
 of Juarez, so Juarez, Mexico. Anyways, he's in this town. He's riding his bicycle down the street

262
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:07,360
 and he doesn't want to really deal with traffic. So he's taking a side street, kind of a country road

263
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,920
 that takes him home to the place where he belongs. And while he's riding down that lonely road,

264
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,480
 he sees in front of him luminous eyes, large luminous eyes as he describes them.

265
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,720
 It's 8 30 p.m. So he has a little light on his bicycle. And it takes him a second to think,

266
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,360
 is my light? First off, oh my God, there's giant eyes in front of me, but they're about 500 meters

267
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,160
 away. So what is that in feet? Like, I don't know, 700 feet, something like that? I have no idea.

268
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,800
 I'm not going to bother looking it up. It's a long way away. Okay. So he's looking at these

269
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,040
 eyeballs and he's thinking, is it my light flashing on something that's lighting up these eyes?

270
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,800
 But as he gets closer to the object or whatever it is, the bicycle light fates.

271
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,160
 This is very common. We see this in UFO stories a lot of times the cars die. They can't be powered

272
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,280
 anymore. Car engine dies, headlights go off, radio goes off, everything like that. But he's on a

273
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,760
 bicycle. This is an interesting thing. Bicycles aren't powered electronically if you didn't know.

274
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,480
 I'm a bicycle expert myself as much as I despise their existence. They're powered by man. So

275
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,040
 the light goes out, but he's still pedaling. Again, classic UFO lore is the car dies.

276
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,080
 So this is an interesting, this is what makes this story believable. This is a detail that I don't

277
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,920
 think someone would make up on the fly. The story still needs the vehicle to stop, correct? Because

278
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,920
 that's what happens in UFO stories. From Betty and Barney Hill all the way to very, very recent

279
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,480
 UFO stories. Cars driving down the lonely road dies. He's on a bike. What happens in this story is

280
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:57,920
 his legs start to get heavy. He can barely move them. The bike's just going.

281
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,440
 Comes to a stop because he can't pedal it. That's an interesting thing. That's an interesting detail.

282
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,720
 And all these stories, the vehicle stops. And this one is not a mechanical failure. It's a

283
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,360
 biomechanical failure. His legs don't work anymore. At this point, he's about four meters away from

284
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,800
 the eyes. The eyes haven't moved to this point. And he's ordered to get off of his bike and to follow

285
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,880
 him. So Carlos is following this set of eyes through the darkness. And they leave the road and

286
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,000
 they're cutting across this field. And he says, "I can never get closer than four meters to this

287
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,240
 creature." Couldn't really see what it was because it was still dark. Just knew that it had those

288
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,320
 giant eyes. And it's funny, I'm wondering now if it was walking backwards, if he saw the eyes the

289
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,760
 whole time? Or if when the alien turned around, he's like, "Where'd you go? Where'd you go?" And

290
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,920
 the alien's like, "Over here." But anyways, he leads Carlos onto a glowing object. The terminology

291
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,720
 in this story is interesting as well. Leads him onto a glowing object. It has a little ramp.

292
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:07,520
 Come out of it. Doesn't say UFO, doesn't say disc or teardrop or circle or cigar, whatever.

293
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,080
 It's simply an object, a glowing object. Maybe the light was too bright for him to even see what it

294
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,920
 was. But he does see the ramp and he follows the creature up onto the ship. Now at this point,

295
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,400
 he's able, this ship is very, very well lit. So he's able to kind of get a feel for what these

296
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,720
 things look like. The ship is a standard UFO layout. You're like, "Jason, there's no such thing as a

297
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,040
 standard UFO layout." You know what I mean? If you've seen a sci-fi movie control panels,

298
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:42,720
 little lights and stuff like that, right? He sees that there's three small dudes. Basically,

299
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 he describes them as gray aliens. They have big black eyes when they're not being lit up in the

300
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,720
 darkness. Skin, like, obviously they have skin. They're just a collection of organs and tendons

301
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,280
 that just kind of... I'll get to the skin in a second. They have little ear holes, little nose

302
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,400
 holes, a slit for mouth. Those are all big heads. Those are all telltale signs of a gray alien. But

303
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,680
 he has some interesting details too. He sees these three little ones, but then he sees a taller alien.

304
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,960
 It has the same features, the same face, the giant head, the big black eyes, gray alien. But he,

305
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,120
 again, there's some weird features that kind of separate these from our traditional gray aliens.

306
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,360
 They have no necks. The head sits directly on the shoulders, like this. I guess you can't see,

307
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,080
 but you can imagine what would make your voice change. Head sat directly on the shoulders. The

308
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,160
 big one had a hump, a hump on his back that he wanted everyone to check out. How does that

309
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,400
 sound like? Go, "My humps. My humps. My humps." I don't know. Anyways, the point is, is that...

310
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,000
 Let's get back to it. Let's get back to something that actually matters. This story.

311
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,760
 Alien has a big hump on his back. No neck. His skin is gray, like typical gray, but a lot of times

312
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,400
 the gray aliens are described as like plastic, plastic-y alien or soft. He said it looked like

313
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:07,760
 elephant skin. Now, what's possible that this one he was looking at was exceedingly old, an

314
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,360
 ancient gray alien, but he said that the main alien skin looked, reminded him of elephant skin.

315
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,600
 Very leathery and rough. Still gray, though. Again, interesting details. Interesting details. If

316
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,720
 someone was making this story up, they're really going out of their way. One, they know UFO allure

317
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,560
 enough. And then two, if you were making it up, I don't know. I just, something seems authentic

318
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,640
 about this story, but it doesn't mean it could definitely be made up. I've been fooled before.

319
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,360
 Let's keep going, though. The oddest thing about this guy is that his fingers... He didn't have

320
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,480
 fingers, right? Like, he didn't have fingers. They, well, he had them, but they were like tree roots.

321
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,080
 So they just, he said they were like filaments. Had a normal hand, and then the fingers just became

322
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,360
 all like, like, big ol' rutabagas. But like, not big ol' rutabagas. Skinny little rutabagas. And

323
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,160
 they just kind of ended on little gross tips. That's disgusting to me. I would not want to

324
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,080
 be touched by someone with rutabagas for fingers. I mean, and I also would, I would like to be able

325
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,160
 to pronounce that word, but if I could pronounce that word, I still don't want to be touched by them.

326
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:23,040
 It sounds disgusting. That sounds alien. So many of it, like reptilians, they have human fingers,

327
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,320
 but claws. And Pleiadians just have human hands. And gray aliens tend to have, you know, five fingers,

328
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,800
 they have human hands. Not grody elephant skin, big ol' gross rutabagar fingers, right?

329
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,560
 So anyways, as Carlos is trying not to throw up at this dude, the alien's like,

330
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,560
 like what you see. Also they're totally naked. But to be fair, he doesn't describe any sex organs.

331
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,880
 So I, that also points to the fact that gray aliens just seem to be sexless, right? So now

332
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,360
 we get to the point of the story where generally they get the tour of the ship. But even here we

333
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,080
 find some interesting, interesting details. Carlos is now standing on the ship. And again,

334
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,160
 he says he didn't, he felt like he didn't have a choice. He felt like he was ordered to follow

335
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,440
 onto the ship. The aliens talk to him and they go, "Do you want to go back to our quote, place of origin?"

336
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,640
 And he goes, "No, no, I don't. He's terrified." And he gets this telepathic message and they said,

337
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,880
 "Don't worry, we don't hurt humans. Like, don't be afraid of us." They ask him if he wants to go

338
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,200
 back to their place of origin. He goes, "No, I don't want to. You're spooky. Your fingers are gross."

339
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,320
 Aliens look at each other. They're like, "Yeah, they're pretty disgusting." But let us show you

340
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,280
 what our place of origin is like. They go and they hit this button and the screen pops up.

341
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,080
 Now I'm going to pause right here because I think it's weird that they refer to it as their place

342
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:51,360
 of origin, not planet. Because in every other UFO story, we come from the star system and drama.

343
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:59,840
 We come from cluster 4, a planet orbiting what you call Betelgeuse. This one they refer to it as

344
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:07,600
 their place of origin, which makes you think they're not from another planet. It's weird terminology.

345
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
 That could be a translation error because this was coming from a Spanish story. But even then,

346
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,920
 do you think the translation error would simply be from Spanish to English planet? Unless they

347
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,920
 were specifically saying place of origin. So are these aliens from another dimension? Are they from

348
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:30,560
 here? Because what they show is a vast desert wasteland. So it could have been Las Vegas for all

349
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:38,320
 I know. But the fact that they're not referring it to as a planet makes me think that it's like

350
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,000
 interdimensional, which is kind of my view of aliens in the first place. That being said,

351
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,120
 these aliens use the term place of origin twice. And so when they hit the button and they pull up

352
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,120
 the display, they say this is our place of origin. It's a vast desert wasteland. Which that would

353
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,840
 also explain why they're at Earth so much because Earth is awesome. We only have like two or three

354
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,680
 really big deserts and the rest of it's surrounded by lush, beautiful water and green stuff and really

355
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,800
 hot human women and all sorts of stuff. So rutabaga fingers, I'm sure that you would want to come here

356
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:20,000
 all the time. Now, they also tell him we have the ability to change shape at will. And they give him

357
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,600
 what's described as a brief demonstration. And then he's surrounded in blackness. He doesn't tell

358
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,200
 us what the brief demonstration is. When Carlos is telling the story, he doesn't say what the brief

359
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,400
 demonstration is. The alien could have been like, "Ta-da! My hand is now has eight fingers,

360
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,800
 eight disgusting fingers!" Or it could have been a full body morph. We don't know. He just said they

361
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:48,000
 gave him a brief description. The next thing he knew, he is shrouded in darkness. And then he's

362
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:58,240
 laying on that country road, his bike next to him. It's 10 p.m. An hour and a half had passed

363
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,160
 since he first saw the eyeballs. But now he's all alone. The next part's pretty explainable. For

364
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:12,480
 the next two weeks, full-on insomnia could not sleep. And when he did fall asleep, hideous nightmares.

365
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:20,080
 He never ate a rutabaga again. I don't know if that part's true. I wouldn't. But horrible nightmares,

366
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,800
 he couldn't sleep. He didn't want to sleep. And when he did close his eyes, he would just have

367
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,600
 these fearful dreams. He also noticed that he had a red mark circling his belly button.

368
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,720
 And red circles under his armpits. Ringworm? Maybe? I don't know. He could have just been laying in

369
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,880
 the dirt for an hour and a half. Worms were crawling in with his armpits, crawling out his belly button.

370
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,040
 But he does eventually go, "You know what? Something really weird happened that night.

371
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,800
 I'm going to undergo hypnosis." Which seems to be a lot of people who are in UFO abductees take

372
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
 that step. Because obviously, if you go through this traumatic event, you're going to start looking

373
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,920
 for resources of other people who've gone through it. And a lot of times in these resources,

374
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,680
 people who've been abducted, they get hypnotized because they want to know what else could have

375
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,120
 happened. He remembers two things. And this is where the story, I think, gets super bizarre.

376
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,200
 Like, that is all pretty creepy anyways. It's a weird description of the aliens.

377
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
 They're not talking about planets. He was under their command. The whole thing about the bicycle

378
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,240
 slowing down is a very, very weird, authentic detail. Then he has these two things that come

379
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:36,720
 out of the hypnosis. One of them is he remembers another part of the ship. So the leader alien,

380
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,040
 the big one he considered was the leader. I don't know why, but I just had the feeling

381
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,200
 he was the leader. And that's another thing. A lot of UFO contact stories will be like,

382
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,920
 "I could tell who was the leader." The leader leads him into this room and it was this room

383
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,120
 full of what he said looked like phone booths. And the alien goes, "Get in one of those phone

384
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,880
 booths, young Carlos. Get inside of there." And he gets into the phone booth. This would be a

385
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,960
 weird creepy thing to remember because it's a fragment of a memory. He doesn't know what happened

386
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,360
 after this. He gets in the phone booth. Oh, it's not an actual phone booth. There's not a phone

387
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,440
 and a yellow page is there. A lot of you guys are too really young to remember phone booths. I've

388
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,360
 used phone booths. That's how old I am. I remember I used to have a pager. I'd be like, "Oh, okay,

389
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,120
 I gotta drive another mile. There's a phone booth over there. Get out by the blockbuster video.

390
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,720
 Get on the phone. Hey, what's up?" He gets in the phone booth and he's bathed in a blue light.

391
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:42,960
 Now, the room is full of phone booths, right? And directly across from the phone booth that he's in,

392
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,720
 he appears. Not teleportation. He's still in his phone booth, but when the blue light goes away,

393
00:36:51,280 --> 00:37:02,160
 he looks in that phone booth and there's a clone of him. Memorians. That's terrifying.

394
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,160
 That's something that you would be hypnotized and be like, "Can you do it like reverse hypnotism?

395
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,240
 Can you make me forget that?" Because then you're going to have the idea that there's another you

396
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:24,800
 out there, which is really like mental illness 101. Doppelgangers, clones. That's like, that's scary.

397
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,720
 Because then if you do have a thing where you're like, "Who posted this thing on my..." That guy

398
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,040
 obviously was suffering. He was having meth problems. He posted it on accident or on purpose

399
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,120
 in meth psychosis. If it happened to you, you may go, "That's weird. I'm not a drug user. I'm totally

400
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,760
 in charge of my facilities." And maybe it was a glitch. But if you knew you had a clone out there,

401
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,360
 every time your keys went missing, every time someone goes, "Hey, I saw you at the bowling

402
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,560
 alley." Someone comes up to you and goes, "Didn't I see you at the bowling alley the other day?"

403
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,000
 You'd be like, "No, I haven't gone to the bowling alley in a while." The person would go like, "Oh."

404
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,320
 And then you would just figure someone who just looked like you or maybe your friend saw someone

405
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,200
 from the back. If you knew there was a clone out there, you would, whenever it's like, "Hey man,

406
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,000
 long time no see." You'd be like, "Was it me? You last saw or was it my clone? What? What? Are you

407
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,680
 okay? I don't know. Am I okay or am I my clone? Like, how... That's... Oh my god. I want to even

408
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,960
 think about that. How would you even know that you're the one back on earth? Maybe the clone

409
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,240
 is on earth and Carlos is still in the ship? You would never know. You would always wonder.

410
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,040
 You would go to sleep and then you'd wake up and you'd think, "Was I replaced by my clone in

411
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,720
 the middle of the night?" Would the clone know? That, again, is like mental... That's like a mental

412
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,760
 delusion 101 type of thinking. But this guy saw his clone be created. And again, you would... For

413
00:38:51,760 --> 00:39:00,880
 what purpose? So that's creepy detail. And it opens a whole host of things. We talk about reptilian

414
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,480
 shapeshifters taking over, "Ah, I'm Queen of England now. Let me go lay on this rock to regulate my

415
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,800
 body temperature. Ah, yes. And soon I will rule the world." You got people who believe that.

416
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,160
 And now, eh, but now you have aliens who are just like, "Boop, here's a clone of the Queen of England.

417
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,560
 Oh wait, that one died. Boop, here's another one. Like, we can just keep making them. Keep her alive

418
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,400
 as long as we have our rutabaga fingers pulling the strings of the world. Instant clones is creepy,

419
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,800
 but it'd be even creepier knowing there was a clone of you." And then he has another memory

420
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:42,880
 that comes out of this hypnosis. The aliens said they will return. They will return. They turn to

421
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:50,000
 Carlos and they say, "You will know we are going to return because you will hear, quote," this is

422
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,200
 what the aliens actually said to him, "when they return, there will be the quote, "sounds of distant

423
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:08,240
 thunder." That's a super evocative phrase and terrifying. Now, I know some people like the sound

424
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,600
 of storms and thunder and it's peaceful and it's white noise and stuff like that, but in our caveman

425
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:21,440
 brain, that's a sound of unbridled nature. Like, we may have trained ourselves to kind of like the

426
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,240
 idea of like a thunderstorm when we're in our house, but if you're out on the plains or the

427
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,760
 prairie, there's something very primal about a raging storm coming to our caveman brains.

428
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:43,920
 Even up until like the 1700s, 1800s, when you heard that thunder coming, you knew bad stuff was going

429
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,520
 to happen. Could be a little rainstorm help your crops. Could be a massive storm that's going to

430
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,400
 bury everything, flood the area. And now you have an alien using basically human terminology.

431
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,760
 I mean, I guess there's storms on other planets, but we don't have a monopoly on that. I think

432
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,080
 Jupiter probably does, but you know what I mean? The idea, I wonder what thunder sounds like on

433
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,600
 Jupiter. I'd probably want it to sound like it does here, right? Because the atmosphere is different.

434
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,680
 Maybe it sounds like really high-pitched and not intimidating at all, but yeah, because all the

435
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,440
 helium, right? That's a joke. That was a joke, guys. Don't bombard me with, I don't know anything

436
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,920
 about science again, the sounds of distant thunder. It sounds almost biblical, really. I actually

437
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,400
 thought it was a quote from the Bible. I actually tried looking it up, because that sounds like

438
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,520
 something you'd see in the book of Revelation or the book of Daniel or any book where they were

439
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:43,200
 talking about prophecies. The sound of distant thunder will herald the return of the aliens.

440
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:52,240
 A very, very evocative phrase. It gets right into our primal brain of something destructive

441
00:41:52,240 --> 00:42:01,120
 and unstoppable. And it's being told to this young man in a fragment of a memory,

442
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,840
 in aliens telling him that not only will we return, but you will know we will return

443
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,000
 because of the sounds of distant thunder. Now, does that mean that they're going to return as an

444
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,840
 invading force, even though they said they don't hurt humans? They may not hurt humans the way

445
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:25,600
 humans try not to hurt pets or cattle. Well, we kill them for food, but we try to make it as

446
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:33,120
 humane as possible, right? Could it be the sound of a fleet of ships cracking the dimensional wall?

447
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:41,360
 Or could it be something more personal, more terrifying, that someday, any day, really,

448
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:50,800
 Carlos, now no longer a young man, now older, now it's 2020. This experience was 24 years ago.

449
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:58,080
 He has a wife, he has a family, and then he hears the sounds of distant thunder.

450
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:10,160
 [thunder]

451
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:20,000
 He's heard a lot of rainstorms since 1986, and they always sense a chill down his spine,

452
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,560
 but this time it sounds a little more frightful, a little more raw.

453
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:41,360
 And he steps out on his patio, and he sees himself perfectly aged to where he is at now,

454
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:47,040
 24 years older, looking at him, standing in his backyard.

455
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,280
 And as he's staring at himself in that backyard, his family completely unaware, just a few feet away.

456
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:04,480
 The switch takes place, a human man replaced by a clone.

457
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:18,240
 The sound of distant thunder fades away, and now an alien agent walks into his house.

458
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:26,960
 Smiles at his kids, knows that this has happened all over the world at the same time.

459
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,560
 There's thousands of these clones out there now.

460
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,960
 Just getting ready for the next phase of the plan.

461
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,000
 Just getting ready to hear the thunder again.

462
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,280
