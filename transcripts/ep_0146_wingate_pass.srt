1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
 A haunted video game you can play today.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,680
 And then we take a look at the rumors of underground cities beneath Death Valley.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,000
 Do they really exist?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,080
 Are they being covered up?

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,600
 And was Charles Manson so tuned in?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,000
 He found the entrance to one of them, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I hope you are having a great day too.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 It's bitterly cold here.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Ugh.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Big cold snaps come through.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 You know what's funny?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 So I have this weather app on my phone.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,440
 And it'll say the weather, the temperature is 35, but it feels 29.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,640
 How do they determine that?

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,600
 Is there like a guy at the weather center?

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,400
 They're like, hey Bobby, you gotta update the website.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,200
 Go outside and tell us what it feels like.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,440
 And eventually that guy would just be like, ah, it feels like 60 degrees and everyone's

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,200
 super cold because he would get immune to the cold.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
 How do they figure that?

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,520
 Did they just go, oh according to like stupid nerd science stuff, they can go, well, depending

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,080
 on the wind factor, this would be 20 or do they just have an intern stand outside?

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
 They're like, uh, he's dead.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,440
 So it's probably feels like it's 10 degrees.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
 There has to be an answer behind that.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,080
 But we're not going to figure it out today.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,620
 Instead, we're going to talk about some ghosts again.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,560
 This is the continuation of ghost week.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,440
 Two things, two before I get started.

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,800
 One, just a reminder, the merch store is now open.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,080
 We got shirts and hoodies and mugs.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
 We got a clock.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,680
 We got a dead rabbit clock.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,840
 That's all on the merch store.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,200
 Those will be in the links below.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,040
 And quite a few people have already bought some shirts and hoodies.

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
 One guy bought a mug.

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
 I'm assuming it's a guy.

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
 I don't, could be a woman.

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
 I don't know.

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
 Yeah.

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
 So we got the merch store going.

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,760
 Secondly, I said I've been, I, I give you a hint on Monday of what our Friday episode

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
 would be.

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,020
 One of the most requested, if not the most requested topic to cover on Dead Rabbit Radio.

49
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,060
 I said on Monday it involved ghosts.

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,320
 And today the hint is it also involves music.

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,560
 So a little mystery for you.

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
 Ghosts and music.

53
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,220
 See if you guys can figure it out before Friday.

54
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,060
 But let's go ahead and get started here.

55
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,420
 Now, okay, so the first thing we're going to talk about is a video game.

56
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,740
 Now I read an interview with one of the game developers way back in the day.

57
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,160
 Probably around 2004, the year that everything crazy happened in the news.

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,000
 And I can't find that interview again.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
 So you'll have to take my word for it.

60
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,720
 And you'll have to believe in this quote unquote quote.

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,040
 Because I don't know exactly what he said, but I remember reading it and being like,

62
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
 "Ugh."

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,120
 There was two people who developed this video game.

64
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,360
 The video game is called Fatal Frame.

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,480
 And you had these two developers.

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,760
 You had Makato Shibata and Kisuki Kikichi.

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,080
 And one of them, I don't remember which one, one of them was doing this interview with

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,520
 this game magazine.

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,540
 And they were talking about it at the time.

70
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,580
 It was a kind of a big hit.

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,820
 It's definitely cult classic nowadays.

72
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
 There's like five of them.

73
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,580
 And they were talking about the first Fatal Frame and they were developing the second

74
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,580
 Fatal Frame.

75
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,540
 And the interviewer asked them about the workmanship, the craft that went into the game.

76
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,580
 And the game developer said, "Yeah, I wanted to make the game beautiful because I know

77
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,980
 ghosts watch you while you play it.

78
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,420
 And I wanted to give them something to look at."

79
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,420
 Now that might just be hyperbole for a game where you're hunting ghosts, but it's actually

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,420
 quite accurate.

81
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,680
 I have my own personal experiences with Fatal Frame.

82
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,320
 Now Fatal Frame came out in 2002.

83
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,640
 It was released for the PS2 and the Xbox, first the PS2.

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,520
 But I was house-sitting for some friends of mine.

85
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,640
 Jackie, Jackie, she was one of the people who was in the Shadow People invasion story.

86
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
 We did a lot of ghost hunting.

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,440
 Well anyways, her family would let me house-sit for them.

88
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
 It was totally awesome.

89
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,620
 And they had a PS2 and a big screen television set.

90
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,100
 So I was like, "Dope."

91
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,140
 Ran a Hollywood video, rented a copy of Fatal Frame because it looked super cool, took it

92
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,980
 to the house, played it for maybe 30 minutes, went back to Hollywood video and said, "Uh,

93
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,460
 yeah, you know, I took this home and like my mom was like, it's scaring my little brother,

94
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,700
 so I gotta return it.

95
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
 Can I get another game?"

96
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,940
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure."

97
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,820
 The game is terrifying.

98
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,300
 The game is very, very scary.

99
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,920
 The setup of the game is you're a young girl who's looking for a missing sister.

100
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,640
 You're in Japan, you have to go into this mansion.

101
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,320
 The only weapon you have is a camera and you gotta like time it right to get the ghost.

102
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,720
 But what's scary is you don't, you can't really see the ghost until you lift the camera

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,920
 up and the camera like restricts your field of view.

104
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,040
 It's a very, very claustrophobic type of game.

105
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,240
 Very, very well done.

106
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,000
 Great game, great game.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,860
 But it was so scary that when the developers started to make the second one, Fatal Frame

108
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,660
 2, Crimson Butterfly, they got complaints that the first one was too scary.

109
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
 People didn't finish it.

110
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,260
 A lot of people did not finish Fatal Frame.

111
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,740
 It's too scary.

112
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,900
 So the developers said, "Okay, we'll make it, the sequel we're gonna make a little less

113
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
 scary.

114
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,680
 We're gonna make the plot a little more emotional, a little more involved.

115
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,540
 So people will want to stick around to the end.

116
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,100
 Fatal Frame 2 is considered the scariest game ever made.

117
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,540
 Fatal Frame 2 is considered, I haven't played it.

118
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,240
 Because my experience is with Fatal Frame.

119
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,880
 Because what happened, it wasn't just that 30 minutes.

120
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,160
 I was obsessed with that game.

121
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,760
 And the only place I knew that had a PS2 was at Jackie's house.

122
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,480
 So I ended up getting a copy somehow.

123
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,920
 I don't remember if I like bought it used or something like that.

124
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,720
 And I would go over to Jackie's house because I hung out there all the time and her and

125
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,080
 I would play it late at night.

126
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
 Make it extra spooky.

127
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,280
 But you know, I can be brave if there's somebody else there.

128
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,780
 And her mom was always very, very sensitive to ghosts.

129
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,260
 If I've ever met a true medium in my life, it would be Jackie's mom.

130
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,220
 Like she just was very, very sensitive to all that stuff.

131
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,620
 She never tried making money from it.

132
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,620
 She never tried like, you know, being the ghost whisper or anything like that.

133
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,460
 She would just kind of mumble about stuff every once in a while about things she was

134
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
 seeing.

135
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,460
 And that house was creepy.

136
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,820
 But just her mom kind of had that.

137
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,700
 And she was just like, she was a housewife.

138
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,980
 She wasn't like a hippie chick.

139
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,320
 She was just like a normal person.

140
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,080
 But she kind of, just the way she talked, like if I've ever met a real medium, it would

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
 have been her.

142
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,720
 So I remember one night she came downstairs and she was like, can you guys quit playing

143
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 that game?

144
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
 And we're like, why?

145
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,360
 And she's like, because it's causing stuff upstairs.

146
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,920
 And I'm trying to go to sleep.

147
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
 Jackie and I kind of looked at each other.

148
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,480
 We're like, yeah, sure.

149
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,240
 And we thought maybe we were being too loud.

150
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,900
 But then we started kind of talking and we shut the television off and just sat there

151
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
 for a while.

152
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,740
 We're like, because the game just has a creepy vibe to it.

153
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,980
 And her mom wasn't saying, it didn't wake up the dad.

154
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,940
 Her mom wasn't saying, please turn it off.

155
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
 You guys are being loud.

156
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,220
 It's like she said it's causing stuff upstairs.

157
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,340
 So at that point we had to finish the game.

158
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,140
 So there was a time when the mom, where the parents weren't there and Jackie and I were

159
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,900
 there and we were playing Fatal Frame and we actually beat it.

160
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,700
 We were up till maybe like one or two in the morning.

161
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,140
 I'm sitting there playing it.

162
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,040
 He's going through game facts.

163
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,240
 I think we actually had to go upstairs to the computer upstairs, print out game facts,

164
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,040
 the website and then bring it back downstairs.

165
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,080
 Because, you know, nobody had a laptop.

166
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,680
 We're still ridiculously expensive and no one had smartphones.

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,120
 So we're sitting in the dark playing this game.

168
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
 We beat it.

169
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
 But there's some other stuff you can do on it.

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,560
 I don't remember if it's so much bonus stuff, but other content you can go through battle

171
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
 mode or something like that.

172
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,640
 So we beat it and I put it away.

173
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,780
 And I remember maybe a week or two passed and I was talking to Jackie and Jackie's like,

174
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,900
 "My mom threw your game away."

175
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
 And I was like, "What?"

176
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,940
 She's like, "My mom threw Fatal Frame away."

177
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,980
 I was like, "Why did she throw Fatal Frame away?"

178
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,480
 She goes, "It's so weird."

179
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,900
 So when her parents came back into town, she goes, "My mom, they came back to town.

180
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
 They're in the house."

181
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,640
 She goes, "Maybe a night or two passed."

182
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,380
 And my mom came to me and said, "Were you guys playing that game while I was gone?

183
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,260
 Were you guys playing that ghost game while I was gone?"

184
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,120
 And Jackie's like, "Yeah, yeah, we were."

185
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,160
 And the mom was like, "Give me the game."

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,660
 She threw it away.

187
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,780
 Somehow this game, even though she wasn't there for this, and Jackie's someone I trust

188
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,560
 explicitly, she's never lied to me, somehow the game does open something up.

189
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,360
 And it's a mass produced game.

190
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,960
 You can buy copies today.

191
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,640
 They're like 20 bucks.

192
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,920
 And there's like five sequels and some of them are on the Wii U, but it's not like this

193
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,500
 cult game, this is a spooky game that only one person can own.

194
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,700
 You can buy it and play it today.

195
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,900
 And I swear it opens something up.

196
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
 Really, really creepy.

197
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,140
 And I think that's what adds to the creepiness and that quote, because I was really into that

198
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,700
 game when I read that quote from the developer and he's like, "Dead people watch you."

199
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,380
 Like, basically when you're playing it, the dead will stand behind you and watch the game.

200
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,060
 I'm like, "Rrrrr."

201
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,700
 And from my own experiences, I knew that wasn't hyperbole.

202
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,120
 I knew that he probably built the game to attract the dead.

203
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
 I don't know.

204
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,440
 I haven't played it since.

205
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
 Yeah.

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,680
 And I have no way I'm playing the other ones.

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,880
 You know what, that would be kind of cool to do a twitch playthrough of one of the Fatal

208
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
 Frame games.

209
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,400
 Fatal Frame 2 maybe.

210
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
 We'll think about it.

211
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,720
 You see a bunch of ghosts standing behind me, that would be creepy.

212
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,360
 I'm like, "Hey guys, donate me some bits."

213
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,200
 And you just see like this hulking figure behind me, mongo's ghost standing behind me.

214
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,160
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

215
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,900
 Now, our next story is actually not a story.

216
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,300
 It's very, very quick.

217
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
 Please indulge me.

218
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,940
 "Dead Rabbit Recommends."

219
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,460
 This is something I've wanted to do.

220
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:40,540
 Originally, I planned on doing it every week or every other week and I really haven't.

221
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,940
 And the reason why I do it is not because my taste in films is greater than everyone

222
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,260
 else's or that because it's not.

223
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,900
 But it's not like I have this secret knowledge of movies, but there's a lot of movies out

224
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,360
 there that I think would appeal to this audience, to you, that people don't know about.

225
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,120
 The Evil Within, In the Mouth of Madness, The Conspiracy.

226
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,960
 These are all great movies that when I found them, I was like, "These movies were made

227
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
 for me."

228
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
 And this one too.

229
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,200
 This is a movie that I just happened to stumble across and I really can't talk about it without

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
 spoiling it.

231
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,520
 So I'm not going to talk about it a lot.

232
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,020
 It's called Coherence.

233
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
 It's by James.

234
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,200
 It was written and directed by James Birkett, I believe.

235
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,680
 But it's Coherence.

236
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,460
 It's an ensemble piece.

237
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,380
 It takes place in a single house, or does it?

238
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,980
 And I'll tell you the beginning.

239
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
 Beginning of the movie.

240
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,220
 There's a dinner party.

241
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,420
 It's these upper middle class people sitting around drinking white wine.

242
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,260
 There's a Comet Passing Overhead.

243
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
 This movie's probably from like 2013.

244
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,460
 There's a Comet Passing Overhead.

245
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,460
 They're having this party where they sit around and talk about their, how great their

246
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,940
 lives are when really their marriages are all falling apart type of thing.

247
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,760
 And one of them's an actor.

248
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,000
 Not everyone knows each other.

249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,880
 Some of them are just friends of friends and they're all at this dinner together.

250
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
 One person goes, "Hey, you're an actor, right?"

251
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,200
 And the dude's like, "Yeah, I'm an actor."

252
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,760
 And they go, "You were on that show Roswell, that TV show Roswell on the WB."

253
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,680
 And the guy's like, "No, I've done television, but I was never on Roswell."

254
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,920
 Other person's like, "Are you sure?

255
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
 Are you sure you're not?"

256
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,360
 "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm totally sure.

257
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,820
 I've never done Roswell."

258
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,660
 The movie is amazing.

259
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,420
 When the movie ended, I remembered that line and was like, "It's such a well put together.

260
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:37,620
 It is a sci-fi thriller bordering on horror and it just goes places.

261
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:46,380
 I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of weird stuff, 40 and stuff, science, whatever you

262
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,380
 want."

263
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,000
 It is a perfect show for this audience.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
 "Coherence" Check it out.

265
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
 Pretty sure you can rent it on YouTube.

266
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,360
 Most likely because it was not a big release, but it had a main distributor.

267
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,960
 Again, it's not some cult film.

268
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
 Very, very well done.

269
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
 It's been a year.

270
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,840
 I saw it in 2013, so it's been what?

271
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,280
 I'm going to do math here.

272
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,320
 It's six years and I still remember certain scenes absolutely vividly.

273
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,800
 Very, very well done movie.

274
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,960
 So Dead Rabbit recommends "Coherence."

275
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
 A short review.

276
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,060
 I would like to do these once a week because I got a ton of great movies.

277
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,420
 So we're going to move on to our last story, our main story.

278
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,980
 This one's really, really interesting.

279
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,620
 It's quite frightening actually.

280
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,260
 I have a thing about, and I've mentioned this on other episodes, I have a thing about stuff

281
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,980
 being underneath me.

282
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,540
 I think that's the reason why UFOs don't scare me because I don't find the sky necessarily

283
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
 spooky.

284
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,300
 I don't find UFOs or space aliens and stuff like that intrinsically scary.

285
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,320
 And it's funny because when I talk about aliens that come from Earth or in underground caves,

286
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
 that gets to me.

287
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,520
 And I think you might, if you're a long time listener of the show, I think you might have

288
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 picked up on that.

289
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,680
 When I'm like, "Grey's coming from space."

290
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,640
 But then when I talk about "Grey's" evolving from dolphins and being in tunnel systems,

291
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,000
 the tone of my voice was quite different in that episode versus how I talk about aliens

292
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 in general.

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
 I don't like stuff underneath me.

294
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 I don't like being on lakes.

295
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,520
 I don't like being in the ocean.

296
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,980
 It always trips me out to think, I live between two volcanoes here in Hood River.

297
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,060
 There's Mount Adams on one side and there's Mount Hood on the other.

298
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,220
 And I think, you know, what, a mile down there's just rivers of hot lava.

299
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,220
 I mean, that might not actually be accurate, but it trips me out to think that there are

300
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,540
 caves underneath my feet.

301
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,620
 And it's even weirder when we start talking about civilizations.

302
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,220
 And imagine you're spending your whole life walking on Earth and three miles underneath

303
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,480
 you, there is, well, we'll get to that.

304
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,360
 We're headed to Wingate Pass.

305
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
 And you know what?

306
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
 Let's see here.

307
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
 I don't think that Jason Jalopy can make it.

308
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,400
 Let's take the bunny buggy that-

309
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,600
 [imitates buggy buggy sound]

310
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,960
 It's not a weedwacker.

311
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,000
 That is our four-wheeling, it has machine guns on it.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,040
 We got two 50-caliber machine guns on the front of it.

313
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
 It's a buggy.

314
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,160
 [imitates buggy buggy sound]

315
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
 Going over the dunes.

316
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,980
 [imitates buggy buggy sound]

317
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,180
 It's a four-

318
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,540
 Well, they all have four wheels, but it's a four-wheel drive.

319
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,740
 Buggy for going over the sand dunes.

320
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,420
 [imitates buggy buggy sound]

321
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,420
 War boys are chasing us.

322
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,420
 Do we have to outrun the war boys?

323
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,420
 [imitates war boy sound]

324
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,620
 Medioka!

325
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,380
 We hear them yell as we just kicked us in their face.

326
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,820
 Whenever we go anywhere we're sand, if I remember, the war boys will show up and try

327
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
 to take us.

328
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
 Medioka!

329
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
 But we outrun them.

330
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
 Okay.

331
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,840
 So we're going to Death Valley.

332
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,040
 Specifically, we're going to Wingate Pass.

333
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,440
 Now, Wingate Pass is an area of Death Valley.

334
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
 And there was a guy back in 1932.

335
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,540
 He was writing a book called Death Valley Men, which is actually quite evocative title and

336
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
 very self-explanatory.

337
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,280
 You know what you're gonna get when you read the book.

338
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
 He's in Death Valley.

339
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,900
 He's talking to like the hardy people to survive.

340
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,760
 Not the hardy boys, the hardy men.

341
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,960
 He's talking to like, survive, you know, people who've lived there their whole lives are all

342
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,560
 dusty and stuff like that.

343
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,140
 These real like, kind of, land scrabble guys if that's even a word or a phrase.

344
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,220
 And he meets up with these two dudes and they go, "Do we have a story for you?"

345
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,620
 And he's like, "Why'd you get that accent all of a sudden?"

346
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
 And they're like, "I don't know."

347
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,100
 They go, "Do we have a story for you?

348
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,500
 You, you, let's have a couple rounds because it's gonna take a while.

349
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,660
 It's gonna take a while, Mr. Lee."

350
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,980
 So they have this saloon.

351
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,540
 The only saloon still standing in 1932.

352
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
 They're drinking this beer.

353
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,100
 And he goes, "Okay, here's the story.

354
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,560
 Me and my buddy were out at Wingate Pass long, long time ago."

355
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,760
 Not super long ago, but you know, more recent.

356
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,560
 And the author's like, "Oh, okay, just get on with it.

357
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
 Get on with it.

358
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
 Okay, okay, okay.

359
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
 Let me drink my beer here real slowly."

360
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,120
 So me and my buddy were out there.

361
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,640
 We're goofing off.

362
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,760
 My buddy here being the idiot that he is falls down a mine shaft.

363
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,960
 And I have to rescue him.

364
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,800
 Now it wasn't like a straight, I'm imagining it wasn't like a straight drop, but they had

365
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,900
 to go down to the bottom of this mine shaft to rescue his buddy.

366
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,900
 And they find what appears to be some sort of false wall.

367
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,860
 And so they start kind of digging around in there.

368
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,500
 Now of course, at this point, you're probably thinking, "This story is fake.

369
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,220
 This story is super fake."

370
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,700
 But don't say that yet.

371
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,340
 You can say that at other points, but I mean, I guess these two characters are basically

372
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,500
 Laurel and Hardy.

373
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,140
 They're like falling down and they like awaken the mummy because they're moving rocks around.

374
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,000
 But anyway, so they move away, they get through this false wall type of thing.

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,520
 And what they see is a massive underground chamber, a city really, but completely devoid

376
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
 of life.

377
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,760
 It's empty, except for the eight foot tall mummies holding golden spears.

378
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,480
 So the two dudes, we'll call them Laurel and Hardy because I have to determine them in

379
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
 some way.

380
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,060
 So Laurel's like another fine one you got us into.

381
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,900
 That might be the worst Laurel impression ever.

382
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,900
 I'm so sorry.

383
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,260
 I'm apologize for that.

384
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,020
 Laurel and Hardy begin exploring this huge...

385
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,500
 It's quite tragic that I named them that considering what's coming up, but Laurel and Hardy are

386
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,180
 beginning to explore this huge chamber.

387
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,500
 They find gold everywhere.

388
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,820
 There's a huge table that's flat.

389
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
 It's round.

390
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
 It's polished.

391
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,020
 And they're like, "This looks like some sort of ceremonial chamber.

392
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,520
 This looks like it goes on forever."

393
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,600
 They begin exploring this whole area, finding massive gems.

394
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,560
 I thought one of the most interesting things they found was, and here's a quote, "Heavy

395
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,200
 stone wheelbarrows which were perfectly balanced and scientifically constructed so that a child

396
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
 could use them."

397
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,200
 Now I understand in 1932 a wheelbarrow was probably the height of technology and they're

398
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,120
 like, "Oh my God, this is the Lamborghini of wheelbarrows.

399
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 This is the mo...

400
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
 Look at this.

401
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
 Look at this, Hardy.

402
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
 I can do anything.

403
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,960
 A child could use this."

404
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,580
 I don't think there's any way I could be impressed by a wheelbarrow today unless it

405
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,220
 was a hoverbarrow.

406
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,860
 If it had no wheels, it just hovered around.

407
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
 That's it.

408
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,260
 But apparently these guys are super impressed by this wheelbarrow.

409
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,900
 Now it's funny because they just walked by eight foot tall mummies and they're like,

410
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
 "Whoa, look at those giant mummies.

411
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
 Dude.

412
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
 Is that?

413
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
 Is that a wheelbarrow?"

414
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,820
 But apparently it really excited them.

415
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,740
 One interesting thing about their story too is there's two ways to fake stuff.

416
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,840
 One is to be completely vague and one is to be overly detailed.

417
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,520
 But one of the things they said was that when they got in, the place was illuminated because

418
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,240
 there was lines of gas in the wall that illuminated the place.

419
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,960
 So it was basically fluorescent light bulbs built into the cave walls and you could see

420
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,880
 the gas swirl around in there.

421
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,800
 That's a very, very intricate lie.

422
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,200
 If this is fake, that's a very, very intricate fake.

423
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,760
 For 1932.

424
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,180
 I mean, again, if I found an eight foot tall mummy, a wheelbarrow, and some gas in the

425
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,700
 wall, I think those would be my first two things to talk about would be the mummy and

426
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
 the gas.

427
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,340
 But for some reason they really liked the wheelbarrow, but it just is a weird detail.

428
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,660
 It's a very, very weird detail to fake the lighting system.

429
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,820
 But again, someone kind of said, "Well, was it dark in there?"

430
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,060
 And they're like, "Uh, no, no, no.

431
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
 There's gas in the wall."

432
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
 So you don't know.

433
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,280
 So they're telling Borkley these stories.

434
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,340
 They do the smart thing.

435
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,640
 They take a bunch of gold home.

436
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
 Now they probably use their scientifically constructed wheelbarrow, but they take a bunch

437
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,440
 of gold home and a bunch of gems and they say, "We're going to go back there.

438
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,360
 We're going to get even more stuff."

439
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,880
 But conveniently if they're lying and tragically if it's a truth, someone steals all the gold

440
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,040
 and all the gems.

441
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,280
 So now they have absolutely no proof.

442
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,280
 And there was a cloud burst over the area, which actually is like this massive amount

443
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,700
 of rain that can deform the terrain.

444
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,580
 Because it's just such a steady, harsh set of rain that comes out of nowhere.

445
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,700
 They said that a couple of the landmarks were destroyed.

446
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,660
 They couldn't show where it was again.

447
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,460
 Again convenient if it's a lie.

448
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,820
 So they tell this story to Borkley and he writes it in his book.

449
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:08,180
 But later on, not like later that day, but at a later point in time, they contact Bork

450
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,620
 again, probably through Telegram or something like that.

451
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,580
 I guess they had telephones in 1932.

452
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,260
 But they call him up and they're like, "Hey, we're going back.

453
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,080
 We're going to go back to Wingate Pass and we're going to find proof."

454
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,280
 And Borkley's like, "Oh, awesome."

455
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
 Never people disappeared.

456
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
 The two Laurel and Hardy, gone.

457
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,200
 No one ever saw them again once they set out to go find Wingate Pass again.

458
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,640
 Now of course, it's Death Valley.

459
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,960
 They could honestly just die.

460
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
 Anything could happen.

461
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 It was 1932.

462
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,180
 The bandits could have got them.

463
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,360
 War boys could have got them.

464
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,880
 They could have been out in the desert.

465
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
 Witness me.

466
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
 And then it just got blown up.

467
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,960
 But the guys were never seen again.

468
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,480
 And they were real people.

469
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,500
 Because the rest of the book was real people.

470
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,220
 But now, you know, you're like, "Jason, okay, that's an interesting story."

471
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,060
 A couple of people said they found something in Wingate Pass.

472
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,700
 But someone else also found something in Wingate Pass.

473
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,740
 In 1946, this doctor shows up.

474
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,700
 And we have a name for this guy, Dr. F. Bruce Russell.

475
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,780
 And this is interesting because he goes, "In 1931, I found a tunnel in Wingate Pass."

476
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,500
 Now this guy is more known to history.

477
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,780
 Because there was a big hubbub.

478
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,520
 He says that he found a tunnel in Wingate Pass that led to an underground city full

479
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
 of eight-foot-tall mummies.

480
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,800
 And gold everywhere in these huge statues.

481
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,960
 These huge gold spears and everything like that.

482
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,640
 Pretty much the same story.

483
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,760
 He doesn't bring back proof.

484
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,440
 He comes back and says, "We need to bring an expedition down there.

485
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,240
 I need to get investors.

486
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,080
 And we need to lead a team in there and we're going to take all this gold.

487
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,680
 And we're going to explore this place."

488
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
 Now, it's possible that he heard the original story.

489
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,020
 He read the Valley Men and they just made it up that he personally went there.

490
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,260
 That's definitely possible.

491
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,060
 But he's saying he went there himself.

492
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,380
 He comes out, he tries to get investors.

493
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,300
 People were like, "Listen, we're not going to give you money to find gold until you bring

494
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,340
 us back some sort of evidence that this place actually exists."

495
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,020
 And really, he's like, "In 1946, he's thinking, 'Okay, I'll go.

496
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
 I found it once.

497
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
 I can find it again.

498
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,580
 I will go and I will prove to you that this place exists.

499
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,580
 Hold my beer.'"

500
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,400
 That beer eventually got warm and evaporated because he was never seen again as well.

501
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
 So now we have three disappearances linked to the same place of people who went to a

502
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,220
 location, came back, told people they knew of it, and then went missing.

503
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,160
 With the doctor, they did find his car with a busted radiator in Death Valley.

504
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,120
 But his suitcase was in the back seat.

505
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,040
 And that's always been people who thought, "Well, if he abandoned his car, you think

506
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
 he probably would have brought a suitcase?"

507
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
 I don't know.

508
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,760
 Maybe I want to want a suitcase walking around the desert, but they never found his body.

509
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,020
 But again, it's Death Valley.

510
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,980
 Is it possible that all three of these people just met their end in Death Valley?

511
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,700
 Or is it possible that there's something else going on, that somebody wanted to cover the

512
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,100
 story up?

513
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,340
 Now, you can go to Wingate Pass today, if you're a member of the military, because

514
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,500
 what happened was the U.S. government bought all the land around there.

515
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,140
 And now Wingate Pass, this entire area that supposedly has an entrance to this underground

516
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,420
 city full of 8 foot tall mummies and untold riches, and wheelbarrow technology far beyond

517
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,900
 our own, it's now part of the China Lake Naval Weapon Center.

518
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,640
 From what I understand, it's where they test weapons.

519
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,880
 So even the military officials don't want to go out there, because the bomb's going

520
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,120
 to fall on them.

521
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,480
 But you can't go there.

522
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,400
 As a civilian, there's no way you can go there, at all.

523
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
 Government controls it.

524
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,120
 Let's go ahead and take a look at another part of Death Valley.

525
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,480
 This place is known as Devil's Hole.

526
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,640
 And it's interesting.

527
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,120
 It's not the Devil's Hole.

528
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,820
 It's not Devil's Apostrophe S Hole.

529
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
 There's no ownership.

530
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,500
 It's just Devil's Hole, as in multiple devils.

531
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,300
 Which is a weird name for it.

532
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,780
 Charles Manson was that kooky serial killer cult leader back in the 60s, if you're not

533
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,020
 familiar with the name.

534
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,860
 And they were the ones who murdered Sharon Tate in our previous episode.

535
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,260
 They didn't murder her during that episode, but that covered that story.

536
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,900
 Now his plan was this.

537
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,900
 He was going to start a race war, so that he was going to commit a bunch of crimes,

538
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,040
 blaming on black people.

539
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,800
 The white people would then attack the black people, the black people would fight back.

540
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,680
 And in the resulting race war, the world would be destroyed.

541
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,760
 And Charles Manson would reign supreme.

542
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,960
 What do you expect the Asians and the Hispanic people to do?

543
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
 I have no idea.

544
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,480
 They're just sitting there watching it, and they're like, "Hey, you want to divide this

545
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,600
 up after these guys get done killing each other?"

546
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,680
 They're like, "Yeah, that's a good idea."

547
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,320
 So very, very short sighted thinking, Charles Manson.

548
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,980
 And you're normally known for such lucid bots.

549
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,880
 To be able to survive Helter Skelter themselves, him and his group were going to go into

550
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,140
 an underground passage in Death Valley.

551
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,900
 It was underneath Devil's Hole, so you had to swim through the water, and when you get

552
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,100
 to the bottom, it opens up to this vast underground city.

553
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,700
 Now again, we're still in Death Valley.

554
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,940
 Now we have two accounts of underground cities in Death Valley.

555
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,540
 Or three, technically, because you had two guys with the first one.

556
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,940
 Now of course, one of them is Charles Manson, so you can take it with a grain of salt,

557
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,060
 or a hit of acid.

558
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:07,120
 But he said that in this, whenever a civilization comes close to being destroyed, the tuned

559
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,040
 in members, as he called them, of the tribes or the nation or whatever, would descend into

560
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
 Devil's Hole.

561
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:18,440
 So underneath the water, there's a land of, the rivers are of milk and honey, which is

562
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,360
 as evocative as that might be.

563
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,600
 That's disgusting.

564
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,280
 I want you to take some honey and some milk and mix it together, and tell me if you want

565
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,600
 that running down the river.

566
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,980
 It's all blah, blah, blah, blah.

567
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,660
 And big question, skim or whole milk, Charlie?

568
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,060
 What are we talking about here?

569
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,660
 But anyway, so milk and honey rivers, honey and milk rivers, whatever the phrasing is,

570
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,220
 a tree that has 12 types of fruit on it, one different fruit for each month.

571
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,700
 That's, I'd rather take a scientifically constructed wheelbarrow than a tree that I'm like, "Man,

572
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,900
 I really want an apple, but it's June and apples aren't popping up until October."

573
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,180
 So whatever, I don't eat apples actually, but it's still frustrating me that I'd have

574
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,640
 to wait for something, even if I didn't want it.

575
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,680
 So he told his followers, "We're going to start this race war.

576
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,920
 We're going to go into this underground water pit.

577
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,160
 We're going to find this ancient civilization where people are still alive from thousands

578
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
 of years ago.

579
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,880
 It's just this beautiful, peaceful place."

580
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,200
 Now his place was teeming with life as opposed to the dead city further off in Death Valley,

581
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
 but that was his plan.

582
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,720
 Now obviously, it didn't work.

583
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
 They started Helter Skelter.

584
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,040
 It was a total failure.

585
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,800
 They all got arrested.

586
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,880
 That was the end of it.

587
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,700
 But we still have the issue of Devil's Hole, which is a real place.

588
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,100
 You can visit it.

589
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,140
 It is a bottom, but people don't know how deep it is.

590
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,780
 People have tried swimming to the bottom of it and they've died because again, you're

591
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,780
 in Death Valley.

592
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,180
 It's not the most hospitable place, but it is out in the middle of nowhere.

593
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,620
 Nobody knows how deep it is, but you can visit it.

594
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,580
 You can actually go to it, but the government bought it.

595
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
 Government owns it.

596
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,560
 You can't actually go up to the rim of Devil's Hole.

597
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,600
 There is a massive fence with barbed wire wrapped around it.

598
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,160
 The government bought it and it's by the national, the Death Valley State Park, owns it.

599
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,880
 So you can go there and you can look at it.

600
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,680
 You can look at this hole of blue water in the middle of the desert, but you can't go

601
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
 in it.

602
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
 You can't test how deep it is.

603
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,760
 You can't do anything.

604
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,040
 Now their reasoning is there is a type of pupfish that it's the only place on earth that these

605
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,700
 pupfish still exist and these pupfish have been isolated from the rest of the world for

606
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,140
 10,000 years.

607
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,220
 So they say it's a conservation thing, which is possible, but it's so weird.

608
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,860
 If one of those two places were purchased by the government and was inaccessible to people,

609
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,260
 I would be like, "Okay, but this other place you can visit?"

610
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,140
 Like, yes, yes, the pupfish, but you can go to Windgate Pass and you can look around for

611
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,860
 this spooky treasure.

612
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,660
 But both of them in the same area are both controlled by the government.

613
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,180
 They're inaccessible to civilians.

614
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,800
 That's down there.

615
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,760
 I'm not giving a lot of credence to Charlie Manson stuff, but again, if he had placed

616
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:00,080
 that same legend in Eureka, California or Baja, Mexico, the fact that they're both relatively

617
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
 in the same location, they both tell the same story.

618
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,080
 Now of course, Charles Manson could have read Death Valley Men and got his information from

619
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:16,640
 that, but when the government buys property, just buys it full off and makes it inaccessible

620
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,180
 to other people.

621
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,500
 It raises suspicions no matter where it's at.

622
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,660
 But the fact that they happen to purchase the legendary portals to the underworld in

623
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,020
 two different locations in the same geographical area, what's going on down there?

624
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,060
 We talked about that in the previous episode too and I said I'd address it later, where

625
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,860
 is the government covering up the existence of previous civilizations?

626
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,540
 I want to believe no.

627
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,260
 I think that's a ridiculous conspiracy theory.

628
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,160
 There is an urban legend that the Smithsonian has been going around the world destroying

629
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
 proof of 8 foot tall mummies.

630
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,600
 It's such a specific rumor and I've always dismissed it.

631
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,960
 I've always thought that was completely ridiculous that the Smithsonian would walk around with

632
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,760
 hammers and mallets and they're just like, "Dy, desiccated corpse!"

633
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
 None of this ever happened.

634
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,720
 They're basically the men in bandages.

635
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,160
 They go around and they erase people's memories if they ever seen 8 foot tall mummy and destroy

636
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
 the evidence.

637
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,460
 But then I come across stuff like this and it makes me go, "Maybe there's something

638
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,020
 to that ridiculous conspiracy theory."

639
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,540
 I don't believe that the Smithsonian is going around destroying 8 foot tall mummies, but

640
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,380
 I'm a little more suspicious.
