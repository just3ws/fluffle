1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 You're riding in your car with your family and you see a massive UFO in the distance

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,480
 But you're the only one who sees it and no one believes you but will they believe you when a gray

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,040
 breaks into your house and

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,240
 Then we take a trip around the world to discover a disturbing connection between

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,960
 unwanted children and

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,080
 Killer ghosts today on Dead Rabbit Radio

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,520
 *Music*

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:39,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,700
 My day was actually quite rough and they did something I don't normally do

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,040
 It was such a rough day and my back has been killing me that I took a shot of vodka

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,480
 Probably about 15 minutes ago

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,040
 Well, it was actually more than shot and it was inside of a diet coke. So let's go ahead and start it with the episode

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,800
 I don't know how this is gonna turn out. I don't think I've ever I've done the show with hangovers before

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,920
 And I might have once done it with a buzz

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,640
 So we'll see how this works because right now I'm buzzing pretty hard when you're on keto

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,440
 Alcohol actually hits you a lot harder because your pancreas is functioning differently. Let's go ahead and get started here now

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,280
 This first story I mentioned briefly yesterday

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,840
 But we're gonna go ahead and really delve into it today. The year is

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
 1994 the place is

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,240
 Lapierre, Michigan. I always think it's so funny when people go my hometown's in an episode. It's funny how many

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,760
 Weird stories have happened in people's towns around the world and they're just completely unaware of it

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,320
 But I can guarantee at least one listener either lives in La Pierre or knows of La Pierre

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,860
 I didn't know about it. So I'm not one of those listeners, but someone's gonna go well golly. That's where I live

25
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,020
 I'm not seeing everyone from La Pierre is Tom Sawyer because I don't know anything about the town

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,000
 It may be completely urban city. It may be a suburb of affluent people

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,220
 I don't know or it could be full of a bunch of Tom Sawyer clones. I don't know golly

28
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:13,120
 They have a huge their biggest import is single stalks of wheat so they can put between their teeth

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,200
 They walk around but anyways in La Pierre, Michigan in 1994 this kid tells this story

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,600
 Well, he's an adult when he's telling the story, but this happened to him when he was a kid

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,800
 I know that's confusing but that's just the way I phrased it an adult

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,960
 Back up here. This episode is already going off the rails an adult tells a story about what happened to him in

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:42,000
 1994 when he was younger and that's important because the way people interact with adults and the way people interact with kids is completely different

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,920
 For for many reasons one kids are generally stupid and two kids are prone to making stuff up

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,560
 But as an adult he tells the story his mom was driving him and a friend back from bowling

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,040
 Which now that I see my nose the fact that the best thing they could do on a Saturday night was bowling really makes me think

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,280
 I'm on point with the wheat stalk imports

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,360
 But anyways, so mom was driving this boy this unnamed boy will call him Tom

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,480
 We'll just call him Tom because it fits he's right. She's driving because he doesn't say his name

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,520
 She's driving Tom and his friend Huck back from bowling right and they had another guy who they hung out with the bowling alley

41
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,480
 But I'm not gonna say his name so anyways

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,160
 Otherwise this will get banned from YouTube so Tom and Huck and we'll just call him Jim

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,480
 We're all hanging out at the bowling alley and so Tom and Huck are like bye and the mom's like who's that?

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,800
 Who's your nice friend again?

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,440
 And they're like we don't say his name in public even in 1994

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,800
 But anyways the mom's like let's that's odd so they all hop in their car

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,240
 They hop in the mom's car. They're driving down the road and he's looking out the window and there's a big empty field

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,640
 And he sees in the it's like dark. It's late at night. They're coming over from the bowling alley

49
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,960
 He's looking out the window as you're driving by this big field

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
 He sees a massive

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,200
 Actually what he sees is he sees all these lights and his first instinct

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,880
 He says I thought a football game was being played out in the field like I thought it was a stadium game

53
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,680
 It was that light out but as I continued to look at it

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,040
 I realized that it wasn't a football game. It was a giant triangle with lights on it

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,360
 So he's seeing this triangle out there now. He starts pointing it out. He's flipping out

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,440
 He's like mom. Huck look he's pointing out the window at this massive triangle and they don't respond to him

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,600
 The mom is just staring straight ahead driving and Huck in the back seat is not making any motions

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 Not looking not making any any reference to this massive UFO that's out in this field and then the vehicle just

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,920
 Darts away super fast which again is typical of UFOs. It just you know and after it leaves

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,560
 He's this is what happened. He's like mom Huck look look out the window. Come on guys

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,760
 Look look and they're not responding and then it flies away

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,280
 And he's like look look you got a look and at that point both the mom and Huck look out the window and see nothing at all

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,120
 Almost like mid-sentence as he's imploring them to see what he's seen after it zips away

64
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,320
 Then they're unfrozen and they see nothing and they start making fun of them

65
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,640
 They're like ah Tom always with the tall tails and he's like no no no no. I'm not making this up

66
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
 I actually saw this massive UFO

67
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,960
 Triangle flying out in the field, but since they didn't see it

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,600
 They basically made fun of him until he got home

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,720
 He said that he saw it two more times now

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,120
 I'm a little iffy on that detail because it just says he said he saw it two more times

71
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,640
 I don't know if he saw it two more times on the right home, which if that's the case then the info is just kind of

72
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,720
 Being a dick. It's like flying around keeps freezing his friends

73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,600
 He's but or it could be that he saw it two more times before this last event

74
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,960
 But again, he says I saw it two more times when nobody else saw it

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,480
 So I still imagine this UFO is a dick like he's at high school. He's doing his homework

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,720
 He looks out the window UFOs stand in the front yard. He's like guys look look the whole classroom is frozen

77
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,280
 He's at prom everyone's taking prom photos his day gets replaced with the giant triangle

78
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,840
 He's like guys look look no one pays attention to him at that point

79
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,640
 UFOs just kind of being a jerk because it keeps appearing in front of them and

80
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,120
 Freezing everyone no one else can see it

81
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,480
 So either this UFO has is totally trolling this kid or this kid has some sort of brain damage

82
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,120
 He hallucinates triangles, but the story wraps up like this

83
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,440
 So Tom goes over a while later. It doesn't tell us how long but Tom goes over to Hux House to have a sleepover

84
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,000
 He's over at Hux House. He's having a sleepover and they're sleeping in Hux basement in the middle of the night

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
 He wakes up something

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,320
 Just startles him and he comes out of a deep sleep

87
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,400
 He sees

88
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,400
 The stairs leading into the basement so he wakes up and he's able to have a clear view in the dark of the stairs that lead

89
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,520
 Down to the dark basement now. I'm assuming they're not in a dark super spooky Freddy Krueger basement

90
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,660
 But technically all basements are super spooky Freddy Krueger basements

91
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:05,500
 He's sitting there in the dark and he's looking at the stairway and he starts to hear something walking down the stairs

92
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:15,140
 Not the most healthy thing not the most healthy thing, but he hears it walking down the stairs

93
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,120
 He looks up and he sees peering between

94
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,200
 The banister so you know how you have a staircase and you have like the banister and then you have like the rungs in

95
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,200
 The middle you guys have seen staircases before

96
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,480
 But in between the slats of the staircase he see he hears something walking on the stairs and he's looking

97
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,640
 He can't really figure it out

98
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,600
 Then you see something holding on to two slats and with his face pressed between

99
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,560
 Banister thing, you know, I'm trying to build a visual, but I don't know the terminology

100
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,420
 You've been to stairs before you've seen stairs in your life

101
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,380
 Imagine being a kid looking in the darkness and seeing someone peeking through the staircase

102
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,900
 There's a great alien just staring at him

103
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,740
 little three-foot tall creature

104
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:06,460
 Looking at him in the darkness and then Tom is looking at this thing and he says I see you

105
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:14,180
 Which is an interesting thing that he said because he has had so many encounters with these vehicles

106
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,760
 And he's constantly telling people he sees it and nobody believes him

107
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,760
 But now he's face-to-face with this creature from another world and he says it plain as day

108
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,160
 He's finally stating it. I see you and in that moment the alien

109
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:40,640
 Vanishes doesn't run up the stairs doesn't run down the stairs doesn't hide in the washing machine just blinks out of existence

110
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,940
 Now that's where Tom's story ends

111
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,840
 But I don't necessarily know if that's true

112
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,300
 Because Tom saw the UFO and it zipped away and no one believed him

113
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,780
 The UFO was able to appear in plain sight when to his prom took his virginity and was able to

114
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:09,460
 Deceive everyone that there was no UFO there and when he looked at that alien that gray and said I see you and it vanished

115
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,740
 Did the alien go back to its mother ship or did the alien finally figure out?

116
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,000
 Which human kept noticing it?

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,080
 Moved out of his field of vision moved out of his ability to see and still followed that boy around

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,100
 cloaked

119
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
 hidden out of sight

120
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,300
 But always right behind him

121
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,280
 Let's go ahead and move on to that was creepy enough little gray alien like as you're listening into this podcast

122
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,680
 You're driving in your car. She'll gray alien behind you

123
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,220
 Just looking and you turn around

124
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,600
 He's not there

125
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,020
 Or even better if you're listening to this podcast in bed God help you if you do I know a couple people do I wouldn't even listen to

126
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,140
 This podcast in bed you're listening to the podcast in bed

127
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,700
 It's you're laying on your stomach so your back is to everything in the room and while you're listening to it

128
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:12,520
 You feel those large black emotionless eyes on you actually maybe more than one gray alien

129
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,360
 He's watching you right now

130
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,240
 Sorry sorry guys, sorry guys blame that one on the vodka shot claim that one on the vodka shot

131
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,240
 Well, I just lost 50 subscribers because of that description people like I'm gonna listen to your podcast anymore

132
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
 Now you're intentionally scaring me jerk

133
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,300
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now if you thought that story had a grim ending

134
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:42,100
 You have no idea what's coming up none and I will say this this particular segment is quite

135
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,740
 insensitive so

136
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,860
 I'll see you guys. I'll see a good chunk of you tomorrow once I start talking about this feel free to just skip ahead

137
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:58,100
 Whatever move on till tomorrow because this episode this gets a little dark here. We're gonna travel around the world

138
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
 We're gonna look at some interesting

139
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:08,020
 Cryptid spirits ghosts what whatever you want to call it first off. We're gonna start off. You know what?

140
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:16,740
 Because we're traveling all over the world. We haven't done that in a while and because this is actually if this is an episode 250

141
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,400
 I think it's like 249. It's close enough guys

142
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,080
 It's back in action. Let's hop on board the carpenter copter get on

143
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,800
 Take your bags get all your stuff and you might want to carry a back brace and some knee braces

144
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,220
 But go yeah, put them on strap them on hop on the new improved carpenter copter because we are going to use this

145
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:45,380
 Brilliantly designs device. It's actually just a helicopter. It's not space-age material or anything

146
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,100
 But I might be over hyping it get on the copter. Just come on get on the copter

147
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,840
 I'm not gonna sell it anymore carpenter copter is back in action. We have it repaired

148
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,040
 We're ready to go. I actually meant to bring it back a couple episodes, but I forgot I was gonna do I did some UFO episode

149
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,440
 And I was gonna have that carpenter copter to show up totally forgot it was in my notes, but it's here now

150
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,380
 It's here for the story of ghost babies now ghost babies is a

151
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:16,440
 Quote-unquote legitimate phenomenon and you'll understand what I mean in a second, but if you have a problem with

152
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,600
 If you have a problem with infants like being left in the way everyone has a problem with infants being left in the wood

153
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,080
 but if you have a problem with stories about

154
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:33,980
 Babies being left in the wood and again everyone has problem with trying to figure out the best way to put a disclaimer on this if you

155
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
 Don't like stories of infants in peril

156
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,760
 I'll see you tomorrow, but know that the carpenter copter is here

157
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,480
 So when we mentioned in a later episode you're like where'd that come from it must have been the episode

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
 I skipped the ghost baby episode

159
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:53,000
 How about the carpenter copter we are taking a trip to Scandinavia is that a place is that Scandinavia is a

160
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,660
 Like a language right? I know it's a folklorist system. Is that just the Nordic countries anyways you get in the carpenter copter, dude

161
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,560
 We're going to Scandinavia. We're just flying around until we see a country called Scandinavia

162
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,600
 You're like dude. We're gonna be flying around for an awful long time. I'm like shut up. Just get inside

163
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,360
 You're like dude, didn't you just say you drink vodka? I'm all fine

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,360
 Okay, anyways

165
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:24,080
 Carpenter copters are gonna probably crash this episode too, but we're going to Scandinavia and in Scandinavia we land

166
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,440
 We eventually find it might actually be a real country and that bit didn't work at all

167
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
 but we land and

168
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,160
 We meet these villagers and they're like a

169
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,680
 Why they're rostafarians we meet these villagers and they're like hello good travelers

170
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,800
 Welcome to our fictional country or it may be true

171
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,920
 I am norvish. Hey norvish. How you doing? He's like yeah, yeah enough of the introduction

172
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,400
 So norvish tells us this story. So norvish says you guys can do whatever you want, but don't go for hikes alone

173
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,040
 like why not he goes because

174
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,760
 of the myling

175
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,000
 The myling is what you got to look out for. I'm like, what's a myling norvish is like. I'm glad you asked

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I'm glad you take a seat by this fire

177
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,040
 Because I smoked this alien marijuana

178
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,880
 And tell you the story of the myling now the myling is also known as a

179
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,600
 ut bird and an

180
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,680
 ut bird ut bird

181
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,280
 so

182
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,800
 Myling comes from an old Swedish word that means murder

183
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,040
 So you're like we're off to a good start some sort of murder ghost

184
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,120
 But ut this word starts to get dark ut bird means that which is taken outside

185
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,840
 So you would call garbage ut bird. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, but I like saying it

186
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,760
 But it means specifically the ghost imagine having a ghost

187
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,240
 Nothing to think about it ut bird means something to take outside i.e. garbage

188
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,720
 But this ghost is also called an ut bird. Imagine if you were a ghost and your name is just garbage

189
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,120
 Trash you have like a phantasm. You have a poltergeist

190
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,280
 You have a specter and then you just have trash trash ghost

191
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,440
 That'd be the worst way to die even a garbage man would be like this sucks

192
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,280
 I don't know why I don't know why I assumed garbage. I'm in love trash

193
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,000
 I'm I think the alcohol is kicking in more now anyways ut bird means thing

194
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,800
 That which is taken outside and so the story is this in Scandinavia. They have these folk lorish legends that unbaptized children who die

195
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,080
 And that can include all sorts of stuff more specifically children who are left in the elements to die

196
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,240
 It's been done all over the world. You have a baby that you don't want

197
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,440
 You don't need or has some sort of deformity

198
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,640
 You would basically take it out into the middle of nowhere or actually just take it at three feet from your house

199
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,960
 And leave it there and eventually it would die of cold it would die of heat

200
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,360
 It would die of wolves

201
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,160
 Barret eat it a bunch of crows would carry it away. Whatever now oddly enough. It wasn't 100 fatal

202
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,160
 Sometimes people would find it sometimes animals would raise it like mogulie

203
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,760
 So it can have a happy ending but for the most part the babies just died

204
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,920
 So dark episode here dark episode. So these spirits are

205
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,840
 Dead dead babies

206
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,600
 There are the spirits of babies who specifically have been left in the woods or left anywhere outside

207
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,960
 Or inside just neglecting babies is what i'm trying to say or unbaptized babies who die

208
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:33,720
 Now the legend goes like this these creatures in the scandinavian regions they will haunt the area where they died

209
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,720
 So there are huge problem for hikers and travelers and stuff like that because if someone took their kid and left it in the woods

210
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:49,400
 And then bounced and then a couple days later it dies or a couple hours later it died. Oh my god. So so dark

211
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,640
 And then a couple months later you are hiking down the woods going man

212
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,160
 What a beautiful day look at those squirrels are hanging out and they're playing chess and look at birds are singing and making cinderella's dress

213
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,360
 That rhymes and then there's like a dead baby 10 feet away from the trail

214
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,280
 You're not going to know about it. So these things can haunt areas. They're not spooky like graveyard hauntings or

215
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,120
 abandoned castles or mental asylums and stuff like that. They're just like landmines sitting in the middle of fields

216
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,680
 So you're walking down the trail late at night and you hear the sound of a crying baby

217
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,200
 And you're like that's where to middle of nowhere. There's no babies around you check your pockets

218
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,400
 You don't have any babies. You didn't bring any babies with you. Where's that sound coming from?

219
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,600
 At that point the myling jumps on your back and demands to be taken to a cemetery

220
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,960
 It needs to go to hallowed ground to be buried to be at peace

221
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,160
 So you're like, whoa chill baby chill chill. Yeah, dude. I'll totally take you to a cemetery. No big deal

222
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,960
 It sucks your parents left you out here. I will take you to a cemetery now in a rational world

223
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,720
 That's how it would work the mylings the ute birds don't work like that

224
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,360
 They jump on your back and they demand you take them to a cemetery and almost as kind of the ultimate dick move

225
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,400
 They don't let you take them there. That's where they want to go

226
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,880
 But what happens is the closer you get to the cemetery you closer you get to hallowed ground like a church yard or whatever

227
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,040
 It gets heavier and heavier and heavier to the point where you imagine, okay

228
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,240
 It will get so heavy you will begin to sink into the earth. That's impossible

229
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,600
 If a steamroller rolls you over you don't sink into the earth

230
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,480
 Like you just flatten but anyways, so you're walking and you're like, yeah, dude. I'll take you to the cemetery

231
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,600
 No problem. It's just hot. Oh, he hops on your back. He's like, yeah, I guess that's a good way

232
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
 I was gonna put you in my pocket, but we're all my other babies ago

233
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,520
 Anyways, you're walking to the cemetery, but the closer you get the heavier he gets to the point that very rarely do they get to the cemetery

234
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,600
 Most of the time travelers will collapse and die before they get there or they'll be smushed into the earth

235
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,920
 But sometimes they do get to the place where they're going the myling hops off their back. The dude's like, oh, thank god, man

236
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,360
 Oh my back and the myling is now

237
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,040
 Fine it is now fan hallowed ground and can be a piece

238
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,240
 Also, if you can't make to the cemetery and you don't get crushed they just rip your throat out

239
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,480
 So the creatures are quite vicious. Even though they are the victims of a horrible crime

240
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,320
 They they stop you from getting to where they order you to go

241
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,800
 And if you don't get crushed or sink into the earth, they just rip your throat out

242
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,400
 So that's the story of the mylings or the ut birds different names for different regions

243
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,880
 But the same type of creature

244
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,040
 But let's go ahead and hop back into the carpenter copter

245
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,960
 And let's go to germany and you're like jason are we just going to germany?

246
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,760
 So you can tell me another depressing story about abandoned kids

247
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,280
 Kind of pop in the helicopter. Just get it. Just get it

248
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:47,080
 We're going to germany and that is where we meet the the wider ganger and in german that means one who walks again

249
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,320
 So it is either a reference to a zombie or just a lazy person who's always on the couch and they're like, oh

250
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,080
 Look at the wider garden as you get up off the couch to go get some more cheetos

251
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
 And then you go back to the couch

252
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,760
 But anyways in general it is a reference to a zombie one who walks again a dead person who's come back to life

253
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,720
 And within the wider garner there is a specific subset of it known as the off-hacker

254
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,080
 What's an off-hacker you ask? Well, good question. Good question

255
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,840
 An off-hacker will literally the name off-hacker means

256
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,480
 leap upon

257
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
 Because it jumps on people's backs

258
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,880
 You're like, oh, that's kind of weird. We have Scandinavian myths when this is a german creature

259
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,440
 So fairly close

260
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,840
 Maybe some cultural contamination both creatures jump on your back, but let's keep going here

261
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,040
 The off-hacker is a shape shifter that can shape shift into a werewolf

262
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,600
 Or anything else

263
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,600
 And when I read that I thought why would you want to shape shift into anything other than a werewolf?

264
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,000
 The werewolf might be the most badass cryptid on the planet. A werewolf could take on 10 bigfoots. No problem

265
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,680
 I really don't think outside of a god level cryptid like the Groot Slaying which we covered in like episode 53 or something like that

266
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,160
 I think the werewolf might actually be the most vicious of all cryptids

267
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,160
 So this thing can become a werewolf a houseplant a telephone

268
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,520
 Norvish a carboner copter, but why would you become anything other than a badass werewolf?

269
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,560
 I don't know but this is the off-hackers

270
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,760
 MO this is what they do late at night when a lone traveler is walking through the woods

271
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,720
 This creature will jump on your back as the name says off-hacker and

272
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,560
 Demand you take it to hallowed ground

273
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,200
 That's kind of weird

274
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
 Now the regions are fairly close

275
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,000
 But this creature will jump on your back and demand to be taken to hallowed ground

276
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,440
 But as you get closer to the hallowed ground

277
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,720
 He gets heavier and heavier

278
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,200
 and heavier

279
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,760
 And if you didn't get crushed by the weight it would rip your throat out

280
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,520
 Now the fact that we have two similar

281
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,840
 Demons cryptids spirits however you want to describe them

282
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,680
 Within a northern europe is basically where both of these myths come from you could say

283
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,800
 People from germany went to scandinavia and people from the scandinavian countries went to germany

284
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,440
 cultural contamination

285
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,880
 maybe

286
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
 Most likely yes, you're right

287
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:34,360
 The first one had to do with little babies. This one is just some sort of creature that likes to jump on people's backs

288
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,200
 It's not connected to infants

289
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,520
 So there's enough of a difference between those two

290
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,160
 Maybe it's just an idea of people playing telephone with folklore and the myth grows

291
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:51,000
 So are you trying to say because there was a similar myth in germany and a similar myth in the scandinavian countries that

292
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,360
 There's some reason to think that there really is some sort of spirit that haves some people's backs

293
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,360
 And they get heavy and heavy and heavier until they crushed until they're crushed

294
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,560
 And if they're not crushed to death they get their throat stripped off and they both want to go to hallowed ground

295
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,040
 Are you trying to tell me there that this thing might be real because you've made a connection between these two?

296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,840
 Let's go to japan

297
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,160
 In japan, there is a creature known as the konaki gigi

298
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,720
 which literally means

299
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,880
 old man crying

300
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,240
 So you can talk all you want about cultural contamination and folklore between germany and scandinavia

301
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,560
 because there is going to be a

302
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,680
 Source of that but when you're looking at folklore, we're looking at old old stuff and yes

303
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,440
 You had germany working with norway. You had german not working. They didn't have a business together

304
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,520
 But the germans and the norwegians and the swedish people and all that stuff. They knew each other from way way back

305
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,120
 They were bros

306
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,240
 Back from when they were just a bunch of barbarians running around. I'm sure that there was cultural contamination

307
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,080
 But when we look at similar time periods in japan

308
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,240
 This is what they tell us a konaki gigi is

309
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,640
 It's a shape shifter

310
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,880
 But this one actually can only shift between two forms. No one of them is not a werewolf

311
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,280
 It can either become an old man who sounds like a baby when he cries

312
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,360
 Which is its natural form. Actually. It's an old man who sounds like a baby when he cries

313
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:24,440
 Or it can just be a baby. It can be try to choose between an old man who sounds like a baby or a baby and

314
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,720
 To even make it even more weird sometimes the old man has a baby face

315
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,880
 And sometimes the baby has an old man face and i'll leave it up to you to decide

316
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,560
 Which one is creepier if you're walking down a city street and you turn down an alley, what would be creepier

317
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,720
 seeing a

318
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,200
 one-year-old baby with the face of an old man like benjamin button or

319
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,240
 An old man looking at you, but his face is perfectly smooth and round and he looks like

320
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,960
 John candy he looks like a baby john candy, but the rest of his body is like a 90 pound old

321
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,600
 Like weak frail man. I'll give you

322
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,200
 You guys can decide which one's creepier. I know half of my audience is like who the hell's john candy

323
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,120
 It's a dated reference. I know I know who's a new fat actor

324
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,200
 Um who looks young. Uh, what if you turn around the corner and you saw

325
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,600
 Chris I would say chris farley, but you always look like he was on a bunch of drugs

326
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,120
 He never looked like a baby

327
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,760
 Who would you turn around and i'm spinning way too much time on this

328
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,040
 But you turn around a corner and you see an old 90 pound man

329
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,680
 with the face of

330
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,520
 Melissa mccarthy, how's that melissa mccarthy? Sorry melissa. You've lost a lot of weight

331
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,280
 I've congratulated you on your weight loss, but melissa mccarthy

332
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,680
 From that terrible television show she was on that face on

333
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,280
 Old man that took way too long to describe anyways, so

334
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,680
 It's a shape shifter

335
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,080
 He become two things an old man who sounds like a baby or a baby and you're like jason just get to the

336
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,920
 Just tell me the tell me the creepy boy. Okay. Okay. Anyways, this is his mo in japan

337
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,680
 They have this legend

338
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,920
 You walk in your lone traveler walking through the woods. You hear the sound of a baby crying

339
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,000
 You go and you pick up the baby and if you don't the baby just hops on your back

340
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,600
 You don't have a choice

341
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,000
 The baby then turns into an old man

342
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,840
 And this one just crushes you immediately

343
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,280
 He doesn't say take me to find peace. He doesn't go take me to be buried

344
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,000
 He just crushes you the second he's on your back. The weight of him is so heavy

345
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
 You get crushed into the earth

346
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,640
 There's different versions of how a konaki gg is created

347
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,080
 But one of the versions is if a baby is left in the wilderness to die

348
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,400
 It becomes this

349
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,160
 vengeful spirit

350
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,160
 I find it interesting that across the world and you could say the first two are northern europe

351
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,160
 But I find it and i'm sure there's more variations of it. They're all fairly specific

352
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,080
 Let's look at the similarities between these things. They attack lone travelers

353
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,560
 They use deception to get a hold of you. They either shape shift. Well, they almost always shape shift into something that you don't expect

354
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,560
 They jump on your back and they all crush you now

355
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,720
 You can say like there's not even that many similarities

356
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,360
 There's more similarities between these three creatures and ghosts in general

357
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,720
 Some ghosts float through walls. Some ghosts wear clothes

358
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,240
 Some ghosts you see some ghosts you don't like there's not a lot of similarities between ghosts overall

359
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,760
 That's why they've had to categorize them like poltergeists or phantasms or specters like I was mentioning earlier

360
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,440
 but you have these different legends of creatures around the world of

361
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,240
 something that

362
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,600
 disguises itself as something jumps on your back crushes you

363
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,360
 Two of the versions they tell you to take them to hallowed ground

364
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,080
 Two other versions both basically state their babies left in the woods

365
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,680
 And those are the two farthest apart the Scandinavian one we can take the germany one and we could say well

366
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,320
 You're close enough to scan an avial will lump those together, but the northern european one and the japanese one

367
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:03,320
 Still have enough similarities to make one think that at some point this phenomenon was real

368
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:10,120
 That at some point in human history there was some sort of vengeful spirit that would

369
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,440
 Jump out of the woods jump on your back and kill you and may have been related to an abandoned baby

370
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,840
 Now the skeptic of me says what's happening is people are finding lone travelers just flat on the ground and they were having heart attacks

371
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,320
 And they made up this story

372
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,080
 But even if that's true, I find it weird that the story they made up in northern europe is the same story they made up in japan

373
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,960
 But all that being said

374
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,880
 The truth of the matter is when we see similarities between these stories across the world

375
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,080
 It does give it a hint of something real

376
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
 And what's even more frightening generally?

377
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,200
 Infants around the world are considered the most precious thing

378
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,120
 They are so innocent and untouched by the evils of the world and you have what makes these stories scary

379
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,420
 Is you have the families that are responsible for leaving these kids out on the wilderness?

380
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,440
 Unpunished

381
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,800
 It is the lone traveler walking through the woods

382
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,160
 that basically

383
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
 Triggers this

384
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,840
 vengeful spirit

385
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:23,560
 It's not a creature that goes after and slowly takes down everyone who was mean to it. It gets you

386
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,880
 Who had nothing to do with it who doesn't even know it's there?

387
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,320
 It gets you and kills you

388
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,880
 For the simple mistake of walking by where it died

389
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,080
 It may or may not be real

390
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,400
 And to be honest it most likely isn't but that doesn't mean that when you're out hiking by yourself

391
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,640
 You shouldn't

392
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
 be

393
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,800
 aware

394
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,760
 Of what may be in the bushes just beyond the field of view

395
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,800
 Because we live in a wicked world

396
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:05,000
 And where you walk every single day the roads you take the alleys you stroll down the woods you hike into find peace

397
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,720
 You don't really know what happened there before

398
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,920
 Because the world

399
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,960
 Can be very very cruel

400
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,400
 So when you think you're alone in the woods

401
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,760
 And you think someone's watching you

402
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,880
 Just walk a little bit faster

403
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,840
 Because what is watching you?

404
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,160
 May be something that has long been forgotten

405
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 In the mists of folklore

406
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,840
 You may be able to avoid being found in the middle of the trail the coroner's report

407
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,920
 suffered a heart attack very young for their age to have died like this

408
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,480
 Couldn't breathe

409
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,920
 fell down

410
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,360
 They're dead

411
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
 when in reality

412
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,440
 you made the

413
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,680
 simple mistake

414
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,920
 Of walking past somebody else's sin

415
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,160
