1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
 Can killing your friend help you join the Illuminati?

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,700
 And today we take a look at the history and magic of penis worship.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:21,200
 [Music]

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,700
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,400
 Hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
 I took a nap.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,100
 I don't know if it's technically considered a nap when you started at 7pm,

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,500
 but I was tired, man.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,200
 I woke up and it was dead silent outside.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,600
 And I'm like, okay, fine.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,200
 I'm kind of like bustling around the house, getting stuff together to record this podcast.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,700
 And it was so creepily quiet outside, I started to think like, did I die?

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,300
 That's always my go-to thought.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,800
 Like if I walk outside and there's no cars or people,

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,700
 I'm always like, maybe I'm dead.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,400
 And then of course, once I start recording the podcast, a bunch of cars drive by.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
 So it's just going to be one of those kind of nights.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,900
 So I wanted to start the episode off with this is again,

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,600
 and I know this show has had a lot of these stories,

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,400
 stories that I've come across in the past and I've been like,

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,400
 oh yeah, man, I really want to talk about this.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,600
 And I never really had an outlet for it other than like forums.

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,300
 Now, so this story was, it's a couple of years old.

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
 It's fascinating though.

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,400
 I remember reading it and I was thinking this,

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
 I want, if I could sit in any trial in America, I would sit in this trial.

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,000
 So this happened back in 2013.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,200
 There were two young men, this was in West Virginia, I believe.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
 Yeah, in Virginia.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
 There are these two young men, these two young rappers,

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,800
 and they're sitting there, they're smoking weed, listening to music,

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,900
 talking about, you know, gravity and talking about the Illuminati and talking about like,

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,300
 all this stuff, you know, as 20 year old men will do when they're smoking weed

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,600
 or anyone will do when they're smoking weed.

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,500
 And then, so one of them, Wafik Sabir El-Amin,

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,000
 so we'll call him El-Amin from here on out,

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 he goes, hmm, he gets this little nugget in his brain.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
 He realizes something,

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,000
 a plan that he's always known now finally has to take place.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,600
 So he gets up and he gets his gun.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,300
 He walks back into the living room and he points it at his friend's head.

44
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,100
 Now his friend is, so his friend Curtis Brown is sitting there

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,700
 and El-Amin walks up to Curtis Brown.

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,800
 It's an, I imagine it's like a house and it's full of like red lights

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,700
 and there's a bunch of smoke everywhere, the casting spells.

48
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,200
 And he points his gun at his friend, childhood friend Brown and says,

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,300
 you are my sacrifice.

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,500
 And he goes to pull the trigger.

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 Now, despite how drunk Curtis Brown or stoned or probably both,

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,600
 Curtis Brown was, he reaches for his gun as well.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 And they have a brief shoot off.

54
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,900
 Brief shoot out is the term and El-Amin, the idiot,

55
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,600
 the fire the first shot got shot in the stomach.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,700
 Brown, the bullet just grazed past his head

57
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,300
 and he actually lost some vision because of like bone fragments.

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,100
 I like, when I say graze, I like at the side of his head or whatever.

59
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,700
 And so anyways, it came out and when the store,

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,200
 when El-Amin first got arrested, what happened was,

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,400
 he was so into the Illuminati that he believed that,

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
 not into the Illuminati, that's what he wanted.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,500
 He believed that to be a rap superstar, both these guys are rappers,

64
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
 to be a rap superstar, he had to murder,

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,300
 he had to give a blood sacrifice to the Illuminati.

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,600
 Once he did that, the Illuminati would accept him in

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,100
 and then he would be world famous.

68
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
 And that's why he said, you are my sacrifice.

69
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,900
 Now, El-Amin says, no, no, no, that didn't happen.

70
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,600
 He shot at me first and I was trying to offend myself,

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,900
 but El-Amin was found guilty.

72
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,600
 I think he's got eight years for the crime.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,900
 Brown was like, yeah, no, he was talking about the Illuminati all the time

74
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
 and they found a bunch of Illuminati related materials in his room

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,300
 and it was just such a weird story.

76
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
 And I remember reading at the time and I go,

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,100
 I'm surprised this kind of doesn't happen more often.

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,300
 Adding the drugs into the whole makes some people and maybe it does.

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,100
 I probably doesn't actually, but you know, I was like,

80
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,700
 I wonder why this doesn't happen more often.

81
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,800
 People get so worked up about this stuff like,

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,700
 oh, I want to be rich and famous and but the Illuminati control everything

83
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,500
 and I can't, you know, I'm not a member of the bloodline.

84
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,900
 So I'm going to start looking at these rituals and stuff like that.

85
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,900
 A lot of times you'll see people, especially on the 4chan's export,

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,900
 they'll talk about deals with the devil, deals with the devil.

87
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,700
 And I'm sure some aspect of that is real.

88
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,300
 Some aspect of that works in some sense.

89
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,300
 But yeah, I was like, I'd love to sit in that courtroom because I'm thinking,

90
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,400
 are they going to how many times am I going to hear these lawyers have to talk

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,600
 about the Illuminati in the courtroom?

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,300
 The trial was only two days too.

93
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,500
 I mean, it was a pretty cut and dry case.

94
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,700
 But again, it's just such a weird story.

95
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,800
 This young man, he's lucky he didn't get killed and that he's lucky he didn't

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,400
 kill the other guy and he's just doing eight years because that would have been

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,900
 even worse.

98
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,000
 That's not the way it works.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,700
 You just don't shoot your friend in your squalid apartment in the middle of

100
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,500
 the afternoon and then call 1900 Illuminati and get a membership.

101
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,700
 Like if a group like that does exist, how would they even know you did that?

102
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
 It doesn't make any sense.

103
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,500
 Now, speaking of that, speaking of friendly sacrifices to the Illuminati,

104
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,300
 guess who caught another body?

105
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,700
 Guess what?

106
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,500
 A plus name recognition, but B plus celebrity status.

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,900
 Singer recently lost another friend in the same way she lost her first friend.

108
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,100
 Of course, I'm talking about Lady Gaga.

109
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,600
 We did an episode on her way, way back when I was talking about conspiracy theories

110
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,700
 that I actually kind of believe and one of the ones I actually kind of believe was

111
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:04,500
 that Lady Gaga killed her songwriting companion back before when she was just Stephanie Jermado.

112
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,900
 If you remember this girl who had like the image and the look and all that stuff and

113
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,400
 was already making music and making videos and stuff like that, fell off of a building,

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
 fell off of a ledge and died.

115
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,500
 And there was questions of whether or not she committed suicide or if she was just clumsy

116
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,400
 or drunk or whatever.

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,700
 Lady Gaga had another friend, a guy named Zombie Boy who's covered in like head to

118
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,300
 toe and tattoos.

119
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,200
 He fell off his balcony and you're like, Jason, people fall off balconies.

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
 That's fair.

121
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
 That is fair.

122
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,700
 But he falls off his balcony and Lady Gaga tweets out, the suicide of friend Rick Janest,

123
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,200
 Zombie Boy is beyond devastating.

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,640
 We have to work harder to change the culture, bring mental health to the forefront and erase

125
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,200
 the stigma that we can't talk about.

126
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,400
 If you are suffering called a friend or family today, we must save each other.

127
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,640
 And I agree with that sentiment.

128
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,800
 The problem is, he didn't commit suicide.

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,900
 He was ruled as an accident.

130
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,840
 And his family were like, no, he had plans like way ahead.

131
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
 Like he had made all these plans.

132
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
 He was talking to his friend.

133
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
 It wasn't suicide.

134
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,400
 He's, it was an accident that she had to do a second tweet where she's like out of respect

135
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
 for Rick's family, Rick and his legacy.

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,560
 I apologize if I spoke too soon as there was no witness or evidence to support any conclusion

137
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,880
 for the cause of his death.

138
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,840
 I meant in no way to draw an unjust conclusion.

139
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,460
 So I mean, generally if you knew someone who fell off of something, I don't think you would

140
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,680
 jump to the conclusion that they committed suicide unless you knew something other people

141
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
 didn't.

142
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,920
 So that's two people, two very close friends that Lady Gaga has known who have both tumbled

143
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,680
 off of high buildings.

144
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,240
 I remember reading something a long time ago and it said, the CIA considers throwing people

145
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,800
 off buildings to be the perfect murder tool.

146
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,840
 Because there's no evidence.

147
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
 There's no fingerprints.

148
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
 There's nothing.

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,800
 They just people tumble out of a building and that's it.

150
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 So who knows?

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,920
 Did Lady Gaga sacrifice someone else for the Illuminati?

152
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,680
 The case continues, but we'll see.

153
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,380
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our last story of the night and that is the story

154
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,840
 of penis worship.

155
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,600
 Now penis worship is something that has popped upon the conspiracy iceberg and of course it's

156
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,880
 something that immediately draws your eye because it sounds so weird.

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,880
 And it's actually a fairly cut and dry story with a little twist at the end.

158
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,640
 Now there of course have been cultures that have worshiped penises.

159
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,120
 It's a sign of fertility.

160
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,360
 You can, you know, they'll draw it on cave paintings and then like the obelisk in Egypt

161
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
 has been considered like a fertility thing.

162
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,840
 There's all sorts of penis shaped statues in India or you know, penis shaped towers in

163
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,040
 India and so on and so forth.

164
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,360
 So penis worship in and of itself isn't too rare.

165
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:01,920
 I wanted to focus on some of the more interesting, weird stuff here and that was Jesus' foreskin.

166
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,520
 Now this is an interesting story because it's something that I never really thought about.

167
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,280
 I think it's more in the Catholic realm, but when Jesus was born after eight days due to

168
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,720
 Jewish tradition, he was circumcised.

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,400
 I guess there used to be eight days after Christmas the day of the holy circumcision,

170
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,360
 but it's, they don't, they don't celebrate it anymore.

171
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,360
 But anyways, so after eight days they circumcised poor little baby Jesus and in the apocryphal

172
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,280
 book of Thomas, which is like a book of the Bible that's actually not in the Bible, it's

173
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,160
 something that isn't considered canon.

174
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,400
 It's funny, that's where that word comes from.

175
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,840
 When Canon, canonical was a biblical term, a term to refer to the Bible.

176
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,560
 And now Canon refers to is the alien verse predator, requerium, Canon with the new predator

177
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
 movie coming out.

178
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,920
 It's completely ridiculous, but anyways, so the book's non-canonical, the, they say that

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,600
 they took off his foreskin and then gave it to a guy and said, "Put this in a box of

180
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,160
 liquid, not, you know, like preserving liquid and don't sell it, no matter how much anyone

181
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,440
 offers you and they're going to offer you a ton of money."

182
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,000
 So he ends up selling it and he ends up selling it to Mary Magdalene of all people and she's

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,480
 the hooker who ends up becoming Jesus' kind of best friend later on or confidant later

184
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
 on.

185
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,080
 But anyways, so you have Jesus' foreskin and the reason why this is important, and I didn't

186
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,360
 realize this until I was like halfway through like researching this, because again, I'm not

187
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
 really thinking relics, Catholics are all into the relics.

188
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,160
 But the story of Jesus is that he dies on the cross, he comes back three days later,

189
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,440
 he's walking around town for a while and then eventually he flies into the sky, he's drawn

190
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,040
 back up into heaven.

191
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,240
 So he didn't die, he had no bones left behind or anything like that, but he left his foreskin

192
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,800
 behind because that was taken off of him when he was a baby.

193
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,080
 I mean, obviously fingernail clippings and hair stuff would have been around too, anything

194
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,040
 that wasn't on him when he flew away.

195
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,120
 But now they have this little piece of skin and they're like, "This is the last remaining

196
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,680
 part or the last remaining, like, you know, there's hair and fingernail clipping, someone

197
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,560
 might have those, but this is like the last remaining flesh of Jesus on the planet Earth,

198
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
 the rest of him is gone."

199
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,840
 And so it had this storied kind of history, it didn't pop up again until 600 AD when Charlemagne

200
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,480
 gave it to this pope, he said, "Hey, thanks for helping me out, pope, here is a gift for

201
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,920
 you," opened it up, little piece of shuffled flesh, "What's this?"

202
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,040
 "Nah, it's nothing, I picked it up as swap mate, it's just Jesus' foreskin."

203
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,680
 There's been a lot of, you know, a lot of times with these relics, they kind of pop

204
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,640
 up everywhere, there's one church says they have it, this other church says they have

205
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,720
 it, and you see that with the Ark of the Covenant too, there's a couple churches that claim

206
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
 to have the Ark of the Covenant.

207
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,640
 And then eventually in, they kind of settle, it's kind of settled that there's a church

208
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,160
 in Calcutta that actually has the foreskin that is the one that passed down from the

209
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,120
 pope, from Charlemagne to the pope and so forth.

210
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,720
 And what's interesting is that people used to make pilgrimages there because it would

211
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,160
 cure you of all sorts of illnesses, holding it or being around, they probably didn't

212
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,000
 let them hold it, but you know what I mean, like being around it, it would help you would

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,640
 make barren women fertile, and like, I don't know, help your back and all that stuff.

214
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,240
 And in 1983, it went missing.

215
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,320
 In 1983, according to a priest, a group of men broke into his house and stole it, and

216
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,720
 now nobody knows where it's at.

217
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,360
 And the theory has always been that the thieves were the Vatican, they were like, "You know

218
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,800
 what, this is causing, this foreskin is causing way too much trouble for us.

219
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,360
 It looks ridiculous as far as like, we're trying to be like a modern church and we have

220
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,720
 people praying to a shriveled piece for all that, all we know is like a grapefruit, a

221
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,440
 rotted apple or something like that.

222
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,800
 I don't know why foreskin looks like an apple, but you know, Catholic churches like this

223
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
 is causing way too much trouble.

224
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,680
 They actually threatened to excommunicate anyone who even talked about it.

225
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,440
 They got so tired of hearing about this stupid foreskin thing.

226
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
 So they took it.

227
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
 That's the theory.

228
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,320
 You know, it's also interesting to think though that in 1983, in the 80s and the 90s, you

229
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,520
 know, as we're moving forward, if you wanted to clone Jesus, that's what you would have

230
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,200
 wanted to get your hands on.

231
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
 And that could have been a preemptive thing too.

232
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,280
 The Vatican could have been like, "Yes, we're tired of hearing about this stupid foreskin.

233
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,160
 It's dumb, it's ridiculous, it makes us look like a bunch of backward pagans."

234
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,880
 But at the same time, if it is accurate, we should probably get it in our hands, because

235
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,800
 if somebody wants to try to do some tomfoolery, that's what they're going to do.

236
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,960
 They're going to get it and they're going to clone them or whatever.

237
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
 I wonder if he'd be cloned.

238
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,520
 I wonder if he'd have the beard if he cloned them.

239
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,000
 And I understand he doesn't pop out of like a cloning chamber in his robes and stuff like

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,260
 that, but like, I wonder if they're...

241
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,160
 And I know that like the typical image of Jesus is the white guy is inaccurate.

242
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,280
 He was more Middle Eastern, obviously, because he was Jewish, but he still was known for having

243
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
 a beard and all that stuff.

244
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,400
 I just thought, "Yeah, it would be interesting he's cloned, he has holes in his hands."

245
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
 Interesting.

246
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,240
 It's not interesting, it's absolutely foolish.

247
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,920
 But anyway, so people worshiped that little piece of flesh because it was the last remaining

248
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,160
 part of their God.

249
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,840
 And I think that's what's interesting is that if you believe that Jesus died and came back

250
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:31,080
 to life and is now in heaven and preparing the eternity for you, but you could visit,

251
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,000
 you could actually visit a piece of him.

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
 That's amazing.

253
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,160
 I can't think of any other religion that really has that.

254
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,400
 I think in Islam and in Judaism, you can walk the streets and you can go to the places

255
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,760
 where these people have been.

256
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,600
 Did you know, in Mecca, what it is, it's a meteorite?

257
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,600
 A meteorite hit the desert and it's like this holy rock.

258
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,120
 I don't necessarily want to like visit Mecca just because I don't want to be around that

259
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
 many people.

260
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,600
 It seems like there's like a million people there and they just walk around a circle.

261
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,760
 But I'm sure to actually look, I think it's like an obsidian meteorite.

262
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
 It's a meteorite.

263
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,520
 They built a giant cube around this giant holy structure and most people don't know

264
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,720
 this either.

265
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,240
 Just out of camera, like when they show their shots of Mecca, just out of camera are just

266
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,760
 hotels and fast food diners.

267
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,840
 It's turned into basically like a small tourist city because people have to travel there and

268
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,600
 someone's like, "Hey, let's put up a McDonald's."

269
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,200
 I don't know if they actually have McDonald's, but just out of the camera shots, it's like

270
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
 a tourist trap.

271
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,280
 There's just buildings everywhere.

272
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
 It looks really holy.

273
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,920
 You can't have the camera back and you see like a holiday in.

274
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,120
 Now of course, so that's the story of penis worship, quote unquote, penis worship.

275
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,640
 And you knew I wasn't going to end it there, right?

276
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,520
 You knew I wasn't going to just tell an interesting story about religion and the physical and

277
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,560
 the metaphysical because I thought that's what penis worship probably is.

278
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,720
 But I have to do a little bit more like I did with golf rumors like I did with the ocean

279
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
 at night.

280
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,560
 I found out there is a church now that does nothing but worship the penis.

281
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:20,240
 They are called St. Proprius Priapus Church, North American church.

282
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,440
 They just love giving each other blowjobs and they consider that as the sacrament.

283
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,600
 They blow each other and they swallow the semen and they're like, yes, you are inside of

284
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 me.

285
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,880
 They have their book, their Bible.

286
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,520
 It's called the scripture of the Holy Seed.

287
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,680
 It's basically like a soft-core porn, apparently soft-core porn, but it's written like the

288
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
 Bible.

289
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,840
 So there's like apparently verses and things like that.

290
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
 You can go to their website.

291
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:52,560
 Of course, I'll have it linked below templeproprius.org where you can register and declare yourself.

292
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,160
 So I'm going to have to say right now for us to continue this episode, I'm going to

293
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,000
 have to start using some not-safe-for-work language.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,440
 I try to stay away from it just because I know people listen to it at work.

295
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,800
 So have a great day if you've listened to it so far.

296
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,400
 If you're listening to it at work, put on headphones.

297
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,680
 You can go to this website templeproprius and create an account so you can register and

298
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,960
 declare yourself as a cock worshiper.

299
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,840
 They have a chat room, of course, if you just want to sit there and jack off thinking about

300
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,280
 other guys blowing each other.

301
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,480
 Oh, you have to log in to do that.

302
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,040
 And let's take a look at today's cock prayer.

303
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,920
 So these guys are like full in on the penis worship.

304
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,040
 This is what they want to do.

305
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,720
 Which, hey, you know what?

306
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
 Whatever.

307
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 Knock yourself out.

308
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,560
 So as I'm trying to read this, this is the part, this is their prayer to the God of Foulness.

309
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:54,080
 Now there is a small paragraph of information and there is, hey, at least, there's probably

310
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,320
 about a 12 inch photo of an 8 inch dick staring at me as I'm trying to read this.

311
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,640
 So I'm going to make this fast.

312
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,560
 Okay, so here, let me read a bit of this here.

313
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
 There's anything interesting.

314
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,600
 "Our lips and mouths are honored to worship thee.

315
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,560
 Our arseholes are consecrated by receiving thee.

316
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,320
 Flesh in flesh we are sanctified by thy holy presence and enriched beyond understanding

317
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,920
 by the life giving come."

318
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,880
 So these guys are just, I think these guys are probably like a bunch of gay dudes who

319
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,840
 really, really, really love dicks.

320
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,040
 So they've decided to form a whole religion around it.

321
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,960
 It's probably a bit of a tax shelter, honestly.

322
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,280
 And he gives them an excuse to just walk around naked and blow each other.

323
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,440
 And not like they really needed an excuse.

324
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,080
 I guess they're gay, but they worship the cock as like they're god.

325
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,840
 Now again, I think it's probably more of like a parody religion.

326
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,360
 But you know, if it makes me happy, whatever, they're not bugging me.

327
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,760
 They're not, I'm not like walking to work and I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, and

328
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
 some dudes stuck in my cock.

329
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,960
 And he's like, don't worry, this is religious, but you know, whatever.

330
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,560
 But again, I thought, well, I don't think that's what penis worship is.

331
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,520
 So I dug just a little bit deeper and I wish I hadn't because I uncovered something really,

332
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
 really disturbing.

333
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,000
 And I don't know why I continue to get disturbed by stuff.

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
 I've done episodes on YouTube monkey torture.

335
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,720
 That was disturbing.

336
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,680
 That episode didn't appear on YouTube either, by the way.

337
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,480
 I didn't, I'm such a new channel and it has to do with YouTube failing to regulate their

338
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,840
 own stuff that is not on YouTube.

339
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,760
 To hear YouTube monkey torture, you have to go to the podcast.

340
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,320
 It's actually the golf rangers episode, I think.

341
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,480
 But anyway, so speaking of disturbing stuff, so I scraped it just a little bit deeper and

342
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,560
 I found there is an entire subculture on porn hub, not a site I normally go to, I have

343
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,880
 to say, because I'm always talking trash about porn, but because I'm looking for, Dick worship,

344
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,600
 I got a bunch of porn hub stuff.

345
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,040
 There's a subculture on porn hub about Dick worship.

346
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,760
 Now it gets even weirder than that.

347
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:12,880
 Now of course there are a big site, a big like growing subgenre in porn is trying to

348
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,440
 think of the right word, like feminization or mind control where you watch these videos

349
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,840
 and basically reprograms your mind to make you want to be transgender.

350
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,920
 It's really getting really popular, really fast actually.

351
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,440
 Now their stuff is all about like, "Oh yeah, you suck a dick, blah blah, suck a dick."

352
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,480
 It's like always said to like a Britney Spears song, it's really bizarre.

353
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,000
 And I'm like, "Oh man, I really like that Britney Spears song, like, do I keep listening

354
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 to this video?"

355
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,080
 Because again, like, there's a, you were like, "Chasing, how do you know about this stuff

356
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
 if you don't watch porn?"

357
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,480
 It's, I, this is going to sound weird, but I have to do research.

358
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,240
 Anyways, the point is, is that feminization, sissy mind control stuff is like a Britney

359
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,240
 Spears song and it's just like pictures of women and then like them blowing, blowing

360
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,880
 dudes are getting fucked or whatever.

361
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 Yeah, we're going all out.

362
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,600
 I'm going to shut off the filter here.

363
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,160
 So, so this isn't that even.

364
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:21,120
 This is mind control and it is dick related, but it's even more subculture than sissy videos,

365
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,400
 right?

366
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,280
 These are, this is the video in question.

367
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
 It's a great name.

368
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,920
 I mean, I immediately had to click on it once I saw the name.

369
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:43,040
 This video in question is called, "Surrender, surrender to the dark demon."

370
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,920
 Sorry, sorry, I have to be professional.

371
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 Surrender to the dark demon lust inside you.

372
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,960
 And I'm like, what is this video?

373
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,740
 I'm trying to find stuff like, I just Googled in penis worship or dick worship and a bunch

374
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,400
 of porn stuff came up and I said, well, you know, I'll check it out because it might be

375
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
 related or something.

376
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,240
 And I see that as like, I have to click on that.

377
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,600
 I have to click on that.

378
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
 It's bizarre.

379
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,720
 And it's this, it was just the tip of this iceberg.

380
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,440
 So apparently there is this big watch here.

381
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,000
 Let me pause because I had to pull the video up.

382
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,080
 There we go.

383
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,480
 There is a subculture on in pornography apparently, definitely in porn hub.

384
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,840
 It is gay dick worship, Satan worshiping.

385
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,640
 So this video is like, yeah, you love dick.

386
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
 You love eating dick.

387
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
 Dick is so good.

388
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:43,120
 And then like a pentagram is flashing behind the picture of all of these penises.

389
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
 It's the video is 12 minutes long.

390
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
 And I watched enough of it to get an idea of what the content is.

391
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
 But here's the thing.

392
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
 You're like, Jason, okay, cool.

393
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,440
 You found some creepy side of the internet.

394
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
 Congratulations.

395
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
 Every side of the internet is creepy.

396
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,520
 What if I told you that this one actually works, that this video apparently can make

397
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
 you gay?

398
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,480
 Apparently, because I of course, again, do diligence.

399
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,720
 I was looking at the comments.

400
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,720
 It has 300 over 30000 views and it's like 85% rated on porn hub.

401
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,280
 I'm looking at these comments, right?

402
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,960
 And the first guys like, listen, I uploaded this, but I didn't make it.

403
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
 This was an older video that was uploaded and then it was taken.

404
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,920
 The owner took it down for whatever reason.

405
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,440
 It's this thing to be worshiped.

406
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,640
 It's almost like this.

407
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,200
 It's a weird thing that you worship in and of itself.

408
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
 And then I'm reading the comments and here's one of the comments.

409
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,280
 He used his real name apparently.

410
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,560
 Here's one of the comments.

411
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,120
 This has to be the best vid I have ever seen.

412
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,960
 I've been working on myself for so long to be the best little cockslut that I can be.

413
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,120
 Now I can't stomach the thought of having sex with my wife.

414
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
 Hopefully she'll find some lovers.

415
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,880
 I love cocks so much more than her.

416
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,800
 I ever have and I'll watch this over and over.

417
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,840
 It is the best thing that ever happened to me.

418
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
 Thank you so much.

419
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,400
 That comment got eight likes.

420
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,640
 Another person watch out these actually work.

421
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,440
 People constantly saying, oh, I've watched this for 10 hours in a row.

422
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,360
 I've watched this for 20 hours in a row.

423
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,800
 One guy was late for work because he was watching this video over and over again.

424
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,800
 I haven't watched the video in full.

425
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 But here's the thing.

426
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,520
 What if it works?

427
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,000
 What if it what if this is the ring video of buggery?

428
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,320
 What if this is the ring video that when you watch it within seven days you suck a dick

429
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,040
 and you can't control it.

430
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,120
 These people love this video.

431
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
 All these comments are like, oh, this is great.

432
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,920
 Now a lot of them are like, yes, I used to just be a normal Christian, but now I hail

433
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,320
 Satan and I love sucking cock.

434
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,360
 That's an actual, you think I'm exaggerated.

435
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,440
 Let me actually find that one.

436
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
 Okay.

437
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
 Yeah, you thought it was exaggerated.

438
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 Here's the actual quote.

439
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,800
 Oh, it's from the same guy.

440
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 It's from Joseph.

441
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
 The first guy said about how much he loves this more than his wife.

442
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,320
 And this is two months after the first comment.

443
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,640
 So it's not just this one time troll.

444
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,320
 This is two months later after his comments saying he loves it more than his wife.

445
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,280
 I've watched this vid on repeat six days and at work yesterday I was two hours late, but

446
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
 it's so worth it.

447
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,000
 I'm so addicted and I just want to keep deepening my addiction for Satan and cock.

448
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,400
 I finally got my wife to start worshiping Satan.

449
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 Oh, that's cool.

450
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,880
 They're sharing this together.

451
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,720
 I finally got my wife to start worshiping Satan as well as we were stupid blind assholes

452
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,280
 for Christianity until we found out it's all BS lies.

453
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
 All caps.

454
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
 No punctuation.

455
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,920
 That's why I'm reading it like that.

456
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,080
 What if this is real, man?

457
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,960
 What if this is real?

458
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
 What if this video...

459
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,120
 Now, if you're watching this on YouTube, I probably can't provide the porn hub link,

460
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,800
 but I will provide the title of it.

461
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,960
 You can search it on your own.

462
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,160
 Now I have the excuse right now.

463
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,560
 My internet doesn't work really well, so watching a 12 minute video, I'm actually having to

464
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,400
 upload everything using the wifi on my phone.

465
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 So that sucks.

466
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,120
 Not the wifi, the hotspot, but...

467
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,200
 So I have an excuse not to watch this right now.

468
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,480
 Right now, before the episode started, but I will watch this video in full.

469
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,320
 Yes, I will watch this video in full and I will get back to you.

470
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,160
 I've already summoned Sucky Bus and all sorts of stuff on this podcast.

471
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,680
 I'm not worried about it.

472
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,840
 However, these comments, there's a lot of them, seem to think that it is really good.

473
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,720
 Now, I know what you're thinking.

474
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,280
 Jason, are you going to play a bit of the audio?

475
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,160
 Because I'm sure you have the audio.

476
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
 Now here's the thing.

477
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,640
 Now, I could say I'm going to cut out the outro, you know, thanks for listening to the show,

478
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,640
 all of that stuff, and just end with a little bit of this audio.

479
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:49,520
 Like, come on guys, that would be completely irresponsible of me to play a possibly cursed

480
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,440
 audio clip trying to force me into worship Satan and Suck Dick.

481
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,360
 I am above that.

482
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,440
 I could not in good conscience in this episode with audio playing from that video.

483
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,160
 So, not going to do it.

484
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
 Not going to do it.

485
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
 You crave a man's cock.

486
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
 D, down in the depths of your soul.

487
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
 You are a homosexual.

488
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
 That's what you want.

489
