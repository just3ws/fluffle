00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
 On January 6th, 2022, the European Space Agency spotted an asteroid that was going to collide

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,120
 with Earth next year.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,560
 So how come you haven't heard about it?

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,640
 And then we meet a married man who one day is scrolling through Tinder profiles.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,000
 He's looking for a little side action.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,240
 Instead, he finds a demon who wants his soul today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:37,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,720
 I'm your host, Jason Carver.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,840
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun staying alive.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,160
 I hope you're, I hope you're alive.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,160
 Okay, now listen to this podcast as your final moments as a pack of dogs are chewing at you.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 That was grim.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,120
 Honey, it's starting off so dark.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,840
 Being that's a Dead Rabbit Command right now to lighten up the mood is one of our Thanksgiving

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,860
 live stream contributors.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,360
 Give it up for Charlene.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
 Woo, come on in Charlene.

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,880
 Yeah, get these dogs off of us.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,360
 Beat them away with a stick.

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,880
 Charlene, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,320
 Just help spread the word about the show.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,520
 That really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,040
 If you can't support the show financially, support it with your mouth.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
 That sounds weird.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,200
 Just tell people about the show.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
 Say, "Hey, Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,440
 If you want to listen to a podcast where he threatens you with dog attacks, Dead Rabbit

31
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,240
 Radio is the place to be."

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,040
 Charlene, let's go ahead and talk to the keys to the Dead Rabbit Rocket Ship.

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,120
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command and we're going to fly all the way out to

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:45,240
 orbit around planet Earth.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,320
 We are fighting off those G-forces.

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,120
 And now we're floating around in zero gravity in our rocket.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,760
 You know what, it's interesting.

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,280
 One of the things I've learned doing this show, I've always been a conspiracy theorist.

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,720
 I've always been into the paranormal since I was about 12.

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,120
 I've been researching this stuff.

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,720
 But working on this show, I've started to realize something.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,360
 I'm shocked why what the conspiracy community doesn't talk about.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,640
 I find it so odd.

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
 Right now there's this big thing going around.

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,400
 There's a photo of a black woman at the UN and she's looking down and it's not a high

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,920
 resolution photo.

47
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,760
 She's looking down and she has her hand raised and people think that it's a space alien.

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
 This is all over the internet.

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
 I'll put a link in the show.

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
 I don't know how I can describe it any better than that.

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,760
 The photo looks weird but once you look at it you go, "Oh, I see it's a blurry resolution.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
 Here's her eye.

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
 She's looking down.

54
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
 She's wearing a black face mask.

55
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,160
 She has this hairdo."

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,040
 It looks like Greedo.

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,640
 It looks like Greedo is in the United Nations but when you get another version of the picture,

58
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,320
 you look at it for about a minute and you go, "That's not a space alien."

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
 "That's not a space alien."

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
 I thought, "What are you wearing if it's a space alien?"

61
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,480
 It showed up in the United Nations.

62
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 They didn't tell anyone.

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,840
 It's just a really bad resolution photo.

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,480
 You can go to the YouTube link and click on it.

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,600
 I think it's like 7 minutes in or something like that.

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,720
 But anyways, you see it and it's weird.

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,960
 It is weird looking but it's a human.

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,120
 You can look at it from any other angle.

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,240
 That's going around right now.

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,920
 That's been a big news story past 24 hours.

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,840
 I'm recording this episode on Tuesday.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,240
 I remember the one time when Biden was apparently a hologram or everything else was a hologram

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,240
 and Biden was walking through the hologram and the reporters looked tiny.

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,760
 You're like, "Jesus, what in the world are you talking about?"

75
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
 Now I don't remember when a giant President Biden came walking by.

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
 I'll put that video in the show notes too.

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,840
 That was a big talk of the town.

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,680
 I saw someone recently talking about that.

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,760
 The implication is Joe Biden is, I guess the implication is Joe Biden is either a giant

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,960
 or the White House has the worst CGI team possible and they can't make him look normal.

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,600
 I think the implication is like he's running the country from some green screen room or

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,320
 something like that.

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,720
 I find it fascinating.

84
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,640
 I find all of these stories fascinating and some of these things you look at for a minute

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,920
 or three minutes and then you go, "Oh wait, Joe Biden's not a giant.

86
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,800
 He's a normal sized person and this is just a weird camera angle."

87
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,680
 And then this was totally what I'm about to tell you.

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
 I stumbled across.

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,240
 This story was completely slept on.

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,560
 No one was talking about this.

91
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
 Nobody.

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,560
 I can't believe this is not a main topic of conversation in the world of conspiracy theory.

93
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:51,040
 On January 6th, 2022, asteroid 2022 AE-1 was detected.

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,160
 So the European Space Agency has all of these telescopes aimed up at the sky, which is where

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,560
 a telescope should be aimed at unless you're a pervert.

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,040
 And they detected AE-1 floating through space.

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,480
 Now by the next day, all of these telescopes are running all of these algorithms, like

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,680
 how close is this going to get to Earth?

99
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,760
 The very next day it's classified as potentially dangerous.

100
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,320
 European Space Agency, they're looking at all this stuff and they realize this is moving

101
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,760
 so quickly through space, there is no way it will swerve away from Earth.

102
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,640
 Sometimes the asteroids are coming, they get caught in the gravitational field of another

103
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,120
 planet or of the sun or of our moon and it glides away peacefully.

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,720
 They were looking at this in January going, this will most likely hit Earth.

105
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,600
 We don't know where it's going to hit, we think it will be somewhere in the equator region,

106
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,880
 so that's a lot of ocean, but also a lot of land.

107
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,760
 And the day it was supposed to impact, July 4th, 2023.

108
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,280
 Now is this a civilization killer?

109
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
 No.

110
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,600
 But had it hit a populated area, it could have destroyed a city.

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,400
 And it's coming on our Independence Day.

112
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,960
 Did you hear any of this stuff?

113
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,120
 Asteroid potentially dangerous, it's not going to move out of the way and the European

114
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,160
 Space Agency is saying there's a very, very high chance it's going to hit Earth on July

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,280
 4th, 2023.

116
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,160
 They're observing it very closely for that week in January.

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,000
 January 6th it's discovered, algorithm gets run and now the scientists are looking at

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
 it each day.

119
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,520
 But there's this thing that happens in space, the moon floats around, everything floats around,

120
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
 right?

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,080
 And as the telescopes are picking up on this asteroid, and it's pretty far off again,

122
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
 right?

123
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,120
 It's going to be about a year and a half before it hits us, the moon blocks our view of AE1.

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,200
 This story is 100% real.

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,440
 This story happened this year and no one's talking about it.

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,680
 The moon blocks our view of AE1 and the telescopes can't see it and the scientists are like,

127
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
 well, you know, the moon's only going to be there, the moon's only going to be blocking

128
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,760
 it for about a day or two.

129
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,960
 But when the moon moves out of the way, and when the telescopes can once again catch AE1

130
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,520
 and steady its trajectory, when the moon moves out of its way, it has changed course.

131
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,280
 It has no, it has zero chance of hitting the Earth now, none.

132
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,240
 It's been removed from potentially dangerous.

133
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,120
 And there you go.

134
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,180
 What in the world just happened?

135
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,680
 This is 100% a legit story now.

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,320
 The conspiracy theory side says aliens, right?

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,400
 Disasteroid was coming towards Earth.

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,960
 They didn't want to be discovered directing it, so you can calculate all this stuff.

139
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,200
 You know where the moon's going to be.

140
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,760
 It's not a surprise, right?

141
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,160
 And as the Earth and the move are in that endless cosmic dance, this alien ship, they're

142
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
 sitting there, they're tapping their little space watch.

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
 They're like, come on, come on, come on.

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,000
 We want to move this thing.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,160
 It was headed towards Earth.

146
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,600
 It gets redirected.

147
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,520
 Now that's the conspiracy theory side.

148
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,520
 Again, I can't believe nobody talked about this.

149
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,080
 The scientific side, they go, it happens, right?

150
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
 They're just kind of, it's so weird.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
 They don't really have an answer for it.

152
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,180
 They go, listen, here's the thing.

153
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,520
 Sometimes we see that asteroids are going to hit Earth and then they don't.

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,920
 So that happens onto the next one.

155
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,720
 That was, that was, I'm telling you, I'm being glib.

156
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,480
 That was a quote onto the next one.

157
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,920
 He said, yeah, sometimes the, their calculations were not wrong.

158
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,280
 They're not saying that calculations were wrong.

159
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,520
 They're just going, sometimes weird stuff happens, right?

160
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,760
 Space is weird.

161
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,920
 We have to constantly adjust things, but it's not going to hit.

162
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
 And I would accept that as a scientific reason.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,400
 However, the fact that the moon blocked our view of this potentially dangerous asteroid,

164
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,640
 and we don't know why it moved away.

165
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,000
 Fascinating, so I'm not saying an alien of the, I'm not saying an alien of the UN isn't

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,760
 fascinating or giant president Biden isn't fascinating, but it's so weird.

167
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,960
 This is what makes me think like there are elements in the conspiracy theory community

168
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,280
 who say this is acceptable to talk about because it's super, super distracting.

169
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,520
 And we won't even mention this.

170
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,120
 I can't believe this wasn't bigger news.

171
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
 I feel like a broken record that I keep saying that.

172
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,400
 And that's one of the things I love about doing this show.

173
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,880
 We cover 10 topics a week and we discover stuff like this.

174
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,440
 And it's just show where I thought this would be bigger news.

175
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080
 Even that first week of January, people should have been talking about the independence day

176
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
 disaster like in 2023, like all those doomsday predictions and stuff like that.

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
 Where were they?

178
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,400
 And then that it just stopped threatening earth when we couldn't see it.

179
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,880
 It moved out of the way.

180
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 Fascinating.

181
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,120
 It's a fascinating story about how fragile life is on this planet.

182
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
 And it's fascinating that this story did not get a lot of play in the conspiracy theory

183
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 community.

184
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,680
 Like when it first happened or now.

185
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,960
 Because now it's getting out about, oh, you know, it got diverted.

186
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,480
 What, what is going on?

187
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 Fine.

188
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,600
 Let's look at more blurry photos of a UN meeting because it can be fun, but you can easily

189
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,120
 go that is a normal human photographed under really bad lighting conditions.

190
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,720
 A really blurry resolution.

191
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,080
 Can we get as the asteroid is hurtling towards earth and a UFO is a tractor beam and it's

192
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,880
 like, come on, come on and throws it into the sun.

193
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,160
 Everyone's looking down at their phone looking at giant photos of President Biden.

194
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,560
 I do have to admit, I do.

195
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,200
 I do love that conspiracy theory.

196
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
 But a dude.

197
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 Insane.

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
 Insane.

199
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,320
 Great story and what caused that?

200
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
 Who knows.

201
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
 I did a story a long time ago.

202
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
 I'll put the episode in the show notes about Comet Ellenin, which was another doomsday

203
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
 comet that was supposed to hit earth.

204
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,720
 And I uncovered quite a bizarre conspiracy theory involving that one.

205
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 I really liked the episode.

206
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,440
 We'll put that in the show notes.

207
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,760
 But, Charlene, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

208
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
 We got to go back to weighing.

209
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,920
 We got to go back to being under the force of gravity like a bum.

210
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 Let's hop in the carbonicopter.

211
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,440
 We're leaving behind space.

212
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,800
 We're headed all the way out to Houston, Texas.

213
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
 We land in Houston.

214
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,560
 We're walking around, taking in the sights and the sounds of the city.

215
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,560
 And we are here because there is a man known as Luce.

216
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,240
 Now that's his profile name.

217
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,560
 I don't know if that's exactly how he pronounced it.

218
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
 Hey Luce, what's up?

219
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
 Luce Goose?

220
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
 Luce?

221
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
 I don't know.

222
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
 It doesn't really matter.

223
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,160
 Pronunciation are never in my strong suit.

224
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,120
 He is posting on a forum that maybe some of you have been to.

225
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
 I highly doubt it.

226
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
 It's possible though.

227
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,480
 In my audience, I have a very, very diverse audience.

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,840
 It's a forum that I just discovered called Joy of Satan.

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,520
 These are Satan worshipers, but not like your classic Anton Leves Satan worshipers who use

230
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,480
 Satan as a stand-in for humanism.

231
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,200
 You know, it's just about the worship of self and being hedonistic and stuff like that.

232
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
 No.

233
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,160
 These guys, according to their website, actually worship Satan.

234
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,200
 They acknowledge Satan as an entity and he's like, "Soon you can also have a pitchfork

235
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
 and wear red tights and dance around in hell with me.

236
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
 Satan."

237
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,280
 And so I'm still parsing through a lot of their beliefs.

238
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,120
 I was kind of poking around on that.

239
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,960
 From what I've already read, it is as insane as you would think it would be.

240
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,800
 Luce here is posting on Joy of Satan's forum and he tells this story.

241
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,160
 He goes, "Listen, I was raised as a Christian, but I was never really into the whole thing,

242
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 which probably explains why I'm on a forum called Joy of Satan.

243
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,880
 But you know, I was raised as a Christian and parents are a Christian and stuff like

244
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
 that."

245
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,840
 He says that he can decode reality.

246
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,880
 He goes on this long-winded rant about breakfast, meaning breakfast.

247
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
 "Whoa, dude!

248
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,640
 You're blowing my mind, man!

249
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,040
 I didn't ever put that together in my 45 years of being alive!"

250
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,720
 But it literally means I'm breaking the fast in between supper and then you don't eat

251
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,480
 anything until the morning and you would break the fast.

252
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
 Whoa, dude!

253
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
 Really?

254
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,480
 Did you know television means tell a vision?

255
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,760
 I wonder how much I could blow that guy's mind.

256
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,480
 He believes that life can be decoded like that.

257
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,920
 So he decides, you know what, instead of breaking the fast, he starts fasting.

258
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,280
 He's not gonna break the fast.

259
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
 He starts fasting.

260
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,800
 And, which I didn't find, right?

261
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 There's a lot of benefits.

262
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,040
 Health benefits to fasting.

263
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,160
 I mean, most people fast to have the health benefits.

264
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,440
 They don't fast because they're trying to be contrarian because they don't want to break

265
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
 fast.

266
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,960
 But anyways, he starts fasting and then he starts getting rid of fluoride.

267
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
 Fine, whatever.

268
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,080
 I don't have a big issue with fluoride, but I understand why people do.

269
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,840
 Fine, whatever.

270
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,480
 And then he starts running and...

271
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,920
 Oh, let me back up here.

272
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,640
 Intensely, is his word.

273
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,200
 Intensely running in place every day.

274
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 So you don't let me finish.

275
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,760
 You go, "Jason, it's awesome.

276
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
 He's getting athletic.

277
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,920
 He's running around town.

278
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
 He's waving at people.

279
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,560
 Dogs are attacking dead-rabber radio listeners.

280
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
 He's waving at the dogs."

281
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,600
 Running intensely running in place.

282
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,040
 So now I want you to picture this man loose in his house in Houston, Texas.

283
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,520
 Just running, running in place in his house, hopefully, right?

284
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,920
 That's a little less weird because it's air-conditioned maybe.

285
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,760
 He's just in his driveway running intensely over and over and over again.

286
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,640
 And that should set the scene for where we're going because this loose dude...

287
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,440
 Speaking of loose, a couple screws in his head.

288
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,720
 Allegedly, right?

289
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,480
 Allegedly, I can't legally say that.

290
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
 I'm not a doctor.

291
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
 He also quits porn.

292
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
 That's totally fine.

293
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
 Porn, huge drain on the environment.

294
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,960
 Produces more carbon than a lot of countries.

295
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,680
 Porn's horrible for the environment.

296
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,120
 More power to you, buddy.

297
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
 Running porn.

298
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,920
 You're doing the world a favor.

299
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
 Then...

300
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
 That's not...

301
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
 He's running in place.

302
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,280
 He's like, "Oh, no, I don't have anything to watch.

303
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,120
 I'm normally watching Pornhub right now.

304
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
 He's running in place."

305
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,880
 He starts doing extreme stretches.

306
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
 His word...

307
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,400
 Okay, so first off, we can pretty much tell this guy takes things to the extreme.

308
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,180
 He doesn't just go running.

309
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,240
 He intensely runs in place.

310
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,960
 He begins doing extreme stretches.

311
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
 I don't know what that is.

312
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,760
 I imagine he's like a wacky wall crawler.

313
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,920
 He's like a stretch arm strong.

314
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
 He's like, "Ugh."

315
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,680
 He does extreme stretches for multiple hours a day.

316
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,640
 So again, I don't have a problem with physical fitness, right?

317
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
 I encourage it.

318
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,200
 But how do you stretch for multiple hours?

319
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,120
 I don't know what this guy does for work.

320
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,680
 Maybe he's a stretcher.

321
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,480
 Maybe he's like, it works at a construction site and they're like, "Hey, we need this

322
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
 metal stretched out.

323
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,680
 Hey, loose, you got it."

324
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,600
 He's like, "Already on it."

325
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 Stretching out stuff.

326
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 Or he's unemployed, right?

327
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
 Or he's unemployed.

328
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,400
 Because I don't know how many bosses would allow me like, "Oh, it's break time.

329
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
 Wonder what loose is doing."

330
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,720
 There's just a guy jogging in place in your break room.

331
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,440
 He's like, "Ah, I got to call OSHA about that guy."

332
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,000
 Multiple extreme stretches for multiple hours a day.

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,800
 And he does this because he realized that his body had all of these muscular knots in

334
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 it.

335
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 I feel, I have that right now.

336
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,160
 I've really been knotting my back.

337
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,720
 That's like radiating to the front.

338
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,480
 It's not getting any better.

339
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,160
 So he's doing these muscular stretches.

340
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,880
 Now I know why I have a muscle knot.

341
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 I'm overweight.

342
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,000
 I sit in a chair for most of the day editing a spooky podcast.

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 That's a big part of it, right?

344
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,020
 And I need to drink more water.

345
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
 And I need to stretch more.

346
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,880
 So I got to do extreme stretches.

347
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,600
 My stretches aren't extreme enough, apparently.

348
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:22,040
 But he says that the knots in his body are caused from the positions of a slave.

349
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,080
 He's constantly been in a slave, see, and his knots have tightened up.

350
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,600
 I don't get it either.

351
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
 I don't get it either.

352
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,000
 I mean, I guess maybe he has to sit down at an office job and he's like, "Oh, my muscular

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 knots.

354
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,080
 Every time my boss tells me to do something, I get a little knot in my body."

355
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
 I don't know.

356
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,640
 But anyways, he says that the knots are actually signed, like they were created because of

357
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,840
 his slave life.

358
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,240
 But you know, he's doing these extreme stretches for hours and hours and hours a day, and then

359
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,040
 he's running in place when he's not doing that.

360
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,360
 And he says he starts to really enjoy life.

361
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,840
 Again, there's a lot of positive to come out of being physically fit, quitting porn, watching

362
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,320
 what you eat, starving yourself, fasting for extreme amounts of time.

363
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,720
 You're kind of pushing it there, buddy.

364
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,680
 But anyways, he starts to enjoy life.

365
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,040
 We enjoyed this loose, right?

366
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,080
 We like a guy who enjoys life.

367
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,720
 And then the very next sentence, again, he shows that something's not quite right.

368
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 I mean, obviously running in place, running in place all day.

369
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,480
 It's also a sign someone's not right.

370
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,440
 But he's starting to enjoy life.

371
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,640
 And when he's outdoors, he hears the birds.

372
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,120
 Blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib,

373
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
 blib, blib, blib, blib, blib, blib.

374
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
 He has a big smile on his face.

375
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,280
 He's like, "You know it."

376
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,120
 And then like a crow comes by.

377
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,400
 "Caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw."

378
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,120
 He's like, "Oh yeah, that crow knows my name too."

379
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
 Apparently, apparently when he...

380
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,680
 Apparently he's in such a good mood that he hears the birds singing his name and the name

381
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,720
 of his wife.

382
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,760
 So unless his real name is Tweet Tweet and his wife's name is "Caw!"

383
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
 This is a hallucination, right?

384
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,120
 It's funny because I believe in ghosts and I believe in demons and stuff like that.

385
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,080
 And I guess I believe at some point like an animal could talk, maybe one somewhere like

386
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
 in the middle of Siberia in the 1700s.

387
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,600
 I wouldn't be shocked if it's happened once.

388
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,560
 But if a whole population of a whole population of a species, if I was walking around and I

389
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,000
 heard birds spreading the word about dead rabbit radio, they're like, "Dead rabbit radio,

390
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 dead rabbit radio."

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,720
 I would assume I've lost my mind.

392
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
 I guess I'm not stretching enough.

393
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
 I guess I'm not stretching my imagination enough to believe that this is real.

394
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,600
 So he says like now that he's cleaning out his pineal gland, it's decalcified because

395
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,560
 he's not on the floor right anymore, he's given up porn, all this stuff, he's starting

396
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,360
 to see the world the way it really is.

397
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,560
 He says that he now will every show have to look at someone and as he's talking to them,

398
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
 this is terrifying.

399
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,000
 This is where it gets spooky, right?

400
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,680
 Like that was all, "This guy clearly had some mental issues and he's been laughing about

401
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
 it all the time.

402
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
 The whole thing's spooky."

403
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,000
 But this is where it gets creepy.

404
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,480
 Sometimes he's talking to people and he'll see their eyes shift to reptilian eyes.

405
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,960
 I'm not saying it's spooky because I'm afraid he's actually talking to reptilians.

406
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,560
 When I read these types of accounts I always wonder what if I'm talking to this dude.

407
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,800
 Imagine you're talking to this guy, you're talking to Loosh, you don't know what's up

408
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,400
 and he sees your eyes become reptilian.

409
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,200
 He kind of looks at you and he goes, "Ah, I knew you were one of them."

410
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
 You're like, "What?"

411
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,680
 Then he walks away.

412
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,400
 "If you're lucky, he walks away, right?"

413
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,280
 He might start stabbing you right there.

414
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,600
 He says he also saw a woman shape shift in front of him, but you know, life is good.

415
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,080
 It's interesting because I do believe that there could be reptilian aliens and I do believe

416
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,520
 in shape shifters and stuff like that.

417
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,600
 I'm not saying that it's interesting because I do believe in the elements of the story,

418
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
 but I don't believe him.

419
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,160
 Does that make sense?

420
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,040
 Even a crazy guy can be wrong.

421
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,160
 Let me back up.

422
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,280
 Crazy guys are often wrong, but they can if a crazy guy started seeing ghosts in their

423
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
 house.

424
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,880
 I would assume that there's no ghosts.

425
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,480
 It's just him being crazy, but it doesn't mean I don't believe in ghosts at all.

426
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,800
 Anyway, so life is good and it's fine.

427
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,040
 You're not really damaging anyone at this point.

428
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,160
 I'm a little concerned about your knees from all the running and stretching, but one day

429
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,720
 he's on Tinder, which is odd because he's married, right?

430
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,640
 He's on Tinder, he's scrolling through, and he sees a pyramid stretch.

431
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,480
 There's a photo in the show notes and it's just one of those stretches where you're on

432
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,640
 your knees and you reach back and you touch the soles of your feet with the palms of your

433
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
 hands, right?

434
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,440
 And your body makes a little pyramid.

435
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,120
 I want you to visualize that right now.

436
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,960
 And if you are flexible enough to do it, do it in Synthephoto, the Dead Rabbit Radio.

437
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,360
 He's doing this pose and so picture that.

438
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,800
 I want you to picture that in your head.

439
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,880
 And then the next sentence is probably the least likely of anything he said.

440
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,640
 He said that, I don't know if this is Hunter Biden, I don't know if this is Joe Biden's

441
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
 son.

442
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,080
 I don't know of any way this is possible, but he said when he is on his knees, he's

443
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,840
 on his knees and he reaches back to put the palms of his hands on the soles of his feet,

444
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,400
 your chest, your head is bent backwards and really the highest part of your body is your

445
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
 chest.

446
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,640
 Really your neck is too, but you know, you can kind of see this visual, your body becomes

447
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
 a pyramid.

448
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,560
 He said when he did this, he thought it might have been a demonic trap, honestly.

449
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,960
 He does it and he says that he did it wrong.

450
00:22:51,960 --> 00:23:00,640
 His chest was not the highest part of his body, his crotch was.

451
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,360
 For that, imagine that again.

452
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,880
 Imagine you're reaching back, maybe you're doing it right now, you're reaching back and

453
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,080
 you're touching the palms of your hands to the soles of your feet and your crotch is

454
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,960
 the highest part of your body.

455
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,600
 Like either this dude is hung, super hung, right?

456
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,920
 Which I doubt it because he would have started the story off like that.

457
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,080
 He goes, "I have a three foot wiener."

458
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
 That's not how it starts.

459
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,640
 If you did, if you did have one, that's how every story would start.

460
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,600
 But he, how does that even happen?

461
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,480
 Now remember, the knees have to be touching the ground, the toes have to be touching the

462
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
 ground.

463
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:40,400
 It doesn't make sense, but he does this and he thinks it's a demonic trap because he started

464
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,440
 convulsing immediately.

465
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:52,360
 Now the rest of your time is running in place and now you're taking this yoga pose, the

466
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,280
 pyramid pose, and you've done it so incorrectly.

467
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,040
 The only way your crotch could be the highest part of your body is if your head is under

468
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,520
 your feet and your chest has been crushed with a cinder block.

469
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,520
 That's the only way I can imagine this work and he starts convulsing and then a demon

470
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,400
 shows up.

471
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
 In him.

472
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,040
 A demon enters his body.

473
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,960
 What happens is he covers one of his eyes, the left eye, the evil eye, and this demon

474
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,800
 shows up and it says, "I am the god of this world."

475
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,720
 Smashing Blumkin's music starts playing.

476
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,680
 If I die, this world resets.

477
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,320
 If I blank, he doesn't remember what the demon said.

478
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 This world resets.

479
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,720
 I'm going to assume it was die again.

480
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,240
 But apparently so this demon pops in his body and now he's possessed and if he dies, the

481
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,360
 world will reset.

482
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,840
 He spends the next few days not really eating or sleeping, which I'm sure was kind of hard

483
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,480
 for anyone around him to tell that it was any less eating than he normally does.

484
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,200
 But his wife does get concerned and we do have a real human in this story.

485
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,520
 She takes him to the hospital.

486
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,800
 Because he's not eating, he's not sleeping, his crotch is huge, his crotch is super swollen.

487
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,920
 She takes him to the hospital.

488
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
 He doesn't want to be there.

489
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,120
 You know, he's got stuff to do.

490
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,600
 He has a demon in his body.

491
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,520
 He has a world to destroy.

492
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,360
 And he says that it took six staff members to hold him down.

493
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,680
 That's a bit of a brag, right?

494
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,240
 If you are, if you're a mental patient, if you're a mental patient, you're being dragged

495
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
 away.

496
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,360
 I wonder if in facilities they're like, "Ah, that was nothing.

497
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,480
 It took eight guys to hold me down."

498
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,240
 And one of them, I bit his lip off.

499
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,600
 I'm eating it right now.

500
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,400
 Do they try to one up each other?

501
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,120
 Do mentally insane people try to one up each other with how they were caught?

502
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:49,520
 Anyways, he says it took six people to hold him down and one of them ripped off his bicep.

503
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,440
 So full, it has to be a full blown hallucination, right?

504
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,960
 Ripped his bicep off.

505
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
 His own words.

506
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,480
 And one ripped my right bicep off.

507
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
 So it's gone.

508
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,160
 It's like, basically someone grabbed a steak of meat, ripped it off.

509
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,320
 No, no, I need that bicep.

510
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 It was my favorite one.

511
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,880
 And he's like, "Find your thing.

512
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
 He stopped watching porn.

513
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 He doesn't need his right hand anymore."

514
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,440
 He's being held down by these guys.

515
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,920
 The other guys like looking at this bicep.

516
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,440
 He's like, "Hm.

517
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,480
 Total hallucination.

518
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,200
 This dude saw his bicep get ripped off and they don't acknowledge it, right?

519
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,240
 They're like, "No, what do you mean?

520
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,000
 What do you mean I didn't rip off your bicep?"

521
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, you did.

522
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Yeah, you did.

523
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You're holding it right there."

524
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,680
 And this again is one of those things that's so creepy about like hallucinations.

525
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,200
 Imagine you're standing in a room and a guy is accusing you of ripping off his bicep.

526
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,160
 And you're like, "Bro, what are you talking about?

527
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,960
 We were just playing PlayStation 5.

528
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,880
 Everything was normal and now your eyes are all crazy.

529
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,480
 They're a little reptilian."

530
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,600
 And you're accusing me of ripping off your bicep?

531
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,960
 And that dude's point of view is you standing there.

532
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
 Like you're just normal.

533
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,600
 He sees you as standing there holding a bloody piece of meat.

534
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,080
 Just looking at him.

535
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
 That's terrifying.

536
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
 It's like two completely different realities.

537
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,680
 And he sees you have ripped off a chunk of his body.

538
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,600
 While he's at the hospital, he meets a woman named Jenny.

539
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,440
 It's unclear if this is a nurse or not.

540
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,400
 I'm assuming it's a nurse.

541
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,760
 In this cast of characters, a woman named Jenny comes into the room and has to remove

542
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,280
 his wedding ring because his fingers are swollen.

543
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,720
 You know, you get a bicep ripped off.

544
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,400
 It's bad for the blood flow.

545
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,600
 Jenny takes off his wedding ring and he has like a white band of flesh there.

546
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
 That tracks, right?

547
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,360
 That makes sense because if you're swollen, your fingers are probably red and you don't

548
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,800
 have a little white mark there from where the finger is not so swollen from the ring.

549
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,600
 And he notices that she is wearing a white lace ring.

550
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,960
 So he realizes that she has cast some sort of binding spell on him.

551
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,360
 He gets discharged from the hospital and he begins texting Jenny.

552
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,480
 Apparently Jenny likes a man with one bicep.

553
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,120
 He begins texting Jenny and his wife's like, "Please stop.

554
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,400
 Please stop.

555
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,880
 You know the medical bills that we incurred, you incurred because of all this stuff?

556
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 Yeah.

557
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
 At least don't cheat on me.

558
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
 Also, what were you doing on Tinder?

559
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
 Why were you on Tinder?"

560
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,480
 He's like, "Uh..."

561
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
 He is texting with Jenny.

562
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,280
 I don't know what they're talking about.

563
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,120
 They're talking about comparing rings.

564
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,720
 And she's like, "Dude, stop doing that.

565
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,160
 Stop connecting with Jenny."

566
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,960
 And he goes, "Listen, Jenny told me that I'm a victim of the Monarch programming, which

567
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,840
 is an old trope in conspiracy theory.

568
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,400
 The fact that usually children are kidnapped by the government."

569
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,240
 There is a lot of truth to it, but they've made it this more elaborate thing.

570
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,240
 It's basically the idea that the government brainwashes people and they do it as childhood.

571
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,960
 There is a lot of stuff to back that up.

572
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,440
 Whether or not it's still in operation today, it probably is.

573
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,000
 Whether it is on the scale conspiracy theorists say it, it probably isn't.

574
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,600
 But there is a thing like Monarch programming that does exist.

575
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
 But this doesn't.

576
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,640
 And he also says she's a clone.

577
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,960
 She's a living clone, an adult clone, and he's a member of the Monarch programming.

578
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,000
 So of course you got to text the clone, right?

579
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,720
 Even if you're in a loving relationship, if you have the chance to talk to a clone, you're

580
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,160
 talking to a clone.

581
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,800
 He ends up having to take medication because of all of this insanity.

582
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,880
 He ends up being diagnosed with something he doesn't tell us.

583
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,640
 And he ends up taking medication for his mental illness.

584
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,800
 He does say it.

585
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
 He stopped hallucinating.

586
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 So it's interesting.

587
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,640
 This far in the narrative, he admits that he had trouble hallucinating.

588
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,880
 You're like, "No, Todd Jason, I figured that out long ago."

589
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,160
 He didn't need to say that in the second paragraph.

590
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,680
 He says that he stopped hallucinating, but now he wants to kill himself.

591
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,800
 And you know, that's no joke.

592
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,440
 Like if you're suffering that much, change your medication.

593
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 Go see someone.

594
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
 But anyways.

595
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,360
 He stopped hallucinating, but now he wants to kill himself.

596
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,200
 And this part threw me for a loop when I was reading this for the first time.

597
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,240
 I had to read it multiple times for it to make sense.

598
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,680
 He ends up, he's not hallucinating at this point, according to him.

599
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,040
 According to him and the magical elf sitting on his shoulder.

600
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 He's like, "You sure?

601
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
 Aren't buddy.

602
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,560
 Everything's real now."

603
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,800
 He goes back to the hospital to have surgery on his arm.

604
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,560
 Because apparently, even though he was taking the medication, he's not hallucinating.

605
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,120
 He didn't have a right bicep anymore.

606
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,000
 The dude, the dude actually ripped it off, apparently, and then kept it.

607
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,840
 And he says they reattached his bicep to his arm using the Achilles tendon of a cadaver.

608
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,360
 Which was good for him because he loves running so much.

609
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,640
 Now he can run on three limbs.

610
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,680
 Apparently his bicep really did get totally removed from his body.

611
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,560
 He preserved it in some sort of pickle brine and then they got a cadaver's Achilles tendon

612
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,760
 and they reattached it.

613
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,160
 He's doing fine except he has a scar on his right arm where all of this happened that's

614
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,680
 in the shape of a satanic lightning bolt.

615
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
 And he goes, "That's a sign.

616
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,480
 That's why I'm on this Joy of Satan forum.

617
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,640
 I believe the ultimate battle between good and evil, between God and Satan, between

618
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:17,560
 the demons and the angels, are being waged in my body.

619
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:24,520
 My body, my life, my spirit is the ultimate battleground.

620
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,200
 Absolute delusion is a grandeur as well.

621
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,680
 Might as well put that on top of it, right?

622
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
 And that'd be interesting.

623
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,920
 He's probably not going to stay medicated a long time, especially if he's having thoughts

624
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
 of suicide.

625
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
 I hope he takes care of that.

626
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,480
 But think about it, like every sneeze you got, you're like, someone goes, "God bless

627
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
 you."

628
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,960
 You have no idea how much that helps, sir.

629
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,760
 That put back the forces of hell.

630
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
 And you're like, "Huh?"

631
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,880
 Like everything that his body goes through, you would imagine, well he would imagine,

632
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,240
 not you, he would imagine, is a sign of this eternal battle.

633
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,440
 We're going to wrap it up like this.

634
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:09,720
 This really, really sums up how terrifying it would be to be with someone in a situation

635
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,840
 like this.

636
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,240
 Because in it, Loose is a normal guy who's walking around Houston.

637
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,840
 When I say normal, probably has a job, probably has a car, probably has a house, someone's

638
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,000
 neighbor, someone's coworker, something like that.

639
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,120
 And then he has these delusions.

640
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,800
 And again, imagine you as just you, right?

641
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,920
 A outside observer walking down the street, you meet him on a sidewalk.

642
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,760
 This is how he talks about his wife.

643
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,320
 Imagine this type of interaction with just you, someone he doesn't know.

644
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,840
 "My wife always freaked out when I talked about Jenny, and I think it's possible.

645
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,320
 My wife is a Freemason.

646
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,560
 I straight up asked her if she is, and she started joking around, said the president

647
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,160
 of her country was a Freemason, and she carries a picture of her president everywhere.

648
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,480
 So what did I think she was?"

649
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,440
 I really doubt this interaction happened.

650
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,400
 His wife has to know he's struggling with mental health issues.

651
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,480
 And when he goes, "Are you a Freemason?"

652
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
 You would just lie, right?

653
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,800
 She could have a grand order in her closet.

654
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,840
 She could be a high ranking member.

655
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,080
 You would just lie.

656
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,400
 Because you know that this guy has some serious delusions.

657
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,160
 But he goes, "Are you a Freemason?"

658
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,480
 And she goes, "What do you think?

659
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,720
 Here's a picture of my president.

660
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,080
 I don't know what country she's from."

661
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,280
 But she's like, "Here's a picture of the president in my wallet."

662
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
 And he's like, "So are you a Freemason?"

663
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,000
 And she's like, "What does this say?"

664
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,800
 I don't think she would lead on a guy who first off, he's in great shape, right?

665
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,240
 He can run and he can do stretches.

666
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
 But mentally, he's in a bad shape.

667
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
 I don't think she would do that.

668
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,560
 I think she would just lie or tell the truth.

669
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,960
 Maybe she's not a Freemason.

670
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,920
 I don't know.

671
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,160
 But let me continue here.

672
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,280
 I don't think she would go to mom.

673
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
 Let me continue here.

674
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:02,000
 Quote, "I asked her again because I said it was a yes or no question, and she made

675
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 the shh sign."

676
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,240
 She put her finger to her lip.

677
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,200
 And then she said she was going to cut me up and spread my entrails in the street.

678
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,400
 I asked her again and she finally said no.

679
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:24,120
 But they can lie to non-members.

680
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,200
 Did that even happen?

681
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 Did any part of that conversation happen?

682
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,600
 I mean, I'm sure he goes, "Are you a Freemason?"

683
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,640
 And she probably said, "No.

684
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,840
 For the one hundredth time this hour, Luce, I'm not a Freemason."

685
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,480
 But in his mind, are you a Freemason?

686
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,040
 Here's a picture of the president and he's a Freemason.

687
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,400
 So what do you think, Luce?

688
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,880
 Are you a Freemason?

689
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
 Shhh.

690
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:58,440
 I'll cut you up and spread your entrails all over the street.

691
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:06,000
 No, I'm not a Freemason.

692
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,400
 That's terrifying.

693
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,520
 That's the conversation he heard in his head.

694
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,640
 And how do you react to that?

695
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,360
 She's sitting there and he asks her a question and she does say no.

696
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,360
 I'm sure that's what happened.

697
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,720
 But his brain created this thing and this woman who loves him apparently takes him to the

698
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,880
 hospital when he's not doing well, stays with him.

699
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,200
 As Luce is looking at her, she stares at him directly and goes, "I'm going to cut you

700
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,080
 up and spread your entrails across the street."

701
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
 She's a beast.

702
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
 She's a demon.

703
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,040
 How do you deal with that?

704
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,760
 Because that's, now he honestly believes that that has happened, that his wife is threatened

705
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,040
 to murder him.

706
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,040
 And is she, I don't know if she's on Joy of Satan.

707
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,400
 I don't know if she's a member of this forum.

708
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,880
 I don't know if she knows this is what he thinks about her.

709
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,920
 But it is what he thinks about her.

710
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,120
 And this is on the medication.

711
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:13,040
 So the medication may be getting rid of the hallucinations, the visual ones, but terrifying

712
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 story.

713
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,880
 Tonight, a woman is lying in bed next to a man who believes that she threatened to cut

714
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,360
 him up and spread his entrails across the street and that she's a member of this vast conspiracy

715
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,200
 against him.

716
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,360
 And as she sleeps peacefully, he watches her slumber and trying to figure out if she is

717
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,840
 good or if she is evil.

718
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,160
 It is a question he asks himself every night.

719
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:53,820
 And so far, he's looked at her and said, "No, she's a good woman.

720
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,680
 She loves me."

721
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:03,040
 But what happens on the night when he lays next to his unconscious wife and decides, "No,

722
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,380
 this woman is not good.

723
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,520
 She is evil.

724
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,800
 She is darkness.

725
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,960
 She is my enemy."

726
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,600
 A terrifying true story straight from the mouth of the mentally afflicted.

727
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,040
 A man who believes the battle of good and evil is being waged in his soul and everyone

728
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,840
 from his wife to random strangers are signs and symbols of that conflict.

729
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,480
 A man on the precipice of losing his mind.

730
00:37:38,480 --> 00:38:03,840
 A man walking the streets of Houston, Texas.

731
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:21,280
 A man walking the streets of Houston, Texas.

732
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:32,120
 A man walking the streets of Houston, Texas.

733
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:42,120
