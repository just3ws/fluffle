1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
 Will humanity team up with one of its greatest enemies to defeat its current threat?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,280
 Is there currently secret coded messages appearing over shortwave radio?

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,240
 And then we travel to England to take a look at three young boys out for a walk.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,080
 They expected a fun day of exploring the countryside.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,680
 Instead, they walked directly into the past, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:39,240
 [Music]

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,080
 I'm actually recording this at 10.30 in the morning, super early.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,560
 I'm normally working out right now.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,080
 I finished watching that show Freakish.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,920
 It's pretty good.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,480
 I recommend it.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,480
 They're not making a new season though, so some cliffhangers.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,320
 You gotta use some headcanon to figure out what you want the ending to be.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,480
 But overall, I enjoyed it.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,080
 I'm watching a new show called Zomboats.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,440
 It's about, it's a zombie comedy, which I normally abhor.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,960
 But you know, any zombie port in a zombie storm.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
 I'll check it out.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
 I watched the first two episodes.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
 It was clever.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,480
 I haven't laughed out loud, but it's clever.

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,920
 Before people trying to escape on a canal boat, which apparently is the slowest boat.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,720
 The zombies are constantly like 30 yards behind the boat.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,800
 There are two episodes in it and it's the same group of zombies following them.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
 Pretty clever.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,760
 I did play my escape game last night, the Haunted Roller Coaster.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
 There's a box.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,520
 And you know, you guys know about those escape rooms, right?

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,280
 You know, they made that terrible movie based on them, but there's actually like an escape

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,760
 room you go and you pay to have you and your friends argue about who's the leader of the

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,280
 group as you guys try to solve this puzzle.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
 You can replicate that anger at home through a boxed game.

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,040
 They have the escape room in a box and it's only to be played once.

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,120
 It's like 15 bucks you play at one time.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,520
 So I'm in self isolation.

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
 I bought myself a copy.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,280
 I sat down last night and I played it.

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,000
 It probably took about an hour and I had to use a couple of the solution cards because

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,760
 the quizzes, some of the puzzles were really, really difficult, but it was fun.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,240
 Like yeah, it was 15 bucks for like a one time thing, which is also food, right?

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,560
 You don't go, "Mmm, mm, mm, can't wait to eat that again."

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
 "Bleugh."

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
 And then eat your vomit.

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
 Most stuff is a one time thing, but I enjoyed it.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,600
 I recommend doing it.

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,360
 Now I don't know how much fun I would have had doing it with another person.

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,840
 It's like, "No, don't look at the solution card yet.

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
 Don't do that."

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
 Yeah.

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,720
 If you want to fray, if you want to start a fight while you guys are all quarantined

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,280
 by it, but again, you can also just play by yourself.

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 It was really fun.

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,600
 I enjoyed it.

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
 So anyways, I recommend that.

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,080
 Now we are going to give the keys to Eva Marie.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,440
 She's our newest Patreon supporter and this weekend is her birthday.

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,000
 And since yesterday's episode got cut short, we're going to let her fly around.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,880
 We're going to let her drive us around.

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,320
 It is a privilege to be our chauffeur.

64
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,040
 So Eva Marie, I hope you got, you know, good back muscles.

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,000
 Let's hop in the dead rabbit rowboat and you are going to row us across the big pond.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,160
 We're leaving behind America.

67
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,640
 We're headed to France.

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,680
 Now guys, I'm going to tell you this right now.

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,920
 This is pretty good news.

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
 This is pretty good news.

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 Okay?

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,720
 My fellow addicts out there, both drug addicts and spaces above houses addicts.

73
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,240
 They're all involved because we need the addicts to store all this stuff.

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,360
 And apparently in France, a bunch of doctors are sitting around and they go, we just got

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,480
 new reports from China.

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,080
 We put them in the shredder because China's lying to us about everything coronavirus related.

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,720
 We're not even going to talk about China.

78
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,160
 Done talking about China and their lies regarding this thing.

79
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,040
 But in France, they were looking at these Chinese quote unquote results that doctors

80
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,240
 are all rolling their eyes.

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,280
 I hope another study from China throw it away, but they did start to notice something in

82
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
 France.

83
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,000
 And they started to notice something in France as well.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,760
 China said they had this, but again China says they had 3,000 deaths.

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,280
 So they're lying.

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
 France says this.

87
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
 It's, let's look at the stats here.

88
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,240
 25% of the French adult population smokes.

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,240
 When we're having our patients come in, 8.5% of the patients coming in to the hospital

90
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,480
 for coronavirus are smokers.

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,960
 And the doctor, like that's kind of a weird statistic.

92
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
 And the head doctor is like, it is weird.

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,040
 Like we expected it to honestly be higher because this disease can attack the lungs,

94
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,080
 but it can also attack the central nervous system.

95
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,520
 That's why they say people will start to lose their sense of taste.

96
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,240
 That's why they say people lose their sense of smell.

97
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,160
 Sometimes has a nervous, I have a theory about that.

98
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,600
 I have a theory if it gets in your eyes, it causes neurological things.

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,960
 If it gets in your throat, it'll cause the lung thing, but it's the same disease.

100
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,760
 But I'm not a doctor and I have nothing to back it up, but because it doesn't affect

101
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
 everyone the same way.

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
 They go, it's weird.

103
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,360
 We expected honestly to have that basically be a preexisting condition.

104
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,240
 We know smoking is bad for your lungs.

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,960
 If this thing attacks your lungs, which it primarily does, you're boned, right?

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,760
 And you're already full of black tar.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,680
 So when they started getting these patients coming in and they knew Italy had a high smoking

108
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
 rate, they knew China had a high smoking rate, but again, you can't trust anything coming

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
 out of that government.

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,680
 They expected the results there and it's not the case at all.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
 So they started doing a study.

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,000
 They started doing a study where they are taking people who currently are infected with the

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,760
 coronavirus and putting nicotine patches on their skin.

114
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,560
 This is their theory.

115
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,240
 Despite the fact that smoking can actually weaken your lungs, they believe there is something

116
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,720
 in cigarettes and they are pinpointing nicotine itself that can not only help you if you have

117
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
 the coronavirus, but it may prevent you from getting it in the first place.

118
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,600
 So here's the thing, nicotine down regulates your ACE2 receptors.

119
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,120
 That is old research.

120
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,040
 They've known that for a long time, a couple of years.

121
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,400
 I won't say it's like super old, but they've known that for a while.

122
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,680
 The coronavirus needs to have your ACE2 regulators flying up.

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,480
 "Gay, give me some, give me some of you to sweet, sweet coronavirus.

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,280
 Come on, touch me."

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,200
 Nicotine actually down regulates those receptors.

126
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,200
 Makes it harder for the coronavirus to get into your lungs.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,360
 They also believe because nicotine can work on the central nervous system that it can

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,200
 stop it from getting into your central nervous system as well.

129
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
 So this study is going on right now.

130
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,720
 They're putting nicotine patches on it.

131
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,440
 In France, the French researchers are saying, "Listen, this is an addictive drug."

132
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,920
 And I read an article and they said, "In the end, 50% of the people who smoke, it kills

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
 them."

134
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,840
 And that doesn't necessarily mean lung cancer.

135
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,520
 Obviously, it causes cardiovascular issues as well.

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
 And I don't know if that statistic is true, honestly.

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,880
 That sounds quite bizarre if it really is 50%, but maybe they lump in all these different

138
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
 things.

139
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
 That sounds extreme.

140
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
 That sounds extreme.

141
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,120
 The point is, is that here's a study that's going on right now that scientists have, when

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,200
 this whole thing started, they go, "I've read other studies on this.

143
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,640
 This is the first official one, but I've read other papers on this where they're like, 'We

144
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,320
 do know nicotine down regulates ACE2.'

145
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,880
 This might be a treatment option."

146
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,480
 So would you be willing as a society to embrace nicotine?

147
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,320
 We've been taught our whole lives how awful and horrible it is.

148
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,680
 And it may actually be not only a treatment if you have it, but a preventative measure

149
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
 if you don't.

150
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,160
 And I know what you, I know what long-term listeners of the show are thinking.

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,760
 Jason, does this mean you're going to start doing nicotine lossages again after not taking

152
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,280
 them for eight months, nine months of this time?

153
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,760
 Only time will tell, my friends.

154
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
 Only time will tell.

155
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,000
 Wouldn't that be awesome though you go to the doctor and they're like, "Oh, here you

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 go, nicotine."

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,320
 And I miss nicotine.

158
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,600
 I think that's my drug of choice.

159
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,560
 I keep going to those subreddits.

160
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,200
 I'm still going to the meth subreddit and the opiate subreddit, the crippling alcoholism

161
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 subreddit.

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,880
 I found there's a subreddit just for heroin.

163
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,000
 I mean, they don't want to be lumped in with the pill takers of opiates.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,640
 How does this stuff up online?

165
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,800
 Like, I get it.

166
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,000
 I always thought Reddit was like the prissy principle.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,640
 No, they have a subreddit directly dedicated to doing heroin.

168
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,080
 And they even go, "This isn't about harm reduction, guys.

169
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,760
 This is about how much we love heroin."

170
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
 There's a subreddit called heroin-hotties.

171
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,680
 There's not many of those.

172
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,880
 I don't even know how a person on heroin operates a phone, how they can even post.

173
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,320
 There's a subreddit I found today for PCP users.

174
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,840
 And I scrolled through it a couple times and I already came across two posts and they're

175
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
 both like, "Help!

176
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,760
 I need your help right now!"

177
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,400
 Which I imagine is what everyone on PCP says.

178
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,920
 Nicotine, it's a wave of the future, guys.

179
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
 Let's move on to our next story.

180
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,480
 Our next story we actually found on Reddit, too.

181
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,680
 Eva Marie, let's hop in that Jason Jalopy.

182
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,280
 We are driving out to Germany.

183
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,240
 So that's pretty good, pretty close, right?

184
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,160
 I imagine France isn't too happy about being that close to Germany, you know, considering

185
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
 world events.

186
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
 And as we're driving to Germany, and really this is happening all over Europe, but I've

187
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,960
 seen this come out of Germany, Netherlands, France as well, that's a rumor of where this

188
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
 is coming from.

189
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,760
 But as we're driving around just Europe in general, taking a look at, do you guys still

190
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,240
 have battlefields over there?

191
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
 Like in America, they're like, "This is Gettysburg.

192
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,240
 It's like a park where you can go and you can walk around, eat a sandwich."

193
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,880
 I don't know really what you would do there.

194
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,880
 I think it would probably be cool to go there, but you know, like, or you could just show me

195
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
 a picture.

196
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
 Do they have?

197
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,560
 I mean, I guess probably not, because everywhere was a battlefield in Europe.

198
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
 You're like, "Here's Paris.

199
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 It's a national park.

200
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 You can't go in there."

201
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,400
 Like everything ended up getting bombed out at some point.

202
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,800
 But like Normandy, can you bring a metal detector to Normandy?

203
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,920
 Just walk around, looking for stuff?

204
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,240
 Or can you just hang out on the beach or surfing?

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
 Whoa, hang 10 veterans.

206
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,440
 I wonder if it's a national park over there, but again, everywhere would be a national

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,940
 park.

208
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,600
 Normandy's like, "Oh, we don't want to talk about that.

209
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 We don't want to talk about the two world wars we lost."

210
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,320
 Anyways, we're driving around Germany going, "Losers, losers."

211
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,000
 Everyone's like, "We will rise again, losers."

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Moaning them.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,640
 Anyways, anyways, after we're done getting beat up by a bunch of Germans for mocking them,

214
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,160
 we turn on the radio of the car.

215
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
 Found this on Reddit.

216
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,880
 There's a user named shadowpeople4life.

217
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,520
 That is a name I can get behind.

218
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,080
 That's a name I can get behind.

219
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,860
 So thank you, shadowpeople4life.

220
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
 We're listening to the radio.

221
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
 Now what's going on?

222
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,220
 I'm going to play you a clip.

223
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,060
 So this is the part where you can start lowering the volume.

224
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,140
 If you have headphones on, I'm going to try to minimize the damage, obviously.

225
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,860
 Not going to have it start off super loud, but if you're across the room working on something,

226
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,140
 you can start to turn the volume down a second.

227
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,700
 What's happening is in the shortwave radio community, people are sitting there with their

228
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,340
 headphones on, turning the dial.

229
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:44,880
 Hey, everybody, this is Old Candy Cane driving down the road.

230
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,520
 Turning the dial some more.

231
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,200
 Hey, hey, Barney, is that you?

232
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
 Yeah, it is me, Piccolo Pete.

233
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
 How you doing?

234
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,640
 I'm doing good, but I got to keep dialing this dial.

235
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,040
 And then what's happening is people are coming across this signal.

236
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:26,520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

237
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:42,680
 Now, I played a little bit of it for you, and it goes on and on.

238
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,640
 And I didn't want to basically be the rest of the podcast just noises.

239
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,840
 But what you've heard in that clip starts off-- and I have different clips of this, so I may

240
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,720
 be not describing it in the right order, but you're going to hear a tone like a siren-type

241
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:09,240
 tone, actual American police sirens, wolves, the howling of wolves, and then people talking.

242
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,880
 Now, people are saying that they're speaking English.

243
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,920
 It sounds like it, but I can't really decipher what they're saying.

244
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,960
 Now, the shortwave radio community has no idea what this is.

245
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,720
 There's a couple different theories, but people keep tuning back into this.

246
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,200
 First off, you have that it's a glitch.

247
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,520
 Some people said that.

248
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,200
 You guys who have shortwave radios, I'm sure some of you guys do, I always thought it'd

249
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
 be cool to get into in 1992.

250
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,840
 But nowadays, I'm sure it would still be cool to get into.

251
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,920
 It's just nothing that I really have time for.

252
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
 When I was in high school, I thought it was awesome, but not knocking it.

253
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
 It probably is pretty fun.

254
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:52,000
 It's on the 3460 kilohertz channel out of the Netherlands or something like that.

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,520
 But nobody knows for sure.

256
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,840
 I guess some people are saying that it's a French pirate radio station and if you have

257
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,240
 your setup wrong, it sounds like that.

258
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,120
 That sounds a little iffy, but again, I don't know anything about shortwave radio.

259
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,200
 I know about real radio.

260
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,480
 If I have my radio upside down, it doesn't turn from Shakira to Blink 182.

261
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,840
 A sound is a sound, right?

262
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,080
 You could even say, let's say you rigged up, so you're listening.

263
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,520
 Shakira is playing on an FM radio, but somehow you're able to get it on the AM station.

264
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,000
 Shakira is not going to sound like a bunch of wolves howling.

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
 She didn't have that one song called "She Wolf."

266
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 But the point is that she's still not going to sound like that.

267
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,960
 So some people say, one person came out and said, "This is actually a French pirate radio

268
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,680
 station that does techno music, and you're listening to it with this wrong setting."

269
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,440
 So that's why it sounds like that.

270
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,960
 And that might work for me, but people who are in the shortwave radio community, I don't

271
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,160
 think they all went, "Slap their head," and they go, "Oh, he's right."

272
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,360
 People are like, "No, no, no.

273
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
 That's not the case.

274
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,480
 I know how to work my shortwave."

275
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,240
 Some people say it's a glitch, and that kind of goes with the French thing, too, that something's

276
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,040
 not translating, right?

277
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,400
 It's weird that you hear those elements.

278
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,320
 Some people are already larping, and they're saying they can hear it when they stick their

279
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 head out their window.

280
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,560
 This is like starting April 20th.

281
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
 This is super, super recent.

282
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,080
 People are already larping it.

283
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,720
 And that's the thing that we've got to be aware of in this community.

284
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,520
 You're going to get a lot of liars and a lot of jokers.

285
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,240
 A lot of people just having fun like the Penguin guy yesterday.

286
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,680
 So it's never being a rush to take this stuff too seriously.

287
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,320
 Like, obviously these tones are real.

288
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,240
 Someone could have made these tones and could be making an ARG, but you already have people

289
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,400
 saying, "I stuck my head out the window in an ARG."

290
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,360
 So expect to hear that.

291
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,000
 Expect to hear those fanciful tales start spreading.

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,120
 Really want to look at the facts there.

293
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,640
 But speaking of not having any facts, the main theory among the shortwave radio community

294
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:03,880
 that I've seen is that this is some sort of code or call to action.

295
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,400
 Basically, when you think of wolves, you think of two things.

296
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,200
 A lone wolf and a wolf pack.

297
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,360
 Right?

298
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,280
 And so it could signal a code as far as it's time for the lone wolves to do something.

299
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,440
 You got your orders guys.

300
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,320
 Go out and do this stuff.

301
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
 Or it could be a symbol of it's time to form the pack.

302
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
 It's time to get everything in together.

303
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 When you have the police sirens, obviously, that makes you, that raises an alarm.

304
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
 That's what they literally are.

305
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
 They are alarms.

306
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,040
 Letting people know that they're coming.

307
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,280
 So it's funny because that's kind of it.

308
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,840
 People are really trying to run in this stuff through analyzers and spectrograms and trying

309
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,320
 to figure out if there's any sort of other type of message.

310
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,280
 But for right now, the shortwave community is just listening in to see if there's anything

311
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,840
 else coming through that stream.

312
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,080
 It's funny because of one of the groups of people that are monitoring this are people

313
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,040
 who normally monitor number stations where you basically can tune in and it goes like

314
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,680
 five, nine, blark, nine, seventy, nine, twelve.

315
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,080
 They really like nines for a reason.

316
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,560
 But they basically read off numbers.

317
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,840
 Sometimes they're not necessarily numbers.

318
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,920
 It'll be words, like simple words that don't make any sense.

319
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,960
 Sometimes they're in English.

320
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
 Sometimes they're in Russia.

321
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,000
 That's most likely.

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,200
 Number stations have been around since the Cold War.

323
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,120
 I think number stations, honestly, probably have been around since radio.

324
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,160
 And I bet you anything is just, and I think this is not anything groundbreaking.

325
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,400
 It's code.

326
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,600
 So if you're in Istanbul and you're running in operations and you're a CIA agent, you

327
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,880
 can tune in and you'll hear that dace code and then we go to your talk to your handler

328
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
 and reveal.

329
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,280
 I mean, that may be an oversimplification of it, but it's most likely code that you

330
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,160
 listen from 630.

331
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,800
 Your job, your code plays between 6pm and 6.04.

332
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,400
 And that number or whatever they give you then, again, the super oversimplification

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,720
 of it could be more advanced than that.

334
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,480
 Then my Neanderthal version, me no number four, let me in secret base.

335
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,000
 They're like, oh, okay, Neanderthal CIA agent.

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,720
 That is a new Nickelodeon show, bro.

337
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
 Neanderthal, FBI.

338
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,360
 I know I just said CIA, but kids don't want to learn about the CIA.

339
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
 Kids know about the FBI.

340
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,480
 You have a caveman who works for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

341
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,120
 James Wan, I know you listen to the show.

342
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,680
 Make that happen.

343
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
 Just split.

344
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,160
 You got to split me that money because that Nickelodeon money, that's good money.

345
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
 Let's go ahead and move on from Neanderthal FBI.

346
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,880
 We are going on to his partners in Dinosaur.

347
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,480
 You don't even have to make an animated, right?

348
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,440
 It would be better if it was a live action.

349
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,920
 And then you have this giant dude, giant hairy guy, right?

350
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,840
 Okay, I guess it's not really what kids want to see.

351
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,120
 They're like, you look like daddy.

352
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,960
 Daddy without a shirt on.

353
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,520
 No, you just have a giant caveman, right?

354
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
 I'm off topic.

355
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,000
 You have a giant caveman, right?

356
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,600
 He's like walking through the bureau and he gets assigned with a dinosaur.

357
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
 But, and you go, James, so that's kind of trite.

358
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
 No, no, no, you didn't let me finish.

359
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,920
 He hates dinosaurs because they ate his family and stuff like that.

360
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,800
 So us dinosaurs are cute because we only see them in like movies or like Barney, right?

361
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,960
 Or chickens.

362
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,520
 But to him, the dinosaur represents like everything he hates.

363
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
 Me remember, 9/11.

364
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,000
 That's when dinosaur 8, 911 of my tribe.

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,520
 I do not work with dinosaurs and the dinosaur.

366
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,880
 Dinosaurs like a Chester cheetah dude with like the sunglasses, tiny little T-Rex arms.

367
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
 He's sitting back.

368
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,960
 He's like, that was in the past.

369
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,440
 Literally that was in the past.

370
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,040
 That was 65 million years ago, bro.

371
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,000
 So but anyways, anyways, we're leaving behind Neanderthal FBI.

372
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,640
 We're leaving behind his new partner, Tommy T.

373
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
 We are headed out to Britain.

374
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
 This has actually been a pretty European-heavy episode.

375
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,440
 I didn't plan it that way.

376
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,280
 We are leaving behind all of our new friends that I just made up.

377
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,200
 We are headed out to Britain.

378
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,160
 Fire up that Carbentercopter one last time, this episode, Eva Marie.

379
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:28,400
 We are going to a little town named Curse in the province of Suffolk in the quaint little

380
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,600
 country known as England, or as I often refer to England as a city.

381
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,560
 I've called England a city multiple times on this podcast.

382
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
 I don't care.

383
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,240
 We're going to Curse.

384
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,400
 The year is 1957.

385
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,880
 The month is October.

386
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,480
 Spooky, spooky pumpkins out on porches, which is so many witches flying.

387
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,560
 You can't even see the moon sometimes.

388
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,200
 Sucks.

389
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,760
 But these three, it's not nighttime, so it's not super spooky.

390
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,720
 None of that stuff has happened yet.

391
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
 There's three young men.

392
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,360
 They're British Royal Navy cadets.

393
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,360
 So we're flying overhead and we see these three young men walking through.

394
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,160
 And I'm like, land here, land here, and Eva Marie brings the helicopter down.

395
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,520
 And we land in a little pasture.

396
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,080
 We sit, we pull out our binoculars.

397
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
 You brought your binoculars this episode, right?

398
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,920
 Because you're not borrowing mine, bro.

399
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,040
 Not getting none of your pink eye.

400
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,040
 I got my binoculars on looking out.

401
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,800
 We see these three kids walking.

402
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,880
 Now, they're all 15 years old.

403
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,280
 They're all members of the British Royal Navy cadets.

404
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,400
 And they're on a pathfinding exercise.

405
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,080
 So basically the British Royal Navy cadet group is all sitting around and they're like,

406
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,480
 "Dude, are we going to learn guns today?"

407
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,680
 And they're like, "Yes, we're going to learn guns, but those three losers don't know how

408
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
 to shoot."

409
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,000
 So hey, you, Tony, Joey, Michael, you come here.

410
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,640
 We don't know their real names, but that's very British sounding names, right?

411
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,280
 Tony, Michael, and Joe, I don't remember who the second guy was.

412
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,480
 Even the guy running the cadets.

413
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,680
 He's like, "I'm not going to bother learning your names."

414
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,320
 As the other kids are loading up their really cool guns, he gets down on his knees.

415
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,880
 He goes, "Hey, kids.

416
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,560
 Hey, Michael, Tony, and Joe.

417
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,440
 You guys are going to go on a map making quest.

418
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
 You're going to try to find your way back to base.

419
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
 We leave you.

420
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,200
 You go somewhere.

421
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,320
 And if you can find us again, you get a gold star."

422
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,200
 They're like, "Yay, we're totally, yeah, can't wait to get a gold star."

423
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
 They go running off.

424
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
 He's like, "They should have brought supplies, but they didn't.

425
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,960
 Anyways, they take off."

426
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,240
 The point is, is that they are on a path finding expedition by themselves.

427
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,680
 So I don't know if they're the losers of the group.

428
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,240
 Allegedly, my version.

429
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
 Don't sue me.

430
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:53,400
 So anyways, Michael, Joey, and Tom, I don't remember their names either, are walking through

431
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
 the countryside.

432
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,800
 Which, I mean, could you figure out a worse way to spend an October afternoon just walking

433
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,560
 around, walking around the city of England?

434
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,800
 I'm sure it's quite beautiful.

435
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,680
 Now they're walking through and they see, cursey.

436
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,000
 A little town, right?

437
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,960
 They hear the church bells ringing.

438
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
 Jing-dong.

439
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
 Ding-dong.

440
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,880
 And the kids go, "That is perfect.

441
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,400
 Like, we have to eventually find our way back to camp and hope that they just don't get

442
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,520
 there and there's just a note and an empty camp."

443
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
 And it's like, "Losers."

444
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,080
 That's their fear.

445
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,160
 They know this is actually part of their training, but at the same time they're thinking,

446
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,160
 "What if the entire navy leaves before we get back?"

447
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,040
 So they figure, "Let's go through the town.

448
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,200
 Let's go through the town of Cursey.

449
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
 It looks like a nice thing.

450
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
 Maybe we'll buy some..."

451
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,720
 What do they eat over there?

452
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,880
 Maybe we'll buy some biscuits and gravy or sausage and mutton or whatever.

453
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,120
 Whatever the hell British people eat.

454
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,920
 Boiled lamb.

455
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 So they're walking through.

456
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,120
 They're like, "Oh, I can't wait to eat some boiled lamb."

457
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,800
 They're walking into town.

458
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:09,120
 And then ding dong ding.

459
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
 Church bells stop ringing.

460
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,640
 Now, that's not super abnormal.

461
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,720
 Church bells don't go 24 hours a day.

462
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,280
 Like they eventually do stop ringing, right?

463
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,360
 They're like, "That's weird.

464
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,320
 It stopped ringing mid-ding.

465
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,800
 Like everyone knows it goes ding dong."

466
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,960
 But it just went ding.

467
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
 That's weird.

468
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
 Physics.

469
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,480
 And Tony goes, "Well, yeah, that is kind of weird.

470
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,120
 But let's just keep walking through this town.

471
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
 Because this town's not weird.

472
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
 Look."

473
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,680
 They're kind of like just looking around.

474
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,040
 Just normal buildings right now.

475
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,480
 But they notice that the town itself is quiet.

476
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,040
 The town itself seems to be empty.

477
00:24:51,040 --> 00:25:06,480
 But off in the distance, those, that was the sound of ducks playing in the water.

478
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
 So it makes the kids go, "It is weird that this town's empty."

479
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
 That's kind of weird.

480
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,800
 Maybe they all left too.

481
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,720
 Maybe the entire country of England is pulling one giant practical joke on these kids.

482
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,200
 The entire country moved to France.

483
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,000
 These three kids are going to be left alone.

484
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 But no.

485
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,120
 So they go, "That's weird that the town's empty.

486
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,600
 But we can still hear baby ducks."

487
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,800
 So you can't, generally when there's like a serial killer or a monster running through

488
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,320
 the neighborhood, the baby ducks are the first to go, right?

489
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
 They're totally out of there.

490
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,200
 So as long as you can hear baby ducks, you're fine.

491
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,000
 As they're walking through town, they do start to notice some bizarre things.

492
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,400
 I mean, obviously the town's deserted and they only got a ding.

493
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,440
 But the trees have leaves on them.

494
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,760
 That's something that I wouldn't pick out.

495
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,320
 I mean, I'm an observant guy for other humans and animals.

496
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,360
 Like if I'm walking down the street, I'm caught, which I haven't done in so long.

497
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,320
 But when I'm out and about, the thing I'm looking for is human adversaries, attractive

498
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,640
 women and hostile animals.

499
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,160
 In that order, honestly.

500
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,480
 So walking down the street, see a cute girl.

501
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,600
 Oh, that'll turn my head.

502
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,080
 Walking down the street and see someone who I think can cause me damage definitely will

503
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
 turn my head.

504
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,640
 My body language will change.

505
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,800
 See a hostile animal.

506
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 Body language will change.

507
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,960
 If I was walking down the street and I turned a corner and all of a sudden there had leaves

508
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,880
 on the tree, I would not even notice that.

509
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,960
 Now if I was walking down the street and it was snowing, I turned a corner and there was

510
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
 no snow.

511
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
 I would thank God so much.

512
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,960
 But I don't, unless I kept being no snow, I don't think I would thank, I would think,

513
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
 oh, just a snowplow was here.

514
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,680
 I'm not super observant for stuff that can't kill me, basically.

515
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,440
 I have super heightened spidey sense for things that can kill me and beautiful women.

516
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,960
 But trees in the winter, no leaves.

517
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,000
 But now that they're walking through town, they notice green leaves.

518
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,640
 This might also be why I'm not a Royal Navy cadet.

519
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
 They're probably because I have that low situational awareness.

520
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,080
 I don't notice when leaves should be on trees.

521
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,480
 But anyways, they think that's a weird detail.

522
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,080
 So they start to go, wait a second, those shouldn't be leaves on those trees, right?

523
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,800
 Like it's winter, it's October and the other kids are like, that is a weird detail.

524
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,680
 But let's just keep walking through town, because at this point there are a couple blocks

525
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
 into town.

526
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
 What are you gonna do?

527
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,000
 You're gonna turn around, things might even be spookier.

528
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,480
 I would turn around just to play with the baby ducks, but they keep moving farther away

529
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,280
 from the baby ducks.

530
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,000
 There's no cars at all.

531
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,160
 They're all gone.

532
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,280
 The church tower, whose ringing bell attracted them to walk through the town in the first

533
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,440
 place.

534
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,960
 The church tower they can no longer see as they're walking through the city.

535
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,760
 Now they start to get nervous, but again, your brain's gonna work in a similar way.

536
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,240
 There's such a way that you think, maybe I'm in a part of the city where I can't see the

537
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
 largest structure in the city.

538
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,680
 The church tower you could see from a distance, it was the largest structure.

539
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,800
 But you think, maybe I'm walking among these houses, maybe I can't see that.

540
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,160
 As they're walking through town, they don't see anyone.

541
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,800
 There's no cars, there's no telephone lines, no telephone poles, nothing.

542
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,560
 Now some of the houses, some of the shops, they can see through the windows.

543
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,480
 They see a butcher's shop.

544
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,040
 They're like, "Boy, old lamb!"

545
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,040
 And they all run to the window and they look through.

546
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,680
 It's empty of humans.

547
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:30,720
 But hanging inside the butcher's shop are large cuts of rotting meat.

548
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,600
 Just from where they were looking at, they could see the green putrification of the

549
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,360
 carcass on the hook.

550
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,920
 So here's a quote from one of the boys.

551
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,480
 Now that I've looked farther down my notes, one of the boys is named William.

552
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,160
 Did I name one of my fake kids William?

553
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
 I don't think so.

554
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,360
 But anyways, one of the boys, we do have his real name, is William Lang.

555
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,320
 There you go for not looking at your notes all the way.

556
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,480
 Here's a quote he had about his time in this town.

557
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,400
 "It was a ghost village, so to speak.

558
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,600
 It was almost as if we had walked back in time.

559
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,080
 I experienced an overwhelming feeling of sadness and depression and cursey, but also

560
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:16,000
 a feeling of unfriendliness and unseen watchers which sense shivers up one's back.

561
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,480
 I wonder if we knocked at a door to ask a question who might have answered it.

562
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,080
 It doesn't bear thinking about."

563
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,500
 After all of these events, the unseen eyes looking at them, realizing they can't see

564
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,760
 any traces of modern technology, after looking in the butcher's shop and seeing the rotting

565
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:42,240
 meat, the three kids run out of town, and when they leave town, when they get past the city

566
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:55,000
 limits, they turn around, cars are driving through the town, they see telephone poles,

567
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,480
 they see trees with no leaves, they see the church steeple.

568
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,920
 No word on the baby ducks, but we can assume they are still there.

569
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,800
 At some point I'm sure they went back and finally found the Navy cadets and they were

570
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,920
 like "Oh good, you got here just in time guys."

571
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:19,080
 But anyways, I don't know if they told this story to the Navy, there's no point in that,

572
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,440
 but they did eventually end up telling this story.

573
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,120
 Now this puzzled them for decades, and as adults they got back together pinniewyestyle

574
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,480
 and said "Let's figure out what this could have been."

575
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,720
 Then they got with a psychic researcher, so I mean, basically probably could have saved

576
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,240
 their money on that one, but anyways, these three guys who experienced something very

577
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,520
 real to them and someone who gets paid to lie to people, team up to form a group, this

578
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,040
 is what they discovered through their research.

579
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,040
 The psychic researcher was like "Oh yeah, no, I was totally gonna like look into the

580
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,840
 past, but you have that history book there, so I'll just save my psychic energy."

581
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,320
 You can keep looking in that book.

582
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,720
 I'm sure honestly the internet has helped psychics more than anyone, not only from finding

583
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,520
 rubes to pay them for stuff, but for being able to say "Oh your name is Jason Carpenter?

584
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,680
 Yeah, no, come meet me Friday and then they can Google everything about me."

585
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,440
 And they're like "I sense that you spend a lot of time talking."

586
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,200
 "Whoa, golly, how'd you know I had a podcast?"

587
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,120
 Well, they use the internet, but anyways, back then, back when this story started coming

588
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,120
 out when these kids are getting together, the psychic quote researcher, which is a researcher,

589
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,480
 had a library card, could go find the stuff out.

590
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,000
 Anyways, that was your skeptical minute on Dead Rabbit Radio.

591
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,880
 Anyway, this is what they found out, because obviously there's a lot of details, a lot

592
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,800
 of history of the town.

593
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:45,280
 There was no butcher shop in Kersi since 1905, which makes sense.

594
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
 Like when's the last time you actually saw a butcher shop?

595
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,480
 There's grocery stores that have butcher places in it, or unless you work in slaughterhouse,

596
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
 then you see it all the time.

597
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,800
 But there was no butcher shop in that place since 1905.

598
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,760
 So the idea is these guys must have teleported back in time to at least 1905.

599
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,560
 But some people, because this story started to gain traction, these young men came forward,

600
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,880
 other people have done research, so they go at the very latest, because the idea is they

601
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,120
 walked into the past.

602
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,600
 I don't know if that was implicitly said, but that they walked through some sort of portal,

603
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,200
 they walked to Kersi, not of 1957, but of some time previous.

604
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,560
 The very latest it could have been was 1905.

605
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,720
 Some people place it as far back as the year 1350.

606
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,160
 The church tower that should have been visible from any point in town, if you go there today,

607
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,920
 you can see it from any point in town, was built in 1481.

608
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,560
 So now you're pushing it farther back.

609
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,400
 If they cannot see the church tower, I mean not hearing it, again they don't ring their

610
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,560
 bells all the time, but if you can't see the church tower if I walk in through the town,

611
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,200
 we're talking pre-1481.

612
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,920
 Now some people obviously are skeptical about this story, they say the kids made it up.

613
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,000
 There's one detail in particular that they say, other than the fact it's three board

614
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,560
 teenagers walking through England, like people can make up stuff for any reason.

615
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,240
 We have to be aware of that when we're talking about this stuff, that people make up stuff

616
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,360
 all the time, like I said in the previous segment, and that's just something you kind

617
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,560
 of have to deal with.

618
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,000
 People say they're making it up.

619
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,440
 A town that size in the 1400s would not have its own butcher shop.

620
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,680
 It just wouldn't be there.

621
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,960
 Now other people go, but we have town records saying there was a butcher shop until 1905,

622
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,520
 but they go, ah you know, they must have been bringing it, they might have had a shop where

623
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,760
 they were selling meat?

624
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,480
 But a town that size wouldn't have a shop where they were cutting like an actual operational

625
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,040
 butcher shop.

626
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,640
 The town didn't have that.

627
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,000
 However other people have put, this is a weird argument, but other people have pushed back

628
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,160
 and said the town actually was very wealthy.

629
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,000
 We know that, they made a ton of money off wool, and we know they were wealthy because

630
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,200
 they have had glass windows for a very long time, and we covered that a long time ago.

631
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,600
 The thing was in the episode, in the first 100 episodes, about how glass used to be

632
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:15,040
 a sign of immense wealth, to the point that people who were super wealthy started to believe

633
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,760
 their bodies were made of glass, and if they sat down they would break.

634
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,560
 It's called the glass delusion.

635
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,480
 Yeah, it's not an old episode, but yeah, because glass was associated with wealth, and wealthy

636
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,280
 people, only wealthy people got this mental illness where they thought their body had

637
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,560
 become glass.

638
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,480
 They refused to move out of bed.

639
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,520
 Some people believe they became cork, which was also a sign of wealth, because you had

640
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,320
 to get it out of the trees and everything, the cork trees.

641
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,560
 They were afraid that they would bobble along in the bath.

642
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,160
 That would be very easy to prove.

643
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,360
 Just put a bunch of water in there.

644
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,760
 They won't bobble.

645
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,320
 But anyways, so yeah, they go, the town probably did have its own butcher shop.

646
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,160
 If they had enough money that everyone had windows, glass windows, they would be able

647
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,000
 to have their own operational butcher shop, so nothing's being moved in the town.

648
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,800
 Plus the fact that the kids specifically saw the glass windows is more of a point in their

649
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,680
 favor, because they're seeing something that town actually had.

650
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,920
 If they were walking through, they walked through a quote unquote "time warp" they were

651
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,560
 making the story up and they walked through a town that wasn't poverished, that didn't

652
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,920
 have windows back then, and they said there were windows, it would be easily disputable.

653
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,440
 But they happened to walk through a town that was rich enough to have glass in their windows.

654
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,640
 I've always been a fan of portals.

655
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
 I think they're very creepy too.

656
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,320
 It's one of those phenomenon that you just can't predict.

657
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,720
 You don't want to get attacked by a bigfoot, don't go into the woods, or the desert, or

658
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,840
 really any place where a bigfoot can hang out.

659
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
 Don't go to the Himalayas.

660
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,400
 You don't want to get attacked by a ghost, don't go to a haunted house.

661
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,360
 But portals just seem to *vvv* appear.

662
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,360
 And you don't know what's going to be on the other side.

663
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,600
 And you don't know if you'll be able to get back home.

664
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,640
 I think there's something intrinsically scary about thinking you could walk out of your

665
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:15,960
 house, go down the street, turn around, come back, and you're no longer in your neighborhood.

666
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,320
 Sure it looks like your house, and your neighbors may look like your neighbors, but you know

667
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,640
 you're somewhere different.

668
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,040
 Could you find a way back?

669
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,800
 Or even more terrifying is you just go for a quaint afternoon stroll and then when you

670
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,240
 come back home, you realize you're the only one for city blocks.

671
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,520
 You're the only one left in the city.

672
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,360
 And for all you know, you're just the only one left.

673
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,640
 These are supernatural stories, obviously.

674
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,680
 And you could say they can never happen.

675
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,280
 And I could say they may happen.

676
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,400
 As remote as the possibility could be, I believe that it could happen.

677
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,440
 Virtual portals, time portals, dimensional portals, they all sound like science fiction,

678
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,280
 and I'm totally aware of that.

679
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,440
 But it's one of the very few phenomenon that I both believe in and am terrified of.

680
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,880
 I can avoid a cryptid, I can avoid a ghost, I can avoid a demon.

681
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,760
 I can even avoid a hostile human.

682
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,320
 But you can't avoid nature.

683
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,920
 You can't avoid a glitch in the system.

684
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:43,840
 You can only hope that you can survive it long enough to find your way back home.

685
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,160
 And you know what?

686
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,360
 We're going to end this Friday episode with something a little different.

687
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
 Something that I've wanted to do for a long time.

688
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,480
 We're going to have a special musical guest.

689
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,600
 I've talked about this band before, Local Hood River Band.

690
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,160
 I'm a big fan of them.

691
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
 They're called Sun Diver.

692
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,040
 And I got permission from the lead singer, Aaron, to actually play one of their songs

693
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,480
 on this show.

694
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:17,520
 This song reminds me of a breakup on a summer day back in 2006.

695
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,440
 This song reminds me of trying to fall asleep alone in bed.

696
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,360
 I love this song.

697
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:56,160
 This is Branch Davidian by Sun Diver.

698
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:25,960
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

699
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:55,760
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

700
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:25,560
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

701
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:55,360
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

702
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:25,160
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

703
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:54,960
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

704
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:24,760
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

705
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:52,560
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

706
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:20,360
 This is a song that I've been listening to for a long time.

707
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,160
 Be safe, be kind, have a great weekend and I will see you Monday.

708
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
 Bye.

709
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
 Bye.

710
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
 Bye.

711
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
 Bye.

712
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,740
 (upbeat music)

713
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:41,740
