1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
 The exorcist Ronnie from the Philippines is on the case once again.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,700
 This time he tracks Lucifer, Lord of Hell, to a local middle school.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,300
 And then we take a look at a true crime story that at this very moment I'm still debating whether or not I actually want to tell you.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,000
 But it's Cursed Episodes Week, so it must be done.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,600
 It's a true crime story with no moral, no lesson, no happy ending.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,300
 It's just the story of two men, one woman, and a mobile home full of blood.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,300
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,100
 [Music]

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,900
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,100
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,700
 You guys are like, "No, no, no, do a longer intro. Do a longer intro."

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,300
 I don't want you to get to that last story. I'm gonna tell you guys right now.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,600
 I don't really do much gore on this podcast.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,800
 I actually censor a lot of stuff, not this episode.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,600
 So the first story is fine. The first story is a nice little jump back to the Philippines.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,200
 But the second story is pretty bloody.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,600
 So let's welcome in one of our legacy Patreons here.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,300
 I'm gonna have to make it up to him again.

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,200
 He's all like just, "Damn, he's kind of being ushered in by the Dead Rabbit goons."

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,900
 It's Reverend Samuel. Everyone give a round of applause to Reverend Samuel.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,300
 One of our many resident musicians. I'll put his music video on the show notes.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,000
 The Corona Queen, I think, what it was called. It's kind of a jaunty little tune.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
 I've used the word jaunty twice so far this podcast.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,500
 Come on in, Reverend. He is being strapped down to a gurney.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,800
 But then there's like colorful balloons all around him to keep his mood high.

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,400
 He's like, "Man, this episode, I'll make it up to you, Reverend."

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,200
 Reverend Samuel, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you don't want to listen to this episode, that's fine too.

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,400
 Just helps to hear the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:08,700
 You know what, actually, let's use Reverend Samuel's custom vehicle, the Corona Queen, from his music video.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,400
 We'll get on all in poor...

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,200
 We all have the Corona virus now. We are leaving behind.

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,300
 He left. He took the hair hang glider. He's going his own way.

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,800
 We are taking the Corona Queen. We are headed out to the Philippines.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,600
 [singing]

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,400
 That's exactly how his song sounds.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
 I did a perfect rendition of their song. No, check out their music video. It's really cool.

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
 He made it himself because of our last 90-day challenge.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
 Yesterday, I ran out of time.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,200
 I wanted to go more into the adventures of the exorcist in the Philippines, Ronnie.

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,400
 Ronnie E. Ablong. But I ran out of time.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 So I saved this one. This will be our opening story for today. I find this really fascinating.

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,000
 We take the Corona Queen to the Philippines.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,200
 We spent two weeks in quarantine because we told them the name of our boat.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,700
 Reverend Samuel rescues us in the end, a daring raid.

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,000
 We're now walking around the Philippines, and we are going to meet Ronnie E. Ablong.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
 Specifically, we're going to spy on him.

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,400
 So we're hiding in the bushes, and we're looking through a window, and he's sitting there with his logbook.

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
 And he's writing stuff down.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
 [shushing]

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,800
 Very noisy pen. Very, very noisy pen.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,400
 [shushing]

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,200
 He wrote this. He didn't need a logbook. He actually posted this on Facebook.

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 I just like spying in bushes.

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,800
 Like, Jason, you weirdo.

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,000
 You can just go to his Facebook page and read this post. I'm going to read it to you.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
 This might be one of the most--

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,000
 If this story is true. Big asterisks to this one, right?

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,600
 If this story is true, he could have implications for us all.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,500
 Here we go. Case number one.

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,200
 I don't know if this is actually his first case or the first case he put on Facebook.

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,600
 If this was his first case-- he did list it as case number one--

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
 then he has an amazing career in front of him.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,800
 This is the first thing he-- he's like, "Oh, I'm a brand new exorcist. What's on the talk of the day? This?"

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,200
 Oh, dude, he's plucked. He's basically Sam and Dean rolled into one. Here we go.

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,200
 Case one. I'm going to read right from his case file.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,000
 A female junior high school student.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,200
 She came once or twice a month for exorcism session.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,500
 I didn't know. I bet you didn't know. It was that casual.

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,100
 That was shocking to me. I didn't know. It was like, "You're possessed by such demons."

72
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,500
 They're like, "So how many times would you like to see me this week?"

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,300
 "I don't know. Once or twice a month?"

74
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,700
 "Oh, yeah. I'm sure the demons in charge of your body will be totally fine with that lackadaisical schedule."

75
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,100
 "I thought they strapped you down to a bed and just like yelled at you for a couple hours."

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,500
 "Not-- So does Thursday work for you?"

77
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,200
 "No, no, no. I'm going to be perverting mankind."

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,500
 "Oh, okay. How about Saturday?"

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
 A female junior high school student.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 She came once or twice a month for exorcism session.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,500
 She was possessed by Lucifer.

82
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,900
 You definitely need more than one or two--

83
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,200
 One or two sessions a month!

84
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,100
 And it's Lucifer!

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,700
 It's the Lord of Hell!

86
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,000
 Let me continue. Once during the duration of her case,

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,800
 she didn't return for almost three months.

88
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
 I thought the case was over.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,100
 But one day she returned.

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,200
 So...

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,100
 Lucifer-- Lucifer has possessed the young girl.

92
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,500
 And Ronnie is seen here once or twice a month.

93
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
 Loses track of Lucifer for three months

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,100
 and goes, "Oh, I guess she's cured."

95
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,500
 You don't think that Lucifer is actually just not going to the appointments anymore?

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,900
 The Lord of Lies isn't just really good at making up excuses?

97
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,700
 If you knew someone in your neighborhood--

98
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,800
 No, no, scratch that.

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,000
 If you knew someone that you had a responsibility towards was possessed by Lucifer

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,100
 and you just stopped seeing them,

101
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,600
 you don't know where they're at.

102
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,900
 You are going to assume they are wrecking vengeance across the planet.

103
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
 You're not going to-- I guess she's cured?

104
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,400
 I guess everything's totally fine.

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,800
 But one day she returned.

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,100
 Upon inquiry of what happened,

107
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,100
 she told me that after our last session,

108
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,500
 she no longer felt the presence of Lucifer or his minion.

109
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,100
 So actually, I'm wrong.

110
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,900
 I should have kept reading it, but I read it this--

111
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,400
 So he did cure her.

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,900
 All it takes to get Lucifer,

113
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,400
 a mortal enemy of the Almighty God,

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,200
 out of a junior high school girl,

115
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
 once or twice a month.

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,800
 That's all they should-- That's basically the movie the exorcist lied to us.

117
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,200
 They should have just stopped by the house and come--

118
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
 That was like Pazuzu.

119
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,500
 That wasn't even like a top level demon.

120
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,400
 I'm talking about Lucifer here, the light bringer.

121
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,600
 Once or twice a month.

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,700
 That's crazy.

123
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,000
 If you are currently seeing a therapist,

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
 next time you see that therapist go,

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,100
 "You know what? I'm changing this to once or twice a month."

126
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,300
 Because that's all it took for Lucifer.

127
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,400
 And they're like, "Sir, sir, this is a court order therapist.

128
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,100
 You can't just change your woman to top for now.

129
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,500
 See you in three months."

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,600
 Don't actually do that.

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,900
 But my point is that apparently,

132
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,100
 Lucifer, once or twice a month, totally fine.

133
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,300
 So why is she back?

134
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,900
 Why is she back?

135
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,700
 Well, let me keep reading here.

136
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,000
 But one evening, her parents quarreled.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,300
 At the height of their arguments, her father shouted,

138
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
 "Oh, devil!"

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
 So if you didn't listen to yesterday's episode,

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,000
 Ronnie E. believes that just by stating the names of demons,

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,300
 you can bring them into your life.

142
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,400
 That's-- And some of you guys probably didn't listen to it,

143
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,500
 because I said,

144
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,700
 "At the end of this episode, I'm gonna be sure to say demon names,

145
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,100
 because I have to tell the story."

146
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,200
 And it's a cursed episode.

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,300
 All the episodes this week are cursed.

148
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,900
 So he believes that just by saying,

149
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,500
 "Oh, devil!"

150
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,900
 The devil will show up.

151
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,600
 Now, I remember-- You know, I grew up in the church.

152
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,500
 My dad was a Southern Baptist minister when I was growing up.

153
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,900
 We weren't super-- Like, I was--

154
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
 I'm not saying we weren't super religious.

155
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,400
 My dad was a minister.

156
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,200
 But my dad-- I think I've told this story before.

157
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 My dad, when he joined the ministry,

158
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,600
 he bought a painting of an owl.

159
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,500
 And he'd hang it up as an innest house.

160
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,900
 It was a really nice painting of an owl.

161
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,100
 I actually have a painting of an owl in my house as well.

162
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
 You guys see it on my Patreon live streams.

163
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,200
 But the reason why he-- He actually did that for a purpose.

164
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,100
 He goes, "A lot of times, fundamentalist Christians,

165
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,500
 Southern Baptists tend to be very superstitious.

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,600
 And they see the owl as a symbol of evil and demonic activity.

167
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,300
 So he bought that picture as he's growing horns

168
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,000
 and his eyes turn into slits."

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
 No, he goes, "Because that's stupid.

170
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,300
 It's a picture of an owl.

171
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,600
 And owls are God's creatures."

172
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,800
 Who cares? It's dumb.

173
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
 It's stupid to be afraid of an owl.

174
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,500
 So I'm going to buy an owl and put it in a pot.

175
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 An actual owl.

176
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,700
 There's owls flying everywhere.

177
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
 I had a very, very crazy childhood.

178
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
 That's why.

179
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
 Where was I going?

180
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,200
 What's this episode even about?

181
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
 Oh, yeah. Oh, devil.

182
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,100
 So I remember though, hearing stuff like,

183
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,600
 "Don't call them deviled eggs.

184
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
 You'll meet Southern Baptists,

185
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,500
 the fundamentalists that will call them angel eggs.

186
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,900
 People won't use the term devil's food cake."

187
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,600
 I remember that.

188
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,400
 Like, my dad just be like, "I was so stupid."

189
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,000
 He'd go, "Fly my owls and the owls are coming to the pot.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,100
 Let them attack everyone."

191
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,300
 "Ah, ah, ah, they're deviled eggs.

192
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,600
 They're deviled eggs, okay?"

193
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 So I'm used to that.

194
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,900
 Like, I grew up, again, my family wasn't like that,

195
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,200
 but growing up into churches like that

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
 where you didn't use terms like "devil's eggs" or...

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 So I get that.

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,300
 I totally get it.

199
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,600
 I think it's dumb.

200
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,700
 I don't believe it because people use the term.

201
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,000
 I mean, if this was the case, everyone who owned a PS2

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,300
 would have been possessed.

203
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,200
 Because you couldn't own a PS2 without at least once saying,

204
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,300
 "Devil may cry."

205
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,700
 But these terms are used in video games and...

206
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,900
 Food, obviously, and then other stuff.

207
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,600
 But people use that term all the time.

208
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,100
 So...

209
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,600
 But Ronnie E. Believe is just by saying these names,

210
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,200
 these people, these spirits will show up.

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,400
 So, how did she get possessed by Lucifer again, really?

212
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,100
 That long segue about outpaintings and PS2 video games.

213
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,900
 Let me go back to this.

214
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,600
 But one evening, her parents quarreled at the height of their arguments.

215
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,300
 Her father shouted, "Oh, devil!"

216
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,000
 And the devil came.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,300
 And according to these notes, according to case file number one,

218
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,600
 and the devil came and said, "Pah! Anything I can do for you?"

219
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
 Which is awesome.

220
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,900
 The fact that he's not like this sneaky spirit, like possessing their daughter.

221
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,000
 He actually showed up with a bunch of smoke,

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,400
 and I imagine a top hat and he tips it, "Anything I can do for you?"

223
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
 And he sounds like a demonic urkel.

224
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,500
 The case file continues, and she was possessed again after that.

225
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,700
 Just because her dad said, "Oh, devil!"

226
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,500
 And Lucifer appears, "Anything I can do for you?"

227
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,200
 So, that's that.

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,900
 That's that story.

229
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,000
 That happened, apparently.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 She's possessed for another two years, but look on the bright side.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,800
 That's only 24 to 48 visits.

232
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
 You'll be fine.

233
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
 You'll be totally fine, young lady.

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
 Why would devil want to possess?

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 That would seem like be the most inefficient person to possess.

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
 A junior high school student.

237
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 He's just taking tests like a baby.

238
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,900
 What are you doing, junior high?

239
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,100
 I mean, you can get in a little bit of trouble.

240
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,300
 You can ruin her life.

241
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,700
 But, I mean, she's just like a junior high school student.

242
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,900
 We talked about this yesterday.

243
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,800
 The rest of the time, maybe she's like making her smoke or like play hooky and things like that.

244
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,600
 But the time that she's not doing that,

245
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,300
 she's like taking devils like, "Oh, man, I know this one.

246
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,200
 I know this one. I have infinite knowledge."

247
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,500
 But this isn't the way I was taught how to do math.

248
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
 Why? Why?

249
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 I do want to say this, though.

250
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 I'm just killing time before he gets to the next story.

251
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,600
 This would be an amazing sitcom.

252
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,400
 Saved by the Hell.

253
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,900
 Okay.

254
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,000
 Saved by the Hell.

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,900
 Here's my pitch.

256
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,100
 Satan is in high school.

257
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,700
 The principal is God.

258
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,000
 And that's all I got.

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,700
 That's literally all I got.

260
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
 I've been thinking about this for like two days.

261
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,000
 That's all I got.

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,900
 Because I don't want to get super sacrilegious and start like making jokes about religious figures.

263
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
 I can make jokes about God and Satan.

264
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
 They can take it. They can totally take it.

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,000
 You have God as principal.

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 You have Satan as a student.

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
 And they're just constantly pulling pranks on each other.

268
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,100
 God's like immortal misery.

269
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,200
 And Satan's like, "I'll get you next time, God."

270
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
 No, you won't.

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
 I'm far more powerful than you.

272
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 And it goes on and on for about seven seasons.

273
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 And then there's a movie.

274
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,100
 Not only the first three seasons are good,

275
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,800
 but Saved by the Hell.

276
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 Okay.

277
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,900
 We can no longer put this off anymore.

278
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,500
 Reverend Samuel.

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,400
 Trusted man of the cloth.

280
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,200
 Are you ready to call in that carpenter copter?

281
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
 We're leaving behind the Philippines.

282
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,300
 We are headed out to Belle, Florida.

283
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,300
 I remember back when I was in college.

284
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,000
 I had a friend.

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
 We're gonna call him Michael.

286
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,200
 I was in college.

287
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 Just graduated high school.

288
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,300
 I was working at Mervins.

289
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,000
 They don't exist anymore, but it was a clothing store.

290
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,900
 I was hanging out with a couple of the people who worked security at Mervins.

291
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,700
 Dude, and they would beat the crap out of shoplifters.

292
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
 They'd get in full on fights there.

293
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 Because Mervins did not put up a shoplifting.

294
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,100
 This was in Rancho Cordova in California,

295
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,200
 which is relatively rough area.

296
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
 Anyways, I'm talking to this guy and he tells me one time

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,300
 that he got in a fight with this dude at a bar.

298
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,200
 Like this started off as an argument in the bar.

299
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 They went outside argument turned into fist fight.

300
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
 Fist fight turns into grappling.

301
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,900
 They're fighting.

302
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,400
 He goes, I'll tell you what, we're going at it.

303
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,300
 And the next thing I know, I'm pop a thumb in and I pull his eyeball out.

304
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,900
 And he goes, I'm standing there, Jason, and I'm looking at this dude.

305
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,000
 I don't know who this guy is, this big guy.

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,900
 And he's standing there and I'm standing there.

307
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,300
 And in the palm of my hand is his eyeball.

308
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,900
 It's still attached to this dude.

309
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,700
 He's not like running away.

310
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,400
 He realized, hey, what's my hand with?

311
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,700
 Whoa.

312
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,600
 He has his hand cupped and he's holding this man's eyeball.

313
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,900
 And he goes, I knew that I could just close my hand and pop it.

314
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
 And I go, what'd you do?

315
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
 And he goes, well, I didn't do that.

316
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,200
 He goes, I just kind of gave it back to him.

317
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,000
 He goes, I just kind of like let it kind of sit in my palm.

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,500
 And he goes, the fight was over.

319
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,300
 The fight was over.

320
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,300
 Like it was a very, very serious fight, but his eyeball came out.

321
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,000
 That's kind of the end of it, right?

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,400
 My friend, Michael didn't want to kill the guy, but he goes for a moment.

323
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,500
 The fight was so brutal.

324
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,600
 I'm holding that eyeball in the palm of my hand that I thought that I could just close my hand.

325
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
 But he didn't do that.

326
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,800
 The guy goes to the hospital and gets his eyeball fixed.

327
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,900
 Like it was, it was fine.

328
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,500
 We probably didn't look great for a while.

329
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,100
 He probably joined the black eye club.

330
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,500
 Mitt Romney's like, you are now one of us.

331
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,800
 Here's your Illuminati membership.

332
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,600
 But you know, the thing with like bar community, everyone kind of knows each other.

333
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
 You go to the same bar, bartender knows you, all that stuff.

334
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,900
 Michael tells me he goes, so a while later, maybe like a week or two later,

335
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,100
 he goes, the guy wanted to make it up to me because he realized that he was in the wrong to start the fight.

336
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,100
 He was in the wrong to try because he was a bigger guy.

337
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
 Michael was a smaller guy.

338
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,200
 Probably just thought he could beat him up.

339
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,100
 He goes, so he invited me over to his house.

340
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,500
 He wanted to have like a party.

341
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,300
 He wanted to, you know, make it up to me.

342
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,600
 And I go, oh, it's kind of cool.

343
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,800
 At least, you know, he's the bigger man and stuff like that.

344
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 And Michael looks at me and he goes, I didn't go.

345
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,100
 And I go, why not?

346
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
 He goes, I'll never forget this.

347
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,100
 He goes, never go to a man's house.

348
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,100
 After you've held his eyeball in your hand.

349
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,000
 And you might think that's a super specific.

350
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,200
 How often are you actually going to do that?

351
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,200
 You're like, well, I did hold his severed arm, but I didn't hold his eyeball.

352
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
 I'll come over.

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,600
 The fact of the matter was when you beat somebody so brutally, they can never be your friend.

354
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,900
 You always have to watch your back.

355
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,400
 I remembered that lesson.

356
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,800
 I remember that lesson.

357
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,100
 I heard that story when I just graduated high school.

358
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,500
 I must have been, I graduated early.

359
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,400
 So I was like 17, 18 years old.

360
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,100
 Very, very important lesson.

361
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,500
 When you savagely beat another human, they will never be your friend again.

362
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,400
 And you could even argue emotionally as well.

363
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,600
 Like when you just completely collapse somebody emotionally.

364
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 And then they're like, hey, come over.

365
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,700
 I'll make it up to you because he figured that this was a trap.

366
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,000
 He was going to go over to this guy's house.

367
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,400
 A bunch of the dude's buddies were going to be there and he may lose more than an eyeball.

368
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,100
 It's May 2019.

369
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,000
 We're in the town of Belle, Florida, specifically.

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
 We're at a mobile home park.

371
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,200
 Now these mobile homes aren't parked right next to each other.

372
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,900
 It's Florida, so they seem to have pretty good space, at least on the photos that I saw.

373
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,900
 So in this motor home yard, we're going to meet Alex Bonilla, 51 year old man,

374
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,400
 married to a 35 year old woman.

375
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 They have three kids together.

376
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,300
 The next store, mobile home, which there's still a good amount of space there,

377
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,100
 has Jimmy and his wife.

378
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,700
 They've been neighbors for around four years at this point.

379
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,400
 And they have kids of the same age.

380
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
 So their kids play with each other.

381
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
 And Jimmy, that's not his real name,

382
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,500
 Jimmy approaches Alex and his wife and says, hey, you know, I'm working.

383
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,400
 My wife's working.

384
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,500
 Our kids are around the same age.

385
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,300
 Would you mind babysitting my kids?

386
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,700
 Now, Alex's wife goes, oh, yeah, sure.

387
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,900
 I'll totally babysit your kids.

388
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,100
 You know, the kids just play together anyways.

389
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,000
 But one day Alex comes home from work early and he sees Jimmy and his wife

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 having sex.

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Alex, of course, is heartbroken.

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,500
 He's enraged.

393
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,100
 He's been betrayed by both his best friend and his wife.

394
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
 He tells Alex he needs to stay away from his wife.

395
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,200
 No more babysitting.

396
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,600
 That's obvious, right?

397
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
 Stay away from my wife.

398
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,200
 But she can still come over on Tuesdays to watch the kids.

399
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,900
 We're going to have nothing to do with you.

400
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,300
 Alex and his wife fight for a while, but they decide to reconcile.

401
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,200
 They decided that the love they have and the children they have are more important

402
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
 than one in discretion.

403
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,800
 That happened in May of 2019.

404
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,700
 June 14th, 2019.

405
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,800
 Alex comes home early from work and sees Jimmy staring at his house.

406
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,600
 Alex is looking across the field and just sees Jimmy standing there, staring.

407
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,500
 He figures Jimmy is trying to see if his wife is home so they can have sex again.

408
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,800
 Alex isn't going to put up with that.

409
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,900
 He walks over to Jimmy's house and he says, "You need to stay away from my wife.

410
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,800
 You need to leave her alone."

411
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
 Jimmy gets mad.

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,800
 No one tells Jimmy what to do.

413
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,000
 Jimmy speaks to the third person.

414
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,700
 If Jimmy wants to watch, Jimmy wants to watch.

415
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,500
 The arguing turns into a fight.

416
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,900
 Alex says, "You're going to pay for what you did right now.

417
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,000
 You're going to pay for what you did."

418
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,300
 The next thing Alex knows he's at work.

419
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,400
 When the police show up to his place of business, they ask, "What's going on?"

420
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
 And he tells the story.

421
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,700
 I just told.

422
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,800
 Came home, saw Jimmy staring, gotten an argument, gotten a fist fight.

423
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,700
 The next thing he knew, he was at work.

424
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,100
 He quote unquote, "blacked out."

425
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,700
 But the police already know what happened.

426
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,000
 They've been to Jimmy's house.

427
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,800
 Jimmy said he was doing some gardening on June 14th, 2019.

428
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 He was doing some gardening.

429
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,900
 He was making breakfast for the girls.

430
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,500
 Dad stuff, right?

431
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,400
 Just dad stuff.

432
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,300
 He sees Alex staring at him from across the field.

433
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
 What?

434
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
 I don't know.

435
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
 That weirdo.

436
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,900
 Alex walks up to Jimmy's house and is standing at the doorway.

437
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,400
 Now, Jimmy can tell just from the way Alex is standing, he's hiding something.

438
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
 Not emotionally.

439
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,800
 Not, "I don't want to know my secret crush."

440
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,100
 The fact that it looks like he has something tucked under his arm.

441
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,300
 His arms are crossed and it looks like he's kind of concealing something.

442
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,600
 But the door's open and Alex can just walk in.

443
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,800
 And as he steps inside, Jimmy looks and he can tell what Alex is concealing is a pistol.

444
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
 Jimmy's daughter sees Alex.

445
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 Uncle Alex.

446
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,500
 These people have known each other for four years.

447
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,300
 Their kids play together.

448
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,300
 Jimmy's oldest daughter goes running towards Alex to give him a hug.

449
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:42,000
 And Alex just pushes her away, pulls out the gun and puts it right to Jimmy's head.

450
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,500
 He forces Jimmy into the bedroom of the mobile home and he shuts the bedroom door.

451
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:55,600
 Alex tells Jimmy, "I hate that you have a good life and I don't."

452
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,800
 He then pulls out a two foot long metal pipe he had hidden in his pants.

453
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,600
 Howdy, was this guy walking like a gingerbread man?

454
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,500
 I have no idea how he moved with a two foot long- my legs are two feet long.

455
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
 Maybe longer.

456
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,600
 But the point is, my knees aren't.

457
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,100
 I couldn't be able to move my knees.

458
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,500
 He pulls out a two foot long metal pipe and says, "I'm going to ask you a series of questions

459
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,100
 and every time you lie, I'm going to break a bone."

460
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,500
 Jimmy knows what's coming.

461
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,300
 And he knows that he's going to start questioning him about whether or not he's still been

462
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,500
 sleeping with his wife, how many times they slept together, all of this stuff.

463
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 And he's begging Alex, "Listen, just leave.

464
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 Just leave, just leave.

465
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,600
 I won't call the cops, just leave.

466
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 I've never slept with your wife again.

467
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,500
 Please, please just leave."

468
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,200
 For whatever reason, Alex then just drops the metal pipe.

469
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,900
 He's no longer going to do that gimmick.

470
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,600
 He's no longer going to play that game.

471
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 He decides to move to phase two.

472
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,000
 He has Jimmy stand up and get his hands tied behind his back.

473
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,300
 Bad move.

474
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,600
 Never get in the car, never get tied up.

475
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,300
 And it's funny because I can say that and I can tell you that and you guys, if you're

476
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,400
 ever faced with this, it's better to get shot in the head than to get tied up.

477
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,600
 Because once you're tied up, who knows what's going to happen to you.

478
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,700
 It could become three days of horrible, horrible events.

479
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
 Never get in the car.

480
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,200
 It's better to get shot in the street corner where everyone sees it than be taken out in

481
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,100
 the desert and again, stuff could be going for days and days and days.

482
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,200
 There's a little asterisk to that though, which I don't really think about because I'm

483
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,800
 not in this situation.

484
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,700
 But if there are kids involved, you may decide to get tied up.

485
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,800
 His daughter is in the mobile home.

486
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
 As far as he knows, it's still in the mobile home.

487
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,700
 If she was in the mobile home, she got pushed aside when the gun pulled out.

488
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,700
 She could have ran off to get help, but they don't say her age, but I'm imagining she's

489
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
 fairly young in the story.

490
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,200
 Seven or eight or something like that.

491
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,500
 Normally, like 16 year old girls don't run up and hug Uncle Alex.

492
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,400
 I think she's young enough and they needed a babysitter.

493
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,300
 So that also makes me think they're probably like nine or 10 or younger.

494
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,300
 So Jimmy decides to let his hands get tied up.

495
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,700
 Alex then forces Jimmy to be on his feet.

496
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,100
 So hands are firmly tied behind his back.

497
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,900
 Jimmy's now standing up.

498
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,400
 I'm starting to, I don't know why I didn't think about this before.

499
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,900
 I'm starting to second guess the name I gave him that was not intentional.

500
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
 I just came up with a fake name.

501
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,700
 Jimmy is not his real name.

502
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,700
 Alex pulls down Jimmy's pants.

503
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
 We have two quotes.

504
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,500
 All of this information is from the police report and all of the quotes are paraphrases

505
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,900
 of what is actually being said.

506
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,900
 Unless I do this, when I say quote, you are not going to die, Alex says.

507
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,700
 Which you are going to have something to remember this for your whole life.

508
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,400
 This is normal.

509
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,600
 You will not die today.

510
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,900
 Unquote.

511
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,400
 Alex at this point pulls out gloves and a rubber band.

512
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,900
 Oddly prepared for this.

513
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,000
 I don't know what the pipe was.

514
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,900
 I don't know if the pipe, because it doesn't sound like he wanted to do that at all.

515
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,600
 It might have just been a way to control the situation with violence.

516
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,700
 If the gun to the head didn't work, I mean, you figured that would be it.

517
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,400
 Why would you need a two foot pipe that would make it hard for you to walk?

518
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,900
 This was his plan all along.

519
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,500
 He puts on gloves.

520
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:37,100
 He grabs a rubber band and he begins to put the rubber band onto Jimmy's dick and then

521
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:45,700
 wraps it around again and again and again, cutting off circulation.

522
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,300
 Then Alex pulls out a pair of scissors.

523
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,500
 I want you to go to, I want you to pause the end.

524
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 You're still listening to this right now.

525
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,100
 I want you to go somewhere in your house to cry.

526
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
 I want you to go in your house.

527
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:07,700
 I want you to find the sharpest pair of scissors in your house right now.

528
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
 Spoiler alert, they're not that sharp.

529
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,300
 They're pointy, but they're not that sharp.

530
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,100
 Now unless you're like a medical student and you're constantly cutting clothes off

531
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,100
 of crash victims, I don't know why the medical students do that and not the EMTs.

532
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,100
 Or you know, like a chef with those special like scissors that cut carrots or whatever.

533
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
 Maybe.

534
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,100
 But like the scissors I use to like cut paper?

535
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
 Uh-uh.

536
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:43,100
 No way are those sharp enough to do what Alex is going to try to do.

537
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,300
 He begins to try to cut off Jimmy's dick with a pair of scissors that you would find in

538
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,700
 your household.

539
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:59,620
 And Jimmy is jumping from side to side, hands bound as the scissors sips, sips, sips, moving

540
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,500
 through the air and closing, ssss.

541
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,700
 Right before they cut it on his dick.

542
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,040
 It might get a little bit of a pinch, a little bit of a nick, but Alex is getting frustrated

543
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:22,540
 that he can't get them to cut into Jimmy's penis.

544
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,800
 Listen to this.

545
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,620
 This passage in the police report boggles my mind.

546
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,180
 Because I'm not this strong.

547
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,260
 I don't think I've ever thought I was this strong as Jimmy was.

548
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,260
 Listen to this.

549
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,860
 This is from the police report.

550
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:47,840
 The victim stated that he tried to move to get away and to not scream because of his

551
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,880
 children in the house.

552
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,960
 Could you imagine that?

553
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,440
 A madman is trying to chop off your dick and you're thinking of your kids.

554
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,240
 You don't want to terrify your kids.

555
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,680
 You don't want to be screaming the fear and the terror you feel in your body because you

556
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,440
 don't want to traumatize your children.

557
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,320
 I'm not that strong.

558
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,040
 I would be the loudest man on the planet.

559
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,580
 They would write songs about me a thousand years from now.

560
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,620
 The voice heard around the world had I been in this situation.

561
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,040
 I'm not that strong.

562
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
 To think of kids.

563
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
 I don't have kids.

564
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,920
 To me, it would be different.

565
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,180
 But I just boggles my mind.

566
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,960
 He was trying to be stoic.

567
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,460
 He's almost accepted what's going to happen.

568
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,600
 This throws Jimmy to the ground, places his knee on Jimmy's chest.

569
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,320
 The game's over.

570
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,960
 He's flat on his back.

571
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,800
 He can't move.

572
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,520
 Jimmy takes the scissors and starts cutting off Jimmy's dick.

573
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,080
 Now you might have thought I was exaggerating when I said that the scissors were dull.

574
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,160
 That they were just household scissors.

575
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,880
 You're like Jason, how do you know where they're photos of the scissors?

576
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:14,820
 The police report states that it was taking a very long time to cut off his dick.

577
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,300
 He was having to force each cut to make its way through the muscle and the fat.

578
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,140
 To the point where Alex was getting frustrated, there was blood everywhere.

579
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,220
 Alex could not believe that it took this long to cut off human genitalia.

580
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,140
 He's getting frustrated that this isn't already over.

581
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:39,480
 It was taking so long that at times Alex would stop cutting and then put the gun to Jimmy's

582
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,480
 head once again and just hold it there.

583
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,280
 I can only imagine it was because your hand was cramping.

584
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,160
 It was actually getting sore trying to do this.

585
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,000
 So while he was trying to recover from the cramped hand, he still needed to inflict terror

586
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 on Jimmy.

587
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,560
 He'd put the gun to his head.

588
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,540
 And then he would go back to cutting.

589
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:11,020
 Finally after a few minutes, Alex is able to sever two thirds of Jimmy's penis.

590
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,260
 Jimmy was laying there on the ground.

591
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,580
 His body is shaking.

592
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,900
 He's going into shock and he's looking down and he sees what's happened.

593
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:26,380
 He's trying not to vomit as Alex picks up the dick and is holding it in his hand and

594
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,000
 says quote, "Don't act this way."

595
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,720
 This is not like saying I'm a bad example.

596
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,840
 Not like saying don't act like me.

597
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,280
 He's saying don't cheat.

598
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
 Don't cheat.

599
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,000
 He goes, "Don't act this way."

600
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 This is normal.

601
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
 He keeps talking about how what he's doing is normal.

602
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,560
 It's all normal.

603
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,240
 He then says, "And if you try to call the police, I will be out in two months and I will come

604
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,800
 back and finish this."

605
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,000
 This might be the most heartbreaking part of the police report.

606
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,960
 Alex is standing there with the penis severed.

607
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,560
 He's holding it in his hand.

608
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,020
 Jimmy is laying on the floor.

609
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,320
 He's losing a lot of blood.

610
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,320
 He's going into shock.

611
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,520
 He can't believe this actually happened.

612
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,480
 This is the end of the police report.

613
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,940
 Quote, "The victim stated at this point the defendant left.

614
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,420
 He stated when the defendant opened the bedroom door, his oldest daughter was laying on the

615
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:31,200
 ground by the bottom of the door, watching through the crack."

616
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
 Could you imagine that?

617
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,160
 I mean, that's just so much to mentally unpack.

618
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,160
 One, Jimmy, who was trying to be stoic this whole time.

619
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,320
 As that bedroom door opens, he sees his oldest daughter curled up on the ground.

620
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,600
 She was watching the whole thing through that little crack in the door.

621
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,260
 The part that she couldn't see her imagination was filling in.

622
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:00,140
 And him just looking at her and the heartbreak he must have gone through for her to have

623
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:08,600
 seen that and then that poor girl.

624
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:16,700
 How would you even process that level of violence at any age?

625
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:27,420
 Prolonged torture at any age, let alone eight, nine or younger.

626
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:34,260
 I mean, I'm guessing that door opened and he saw his daughter was watching it.

627
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,880
 Isn't that awful, man?

628
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,380
 They never found the penis.

629
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,780
 It's gone.

630
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,520
 They did arrest Alex.

631
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,780
 He goes, "Ah, it's normal, man.

632
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
 What are you guys talking about?

633
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,500
 I blacked out."

634
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,420
 He just recently got sentenced 20 years in prison with, I think, 10 years of parole

635
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,500
 after that.

636
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,660
 He's in his 50s.

637
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,860
 Technically, he shouldn't get out until he's 70, but the way that the justice system

638
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,540
 works sometimes, he could be out in five.

639
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
 Who knows?

640
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,460
 But hopefully not, right?

641
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
 Hopefully not.

642
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,740
 This sounds very premeditated.

643
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,580
 The fact that 20 years actually doesn't seem like that long at all considering how premeditated

644
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,660
 it was.

645
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,740
 He brought in the gloves.

646
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,740
 Just the fact that he's bringing the gloves and the rubber bands in.

647
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,260
 It's not like they got into a fight and he grabbed a pair of scissors and started trying

648
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,300
 to snip at it.

649
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,380
 They never found the penis, though.

650
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,980
 They could never reattach it.

651
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:30,100
 Jimmy, again, we don't know his real name, he said that, you know, because he was married.

652
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,100
 He was married.

653
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,420
 He was cheating on his wife as well, but he goes, "I can't have sex with my wife anymore."

654
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,100
 The doctor says you'll never have any sensation down there.

655
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,460
 He has trouble urinating.

656
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:46,260
 He can't really have sex in any traditional way.

657
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,220
 It's just a story of brutal violence on a sunny Florida afternoon.

658
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,940
 One man slept with another man's wife and he got his dick chopped off by a jealous husband.

659
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,100
 The smart move would have been not to sleep with a woman in the first place.

660
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:09,860
 But barring that, when you hurt somebody physically or emotionally, you have to be on the lookout

661
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
 for retribution.

662
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,500
 If you've done someone wrong no matter how much you liked them before, or no matter how

663
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,500
 much you liked them afterwards, if you've done somebody wrong, you have to be aware

664
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,940
 that at any point they can strike against you.

665
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:32,220
 They could be hiding that rage under a perfect smile.

666
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,140
 When you've hurt someone, you cannot trust them.

667
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:43,700
 Or as my friend put it, never go to someone's house after you've held their eyeball in your

668
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:50,180
 hand.

669
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,740
