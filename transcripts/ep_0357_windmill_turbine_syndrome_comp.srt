1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
 A man makes a horrifying discovery in the middle of the road.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,520
 Another man dies in a horrible way.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,600
 And then we take a look at a...

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,960
 It's kind of hard to describe.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,640
 First off, we're going to look at a conspiracy theory that wind turbines may make people

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,400
 kill other people with a hammer.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,360
 And then we take a look at the broader conspiracy that there is a war on for your mind right

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,880
 now.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,240
 The Battlefield?

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
 The Movie Theater.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:43,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
 You know, I was looking at my notes for this particular week of shows.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
 Man, all the episodes, okay, all the notes are super depressing.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,440
 All the story ideas are super depressing.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,160
 Now I'm not going to do a bunch of depressing stories this week.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,200
 I gotta go find some more lighthearted ones.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
 So I will.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
 I'll find those.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
 They will show up.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,640
 But in the meantime, let's talk about some horrible human tragedies.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,280
 This first one was recommended or sent to me by James Milne.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,760
 I feel really bad because James, he recommended a story in the past and I asked how do you

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,240
 pronounce your name and he told me and then I promptly forgot.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,920
 It's James Milne or James Milne.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,760
 I apologize, James, but I really appreciate the story idea.

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,280
 So I keep saying story idea.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
 Like I'm writing short fiction.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
 This happened in real life and what happened was September 30th, 2019.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,840
 So not too long ago, this dude, walking down the street in Anchorage, Alaska, doesn't have

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
 a care in the world.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
 I don't know.

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,840
 He actually probably could have owned a Fortune 500 company.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,680
 It could have been super stressed.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 Doesn't matter.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
 He's not the subject of the story.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,440
 But this dude's walking down the street.

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,400
 He finds an SD card.

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
 Now I've done that before.

43
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,480
 Well, I'm sure everyone's found stuff in the road.

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,560
 But when I come across like SD cards or cell phones, I always try to look at them.

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
 I always try to see what's in them.

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,800
 Now this one actually was labeled.

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,960
 It was not labeled Scarlett Johansson, parentheses, topless.

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,400
 Must watch underline, underline.

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 Gone wrong.

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 It's not labeled that.

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,240
 This one is a hundred times worse than that.

52
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,360
 SD card that's labeled homicide at Midtown Marriott.

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,000
 So the dude puts the SD card in into his port.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 He's a cyborg.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,080
 He's like, "Ear, eliminate worries, no worries, insert card."

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,000
 He takes it home, presumably.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,520
 Puts it into his computer.

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,800
 Not into his own mainframe.

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,560
 And it is actually what it says.

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,240
 There's 39 photos and 12 videos of a man brutally beating and killing a woman.

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,640
 So he calls the cops.

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,320
 Now, you may think, "Hmm, this could just be someone's snuff collection that they found."

63
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,800
 But it probably would still be a good idea to call the cops.

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,160
 So he does call the cops though.

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,520
 And the cops watch the video.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
 They come over and they're like, "Hey, how's it going?"

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,920
 The cyborg's like, "Boot up."

68
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,520
 Walking slowly towards the door.

69
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,200
 Initiate officer shake hand protocol.

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,800
 They're like, "Dude, just give us the SD card."

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,320
 And you're saying, "Jayson, just continue the story."

72
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
 Fine.

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 Card eject.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:22,680
 So anyways, the cops begin watching the video and they recognize the guy in the video.

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,760
 His name is Brian Steven Smith.

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,480
 And what's interesting, he was currently being investigated.

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,560
 The cops are currently watching him for something else.

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,280
 They haven't revealed what else he was under investigation for.

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,600
 But he was under investigation.

80
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,000
 That's why the cops recognized him.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,600
 Now he was arrested for being in this video footage of him killing this woman.

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,480
 On October 2nd, the body of that woman, that murdered woman, was found and he admitted

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,840
 to killing another woman.

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,520
 And as far as I know, her body has not been found yet.

85
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,520
 So Brian Steven Smith is currently being held for the murders of two women.

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
 Creepy.

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,040
 Now, that's just a standard serial killer story in one aspect.

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,240
 But then you can look at it like this.

89
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,520
 First off, I would find it bizarre if he labeled that...

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,720
 Okay, we're going to put on our little paranormal conspiracy hats.

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,480
 Did he actually label the SD card himself?

92
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,000
 And you're like, "Jayson, that's...

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,640
 Of course he did.

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,320
 Were you saying that a goblin, a murder goblin, labeled it?"

95
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
 Well, no.

96
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,000
 But I mean, I think it would be kind of dumb.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,600
 If I was a jewel thief, I wouldn't take...

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
 I wouldn't write on...

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,800
 I wouldn't take one, I wouldn't videotape my crimes, and then two.

100
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,680
 But I guess you don't have a fetish for stealing jewels.

101
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
 Most people don't.

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,840
 I'm sure someone...

103
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,440
 Some jewel thieves walking around all turned on the whole time is like, "Ooh, I can't wait

104
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,000
 to get home and remember this event."

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,920
 But for the most part, it's like a financial crime.

106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,400
 I guess a serial killer or a killer in general would videotape it to relive it.

107
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,880
 But still, why would you label it?

108
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,160
 Secondly, like, the fact that it fell out of wherever he was holding it, his pocket,

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,560
 or maybe he's walking around with it in his hand looking at it, being like, "Ooh, ooh,

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,600
 ooh, ooh, once I get home, I'm going to watch you."

111
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,440
 Like, that is a miracle.

112
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,520
 Because here was a man who had already murdered two women.

113
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,400
 And proof of his crimes showing his face murdering a woman, it wasn't just his face.

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,680
 This whole body murdered the woman.

115
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,160
 But his face in the video.

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
 That's a miracle.

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,120
 Because who knows how many other women he would have killed.

118
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,600
 So it's not just the story of a serial killer.

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
 It's the story...

120
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,480
 It's this total perfect storm of a serial killer losing proof of his crimes, which again, is

121
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,680
 something the little rascals would do.

122
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,960
 That's quite stupid, but he loses proof of his crime.

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,160
 It's not destroyed.

124
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,860
 It's not swept away.

125
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,920
 Some kid doesn't pick it up, he raced it and put an Xbox game on it.

126
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,840
 And yeah, I know that's not how Xbox games work.

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,720
 But my point is that the right person found it at the right time.

128
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,240
 If my mom found an SD card, she wouldn't even know what it was.

129
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,640
 She wouldn't be able to take it home and put it into a computer and decipher it.

130
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,400
 Now, because it did say homicide at Midtown Marriot, she probably would call up me or

131
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,840
 my brother and have us do it.

132
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
 But you know what I mean?

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
 It was the right person.

134
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,080
 It fell in the right place that it didn't get destroyed.

135
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,160
 And it had just enough information to actually nail this jerk for being a serial killer.

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,760
 So divine intervention or just a series of fortunate incidents.

137
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
 Huh?

138
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
 Huh?

139
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

140
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,920
 Now, our next story is part of our calvocade of depressing stuff.

141
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,080
 Although this one you might be able to say has a happy ending if you like money.

142
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,200
 If you love humans, it doesn't have a happy ending.

143
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,640
 The year is 2012.

144
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,240
 We're leaving Anchorage, Alaska.

145
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
 Let's hop in the Carbentercopter.

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,040
 I don't think we've used it this season yet.

147
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
 Hop in the Carbentercopter.

148
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,120
 We're going to fly all the way down to Santa Fe Springs, California.

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,920
 And as we're flying there, I want to remind you guys the Minecraft server is now open

150
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
 to the public.

151
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,440
 So if you want to join us playing Minecraft and unlocking the secret mystery of the giant

152
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,640
 black spaceship that is just floating over spawn, join us.

153
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,520
 The website, the login, whatever you call it, whatever you kids call it, is in the show

154
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
 notes.

155
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,560
 Go ahead and put that into your Minecraft game, gamermajig, and join us.

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
 It's a lot of fun.

157
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,680
 So after that pitch, after that, I'm not making any money off of it.

158
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,600
 It actually cost me money to run the server.

159
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880
 Anyways, we land the helicopter.

160
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,920
 Everyone's like, "Dude, I don't even play Minecraft, dude.

161
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
 I just like listening about ghosts.

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
 Why are you always hawking your Minecraft server?"

163
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
 I'm like, "Come on, man.

164
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
 It's fun.

165
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
 Let's play."

166
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,200
 Anyways, as we're walking, we're walking into a bumblebee tuna plant.

167
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,280
 So put on our worker uniforms, our hard hats.

168
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,520
 You're like, "Why do we need a hard hat to be around tuna?"

169
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,120
 I'm like, "You'll see.

170
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
 Unfortunately, you'll see."

171
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
 Scammy little badge.

172
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
 Beep.

173
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
 Okay, we go in.

174
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,920
 And working there is a man named Jose Molina.

175
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,480
 Now, this is where they basically do tuna stuff.

176
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,160
 I don't know how tuna works.

177
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,320
 I know that it's a fish, and then you kill it, and then you eat it out of a can.

178
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,160
 But I didn't know they cooked it or how they'd prepare it.

179
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,520
 I just imagine they were ripping fish up, throwing fish into a grinder, and then it

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,920
 [imitates fish] shooting out into a can.

181
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,360
 I've developed a taste for tuna.

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
 I don't like it when I do taste for tuna.

183
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,000
 That's the cool name of a band.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,680
 But I never really was into tuna as a kid.

185
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,440
 That has nothing to do with this story, by the way.

186
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,520
 You may not like tuna after this story.

187
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,080
 Jose Molina was, I think he was like 56 years old.

188
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
 He had adult kids and all that stuff.

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,360
 There are chain breaks in one of the giant ovens.

190
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
 Talk about divine intervention.

191
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,400
 This one's almost the opposite.

192
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,520
 Jose goes in to fix the chain.

193
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,040
 Now, this oven is 36 foot by 54...

194
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,480
 Okay, now I think this might be a typo, honestly.

195
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:49,320
 Because I haven't written down as a 36 foot by 54 inch oven, which would be the world's

196
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,960
 biggest rectangle.

197
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,080
 I'm assuming it should be 36 feet by 54 feet?

198
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
 It doesn't matter.

199
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
 We're already halfway done.

200
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
 Either he's crawling through...

201
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,480
 How big is 54 inches?

202
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,040
 That's about four feet.

203
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,960
 So he'd have to crawl through on his belly.

204
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
 It doesn't matter.

205
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
 The point is he's in an oven.

206
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,640
 He's in an oven trying to fix the chain.

207
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,980
 Now, his coworker has another job.

208
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,300
 His coworker's job is to hit a button and to dump tuna into the oven and to turn the

209
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,440
 oven on.

210
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,360
 So the coworker's walking around the workspace and he goes, "Hmm, where's Jose?

211
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 I don't know.

212
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
 He's probably in the bathroom."

213
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
 Boop.

214
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:35,200
 And then at that point, 12,000 pounds of tuna fall into the oven.

215
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
 And the coworker turns it on.

216
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,800
 Do... turns up the heat.

217
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

218
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:56,440
 Now, I don't know at what point they realize that Jose's not in the bathroom.

219
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,720
 They do end up opening the oven and Jose is dead.

220
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,640
 Now I know you were hoping that it was some superhero origin story.

221
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,720
 I know you were hoping that it was a man who became tuna man who had the ability to talk

222
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,720
 to only tuna, but no, he died.

223
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,480
 Now this is the horrifying part of this.

224
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,400
 You're like, "Jason, that whole thing's horrifying.

225
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,840
 A guy trying to do his job crossing an oven."

226
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
 The tuna, 12,000 pounds of tuna did not kill him.

227
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,840
 When they did the autopsy, the tuna did not kill him.

228
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,360
 He was cooked to death.

229
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
 He survived what?

230
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,280
 Which I find odd that the tuna didn't kill him.

231
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,080
 But I guess if you dropped like 12,000 pounds of like wet, slimy, slidy stuff, it would

232
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,200
 just hit you and like slide down your head.

233
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,400
 Like it's not like a barbell, which hits your head.

234
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,720
 Path of least resistance, your head is the least resistance.

235
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,640
 If I threw 12,000 pounds of feather on you, wouldn't they just like tickle you?

236
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,000
 Sure, you would like suffocate, but you would be able to like move them out of the way as

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,240
 they're falling on you.

238
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,920
 And now if it was only four feet tall, that might be kind of hard.

239
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,520
 Again, I think it was 56 feet tall.

240
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,720
 But anyways, the 12,000 pounds of tuna did not kill him.

241
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,320
 He got cooked to death.

242
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,520
 This is the happy ending.

243
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,000
 His family ended up suing the company, Bumblebee, tuna company, and they made like millions

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 of dollars off of it.

245
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And I get it.

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,240
 You'd rather have your relative still alive.

247
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,720
 They made millions of dollars off it.

248
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,040
 The state got millions of dollars.

249
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,160
 They had to put in all these safety checks and everything like that.

250
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,840
 So a happy ending, not really, but you know, they did get held liable for it.

251
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,960
 So when you get cooked to death, it's horrible.

252
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
 This is horrible thing.

253
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,240
 I'm not going to go too much into detail about it, but you boil your stomach acid boils.

254
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,080
 I think that is horrible.

255
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,640
 I think the whole thing's horrible and it's pretty slow.

256
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,880
 That's the big problem with it.

257
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,120
 I mean, not like I'm pro, not like I'm pro the other things that being cooked to death,

258
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,520
 but apparently it takes a while, your stomach acid boils, and the last thing to really get

259
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 cooked is your brain.

260
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,120
 But yeah, so it's quite the journey.

261
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,280
 I mean, there's a lot of horrible ways to die.

262
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,680
 Being cooked underneath a bunch of tuna is probably not one of them.

263
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,320
 Like I said, dude, I'm sorry.

264
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,680
 These stories are kind of depressing, but let's move on to one that's a little less

265
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
 depressing, unless you find people being murdered with hammers.

266
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 I'm sorry, guys.

267
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,440
 But at least this one starts off with a fictional death.

268
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,400
 Now I was watching a bunch of movies recently, and I'll usually watch like, when I get in

269
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,880
 a movie binge, I'll watch like five or six in a day, because I'll watch like 10 minutes

270
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,240
 and go sucks, click, sucks, click.

271
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
 I just get rid of them.

272
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:44,840
 I started watching a movie called Turbines, and the tagline for the movie is "green, efficient,

273
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
 deadly."

274
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,640
 And it was kind of being billed as a thing where wind turbines are killing people.

275
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,240
 Now I imagined it like a sci-fi channel movie, like at night the wind turbines were like

276
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,480
 jumping off, chopping people up, or the government put some sort of beacon or something in the

277
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,760
 wind turbines that were making them kill people.

278
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
 That's how I imagined it.

279
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,040
 The truth of the matter is this, what the movie is about is a young family is brought

280
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,600
 out to basically the government says, "We will pay you to move out to middle of nowhere

281
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,320
 and help maintain this wind turbine farm."

282
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 And they do.

283
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,680
 And then we start to see the effects of the wind turbines on these people living here,

284
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,680
 i.e. they become hammer-wielding murderers.

285
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,840
 And it's weird, so you're watching the movie, and it's like you can see the guys getting

286
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,160
 a little tense.

287
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,200
 And then there's a five-year time jump, and a group of young teenagers, not teenagers,

288
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,240
 but like young college students, they're doing their grad work on wind turbine syndrome.

289
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,000
 We'll get into that in a second.

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800
 So they're the slaughter.

291
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,520
 They're like the standard cabin in the wood type thing.

292
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,240
 They show up to investigate these.

293
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,920
 The guy takes a hammer, starts bashing their heads, and this guy is like John Wick with

294
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
 a hammer.

295
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,480
 He'll take on like four or five people at a time.

296
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,920
 He's like taking on like two or three cops at a time with this hammer.

297
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,560
 He's murdering everyone.

298
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,880
 And then he murders his wife.

299
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,520
 I don't know if he murders his son.

300
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,080
 I don't really remember.

301
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,960
 I wasn't really paying attention to that point.

302
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,760
 And then I guess it turns out there was two hammer-wielding murderers.

303
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,160
 It's like, "What?"

304
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,880
 And then the movie ends.

305
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,760
 This is not a Dead or Ever recommends, by the way.

306
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
 The movie was beautifully shot.

307
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
 Like it definitely had its strengths.

308
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,880
 But when you watch the trailer, it says, "Based on a true story."

309
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,720
 They're like, "What?"

310
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,240
 So this is the quote-unquote true story.

311
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,280
 Apparently, there is a...

312
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,400
 I don't know how to put it.

313
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
 Some people say it's pseudoscience.

314
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,320
 Some people say it's a conspiracy theory.

315
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,080
 But windmills are actually...

316
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,640
 There's basically two levels of this.

317
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:48,200
 At first, people were saying that wind turbine windmills can cause cancer and can cause people

318
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,240
 to go and murderous rages and commit suicide and things like that.

319
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,720
 That's ridiculous.

320
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,040
 You're gonna get those things in any community whether or not there's a windmill.

321
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,440
 People were saying, "No, no, we think there's more of them around windmills."

322
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,840
 But it's interesting because they've walked that back now.

323
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,600
 What happened was a bunch of medical studies came out.

324
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
 25 medical studies.

325
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,000
 Peer-reviewed medical studies.

326
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,680
 You'll hear that phrase often looking into this.

327
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,760
 Saying that windmills cause nothing except green energy and wind.

328
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,480
 They don't cause the wind, but they do stuff with the wind.

329
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,280
 They don't do anything to your mental health.

330
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,320
 They don't cause cancer or anything like that.

331
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,120
 Then the anti-windmill people said, "Okay, okay, okay.

332
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,000
 Maybe that was ridiculous at first."

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,400
 But it does cause you to wake up.

334
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,200
 It causes insomnia, migraines, ear pressure, visual blurring.

335
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,920
 It's infrasound that's going into us.

336
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,480
 And at that point, the medical people go, "Listen, it may annoy certain people.

337
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,360
 Some people may be able to pick up on the noise and it may annoy them."

338
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,320
 So cities and governments started saying you can't have windmills.

339
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,920
 These wind turbine windmills too close to the houses.

340
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,200
 Because people can't hear the noise and there may be some sort of health effect

341
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,480
 as far as annoying people making them want to leave.

342
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,800
 So it's a weird conspiracy theory because the anti-windmill people

343
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,640
 reached really far from the stars in the beginning.

344
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,680
 And that was easy to be shut down.

345
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,160
 They're like, "No, it's causing no cancer vectors.

346
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,280
 People aren't running around with hammers bashing in people's heads."

347
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,960
 And then they kind of walked it back and said, "Yeah, it's just kind of annoying

348
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
 and it's hard to sleep."

349
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,080
 And the people go, "Well, that might be the case,

350
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,720
 but that's not enough to cause a disease."

351
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,760
 Wind turbine syndrome is something made up by the anti-windmill people.

352
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,000
 It's not a recognized disease.

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,480
 So I had never heard of that syndrome before.

354
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,000
 I never heard of that before.

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,160
 It's an odd, very, very geographically limited conspiracy theory.

356
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,720
 It's not like anti-vax or anything like that, which is like a global thing.

357
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,120
 This is limited.

358
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,080
 You would only care about this if you lived near a windmill.

359
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
 But that's not the point of this topic.

360
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,520
 The point of this topic is the movie itself.

361
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,160
 I'm going to go half Alex Jones right now.

362
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
 I'm going to go half Alex Jones.

363
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,920
 I'm not going to go full Alex Jones, but hear me out on this one.

364
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:20,720
 We have reached a stage in human development that is the perfect combination of access

365
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,640
 to filmmaking equipment and general human lunacy to the point where somebody can sit

366
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,960
 down and make a movie based on a conspiracy theory, set up a horror movie based on a conspiracy

367
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,840
 theory and present it as based on a true story.

368
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
 Now, I know what you're thinking.

369
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,160
 You go, "Jason, this isn't anything new."

370
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,040
 People make movies about aliens.

371
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,600
 People who believe in aliens make movies about aliens.

372
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,640
 But no, this is something new.

373
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,560
 Because yes, people who believe in things like ghosts make movies about ghosts, and then

374
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,460
 people who watch those movies may tend to believe that ghosts are real.

375
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,280
 People who believe in aliens make movies like communion, close encounters with the third

376
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,120
 kind, E.T.

377
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,680
 People who watch those movies go, "Maybe aliens do exist.

378
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,640
 Maybe aliens are visiting us."

379
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,280
 This is different.

380
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,880
 This is the... those aren't weapons.

381
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,720
 Those are saying, "These are beliefs that I have, and I'm making a movie."

382
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,240
 When you go to see a Christian movie like Fireproof or God's Not Dead, that movie is

383
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,760
 made for people who already believe in these things, who already have a general working

384
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,960
 knowledge of Christianity, or aliens, or Bigfoot, or what have you.

385
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,040
 Things like Turbine are a stealth weapon, because it's not marketed towards people who

386
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,480
 believe in wind turbine syndrome.

387
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,040
 That doesn't come up until halfway through the movie.

388
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,240
 It's not in the plot synopsis.

389
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,880
 Nowhere in the marketing for the movie that I saw would you think this movie is for people

390
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,600
 who already believe in this stuff.

391
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,800
 Obviously, if you're watching God's Not Dead, you watch the trailer for that, you go, "Oh,

392
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,040
 this is a Christian film.

393
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
 It's made to appeal to Christians."

394
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,320
 Now, obviously, someone who's not a Christian could watch that, and they could debate it,

395
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,760
 or they could go, "Oh, I believe in Jesus now."

396
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,960
 But the movie itself is not the weapon.

397
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
 We are getting to that level.

398
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
 Think about it this way.

399
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
 Think about it this way.

400
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,760
 If you went back 10 years, before the whole anti-vax thing really, really took off, and

401
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,520
 you had a series of horror movies, or series of sci-fi movies, you'd probably be better

402
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
 for that.

403
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,160
 Imagine a movie on the level of The Matrix.

404
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,200
 As far as popularity goes, but one of the key things in it is the government controls

405
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,280
 you by putting a vaccine in your system.

406
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,480
 They show Neo go, "Tch, and he's like fighting, fighting the vaccine."

407
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,480
 All this stuff about red pills and blue pills and being woke all come from terminology from

408
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
 The Matrix.

409
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,480
 And you could argue some of it farther back, but from that, that's really what popularized

410
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
 it.

411
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,600
 Instead of taking the red pill or the blue pill, Morpheus goes, "Well, now we gotta

412
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,000
 suck out that measles, mumps, and rebu- uh, whatever."

413
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,320
 MMR vaccine from your arm, Neo, that's how the government controls you.

414
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,600
 You would have, I honestly believe you would have more people who are anti-vax.

415
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,320
 The makers of these movies who have an agenda to push forward are constantly fighting for

416
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 your mind.

417
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,080
 Most, I would say 99% of movies really don't have an agenda at all.

418
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,160
 You could go, "Oh, predictive programming, Illuminati's putting eyeballs in everything,

419
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,600
 and Michael Bay has an American flag in every movie."

420
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,360
 I don't, Michael Bay does not have an American flag in every movie, but I dismiss the whole

421
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,680
 predictive programming thing like that.

422
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,320
 I think most movies are there to make money.

423
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,880
 They are there to continue the corporation going on, continuing the consuming of their

424
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
 products.

425
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,440
 That's their main goal.

426
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,600
 They may in a movie throw, and hey, you know, we wanna have, show how badass women are,

427
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,080
 so we're gonna have a female, a lead female character who's stronger than the male characters.

428
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,400
 They could definitely do that.

429
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,720
 Or you could have, we wanna make money so we can make "God's Not Dead 4," but we

430
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,000
 still wanna make this movie, it's gonna have this message, but we still also have to make

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 money doing it.

432
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,720
 So, you can have movies with messages, but I think most movies don't have a message outside

433
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,920
 of maybe the theme of the movie or something like that.

434
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,440
 But we have reached a level now, where, 'cause this movie, "Turbine," it wasn't a bad movie.

435
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
 I'm not knocking it all.

436
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,560
 The acting was good, the cinematography looked great, super low budget film, looked beautiful.

437
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:41,760
 It wasn't the best horror movie I've seen, but there was skill in front of and behind

438
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
 the camera.

439
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:49,280
 And we're reaching a level where now anyone can get this technology and put their conspiracy

440
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
 theory out there.

441
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,760
 If anything, if really if anything the last year of doing this show has really taught

442
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,040
 me, it only takes about 10,000 people to get a conspiracy theory off the ground.

443
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 It really does.

444
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,160
 It's not a lot of groundwork to do.

445
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,640
 Imagine yesterday I talked about my conspiracy theory involving plastic bottles and bottle

446
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,920
 caps and how recycling is a scam.

447
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 Imagine if I had $5 million in the team of people to make a movie about that.

448
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,160
 And let's say the movie actually was good.

449
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,000
 I could rack up 10,000 people to believe that in a year, a year or two, if I really wanted

450
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,040
 to push that conspiracy theory.

451
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,880
 I guess it never really occurred to me before how easy it is to get your conspiracy theory

452
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,640
 out there in a stealthy way.

453
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,360
 If somebody put online, "When mill turbines cause cancer or cause people to kill each other

454
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,960
 hammers," most people are going to dismiss them.

455
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,040
 The idiots will be like, "Oh, really?

456
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,080
 Yeah, my cousin got killed by a hammer and there was a fan going on in the background."

457
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,680
 So that might be that.

458
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,240
 But when you can wrap it in a piece of entertainment like that and put it out there and people

459
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,640
 watch it and then halfway through the movie they mention the term "When mill turbine syndrome"

460
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
 and you're like, "What?"

461
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,200
 And then maybe you catch the trailer and this is based on a true story and you start researching

462
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 it for yourself.

463
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,280
 It's so much more valid to the human mind that way.

464
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,920
 I don't know why it is, but it is.

465
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
 That happened to me with the Mithras conspiracy.

466
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,440
 The movie is called The Conspiracy.

467
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,840
 Highly recommended.

468
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
 It's a fake documentary, a mockumentary.

469
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,920
 I don't want to call it mockumentary because it's not, that sounds funny, but it's a documentary

470
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,840
 about a conspiracy involving the secret society.

471
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,480
 Now it has enough truth in it that when I went to research it I found all the stuff about

472
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,200
 this thing called the Mithras society and I was completely enthralled.

473
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
 Stuff that I would have completely dismissed out of hand if I hadn't seen that documentary

474
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
 first.

475
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
 It was a documentary, it was fake.

476
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,680
 Knowing what it was about, it still made me more interested in conspiracy theory that

477
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,240
 I would have completely just not been into.

478
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,960
 This is the weaponization of entertainment and conspiracy theory combined into one.

479
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,120
 Now mainstream media has been doing this for a long time.

480
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,120
 They want to get an idea out there, they wrap it in entertainment and I'm not dismissing

481
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
 that.

482
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
 They actually do that.

483
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,600
 They want to push a message, they can make it entertaining.

484
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,960
 But now anyone can do that and it's dangerous.

485
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,320
 It's dangerous to everyone involved.

486
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,440
 I believe we're on the verge, not of a civil war where the nation splits in half and we

487
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
 go to war, but a civil war of the mind.

488
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,560
 We are becoming so fractured as a global society where people are believing their own conspiracy

489
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,000
 theories now and I don't see a way back from this.

490
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,200
 I think it's going to get worse.

491
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,800
 I think we're going to get to a point where most movies have hidden conspiratorial messages

492
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,360
 but they're not the big Illuminati messages that people like to pretend as all seeing

493
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,440
 group is pushing on the media.

494
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,560
 It's going to be the bizarre beliefs of different directors and different writers put in these

495
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,000
 movies to the point that other people working on the movie may not even know that they're

496
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 there.

497
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,880
 We've moved past conspiracy theory.

498
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,560
 The world is now in a phase of conspiracy belief.

499
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:20,200
 The world is now not a global society but 7 billion people all with their own set of

500
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,040
 facts and it's absolutely frightening.

501
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,600
 But the hardest thing to admit is that I would do the same thing because if I had the money

502
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,080
 to make a movie, I'm doing it with this podcast.

503
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,160
 How many times have I put out conspiracy theories that I'll say I don't have anything, I don't

504
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,600
 have any proof to back this up but this is what I believe and I'm spitting that out to

505
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,840
 1,800 to 2,000 people a day.

506
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,240
 It doesn't take many people to start to upset the public discourse.

507
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,440
 10,000 people tops and you can start a thought revolution.

508
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,000
 There weren't many Flat Earthers 8 years ago.

509
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,160
 It was a minority of people and now you got hundreds of thousands of Flat Earthers within

510
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,560
 8 years.

511
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,160
 What bizarre conspiracy theories are floating around out there that are just on the cusp

512
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,480
 of breaking into the mainstream?

513
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:24,400
 Are we one blockbuster movie away from more people questioning whether monkeys exist or

514
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,040
 that mountains are actually dead trees?

515
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
 Who knows?

516
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,640
 But I think we're going to find out very, very soon.

517
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,440
