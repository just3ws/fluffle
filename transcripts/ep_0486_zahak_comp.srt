1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 A series of mysterious explosions rocks Iran.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,200
 Is it an external enemy?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,760
 Or a new foe within the borders of the country?

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,220
 And then we stay in the Middle East to take a look at an old Mesopotamian legend.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,720
 Was there really a demon king that once ruled the land for 1000 years, today on Dead Rabbit

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
 Radio?

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:34,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,900
 I'm sweltering.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,900
 But I'm still here.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,200
 I haven't melted completely.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,880
 I'm still here to do your show.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,240
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, UraniumRabbit.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
 UraniumRabbit.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,800
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
 That is super awesome.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,760
 You're going to be our captain or guide this episode.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,040
 You can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,560
 Just help get the word out about the show.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
 That really, really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 We also have the Minecraft server and the merch store.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,240
 You can purchase stuff from there as well to support the show.

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,920
 And UraniumRabbit actually wrote a book called Project Rabbit Hole.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,760
 One of the things he talked about was, I haven't read the book yet, but he's going to send

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
 me a copy of it.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,320
 One of the things that he was mentioning was talking about the ideas of Keck, the ideas

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,600
 of Corona Chan, of us memeing these gods into existence.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,960
 So I thought it would be an interesting episode to have him on because we're going to be

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,120
 looking at a god-made incarnate here on Earth.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,440
 But first, before we get to there, Uranium, let's go ahead, actually that kind of matches

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,840
 that, that that's your name.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,520
 Let's go ahead and fire up the dead rabbit dreadnought, our massive warship.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,320
 We're leaving behind America and we're headed off to Iran.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,320
 We're playing those big drums.

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
 Not that fast.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
 The people rowing the boat.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,040
 The dead rabbit dreadnought is like one of those huge boats from Age of Empires.

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,440
 I know there's a real name for them.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 Tremere.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,560
 So the dead rabbit dreadnought is getting closer to Iran.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
 It's June 25th, 2020.

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,880
 Everyone's just kind of hanging out doing their own thing.

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 And then, people in Tehran, like what in the world was that?

46
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,760
 They're running in the window and they just see smoke plume off in the distance.

47
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,520
 And they're like, "Oh, great.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
 This is not good.

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,880
 Never is an explosion a good thing.

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,000
 There's never a time where you see an explosion in your neighborhood and you're like, "We

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
 did it guys.

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
 Something blew up."

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,160
 I guess unless you're a demolition expert, these people aren't demolition experts.

54
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,400
 They're the citizens of the city of Tehran.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,920
 They see a giant explosion off in the distance.

56
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,040
 Of course, the media has to cover it.

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
 And they go, "Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,520
 Something blew up in Parchin.

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
 Everything's normal.

60
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
 People in Tehran are like, "What?"

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,360
 No, I don't think everything's normal."

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,240
 And that wasn't the direction of Parchin.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
 I saw it over there.

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,720
 So the media was like, "Oh, oh, oh, the reporter's just making that noise."

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 Breaking news.

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
 It wasn't in Parchin.

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
 You're right.

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
 We have listening devices in your house.

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,800
 We heard everyone go, "Huh?"

70
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,320
 We heard a collective scratching ahead.

71
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
 It wasn't in Parchin.

72
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
 You're right.

73
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
 It was in Kojir.

74
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 Kojir.

75
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
 But it was just a gas leak.

76
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,200
 It was a gas leak at a missile site.

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
 What'd you say, reporter?

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 Why'd you move away from the mic?

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
 No, no, no.

80
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,680
 It was just a gas leak at a missile silo.

81
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
 We know what you're saying.

82
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,200
 You're saying missile silo, right?

83
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,400
 There was a gas leak at a missile silo.

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
 Reporter's like, "Yes.

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
 Yes, there was."

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,920
 That's kind of the end of it, right?

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
 I mean, that's not a good thing.

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,480
 Gas leak at a missile silo.

89
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,200
 Five days later, June 30th.

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,920
 It's not a jet.

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,080
 It might be, actually, but that's the sound of a fire burning out of control at a medical

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,600
 center in Tehran, which is the capital of Iran, if you didn't know.

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,120
 Fire burning in a medical center.

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,600
 18 people died.

95
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
 Media's covering it.

96
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,280
 Reporter goes, "Okay, that definitely was a gas leak."

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
 People are like, "Hmm.

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,840
 Two gas leaks in five days.

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,120
 Like two major gas leaks in five days."

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,360
 There's like, "That was, that one was a gas leak."

101
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,040
 And by saying that, you may be thinking I'm implying the first one was a gas leak, but

102
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,600
 that was a gas leak, too, the missile silo and now the hospital.

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,320
 July 2nd, 2020.

104
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 Fire.

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,800
 You got the fire noise.

106
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,480
 Massive explosion.

107
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,480
 So this is the third massive explosion in about eight days.

108
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,840
 This one, though, was at the Natanz enrichment facility, which is where Iran is currently

109
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 trying to enrich.

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
 Well, allegedly, right?

111
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,480
 Like that's always the big debate.

112
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,600
 I think at this point Iran has admitted, "Yeah, yeah, we're enriching it."

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
 But I can't be for sure on that because it's always going back and forth, but Western powers

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,560
 are going like, "You're trying to make nuclear bombs."

115
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
 And Iran's like, "No, no, no.

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,840
 We're just trying to make nuclear power."

117
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,560
 But again, everyone has an agenda of what the story is.

118
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,800
 I'm not 100% for sure, but the fact that it's written in my notes as an enrichment facility,

119
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,840
 I'm pretty sure that Iran's just like, "Yeah, let's not even pretend anymore.

120
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,560
 We're going to make a nuclear bomb."

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
 But I could be wrong on that.

122
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,800
 Don't nuke me with your non-existent bombs, Iran.

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,280
 In two months, though, you might be able to.

124
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,600
 I ran this enrichment facility.

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,080
 This is the same facility that was hit by Stuxnet, the Stuxnet virus, which I would cover, but

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,000
 it's such a well-known story, but I was so fascinated by the Stuxnet virus.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,920
 You guys might not remember that, but a while back, it was probably like 10 years at this

128
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,840
 point, the virus got into this Natan's enrichment facility, and what it did, you couldn't even

129
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,120
 tell it was there, was basically shutting off their...

130
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,160
 What are those things called?

131
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,080
 Not helicopters, which helicopters flying around the enrichment facility.

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,880
 They're like, "Get out of here."

133
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,760
 The cylinders that spin really quickly, whatever those things are, it was basically shutting

134
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,360
 them down and causing them to overheat and things like that.

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,920
 And then Stuxnet virus got out of the facility and started hitting other, like, our power

136
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
 plants and stuff like that.

137
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,960
 It was a very fascinating story.

138
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,080
 But anyways, this is that same facility, so it's a building.

139
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,160
 Apparently, it's like a one-story building, but underneath it's this massive underground

140
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 thing.

141
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 We don't know.

142
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,160
 That's what Western spies are telling us, that underneath it's this massive enrichment

143
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
 facility.

144
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,600
 So you have three major explosions within eight days.

145
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,000
 And people go, "Okay, so why did this enrichment facility blow up?"

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,880
 The Iranian government goes, "That didn't blow up.

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
 It just caught on fire."

148
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,680
 What about that explosion we heard?

149
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,000
 Well, I don't have an answer for that, so you didn't hear it explosion.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,640
 I guess I didn't.

151
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,600
 The roof is like completely like blowing out.

152
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,120
 Like, the photograph of it, something...

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,600
 Maybe it wasn't an explosion, but something force and flame peeled back the roof in a high

154
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,000
 velocity expansion of gas.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,960
 So that's the scientific definition of an explosion, then it was an explosion.

156
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,840
 But otherwise, maybe the rain.

157
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,240
 Within hours, obviously.

158
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,600
 Like the first one, they were saying it was a gas leak.

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,080
 The hospital seems to be a bit of an outlier.

160
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,800
 People have gone, "We can understand why the missile silo would come under attack."

161
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,320
 The medical facility is a little weird.

162
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,480
 We can definitely understand why the enrichment facility would come under attack.

163
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,160
 But I guess a couple weeks ago, I ran and introduced the computer virus into the water

164
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,880
 system of Israel to make it back up so then eventually there'd be a massive...

165
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,040
 I find this also fascinating, the ability to wage war on this level.

166
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,120
 Allegedly, I ran and released the virus into Israel's water control system, which would

167
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,000
 cause a backup of chlorine.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
 So then, if they didn't notice it in time, the water would basically be poisoned.

169
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,880
 That's co-op commander level stuff, right?

170
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,720
 That's insane.

171
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
 Like having the...

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
 Dang, what are those things?

173
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
 Centrifuges, centrifuges.

174
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,200
 Now, slowing down the centrifuges, that's kind of sneaky.

175
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,960
 That's like snidely whiplash level.

176
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,080
 Basically turning all the water supply in point.

177
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,960
 That's something that co-op commander would do.

178
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
 But it didn't work.

179
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,920
 They figured out what was going on.

180
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,160
 So I ran basically, it has to address.

181
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,360
 Obviously no one's buying the gas leak store anymore.

182
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
 I ran and says, "Israel did it.

183
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,000
 Israel attacked us."

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,360
 So I can just imagine a bunch of Iranian agents had an Israeli airport and they're

185
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,120
 like, "So we believe, Israel, that you flew stealth bombers over our territory and attacked

186
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
 those facilities."

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
 And Israel's like, "No, he didn't.

188
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,400
 They're standing next to a stealth fighter."

189
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,120
 And I ran and was like, "Okay, put your hand on the engine of that airplane."

190
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,360
 You see that airplane you're standing next to?

191
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
 Go ahead and touch the engine.

192
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
 "What?

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
 Why do you want me to do that?"

194
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
 "No, no, no, it's fine.

195
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
 Because you haven't flown it, right?

196
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,440
 You weren't flying it the other night and trying to blow up our enrichment facility,

197
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
 right?

198
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
 Isn't that what you just said?"

199
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 "Yeah, yeah, that's what I said."

200
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,000
 "Okay, well put your hand on the afterburner portion of that engine and if you haven't

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 flown it, right?

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,640
 You'll be totally fine.

203
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,200
 But if you flew it recently, I'm pretty sure your hand is going to go straight raiders

204
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 with a lost arc flesh dripping off."

205
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,280
 "Uh, well, I would, but I just bought these gloves and I don't want to get stealth paint

206
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
 on them."

207
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,160
 "You weren't wearing gloves a second ago."

208
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
 "Yeah, I put them on."

209
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
 "They were stealth gloves.

210
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
 You couldn't see them."

211
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,760
 "So Iran is basically accusing Israel.

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
 Israel's denying it.

213
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,520
 That's nothing new, right?

214
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,120
 What makes this story interesting isn't just this mysterious chain of explosions.

215
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,400
 And again, they don't know if the medical facility is part of this.

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,200
 Because that doesn't fit to like trying to slow down the nuclear program.

217
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,320
 It's not a web, just a fire that broke out.

218
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,120
 No one's been able to, even what I saw, what I read, Iran wasn't accusing Israel of doing

219
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
 that.

220
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,280
 It might have been a simple gas leak.

221
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,720
 Nobody knows at this point.

222
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,960
 But again, we had, like I said, the Stuxnet virus thing before, even before that.

223
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,040
 I remember reading this in the newspaper and I was like, I was thinking, is the world really

224
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
 just mission impossible seven?

225
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,760
 Back in 2010, this guy, this nuclear scientist was getting driven to work.

226
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,320
 He's this high level nuclear scientist.

227
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:22,680
 And a guy on a motorbike drives up alongside the car, attaches a magnet bomb to it, takes

228
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,400
 off and you can imagine that dude.

229
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,560
 Because obviously, they didn't leave you a birthday cake, right?

230
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,880
 If someone comes by on a motorbike or someone comes by on a unicycle and slaps the side of

231
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,360
 your car, dude, your number's up and sure enough, the car just blew up and the dude disappeared.

232
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,600
 They got in the motorcycle, got out.

233
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
 He was gone.

234
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,160
 I know eventually they did end up rounding up a couple people.

235
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,240
 They were suspected were spies.

236
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,360
 They thought Israel had something to do with that.

237
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,720
 What's interesting is, I think there were three scientists killed that year.

238
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,080
 One of them walked out to his car.

239
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
 He didn't have a driver.

240
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,560
 He was walking out of his car and there was a motorbike sitting next to his car just parked

241
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
 in the next spot.

242
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 It blew up, killed him in front of his house.

243
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,320
 Basically don't trust motorbikes and Iran.

244
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,440
 And of course, Iran was saying Israel had to do with it.

245
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,280
 They're taking out their ski scientists.

246
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,720
 Here's a little conspiratorial note for you.

247
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,080
 The one scientist who the motorbike was parked outside of his house, high-level nuclear scientist,

248
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,120
 but he wasn't working with the nuclear program.

249
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,480
 He was working with quantum physics.

250
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
 So that's kind of a weird, interesting thing.

251
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
 Like what, again, conspiracy cap fully on the head.

252
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,400
 What if Iran is working on nuclear weapons but also working on some sort of quantum,

253
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,320
 I don't know, quantum bomb, quantum reality thing?

254
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,480
 Because he wasn't working with that program.

255
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,560
 He could have just been a name on a list.

256
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,400
 They could have figured he was working on something even more dangerous than a nuclear

257
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
 bomb.

258
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
 Who knows?

259
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
 But you have this tit for tat.

260
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
 We don't see that much over here.

261
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
 At least we don't hear about it, right?

262
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,920
 For all we know, American scientists, Israeli scientists could be getting taken out and

263
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
 it's just covered up.

264
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 We don't know.

265
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
 Look at Marconi Labs.

266
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,680
 We covered them a while back.

267
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,600
 But Sabine's worried that Marconi's going to send Hitman after me.

268
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 She was like, "I'm a little nervous after you did that episode about Marconi Labs."

269
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,680
 And I was like, "Eh, don't worry about it."

270
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
 So we have this tit for tat going on.

271
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
 Here's the thing though.

272
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,520
 This attack is not, Israel's denying it, which they always will.

273
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,600
 Same thing when something goes wrong in Israel and they say it's Hezbollah and Hezbollah

274
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,920
 is being funded by Iran.

275
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,280
 Iran's like, "Ah, no, it was just a bad day."

276
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,760
 That's why all that stuff blew up.

277
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,480
 It was super windy.

278
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,120
 So this has been going on for years and years and years.

279
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
 What makes this different?

280
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,480
 What makes this fascinating is that there's a group claiming to make these attacks.

281
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,080
 And depending on the translation, they are either cheetahs of the homeland or the homeland

282
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,840
 panthers.

283
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,680
 Homeland panthers or cheetahs of the homeland.

284
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
 We're just going to call them the panthers.

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
 They have claimed responsibility for this.

286
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:09,160
 They apparently they are a group of ex or even current Iranian military officers who

287
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,440
 want to overthrow the government and they're causing these attacks.

288
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,600
 They've sent out communiques, press releases, however you want to call them.

289
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,880
 They claim responsibility for these attacks.

290
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,560
 And so you could go, "Ah, maybe it's just some group doing it."

291
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,400
 They claimed responsibility for the Natanz attack before it was even reported in the

292
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,560
 media.

293
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
 So it wasn't like some bunch of pranksters.

294
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,600
 No, it was an actual group that obviously had knowledge of it.

295
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,120
 Now, could obviously be a CIA group.

296
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
 It could be an Israeli group that's claiming credit for it or they're backed by Israel

297
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
 or CIA.

298
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
 Who knows?

299
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,160
 But they are saying they are fed up with the current Iranian regime.

300
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,640
 They want to overthrow them.

301
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,840
 So we'll see how all of this evolves.

302
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,680
 It's very possible that, because I'm recording this episode so far in advance by the time

303
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,200
 it airs.

304
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,920
 We do have more information, but as of now, this is where we're sitting at, three explosions

305
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
 within eight days.

306
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
 And again, they don't know one's...

307
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,160
 As far as I could see, no one was like, "Yeah, and we hate people in medical facilities.

308
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 Boo!

309
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
 Sick people!"

310
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
 So we blew that up too.

311
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,160
 I think that was just a horrible accident because nobody's taking credit for that.

312
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,040
 And I didn't even see the Iranian government blame Israel for that.

313
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,320
 I think it was just a horrible accident.

314
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
 That was the only one that actually had fatalities too.

315
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,800
 So Iranian Rabbits, we're not done here because like I said, he was writing in that book,

316
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,560
 Project Rabbit Hole, which again, I haven't read yet, but I'm going to check it out about

317
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:38,000
 how gods can be invoked and how basically through stories, through memes, we may be

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,080
 channeling something older.

319
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,720
 Let's go ahead and hop in the carpenter copter.

320
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:49,080
 We're going to leave behind modern day Tehran, flying us over the desert.

321
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,600
 And then this magical wave washes over us.

322
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,520
 And then we go from modern day Tehran to ancient Mesopotamia.

323
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,640
 We have a cloaking device on the helicopter.

324
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,080
 Now it looks like a chariot with 10 horses, 10 beautiful golden horses.

325
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
 What's that?

326
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,200
 They turn into chipmunks too.

327
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
 Nay!

328
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 Nay!

329
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
 Nay!

330
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 We're flying around.

331
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
 Super annoying.

332
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,480
 We don't normally have the chariot version of the carpenter copter.

333
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
 We're flying over ancient Mesopotamia.

334
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
 Uranium rabbit.

335
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,000
 Let's go ahead and land here in the plains of Mesopotamia.

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,680
 I forgot to tell you why we're here actually.

337
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,360
 So the reason why we're here as uranium is petting the horses, feeding them apples, the

338
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,640
 reason why we're here is that when the homeland panthers were writing this letter talking

339
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,440
 about how the government needs to be overthrown, they called the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali

340
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,760
 Khomeini a Zahak.

341
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,200
 And then it said a mythical creature, like a demonic creature is what it said in the

342
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
 article.

343
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 And I was like what?

344
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,000
 I forgot everything in this thing.

345
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,760
 I got explosions.

346
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,960
 I got international intrigue.

347
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,680
 And now I have a cryptid.

348
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,840
 I guess I know what I'm doing with the next 20 minutes of my day.

349
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,920
 I'm going to research this Zahak.

350
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
 Fascinating story.

351
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,280
 You done petting those horses?

352
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,600
 Everyone get a pet of those horses, feed them an apple.

353
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,520
 Let's go ahead and leave behind the carbonar copter guys.

354
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
 All of us.

355
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,120
 Let's hop on one of these golden horses.

356
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,560
 Let's ride them off into the plains here.

357
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
 The story of Zahak.

358
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,960
 There's actually a couple different versions of it.

359
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,840
 So I have to pick one to kind of stick with it.

360
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,320
 The one I'm picking is from welcome2iran.com.

361
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,000
 It's kind of like an official government website.

362
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,960
 But there's a couple different versions of the story.

363
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,480
 They deviate in one serious way.

364
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,840
 One of them has a story of someone who was destined, who was chosen to be the super

365
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:47,920
 powerful person and was raised to be this warrior drinking the milk from a blessed cow.

366
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,320
 The other one was about a ordinary person who has to figure out a way to defeat evil.

367
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,160
 And I want to go with that version of it.

368
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,560
 They're not saying one is more true or one is more well known.

369
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,080
 But the version I went is from the welcome2iran.com website.

370
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,520
 And I think it's more interesting because it's about what we can do.

371
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,120
 What we can do to fight evil.

372
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
 Very fascinating story.

373
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,960
 We're riding these golden horses over the plane.

374
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
 The sun setting.

375
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,240
 It's getting scary.

376
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
 It's getting dark.

377
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,120
 It's time to tell a ghost story or a monster story.

378
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,800
 Let's look at the story of Zahak.

379
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,660
 Zahak was a prince in Mesopotamia.

380
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,000
 His father was the king.

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Everything was going fine.

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,440
 He was just kind of inoffensive.

383
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,600
 He was just a guy.

384
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
 He was a little charming.

385
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,560
 He wasn't really making waves.

386
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,760
 Attractive.

387
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,080
 Has a following.

388
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,120
 But doesn't really get things done.

389
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,800
 And doesn't really have to because he's a prince.

390
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,840
 But there's a dark spirit nearby.

391
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,320
 Name Ariman.

392
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,200
 He's watching Zahak go just about life.

393
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:59,640
 And Ariman sees him and knows that this is the perfect person to carry out his plans.

394
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,000
 So he appears in the form of a wise counselor in front of Zahak.

395
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,480
 And begins to give him advice.

396
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
 Watch out.

397
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
 Is a chariot.

398
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,840
 Goes by street.

399
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
 Saved your life.

400
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
 And Zahak's like, "Ha ha ha.

401
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
 All right.

402
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,080
 Thank you, old man who I don't know.

403
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
 What?

404
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 I'm Ariman."

405
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
 And they're doing a high five.

406
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
 Don't eat that soup.

407
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
 It's too hot.

408
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,280
 Let me blow on it first.

409
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,120
 So, that's kind of gross.

410
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
 But you know, I'm kind of hungry.

411
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,160
 I will eat old man blowing on soup.

412
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,120
 Thank you, Ariman.

413
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,560
 But eventually Ariman puts his plan in motion.

414
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,000
 Zahak, you know, I've been giving you some good advice to save your life from that

415
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 horse.

416
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I blew on your soup.

417
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,640
 I'm sure I did other stuff as well.

418
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,520
 I think you would be a better king than your father.

419
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
 Yes.

420
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,240
 He says in his surfing leg voice.

421
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,560
 Zahak's like, "That's not suspicious at all.

422
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,280
 I think you would be a better king than your father."

423
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,960
 Zahak's like, "Yeah, I probably would be, but you know, he's still alive.

424
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,400
 And that kind of makes it difficult.

425
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,360
 We can change that, Zahak.

426
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
 We can change that."

427
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,800
 Now he convinces Zahak to kill his father.

428
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,240
 And there's a note in one of these stories that he starts banging his mom.

429
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,000
 But I only found that in one source.

430
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,480
 And I'm assuming that the other sources were like, "This guy already has a bad enough

431
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
 rap.

432
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
 We don't...

433
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,280
 I mean, the stuff he does is so awful.

434
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,600
 Let's just leave that part out of the story."

435
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,240
 But anyways, in one of the sources he's banging his mom.

436
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,080
 And then in the other versions, never mention.

437
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,240
 So Ariman disappears and then returns in a new form.

438
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,920
 The form of a chef was Zahak.

439
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,400
 I'm here to grant you food.

440
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,080
 I don't know why it's a musical all of a sudden.

441
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,800
 All the cups are dancing.

442
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
 He says, "Dude, you won't believe it.

443
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
 I'm your best chef ever.

444
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,040
 Remember that old man blowing on soup?

445
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,440
 I was the one who made that soup."

446
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,800
 Zahak's like, "That was really good.

447
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,880
 Is there an old man around to blow on it?"

448
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
 We do it back in the kitchen.

449
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,080
 But you want to taste something really good.

450
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,960
 Here try this.

451
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,280
 And it was meat.

452
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,960
 So Mesopotamia, I don't know if it was for the whole culture, but it definitely in this

453
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,320
 dude's family.

454
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,040
 They're all vegetarians.

455
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,520
 He never eaten meat in his life, ever.

456
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,680
 So when he gets this delicious, what do you call it, steak put in front of him, he's like,

457
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,040
 "I'm going to try that.

458
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,280
 It looks like food.

459
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,320
 It smells like food."

460
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,240
 So he takes a bite of steak and it's heavenly or devilish.

461
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,000
 Pour a little foreshadow in there.

462
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,080
 It's the best food he's ever had.

463
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,560
 He's like, "Give those lentils out of me.

464
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,840
 Burn all the hay.

465
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,160
 No more wheat.

466
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
 No more wheat.

467
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
 It's all meat for me, baby."

468
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,160
 And he tells the cook.

469
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,320
 He goes, "Listen, this is delicious.

470
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
 Can you make me more of this?"

471
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,960
 The cook's like, "Yeah.

472
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,720
 If there's an animal born, I can turn it into food."

473
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 So he's eating ostrich.

474
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,160
 He's eating rhino.

475
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,080
 He's eating every possible meat he can.

476
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,320
 He eventually tells the cook.

477
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,560
 He goes, "Listen, you've changed my life.

478
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
 You've changed my life.

479
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
 I will give you whatever you want."

480
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,960
 And the cook goes, "All I want to do is kiss both of your shoulders."

481
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,080
 At that point, the hawk's probably like, "Oh, God.

482
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,560
 This Freddy who's going to save is going to kiss something else."

483
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,040
 "Yeah, you can kiss my shoulders."

484
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,840
 So he takes off his cloak and he's standing there all bare chest and the old cook walks

485
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,040
 up to him and goes, "Mwah."

486
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
 Kisses one shoulder.

487
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
 "Mwah."

488
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,680
 Kisses the other shoulder.

489
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,920
 And he's like, "Okay, I'm going to go back to the kitchen."

490
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,400
 He walks back in the kitchen and then fades away.

491
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
 If any cooks were back there, they're like, "Mwah?

492
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,040
 I'm going to get paid now.

493
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,800
 He was supposed to sign my paycheck and the guy's disappearing.

494
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,360
 Oh, no."

495
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
 So the hawk goes to bed.

496
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,120
 I know this story's taking a long time, but I find this so fascinating that this episode

497
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
 might run long.

498
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,720
 The hawk goes to bed and he's like, "Oh, my shoulders.

499
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,360
 Remember that old man kissed me?

500
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
 They don't feel good."

501
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,360
 And he wakes up and he looks and he sees a little nub popping out of one shoulder.

502
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
 "Mwah.

503
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,800
 I'm going to look slowly over to my other shoulder and see what's there.

504
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 Oh, no.

505
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,040
 It's a nub too."

506
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,560
 And then two snakes grow out of his shoulders, but they stop.

507
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,240
 It's not like they just pop out and slither away.

508
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,840
 On both shoulders, he has these snakes, two snakes, right?

509
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,480
 They're constantly like snapping at him.

510
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
 He's like, "Ah, ah."

511
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,360
 He's like getting a stick and he's fighting these two snakes off.

512
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,600
 That's a losing battle, right?

513
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,280
 Officially, you do have to like go to the bathroom or go to sleep or, you know, just

514
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,560
 your arms get tired.

515
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,640
 He's fighting these snakes off.

516
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,240
 Ari-mon reappears, but this time he's not a council.

517
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
 He's not a cookie.

518
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,320
 He's a doctor.

519
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,680
 So he's like, "I'm here.

520
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
 You called?"

521
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
 And Zach's like, "No, I didn't.

522
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
 What is it called?

523
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
 What's calling?"

524
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,680
 And his Ari-mon's like, "Oh, phones will be invented someday, but I see you have come

525
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,480
 down with a bad case of snake on the shoulders."

526
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,280
 He's like, "Yeah, what am I going to do?

527
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
 My arms getting so tired.

528
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,880
 I'm trying to beat these guys."

529
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,800
 And the doctor goes, "Hmm, let me see.

530
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,240
 Let me reach into my bag of medical implements."

531
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,800
 And he pulls out a blade.

532
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,880
 It's his only implement.

533
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,240
 Everything he just stabs it until it's better.

534
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
 Slice!

535
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,760
 One of the snakes come off.

536
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
 Slice!

537
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
 The other snake comes off.

538
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
 They fall to the ground dead.

539
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,000
 And so Hawke's like, "Oh, that feels so much weight."

540
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
 No, it doesn't.

541
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
 And the snakes grow back.

542
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,680
 So these snakes are stuck to his shoulder.

543
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,840
 And he goes, "Zahak, you got to do something about this."

544
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,600
 Zahak goes, "Listen, I got the perfect cure.

545
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 You eat me, right?"

546
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,280
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, I love me.

547
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
 It's delicious."

548
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,040
 He's like, "Here's what you got to do.

549
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,720
 Every day to keep the snakes from killing you, because that's eventually what they're

550
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,680
 going to do, you have to eat a bowl of stew."

551
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,960
 Zahak's like, "Yeah, I can do that.

552
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
 That's, you know, pretty good."

553
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,240
 He goes, "No, it has to be brain stew."

554
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,640
 He's like, "Ugh, that's a little grosser, but obviously if my choice is between eating

555
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,200
 brain stew, which I'm pretty sure is a Green Day album, or getting killed by shoulder snakes,

556
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
 I'm going to eat brain stew."

557
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
 And the doctor goes, "But you didn't let me finish."

558
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
 I should have finished.

559
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,960
 I should have just said it in one complete sentence, but every day you have to eat a

560
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,200
 bowl of stew made out of human brains.

561
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,680
 You have to have two human brains a day.

562
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,160
 Otherwise, those snakes are going to kill you and eat your brain.

563
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,680
 And at this point, Zahak goes, "Gulp."

564
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,160
 And anyways, gulp, he eventually does.

565
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,960
 He sets up this thing where every day he'd send out messengers all across Mesopotamia

566
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,200
 because now he rules the land, right?

567
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
 He took over from his father.

568
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,560
 He'd send out messengers and every day someone would have to send them one of their kids

569
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
 and then he eats their brains.

570
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,840
 Now you generally, the easiest way to do this is a lot harder.

571
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,120
 Let's say you live on the edge of Mesopotamia and some guys come out and they're like, "Hey,

572
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
 it's your kid today."

573
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
 And you're like, "Oh man."

574
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,680
 Then that your kid has to like walk all the way over there the whole time.

575
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,560
 He's like, "Oh, I don't want to give up my brains."

576
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,200
 I just started using them.

577
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,360
 And then it's like a 40-day journey to the middle of Mesopotamia.

578
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,000
 And then you're like, "Oh, super tired.

579
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,720
 Your brain is less juicy because you've been walking all the time."

580
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,760
 What the king would do, what Zahak would do, would actually be like, "You kill your kid.

581
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,040
 You take out the kid's brain."

582
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,880
 This episode is too gross.

583
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
 That's a good grim term, right?

584
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,840
 Uranium is just petting the horse.

585
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,240
 He's like, "It'll all be over soon."

586
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,920
 I just want this story to end.

587
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
 I just want this story to end.

588
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,280
 Zahak says, "You need to kill your own kid and just send me the brains."

589
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
 That's easier, right?

590
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,240
 Then you could just have a barrel of brains waiting for you.

591
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,920
 They're like soaking in brine.

592
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,160
 A brain is a lot easier to take care of than having like cells full of humans.

593
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,360
 Just have a box of brains.

594
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,160
 You could put 30 brains in a space where you would need like a giant prison to hold 30

595
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
 people.

596
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
 So you're thinking, "Okay, great.

597
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,720
 So this guy's probably like 20 years old when this happens.

598
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,480
 He eats two brains a day, 365 days out of the year.

599
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,640
 It's about like seven, 750 brains.

600
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,960
 And he's probably in his 20s.

601
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,600
 He probably lived to be about 60.

602
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,040
 So this dude lived for a thousand years every day just eating brains.

603
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,200
 Entire generations would live and die.

604
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,480
 People would be like, "Uh, this is so awesome.

605
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
 I'm 80 years old.

606
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
 No one's ever eaten my brain."

607
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,320
 And they just knock at your door and you're like, "No, I'm on my deathbed."

608
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,920
 They're like, "That's even easier because you're not going to miss your brain."

609
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,920
 Entire generations and generate a thousand years, the United States has been around for

610
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,440
 like 250.

611
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,760
 That's four United States worth of brain eating.

612
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 What happened?

613
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,520
 I don't know why it took so long for anyone to realize this, but what happened is we're

614
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,080
 near the end of a thousand years.

615
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,280
 Oh, and also, I guess I should have mentioned this, during his rule the sky became pitch

616
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,680
 black because all the hope, all the joy, all the beauty is taken out of the land because

617
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
 he's just eating brains.

618
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,920
 He's got these two snakes snapping all the time.

619
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
 Eating that brains too.

620
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:45,160
 He fast forward about a thousand years and there's a blacksmith named Kava.

621
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,800
 He's sitting there with his wife and he's like, "Ugh, my life is quite terrible.

622
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,880
 The sky's pitch black.

623
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,360
 I was born into a world with a pitch black sky.

624
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,440
 I'm going to die in a world with a pitch black sky.

625
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,800
 This king is ruling the land.

626
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 I don't know what to do."

627
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,960
 And then messenger is like, "Hey, Kava, I hate to do this, but I got to deliver this

628
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,520
 message otherwise."

629
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,960
 You know, my brains will get eaten and Kava's like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it."

630
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,200
 He gets the message and it says, "Send us your child.

631
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,320
 We're going to eat her brains."

632
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,960
 It signs a hot and then Kava throws the letter in the ground.

633
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,280
 "Ugh," he rages because this is his last daughter.

634
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,880
 The hot has eaten his other 16 children.

635
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,160
 He had 17 kids overall and Zahok's like, "Can't get enough of those wonderful Kava

636
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
 brains.

637
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,040
 He'd eaten 16 of his kids, right?

638
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 His one daughter left."

639
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,360
 And he's like, "I can't do this, man.

640
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,520
 First off, my wife sure is having a hard time giving birth to 17 kids.

641
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,760
 Secondly, I can't let this dude get away with it.

642
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,720
 He's already eaten 16 of kids."

643
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,760
 So he goes to the roof of his house and he's looking up at the pitch black sky.

644
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,960
 He's looking up at the sky.

645
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
 You can see the moon.

646
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
 He goes, "There has to be a way out of this."

647
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,160
 I could have thought about this, you know, 16 kids ago, but tonight I've been pushed

648
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
 too far.

649
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,920
 And then he's looking out and he goes, "I got it."

650
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:15,200
 So he kills his daughter, little air quotes there, and sends the brains off to the king.

651
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,520
 What he really did was he took his daughter and says, "You go to the highest mountain

652
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
 and you hide there.

653
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,800
 And I'm going to send sheep brains off."

654
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,280
 You'll never know the difference.

655
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,240
 She's like, "Are you saying I'm the brains of a sheep?"

656
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,760
 He's like, "Listen, yes, basically you might find that insulting, but it's much better to

657
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,880
 be insulted than to have your brains eaten."

658
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,000
 He's like, "Yeah, fair enough."

659
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,640
 She goes to the highest mountain.

660
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,440
 The king, Zahak, gets the brains, grabs some human brains, mixes them together, eats his

661
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
 stew.

662
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,280
 He doesn't notice the difference.

663
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,240
 So Kava's story starts to get out.

664
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,920
 This blacksmith who actually hid his daughter starts to get out.

665
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,960
 The king could not tell the difference between a human brain and a sheep brain.

666
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,560
 So other people go, "Oh, this is a good idea.

667
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,720
 I could have came up with it 16 kids ago.

668
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,000
 I could have come up with it a thousand years ago, but send off some sheep brains."

669
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
 They'd send their kids up to the mountains.

670
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,360
 Now what I am at, this story doesn't get so widespread across all of Mesopotamia.

671
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,400
 In the story, I think what would happen is that he'd get one human brain, one sheep brain.

672
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,320
 So he probably wouldn't even know.

673
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,360
 The snakes on his shoulders were still docile.

674
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,840
 There may have been times where he was getting two sheep brains and the snakes still weren't

675
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,040
 realizing what was going on.

676
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,480
 But over time, they were taking the sheep brains and sending them off.

677
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,400
 It was a bad year to be a sheep.

678
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,200
 It was a good year to be a human.

679
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,040
 They were sending the humans up to the mountains.

680
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,000
 After a time, Kava would go up there and visit his daughter and he would see them and they

681
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 were learning how to hunt.

682
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,080
 They were learning how to survive up there, ride horses and stuff like that.

683
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,320
 And one time Kava goes up there and there's a couple hundred young adults now up there,

684
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 hardy people.

685
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,280
 A hidden army and Kava goes, "I'm going to teach you guys how to fight and we're going

686
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,680
 to kill this king.

687
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,440
 We're going to end this rule."

688
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,520
 And so every time he requested a brain, he got at least one sheep brain and another soldier

689
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,360
 would join this hidden army.

690
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,720
 And over time, you have hundreds of young men and women being trained in secret.

691
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,640
 Eventually, Kava has raised this army and leads it to the capital of Mesopotamia.

692
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,560
 And Zahak looks out the window and sees this army that's really sprung up out of nowhere.

693
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,560
 Start marching on his citadel and he fills him with fear.

694
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,440
 He knows that this is the end.

695
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,840
 Kava takes he out of this blacksmith apron that he wore that I think, I don't think it

696
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,160
 was just something he wore.

697
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,520
 I think blacksmiths had to wear otherwise he'd get horribly burned.

698
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,120
 He attaches it to a rod and uses it as their battle banner.

699
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,080
 He leads the forces into the fortress.

700
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
 They take the fortress.

701
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,160
 To be honest, I would assume the soldiers in the fortress didn't put up that much of

702
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
 a fight.

703
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,480
 When you have a trained army, actually an army that had existed for a thousand years

704
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
 with no enemy to fight.

705
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,240
 I don't know how well they would be trained, but if you had a trained army and you see

706
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,920
 a bunch of people marching, you would think they would be able to repel the invaders.

707
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,360
 But they probably knew people whose brains had gotten eaten.

708
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,760
 They probably lost soldiers whose brains had gotten eaten because there was no, like,

709
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,000
 you had to be of this ethnic group or this clan.

710
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 He was just seeing brains.

711
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 It didn't matter.

712
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,400
 Obviously, he was seeing sheep brains for a while.

713
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,560
 He didn't even know the difference.

714
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,160
 So who knows how much of a fight the soldiers put up, but they do take the fortress and

715
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,880
 it ends with, in truly theatrical fashion, having a showdown between Kava and Zahok, this

716
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,480
 thousand-year-old demon king with serpents on his shoulders.

717
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,920
 And Kava is wielding his weapon, is his blacksmith hammer.

718
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,280
 He begins chasing Zahok through the fortress.

719
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,840
 Zahok eventually falls and while his enemy is on the ground helpless, "No, no, no, I

720
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
 had to eat brains.

721
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
 The snakes made me do it.

722
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
 The snakes made me do it."

723
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,040
 Kava takes that blacksmith hammer and just smashes in his brain.

724
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,520
 Like, it's done, right?

725
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,240
 Straight up.

726
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,000
 And then he cuts the head off for good measure, right?

727
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,320
 And then the snakes turn to dust and disappear.

728
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,800
 Kava then goes to the high mountain behind the fortress and lights a massive bonfire

729
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,520
 to let Mesopotamia, all of the nation, know that Zahok is dead.

730
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,640
 On all the other mountains, they see that bonfire at the fortress and the other mountains

731
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,680
 start lighting their bonfires.

732
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,400
 And then farther off, people start lighting bonfires and all of that bonfire light pushed

733
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 away the darkness.

734
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,280
 And for the first time in a thousand years, light shone down on Mesopotamia.

735
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,680
 To this day, on March 21st, this is the oldest religious practice that is still practiced

736
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
 today.

737
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,120
 On March 21st, in Afghanistan, Iran, the Kurdish territory will do this.

738
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,560
 They jump through the flames.

739
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,080
 It's the day of the spring equinox.

740
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,800
 They'll light these bonfires and they'll jump through the fire.

741
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,360
 I think they're, I think bonfires might, they may not be these huge raging fires, but to

742
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,840
 this day, it's the oldest religious practice that is still practiced to this day.

743
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:13,280
 It's to mark the fall of the demon king Zahok and the freedom of the people.

744
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,960
 The apron, which was used as the banner, is actually also the symbol of the flag of Termeqistan.

745
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,240
 It's still, like, it's interesting because even though it's a myth, there are people

746
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,760
 saying Kava existed.

747
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,960
 Kava was an actual revolutionary hero that existed.

748
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,680
 Modern scholars don't actually believe that one guy lived for a thousand years.

749
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,840
 There's definitely a lot of allegory in this story, right?

750
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,180
 The pitch black sky is just oppression.

751
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,760
 They say that the snakes on the shoulders actually just represented that there was a

752
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,520
 real guy named Zahok and the snakes on the shoulders weren't literal.

753
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,120
 They represented his blood lust, that he wasn't even eating human brains.

754
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,520
 He was just a tyrant.

755
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,720
 These are stories that came out.

756
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,480
 So you have another version of the story, like I said, where there's a warrior chosen by

757
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
 destiny.

758
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
 He's born.

759
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,120
 He's a special child.

760
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,360
 He's fed the milk of a blessed cow.

761
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,560
 Zahok has a vision.

762
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,600
 He will be defeated by him and all that stuff.

763
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,120
 It's definitely interesting as a mythological story.

764
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:15,280
 I like this story of Kava as the hero better because I think we can relate more to being

765
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,680
 Kava, right?

766
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
 You know what I mean?

767
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,780
 Like, the idea of the hero's journey, the idea of being destined to be the hero that

768
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,200
 saves the world, that's more, that's fun, but it's less likely.

769
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,920
 The idea of someone who has their back against the wall, who is just a normal person who has

770
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
 their back against the wall, destiny didn't choose them.

771
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,160
 They weren't born into this fate.

772
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,160
 They were just someone who had their back against the wall who said, "Enough!

773
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
 Enough!"

774
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
 And changing things.

775
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,720
 I find those stories more interesting.

776
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,200
 That story, I think, relates to the story of the Panthers.

777
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,320
 Going back to modern day Iran, you have a group of people, if they are, if this isn't

778
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,520
 a cover for the CIA or Israeli operations, Masat or something like that, you have a group

779
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,640
 of people who say, "I've existed in the Iranian regime.

780
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,040
 I've done things.

781
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,800
 I've sold my kids brains, metaphorically, by serving this regime.

782
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,600
 Now I want to overthrow it."

783
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,360
 And to call the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini a "Zahak" fits that story.

784
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:21,480
 These guys, these members of the military machine in Iran, see him as this foe that needs to

785
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,980
 be taken down.

786
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,320
 So that would make sense in that version of the story.

787
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,440
 They see themselves as Qa'vah.

788
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,480
 They see themselves as ordinary people who are being forced to do extraordinary things

789
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,600
 because of an insurmountable foe.

790
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,840
 They may have been spending years of their own life looking up in the night sky and thinking,

791
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,880
 "How do I fix this?

792
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
 How do I change things?"

793
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,680
 But the interesting thing about this myth is that both sides will see themselves as Qa'vah,

794
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
 right?

795
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,200
 The Iranian government, the established Iranian government, sees themselves as a freedom

796
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,280
 fighter against the tyranny of the world.

797
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,840
 And then underneath it you have a group of people within that country who sees themselves

798
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,760
 as freedom fighters against the government.

799
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,960
 Both sides see themselves as Qa'vah.

800
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,680
 They just have a different "Zahak" to fight.

801
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
 So whose story?

802
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,000
 Who's the hero?

803
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,920
 Whose saga will be remembered a thousand years from now?

804
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,080
 A group of revolutionaries in the country of Iran or the government of Iran itself?

805
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
 Who knows?

806
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:45,920
 Only time will tell.

807
00:36:45,920 --> 00:37:00,520
 Thank you.

808
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,100
 (upbeat music)
