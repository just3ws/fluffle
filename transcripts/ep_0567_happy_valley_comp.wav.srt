1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 A man meets an untimely end at the worst and possibly most fun place you'll ever work.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,600
 And then we travel to Oswego County in New York State to find the remains of a town once

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,600
 known as Happy Valley.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,440
 Locals say the area is haunted, cursed, everyone thought it was rumors until the skeletons

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,280
 appeared today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:36,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,640
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,400
 legacy Patreon supporters, Bryce Dawson.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,280
 Bryce Dawson, getting a round of applause as he's walking out of the room and what is

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
 he holding?

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,040
 Yep, that's right, he's holding a turkey, a dead turkey, a cooked turkey.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,240
 He's not just carrying around a corpse, he's carrying a cooked turkey because we did this

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,280
 last year, it was super successful.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,800
 We're in the planning stages right now, so give me your feedback if you guys want this.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,680
 But I'm looking at doing another Thanksgiving livestream.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,120
 We did it last year, I took the whole episode, I uploaded it onto the podcast providers as

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,200
 well so you can listen to it there after the fact.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,840
 We do Patreon livestreams once a month for the Patreons and I'm going to do one with

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,600
 them and then on top of that I'd love to do a live episode for everybody on Thanksgiving

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:36,400
 and we can chat and eat and you can watch me eat with my mouth full talking as Bryce

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
 is feeding me food.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,280
 So Bryce, let's go ahead and put you at the helm of the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught, our

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
 massive battleship.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,400
 We're not going to war, but we just have you in a while and it starts to get rusty, you

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,960
 gotta scrape the barnacles off.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,520
 Bryce, you are navigating this massive warship out to the United Kingdom.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,080
 Specifically, we're going to Red Roof that's in Cornwall in the UK.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,960
 It's November 2017 and the Dreadnaught docks that we're walking around and we see a big

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,040
 building, I don't know, could be meeting size, they didn't say in the article how big it

32
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,480
 was, there's no dimensions involved.

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,840
 H&A Recycling.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,480
 At H&A Recycling there is a young man named Dave McClellan, he's 23 years old and he's

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,400
 currently training Kyle Harvey on how to fix a jammed garbage compactor.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 Garbage compactors jammed and Dave's like, "Okay Kyle, it's time that I show you how

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
 to fix this thing."

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,560
 It actually jams all the time, it's kind of a piece of junk.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,600
 Electionally he says, because that wasn't in the article either, but anyways.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,640
 So Dave goes up to the top, so it's like a two-story garbage compactor.

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,120
 So he's on this walkway and Kyle's down below and Dave opens up the compactor and Kyle

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,320
 kind of is walking down, he can't really see what's going on up there, but he's like,

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,200
 "Well, okay, enough time is passed, I guess I'm going to start hitting this button."

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,920
 He hits the button and he hears, "Ahhh."

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,840
 He goes, "Oh, that's cool, he must have unjammed it, but," because I heard that monster's noise,

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 "Ahhh."

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,200
 But now it's jammed again, it stopped.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
 He's like, "Oh, great.

49
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,720
 Hey Dave, Dave, it's jammed again.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,920
 Whatever you did, it didn't work."

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,480
 And Dave doesn't answer and he's like, "What?

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 That's weird.

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,560
 Dave probably just went to a break.

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,200
 He probably just took a break in the middle of fixing this thing."

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 Oh well.

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,200
 So Kyle goes to the other coworkers, he's like, "Hey, the big green compactor's jammed."

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
 Everyone's like, "What?

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
 Again?"

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,960
 So there, I'll start working around with their life.

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,640
 We don't know how to fix it, you got to call Dave."

61
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,800
 And he's like, "Yeah, Dave was working on it, but Dave's not up there anymore."

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,400
 And the coworkers are looking at each other, they're like, "Oh yeah, it's break time, right?

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,080
 You just leave in the middle of doing the job, totally makes sense."

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,800
 Let's call Dave's cell phone and ask him, one, to bring us back some crisps.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,320
 And two, to let him know this compactor is broken.

66
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 Again.

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,840
 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

68
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,400
 It's in Britain, so there's more numbers.

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,360
 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
 do.

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,600
 They're sitting there on the phone, all of them, all the employees, they're all like

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,920
 girls gossiping on a sleepover, they all have their ear to the phone.

73
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,200
 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
