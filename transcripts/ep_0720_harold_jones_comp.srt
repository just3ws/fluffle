00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
 Today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains violent imagery and disturbing content.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,000
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,600
 A cab driver traveling down a lonely dark road has a close encounter of the FIST, kind.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,200
 And then we take a look at the story of a young man up against impossible odds.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,960
 What would you do if all of a sudden police officers arrived at your house?

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,640
 Knocked on your door and then arrested you for a brutal murder you didn't commit.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,400
 [Music]

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,960
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,760
 Even though this is one of the rare episodes I give a content warning on, it's Liz.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,440
 Everyone give a round of applause to Liz.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,560
 She's looking around and she's like, "Aw man, this episode, come on Liz, throw our arm around her shoulder.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,800
 Come on into this disturbing episode, Liz.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,880
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,120
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,720
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,800
 Liz, let's go ahead and get this party started.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,680
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,720
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,600
 We are flying all the way down to Chile.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,800
 [Liz makes a flying sound]

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,280
 Liz is flying us on over there.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,000
 It's a nice leisurely journey.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200
 We're headed back to the year 1999.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,960
 It's June 19th and we're near Pincot.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,440
 It's a little town apparently in Chile.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,720
 It's four in the morning and while we're flying up high in this Durgible,

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,720
 there's a car driving the lonely dark road below us.

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,000
 [Liz makes a flying sound]

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,760
 And in this car is a cab driver.

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,880
 We don't have his name so we're going to call him Jacob.

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,520
 So Jacob's driving this cab down this lonely dark road near Pincot, Chile.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,280
 And he sees something standing on the side of the road.

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
 It's often the distance.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,760
 It's standing on the side of the road.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,040
 And even though it's night, 4 a.m., it's morning technically for all you space nerds out there.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,800
 He sees this dark figure standing on the side of the road,

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
 but he can still make out the outline of this figure.

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,920
 And right where the eyes should be, there's two red glowing dots.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
 [Liz makes a flying sound]

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
 A little spooky, right?

46
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
 And he notices as he's driving down the road,

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
 the figure is now walking towards the car.

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,280
 And he's like, "Dude, I'm out of here."

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
 Which is what he was doing anyways.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,600
 The cab driver was headed to another destination.

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,120
 He wasn't going to have a picnic here.

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
 But when he sees the figure,

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,520
 start walking towards his car,

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,760
 he just puts a pedal to the metal, baby.

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,520
 And he starts flying down the road.

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,120
 And just then, the shadowy figure leaps into the air.

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,320
 [Liz makes a flying sound]

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
 Jacob can't see it.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,960
 He's like, "Oh man, if I had a convertible,

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,400
 I could see how high it was in the air.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,160
 He's also thinking if I had a convertible,

62
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,000
 I'm totally exposed to my brain getting ripped out by whatever it is."

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
 [Liz makes a flying sound]

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,160
 It like flies away.

65
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,240
 You're like, "Okay, that was chilling."

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,360
 Right?

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,520
 A big black shape with piercing red eyes standing out in the middle of nowhere.

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,880
 It flies away like Mothman story, Man-Bat.

69
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,480
 It'll be something I'll tell before he can finish his sentence.

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,200
 The top of his cab goes, "Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
 The top of his cab goes, "Mmmmm!" Makes like a noise.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
 It doesn't have a horn.

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,040
 It's not a clown up there.

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
 It makes a noise like something landed on the roof of his car.

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,360
 And he's driving faster and faster.

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
 And he looks in his rear view mirror,

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
 and he sees the creature is now holding.

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,800
 This is...

79
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 I'm not your older brother.

80
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,480
 This is not creepybasta.

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
 He sees the creature is holding onto the back of his car.

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,480
 He has a hooky.

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
 [Liz makes a hooking sound]

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
 He has a hooky and ahhh.

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
 He's called... This creature is climbing on the back of his car.

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,400
 So, like, landed on the roof, and then when he's gassing it,

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
 the creature kind of fell off, but grabbed onto the bumper,

88
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,080
 and he's like climbing up, and he can see...

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
 When he looks in his rear view mirror,

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
 all he can see is this thing's face and forehead.

91
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
 It just looked like an outline.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280
 It still didn't look right.

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
 He freaks out.

94
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
 He looks straight ahead.

95
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,720
 He's driving.

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 He looks back to see if it's there.

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,680
 It's completely gone.

98
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,440
 The figure is completely gone.

99
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,400
 But then later...

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,560
 And he just drives away.

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
 He doesn't stop to figure out what happened.

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,000
 He just drives.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
 He's like, "I wonder what that horrible beast was that could fly

104
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
 and land on my car.

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
 I better stop and examine it."

106
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
 No, he does the smart thing.

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
 He drives away.

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,560
 But later, after he gets to his destination,

109
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
 he realizes something.

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
 There's a hook.

111
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
 There's a hook.

112
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,480
 There's a hook on his door.

113
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,360
 Now, I'm not just joking.

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,240
 I don't know why I'm...

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
 I don't know why I'm ruining this door.

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,720
 He notices something.

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,400
 He notices that his odometer shows that he traveled triple the distance he should have.

118
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,840
 So from where he was at to where he's at now, it was triple that.

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,120
 And he could not explain in any way what could have caused that.

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
 This story I got from ThinkAbout@Ducks.com.

121
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,040
 They got it from a group called UFOPR.

122
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,160
 But a really, really interesting story.

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,720
 First off, you do think it sounds like something that if somebody told you

124
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
 around a campfire, you'd be like, "Ugh."

125
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,720
 As he sees horrible, brutal scars, and his car is completely trashed,

126
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
 he's like, "Why won't anyone believe me?"

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
 There's a giant, like, bloody claw marks on his car.

128
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
 Someone told you to store around a campfire.

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,560
 You'd be like, "That's kind of spooky."

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,080
 But then you have this weird alien that...

131
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,120
 What caused the odometer to...

132
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,600
 Even an alien lore, you have lost time.

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
 I've never come across lost distance before.

134
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,040
 Like, sure, people have ended up in places where they didn't start off.

135
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
 They've been teleported.

136
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,760
 But the fact that the odometer was going showed that he wasn't teleported.

137
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,440
 The car wasn't teleported, because if I put your car on a flatbed,

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
 your odometer doesn't keep working.

139
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,560
 It... that's such a weird part of this story.

140
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
 It's action-packed.

141
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
 Creatures flying around, landing on cars.

142
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,240
 That was all the action.

143
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
 But it is action-packed.

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,200
 But then what is up with the odometer reading?

145
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,040
 What could have possibly caused that?

146
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,440
 Traveling through an alternate dimension?

147
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,560
 Maybe?

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
 Just off the top of my head?

149
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
 Who knows?

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,120
 I can't...

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,240
 I mean, there is no...

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,480
 Hypnotized?

153
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,160
 Maybe the creature did get him.

154
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
 Maybe the creature got him and drove him around for a while.

155
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,440
 And then just got out.

156
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,400
 Who knows?

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
 It's one of those stories that, at first,

158
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,640
 it just sounds like a typical monster attack,

159
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
 which we cover a lot on this show.

160
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,400
 But then the ending detail.

161
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,520
 How could the odometer be triple the distance that it should be?

162
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,040
 I really don't even have a theory on it.

163
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,320
 And I'm the king of theories.

164
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,920
 I'm the king of coming up with stuff.

165
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
 The only thing I can think...

166
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,640
 The two theories that I guess I had was that he got possessed,

167
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,520
 and the creature drove him around and did whatever.

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
 And then the second one is that he drove through an alternate universe.

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
 He's running over the smurfs.

170
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,920
 He's running over the smurfs for, you know,

171
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,800
 triple the distance and then the demon or whatever it was.

172
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
 Let's say it was Gargamel.

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
 Gargamel possessed him.

174
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,240
 Who knows?

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,360
 Such a bizarre story.

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
 And I love it when we have this cross-section

177
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
 between run-of-the-mill monster stories

178
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,640
 and then something like this,

179
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,920
 something that seems out of this world.

180
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,240
 So bizarre story.

181
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
 Really, really enjoyed reading it to you.

182
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
 Hope you enjoyed it as well.

183
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,680
 Liz, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
 to the Carbondocopter.

185
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
 We are leaving behind Chile.

186
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
 We are headed on out to...

187
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,000
 Abertillie, Wales.

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,200
 And as Liz is flying over the ocean,

189
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,800
 probably should announce this before we're over the Atlantic Ocean,

190
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,760
 this story does have some disturbing imagery in it.

191
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,520
 So if you don't want to hear it,

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,880
 I will see you tomorrow.

193
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,640
 You can jump out of the Carbondocopter right now.

194
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 We will give you an official parachute,

195
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,000
 and we will see you tomorrow.

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
 For the rest of you and Liz,

197
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,600
 who has to fly us the rest of this way,

198
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,400
 let's go to Abertillie, Wales.

199
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,560
 Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

 [Jed Wigo's "Dog" plays]

201
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,000
 I found out about this story from a person online

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,280
 going by the name of "Jed Wigo" of Calise.

203
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,160
 And thank you very much.

204
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,920
 I never would have come across this story before.

205
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,840
 I find it absolutely fascinating.

206
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,920
 It's February 1921,

207
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,760
 we're in Abertillie, Wales.

208
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,840
 We're at the Abertillie police station.

209
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,560
 And there sits a young man,

210
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,040
 his name is Harold Jones, 16-year-old boy.

211
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,720
 He's being accused of one of the most horrific crimes

212
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
 you can be accused of.

213
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,520
 On February 5th, Frida Elsie Bernal walks into Mortimer's stores.

214
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,600
 They sell oil and seed.

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,960
 Super bizarre combination of stuff.

216
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,320
 I just can imagine like these barrels of black crude

217
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,920
 and then like sunflower seeds.

218
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
 But apparently this people bought stuff back in 1921.

219
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
 You'd be like, "One barrel of oil, please.

220
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
 Maybe it's cooking oil. I don't know."

221
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
 But I'm researching any of that stuff.

222
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,400
 Frida, who's eight years old, was hanging out at home

223
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,280
 and her dad said, "Hey, Frida, you want to earn a penny?"

224
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
 It was like in 1921.

225
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,040
 She's like, "I could buy my own oil with that penny.

226
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,400
 You want to earn a penny?

227
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,280
 Why don't you run down to Mortimer's stores?

228
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,200
 I want you to pick me up some poultry spice and some grit."

229
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
 So at 9 a.m., she runs down to Mortimer's stores

230
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
 to buy the poultry spice and grit.

231
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
 And when she gets there about 9.05 a.m.,

232
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,240
 Harold Jones is working out the stories, working the counter.

233
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,040
 And he does prepare the poultry spice for her.

234
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,480
 And he goes, "Well, here's the thing.

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,520
 I have loose poultry grit, but I don't have just poultry grit.

236
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
 Which one do you want?"

237
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,920
 And Frida thinks about it for a bit and she goes, "I don't know.

238
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,080
 I don't even know what grit is.

239
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
 I don't even know what grit is useful.

240
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
 Let me go home and ask my dad.

241
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
 I'll be right back."

242
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,200
 And she leaves.

243
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
 It's later in the afternoon.

244
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,480
 Way later in the afternoon, police begin showing up at the store.

245
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,520
 And they start asking Harold, "Hey, the little girl come in here?

246
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
 Little girl, Frida?"

247
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,400
 You know, "Oh yeah, yeah, Frida came in."

248
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
 She came in really early.

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,280
 Really early.

250
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,000
 How early?

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,480
 I don't know.

252
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,600
 Like right after 9, she showed up and she bought some poultry spice and some grit.

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,960
 Do you know what grit is in the officers?

254
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
 They're like, "We don't know what it is either."

255
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
 He goes, "Yeah, and I said we know we have these different types of grit,

256
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,960
 but we didn't have this one in stock, so she left."

257
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
 Police officers are like, "Okay."

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,760
 They're kind of taken down as information, talking to them.

259
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,120
 What had happened was she never returned home.

260
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
 And by 3 p.m., the family reported her to the police.

261
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,240
 The police began scouring the area and part of that trail was taken them to Mortimer's stores.

262
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,280
 But the girl's still missing.

263
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,120
 Harold Jones is thinking, "Well, okay, you know, I'm just selling stuff, right?

264
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,920
 I didn't do anything."

265
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,600
 The next day, only 300 yards from the store, a sack is found.

266
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,400
 And inside of the sack is the body of 8-year-old Frida.

267
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,720
 After the body's examined, this is what they're able to discover.

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,160
 She died of a combination of blunt force trauma and strangulation with a cord.

269
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,960
 And that cord was still wrapped around her neck when her body was stuffed inside of the sack.

270
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,480
 She had been gagged, her elbows were tied behind her back, and her ankles were knotted together.

271
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:44,080
 There are also signs that before she was murdered, the assailant attempted to rape her.

272
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,080
 There was two clues that the cops were really looking at with this.

273
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,560
 One, they were able to say the time of death was between 9.30 a.m. and 1 p.m.,

274
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
 February 5th, the previous day.

275
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,680
 And on her body and in the bag and around the bag was corn shaft.

276
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,000
 And just a couple hundred yards from where the sack was discovered, there was a chicken run.

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,280
 They find like this storage shed, this area, and the areas full of corn shaft.

278
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,480
 And in the shed, there was an axe handle, and they believe that was the murder weapon.

279
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,960
 Now, there's only a few people who have a key to that shed.

280
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,640
 The Mortimer family, who owned the store, and Harold Jones.

281
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:40,080
 And he is adamant. I did not do this. I didn't do it.

282
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,920
 And the cops, they don't have any physical evidence that he did it.

283
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,200
 But they got a hell of a lot of circumstantial evidence.

284
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,240
 He was there, right? That's a big part of it if he was in Peru.

285
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,240
 He was there. His friend said, you know, he was acting kind of weird that day.

286
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
 I remember we wanted to go like down the alleyway to go to the shed.

287
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
 He's like, no, no, no, they had to get something out of the shed.

288
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
 He's like, no, no, I'll do it. I'll do it. And he's like, be quiet.

289
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,200
 That was a piece of the evidence. The cops go, oh, maybe he brutally murdered this girl and tried to rape her.

290
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
 He's like, I didn't do it.

291
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,240
 His own family said, listen, during the key times that this crime would have taken place,

292
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
 he was home by then. And his boss said, listen, he was out making deliveries

293
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
 early in the morning. He couldn't have done this.

294
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,520
 So even though his own behavior seemed a little weird and sometimes he would contradict himself,

295
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,880
 he's a 16 year old boy. He's contradicting himself during police interrogation.

296
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,880
 Even though he has an alibi, his family and the owners of the shop are saying,

297
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,480
 no, he wouldn't have been here for the times that you think this would have happened.

298
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,360
 The police arrest him. The only thing more terrifying of being accused of a crime you did commit

299
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,680
 is being accused of a crime you didn't commit. I mean, obviously the most terrifying thing

300
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,400
 is being the victim of a crime. But if you commit a crime, you know what you did.

301
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,360
 And any good criminal has an alibi. And if you know what you did, if you have your alibi,

302
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,880
 and it's a solid alibi, you can coast that for as long as it'll take you. Keep that alibi going.

303
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,440
 But let's say that I break into a couple cars and the police arrest me and they start trying

304
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,320
 to bluff me because police will lie, police will bluff, they're allowed to do that. They will cheat,

305
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,200
 they'll do whatever. Everything you say can and will be used against you. None of it's going to

306
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 be used in your defense. What you say to the police can and will be used against you.

307
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,960
 It's an adversary, when you commit a crime, it is an adversarial relationship with the police.

308
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,960
 So you got to be aware of that. But anyways, let's say I'm breaking in with a series of cars.

309
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,840
 And the police suspect that it's me. It is me. I know that it's me. They think that it's me.

310
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,520
 And they try to bluff me and they say, "Listen, we have your fingerprints at the scene of the crime.

311
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,040
 We know that it's you. And I know full well I've worn gloves every single time." I'll go,

312
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,480
 "I don't understand what you're talking about. I wasn't there, I wasn't there." "Sir, we have your

313
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,680
 DNA." Well, that's funny because I'm a silica-based alien. I have no what you call DNA. If you did

314
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,720
 it, you know what you did. So when the cops are trying to bluff you, you know it's a bluff.

315
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,720
 This happened. This happened. I remember when I worked at Best Buy a long time ago.

316
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
 We caught all these kids, all these employees, these really young employees,

317
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,200
 stealing out of the electronics department. It was a ring. One guy was stealing Dreamcast games

318
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,920
 and selling them on the sly. And his defense was that he was a kleptomaniac. He couldn't help it.

319
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,160
 And they always had this rule at Best Buy. I don't think they have this anymore.

320
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
 They always said, "If we catch a shoplifter, if we catch an employee shoplifting, we're going to

321
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,440
 make him walk the track." There's always that yellow line that kind of goes around the inside of Best Buy.

322
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:00,160
 And they caught this dude. It was Dreamcast games. They made him walk the track. He ended up not only

323
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,160
 not going to jail because his defense lawyer said that he was a kleptomaniac. He's going to help it.

324
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:12,240
 He sued Best Buy and won for humiliation. But also, so that didn't have its suffix,

325
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,720
 just a bit sorry, but at the same time, there were like these five or six kids, these dudes,

326
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,280
 these like, they were like 18, 19 years old, stealing stuff out of the electronics department.

327
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,760
 The way they caught him, the way they broke the back of this group because they were real slick.

328
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,920
 You never would catch him, but the way they broke the back of this group is just what happened.

329
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,440
 I remember being, because I was in management at the time, I remember being told about all this.

330
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,520
 They brought one of the kids into the security room and in the room was one of the department

331
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,080
 managers and a police officer. And the department manager goes, "Listen, we know that you're stealing

332
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,360
 stuff. Just confess." And he's like, "I'm not stealing anything." He goes, "We know you're stealing

333
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
 stuff. You have to confess to us. Tell us you're stealing stuff." And he's like, "I'm not stealing,

334
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,000
 I didn't steal anything." He was adamant he didn't steal anything. Then the department manager had a,

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,960
 again, this very, very old story, had a VHS tape, blank tape and said, "Listen, this, on this tape,

336
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,160
 is security footage of you stealing. We have security footage of you stealing on this tape. Now,

337
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,040
 if I play this tape and this officer sees you commit a crime, he has a legal obligation

338
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,000
 to arrest you and take you to jail right now. So I'm going to put this tape in the VCR and I'm

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,080
 going to hit play. And if it shows you stealing, you will go to jail." He goes, "Do you want me to

340
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,560
 put this tape in the VCR?" And the kid looks, looks at the cop. The cop actually pulled his

341
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,000
 handcuffs off and started kind of playing with him. And the kid goes, "Me and my friends have been

342
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,600
 stealing stuff. We've been stealing stuff." There was nothing on that videotape. It was a blank tape.

343
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,320
 But they bluffed them. They bluffed them and they had no proof that they were actually other than

344
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,920
 stuff was disappearing and these guys were working completely circumstantial. But when you've

345
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,800
 committed the crime, you know what to fight against. This kid, he was a young dude. Of course,

346
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,640
 he was going to get bluffed by the cops, by a department manager of Best Buy even. But if you

347
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,360
 didn't commit the crime, there's no defense other than, "I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't

348
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,880
 do it." And you can say it over and over and over again. If someone came to your place of business

349
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,840
 or your home or your school and a police officer accused you of breaking into a shop and stealing

350
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,840
 somebody's bicycle, you'd be like, "What in the world are you riding away on a brand new bicycle

351
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,160
 that's under this podcast?" You'd go, "What in the world are you talking about? Well, where were

352
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,840
 you such and such time?" "I don't know." Or even worse, I was at home by myself and cops look at

353
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,400
 each other. They're like, "Well, that's not really good alibi." "Check the online logs, dude. I have

354
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,040
 the best kill streak in Team Fortress 2 at the time." There's no defense other than, "I didn't do

355
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,280
 it." And that is so much harder to fight against. If you've committed the crime, you know what you've

356
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,440
 done. You know what the house layout's like. You know what the scene is like when you left it.

357
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,720
 So you can push back against stuff. But if you didn't do it, and it's so much easier to get

358
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,680
 tripped up when you didn't do it. Because they'll just start asking, "Where were you? Do you know

359
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,920
 this person? I don't know. I mean, maybe I know that person. The name slightly sounds familiar.

360
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,120
 They write down, they know the person. Everything you say can and will be used against you.

361
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,400
 The best thing to do is just to get a lawyer. But anyway, so we're talking 1921 in Britain here,

362
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,960
 and Harold Jones is being accused of this crime, and he is adamant. I didn't commit it. I didn't

363
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,360
 do this. And you can only say that so many times, and you're going to start getting tripped up in

364
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,600
 your testimony. You're going to start getting tired. He did have one thing going for him, though.

365
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,280
 The people in town didn't have faith in this arrest. They actually thought the cops arrested

366
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
 them because it was a brutal crime, and they needed to close it really quickly. But they're

367
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,640
 like, "How could a 16-year-old kid do this?" We don't believe that this, he's capable of it.

368
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,840
 There's no evidence. It's all circumstantial evidence. So the people in town actually wore

369
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,560
 behind him. Now we move ahead to June 21st, 1921, war in Monmouth, Wales. That's where the trial

370
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,920
 begins. Now during the investigation, when he's flabbergasted, they're even accusing him of this,

371
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,680
 he sets some stuff to contradict himself, which anyone can do. But when he's on the stand, he's

372
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,160
 super cool, he's super collected. He actually, under very, very strong cross-examining the

373
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,680
 prosecutors asking them questions, he holds up because Harold Jones is like, "Listen,

374
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,880
 I'm telling the truth. You tell the truth, hopefully the jury will figure it out."

375
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,400
 Prosecutors make their case, the defense makes their case.

376
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:05,120
 Jury comes back with a ruling, "Not guilty. Not guilty." And you hear that verdict, "Not guilty."

377
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,000
 Finally, after all these months of being accused of this heinous crime, he gets his validation.

378
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,400
 From a bunch of people he doesn't even know this jury. And he has a little private party at a local

379
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,640
 restaurant and he gets up on the table and gives a little... It's a victory lap, really, right?

380
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,440
 Like how terrifying that would be for us to be in that position. When he's headed back to town,

381
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,840
 when he gets to Avertilly, there's actually like a miniature parade for this guy. Because no one in

382
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,760
 town really believed that he could have done this. So they put him in a, like a horse carriage,

383
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,360
 because they still had those back then that were state of the art. And he's like riding

384
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,560
 through the street and people, people want the real murderer found. Like now it's the next part

385
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,560
 of the investigation. We'll get to that in a second. But I wanted to cover this story with

386
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,720
 Harold Jones and him being accused of this particular crime. Because we get to see what

387
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,480
 happens when someone is accused of something. They say they didn't do it. People, they have no proof

388
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,200
 that this person did it. And the police still try to run him through the legal system. And I wanted

389
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,160
 to examine that. As he's coming down on this little parade in this hope and horse carriage,

390
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,920
 this little kid runs up to him. It's like something out of a movie. This little kid named George Little

391
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,080
 runs up to him and goes, "This is actual quote." And I don't know if the reporter heard this, but this

392
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,880
 is actual quote. "Well done, lad. We knew you didn't do it." Apparently he's also a leprechaun.

393
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,120
 But George Little is saying, you know, like, you're back home. Let's try to get things back to normal.

394
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,560
 But you know, it's funny because you, how do you go back to normal for being accused of a

395
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,840
 murder like that? Of just a horrible murder of a child. How would you go back to normal?

396
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,920
 People are kind of treating him like a celebrity. And people treat him as a victim as well. So

397
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,120
 there's really two victims to this story. You have Frida and then you have Harold going through

398
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,000
 this whole process. So people did kind of have a, it was just a weird way they viewed him. So July

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,040
 8th, this is only, I think, maybe two, two weeks after he got out of jail. He'd been jailed the whole

400
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,000
 time. On July 8th, Florence Little, 11-year-old girl, she's actually George's sister, the guy who

401
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,160
 gave the little speech at the end of that movie. She's playing hopscotch with her little sister

402
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,880
 outside the house and they're neighbors to Harold Jones. So the Jones family and the Little family

403
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,200
 they know each other very, very well. They're just out, her and her sister are out playing hopscotch

404
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,520
 on this day. And Harold pops out of his house, comes out and is chatting up the kids a bit and

405
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,240
 stuff like that. They're talking. And again, you have to imagine they're thinking this dude,

406
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,040
 like what a horrible thing to go through. He was in jail and now he's out. So he goes,

407
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 "Hey Florence, can you come inside? I need help with something." Florence goes, "Yeah, sure."

408
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,360
 So she stops playing hopscotch, she walks inside the house with Harold, and they are briefly in

409
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:55,120
 the house when he gets her in a chokehold and begins to strangle the life out of this girl.

410
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,640
 She can't scream and he begins dragging her through the house to the kitchen.

411
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,680
 There he had waiting a plank of wood and he began bashing her over the head.

412
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:21,120
 He grabs a handful of her hair and holds her over the kitchen sink. The angle's not quite right

413
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:29,440
 yet. He begins to push her head farther over the sink. He then pulls out his father's pocket knife,

414
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:40,000
 slides it into her throat, and slits her wide open. She quickly bleeds out

415
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,080
 while her little sister is still waiting outside for another round of hopscotch.

416
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,640
 He cleans up the scene as best as he can. He actually does a really good job cleaning up the

417
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,680
 scene. He drags her body upstairs, hides it in the attic, and takes about. It doesn't take long

418
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,840
 for the little sister to realize her older sister Florence is missing. She goes home, she tells her

419
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,160
 mom, her mom starts panicking looking for her because there's a murderer on the loose.

420
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,320
 Just no one believed that it was really Harold Jones when it was Harold Jones all along.

421
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,120
 So you have to imagine that mother's fear as she's walking up to the Jones's house.

422
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:31,600
 It couldn't be him. It couldn't be him. But at the same time, where's her daughter? She knocks on

423
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,880
 the door and she said it takes a couple minutes for Harold to answer it and he goes, "Oh, I'm sorry,

424
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,960
 it took me so long. I was up taking a bath." And she goes, "Have you seen Florence?" And he goes,

425
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,640
 "Well, yeah, you know, she came over to help me run an errand." But then she ran away. She just

426
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,760
 ran off into the woods. The mom and other neighbors keep looking for Florence, but it's not, I don't

427
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,320
 know why they waited so long. It's not until 1115 that the police are notified that Florence is missing.

428
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,960
 They begin doing a house-to-house search. And I almost feel because of the public outcry over the

429
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,920
 Harold Jones arrest, they wait. They're literally neighbors. But it's not until the next day that

430
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,240
 they search his house. They go in the kitchen. They don't see anything weird. They're looking

431
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,680
 around the house. Harold's dad is there, Philip Jones. It's in the house as well. The cops are

432
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,680
 like, "Can we search?" And he's like, "Yeah, sure, you know." It's not like he just put my son through

433
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,360
 hell the past couple months. He didn't do it. We told you he didn't do it. But anything can

434
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,920
 help this missing girl. As the police are looking around, they see the little like door knob to the

435
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,640
 attic, you know, that little thing that you pull down. The ladder comes down like in the movies.

436
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,440
 One police officer looked up and it looked like blood that someone had tried cleaning off.

437
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,200
 That's something only a police officer would recognize. Like most people will recognize blood.

438
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,960
 Some people recognize dried blood, but blood that's been cleaned off,

439
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,800
 that's someone who's seen that a lot. The police officer goes, "I think we should check the attic."

440
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,680
 And they went up there and sure enough, she was up there. She was sprawled across the rafters and her

441
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:17,920
 clothes were partially removed. Philip Jones is incensed at this. Obviously, he's horrifying that

442
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,000
 he has this dead girl in his apartment. He feels that tragedy. But you have to know that in this

443
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 moment, he knew his son had committed the first murder. He actually then goes through town, finds

444
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,840
 his own son, and performs a citizen arrest on him until the police show up.

445
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,680
 He denies it. He denies it. And the dad's like, "Okay, that is not going to work this time."

446
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,120
 But it works with the city of Abertilly. They take him, they throw him in jail.

447
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,600
 500 people show up outside the police station. Not as like a vigilante mob. They were saying,

448
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,960
 "Release him." Once again, you're trying to put this poor boy, you're mad because you lost the

449
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,320
 first trial. You're trying to trump us from charges. And the police chief came out and said,

450
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:14,480
 "Listen, this is totally different. We found her in his house, in his attic. His own dad arrested

451
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:22,160
 him. Go home. He's guilty." He denied it. He denied it. And then while he was awaiting trial,

452
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:31,280
 he wrote this. "I, Harold Jones, do confess that I willfully and deliberately murdered Florence Irene

453
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,280
 Little on July 8th, causing her to die without preparation to meet her god. The reason for

454
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:49,520
 doing so? Being a desire to kill." At first, he said, "I didn't kill the first girl. But it was so

455
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,000
 cool being in the spotlight and having everyone pay attention to me that I killed the second girl."

456
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,440
 But then after about a month, he goes, "Ah, just kidding. I killed the first girl, too, for the same

457
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,920
 reason. I just want to know what it was like to kill somebody. I had a desire to take a life.

458
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:13,520
 Two murders of two young girls. One attempted rape. The other one partially unclothed." So there

459
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,120
 was most likely some sort of sexual motive going on as well. There's no trial this time. He goes

460
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:29,360
 straight to jail. But remember, he's only 16 years old. The maximum he can serve is 20 years.

461
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:37,760
 By 1941, remember, we're way in the future. We can chart his path. By 1941, he was out. He was out

462
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,720
 when he was about 35 years old, and he went and joined the merchant navy during World War II.

463
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,840
 After the war, he got married, had a kid himself. It was 1971 when he finally passed away as an

464
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,840
 old man. Died of bone cancer. But that's not where the story of Harold Jones ends, actually.

465
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:03,280
 Because, oddly enough, they think that he murdered way more than just these two girls.

466
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:12,320
 He's been linked to the murderers of at least six other women between the year 1964 and 1965.

467
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,800
 There was a murderer known as Jack the Stripper, who would club women, choke them,

468
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:26,640
 and undress them. To this day, nobody knows who Jack the Stripper actually was. But some people

469
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:35,760
 believe it was Harold Jones, indulging in a sick fetish once again. An eerily bizarre story

470
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:43,520
 about a justice system that gets it wrong. About a boy who commits a crime that's so

471
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,560
 inspeakable that people in town don't believe he could do it. And then he does it again.

472
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:56,560
 A creepy true crime story that just reminds us of a very simple, but sometimes forgotten fact.

473
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,880
 It's not always the creature hanging on the back of your car as you speed down a dark road

474
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,280
 that you need to be most concerned about. It's the person sitting next to you.

475
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:15,040
 It's the friendly smile and wave as you're driving down the road. It's the nice boy at the grocery

476
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:25,920
 store. Or the friendly barista at your local Starbucks. What madness, what evil, lies in the

477
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:37,200
 people we see every day. And when we find out that these people that camouflage themselves

478
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:45,040
 in society so well, when we find out their true nature, will it be when we read about them in

479
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:52,000
 the newspaper? Or will we know of their true nature when we are a victim of theirs? When the

480
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,360
 rock hits across the top of our head, when the knife plunges into our rib cage,

481
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:06,560
 when the gunshot pierces our lung. At that point, it's too late for us. But hopefully,

482
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:13,360
 the next person we'll be able to see through the disguise of the monster who hides in plain sight.
