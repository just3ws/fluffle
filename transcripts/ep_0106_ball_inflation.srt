1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 A railway company wanting to have a little promotion

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 decide to crash two trains into each other with predictable results.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,240
 And then because I never learned my lesson, we take a look at another cult.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,600
 This cult focuses not on the mind, but on the body.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,200
 How far can you push yourself to please your master today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,560
 "I'm a walk big gal"

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,560
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. It's almost Thanksgiving and I'm

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,840
 still on my quest for some Thanksgiving-based conspiracies. Found a little bit. Little bit.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,080
 We'll see. We'll see. Some of them, you know, I'm not going to give it away. And this time I

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,120
 remember to record the Thanksgiving episode the day before Thanksgiving. So you can listen to it

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,760
 during Thanksgiving or before Thanksgiving and you can tell your friends and family,

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,360
 please tell your friends and family, that you're listening to the podcast Dead Rabbit Radio and

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,240
 it's full of all this amazing information and you can regale them with your stories.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,920
 I will say this next part with the caveat, if you are a hypochondriac, skip ahead five minutes

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,120
 because this is insane. I stumbled across this article. This wasn't part of the episode originally.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,080
 I was just kind of, I'm constantly reading the news, just the regular news. I'll go to weird news

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,320
 sites when I'm looking for weird news, but you find a lot of bizarre stuff just, you know,

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,120
 I'm on Drudge Report and I'm like, oh, Trump's doing this and this is going on in Bolivia and

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,840
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then I stumble across these weird articles. So last Thanksgiving,

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
 I guess this is kind of Thanksgiving-based conspiracy. Last Thanksgiving, this guy,

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,160
 this dad, was helping make the Thanksgiving feast. He had a runny nose and he actually ruined the feast

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,040
 because his nose, his snot was dripping into the food. Now, I can understand that happening

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,120
 once. Like, you know, it drips into the mashed potatoes and everyone's like, oh, gross, dude.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,080
 You know, you got snot in the mashed potatoes and being like, uh-oh, spaghetti. Oh, like, I can get

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,320
 that happening once, but he ruined the whole meal. It's almost like a "Fairly Brothers" film. Like,

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,640
 he's just moving around from dish to dish, being like, I'll stand over here by the turkey and they're

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,320
 like, no, dad, no. And it's like drip, drip. So despite it not being a "Fairly Brother" movie,

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,760
 it was real and his nose dripped all over the food. And you're thinking, oh, okay, that's gross,

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,400
 Jason. That's not really bizarre. The nose drip wouldn't go away. He would stick tissue up his nose

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,920
 to kind of block it from dripping out. It was just like this embarrassing thing he was dealing with.

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,120
 He said it was very embarrassing. The doctors couldn't figure it out. He finally went to another

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
 doctor and the doctors run and test because that's weird. Shouldn't have lasted this long. Like,

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
 people have seasonal allergies, but their nose doesn't drip all the time. Let me run some tests.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,160
 They tested it. It was brain fluid dripping out of his nose. His nose, his, basically, they had a leak.

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
 So they repaired his brain. They put a little flap. They took a little flap off of him somewhere,

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
 a little flap of skin. They went in there and they just covered it up. And I'm like, okay,

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:11,520
 that's cool. The last sentence of the article says, "Dr. Ilorta," Dr. I-- oh, sorry, Dr. Ilorretta,

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,640
 I think, said to watch out if you have a runny nose on one side of your nostril. If there's a salty

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,560
 taste associated with it and all that comes with an intense headache, it could be more than a runny nose.

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,960
 What? What snot doesn't taste salty? Like, I haven't tasted my own snot in decades. I can't imagine

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,520
 that. I'm trying to remember the last time I actually, like, got it in my mouth. But if I-- if

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,280
 someone had to say, "Hey, man, what does boogers taste like?" I'd be like, "Oh, I think they're salty."

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,240
 Memory serves me right from being eight. So they're basically saying if your nose is running and it

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,640
 tastes like salt-- and I'm wondering how many hyperchondriacs read this article or will listen

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,560
 to this podcast and then immediately start looking, testing their snot every once in a while to make

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,480
 sure it's not brain fluid. Because it being like salt should just be a given. And then, you know,

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,680
 the intense headaches, it was probably the biggest factor to it. But anyway, so yes, if you have a

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,720
 runny nose and it tastes like salt, like all runny noses do, your brain may be leaking. Hopefully,

50
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,760
 maybe someone's listening to this and they've had a runny nose for years and they're like,

51
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,920
 "Oh my god, thank you." That happened to me once. I remember once-- I remember once I was talking

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,200
 to someone in the break room at a job that I had. I had this story super vague, but-- and they were

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,880
 explaining some sort of problem their husband had medically. And I remember going, "Oh, you know what?

54
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,280
 It might be this. I read an article on this before. It sounds kind of similar." And she's like, "Oh,

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,000
 you know." And I ran into her. She caught up to me like maybe two or three weeks later and she's

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,680
 like, "Dude, you saved my husband's life." Like, he was actually having some really serious problems

57
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,200
 in that article you just happened to read and readers died just four years earlier. Like,

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,360
 that's exactly what he had. I don't remember what the illness was. Maybe this story is not

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,920
 just for hyperconjurax. Maybe someone out there is suffering from brain leakage. Let's go ahead and

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,560
 get started with the first story here. That didn't count. That was just kind of a throwaway story.

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,920
 Not a throwaway story, but that was just kind of a starter story. Now we're going to move on to

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:12,000
 another starter story. So this one is the story of Crush, Texas. Now Crush, Texas is a city in

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,320
 Texas called Crush, or it was a city in Texas called Crush. It was a city that only existed for one day.

64
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,320
 So in 1896, there was a guy named William George Crush. And he worked for the Missouri, Kansas,

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,400
 Texas railroad. And they called it the "Katy" for short. So the Katy railroad, and he said, "You know

66
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
 what? There's a couple other companies that have done this. Let's do this promotional thing. We're

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
 going to take two trains that were in there, not in service anymore. We're going to take two locomotives,

68
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,640
 and we're going to crash them into a... They didn't have television back then. So this was a good

69
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,840
 idea. They're going to crash them into each other and we'll use it as promotion for a railroad."

70
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,200
 So what it was was they said for anywhere in Texas, it only cost you two dollars to take the

71
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,920
 train to Crush. Again, two dollars back then was the equivalent to like twenty dollars now,

72
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,040
 but it was still a good deal. So they were able to show off their railway. It was going to be this

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,640
 big promotional thing. And the Katy railroad said, "That's a great idea. Other people have done it.

74
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,640
 It's been totally fine." They got the engines. They took six box cars and put it on each locomotive.

75
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,520
 They chained them together so the cars wouldn't buckle. Buckle off. Go flying on. And they said,

76
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,160
 "Okay, well, you know, we're not using these locomotives anymore. We have these big boilers

77
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,000
 in them that power the locomotives. Is there any chance these are going to rupture?" And they're

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,040
 like, "No, no, no. These are designed to be rupture proof." So I think you know where this story is

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,120
 going. Because William Crush came up with the name, that's why they decided to call the town Crush.

80
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,560
 It was... The town was basically set up where the two trains would collide. And it didn't have...

81
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
 They didn't like build buildings like... They didn't build like a whorehouse and a saloon and

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,240
 stuff like that. It was just people came out in big tents and it turned into a huge event. Like,

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,160
 you had carnival rides. You had events, which is what I have written down in my notes. So just

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,040
 fill in the blank what events are going on. There's events. And as much people showed up. And when I

85
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,880
 say a bunch of people, 40,000 people showed up. For this one day, Crush, Texas became the second

86
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,320
 biggest city in Texas. Now, the trains are only going 45 miles an hour. So 40,000 people are there.

87
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,840
 Of course, there is going to be a journalist there. And they took some notes of what was going on.

88
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:28,480
 Two trains... I guess no one is blowing the whistle. Because no one is on the train. But anyways,

89
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,720
 the two trains are coming at each other. The 40,000 people are standing around. Little kids

90
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,120
 holding balloons. People playing events. The two trains collide. And then here we go with this is

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,080
 a quote from one of the eyewitness accounts, the journalist. A crash, a sound of timbers,

92
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,960
 rent and torn, and then a shower of splinters. So the wood on the train just... That wasn't all.

93
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,080
 There was just this back to the quote here. There was just a swift instance of silence.

94
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,960
 And then if controlled by a single impulse, both boilers exploded simultaneously and the air was

95
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,400
 filled with flying missiles of iron and steel, varying in size from a postage stamp to half of

96
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,000
 a driving wheel. So yeah, the boilers that were built to withstand rupture, both ruptured at the

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,640
 same time. So the two trains... And they expected there to be splinters and stuff coming off. They

98
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,640
 expected there to be some debris. And that was one of the things that people kept wanting to get

99
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,800
 closer and closer to the tracks. And they had to have guards there to kind of like push them away.

100
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:36,240
 But they didn't factor in. They basically built two giant IEDs. And they just... When the boilers

101
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,000
 exploded at the same time in the two different trains, it basically vaporized the trains. Huge

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,840
 chunks of metal, huge chunks of iron shot up into the sky, hundreds of feet into the sky,

103
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,120
 and then began to land. And the crowd panics. Everyone's running. 40,000 people, all trying to

104
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,480
 get as far away from this shower as possible. This is where it gets weird. So all of that stuff,

105
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,160
 you kind of expect it to happen. Now we're going into Topsy-Turvy land because this really beat

106
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,640
 the odds. This is a really bizarre story. So after all of the shrapnel came down, 40,000 people,

107
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,720
 three people killed, six people injured, which is amazing. Which is an amazing act. That's a

108
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,040
 miracle that people weren't just impaled. As people are laying there, some are dead,

109
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:32,640
 six are wounded. The remaining people there, the remaining 39,993 people, roughly. Some go to assist

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,840
 the wounded. Others start picking up pieces of metal and wood as souvenirs. So they just survived

111
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,160
 this horrible event. And now they're just like, oh, look at half a driving wheel worth of steel.

112
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,960
 I'm going to take this home. So you had people bleeding out and other people picking up souvenirs.

113
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,760
 The railway company was like, okay, that was report, it was big news. It's supposed to be this big

114
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,560
 promotional event. Back then, nine people dying was like 10% of the US population. There weren't

115
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,120
 a lot of people back then. So nine people died. They're like, oh my God, flags at half mass.

116
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,080
 This is terrible. The railroad company, the Katie Railroad Company fired William Crush.

117
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,000
 They fired him. They said that was a terrible idea. You got these people killed. We're going to get

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,200
 sued. We're going to lose so much money over this. You're fired. And then when the newspapers started

119
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
 talking about it the next day, they're like, what a horrible accident. Who could have predicted this?

120
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,960
 And there was no blowback on the Katie Railroad. So they hired William Crush back and he worked

121
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,000
 there for another 60 years. It's funny nowadays people get fired from Chipotle for getting caught

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,800
 on video saying we're not going to serve you guys. And this dude killed three people, wounded six more,

123
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,240
 destroyed two trains, and then got hired back the next day. And they're like, don't worry about it.

124
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
 We'll pay those people out. Don't worry about it. Katie actually benefited from the publicity. More

125
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,760
 people knew of that rail line afterwards. So it actually worked out for them. And the weirdest

126
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,800
 part of this whole story is trains kept doing crashes after this. They're like, ah, I guess people

127
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,440
 go to NASCAR races and airplane shows and stuff like that and people blow up. But it's just weird

128
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,440
 that it was just kind of, it was like, the world reacted to it as it was like a tragedy. There was

129
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
 a lot of news articles on it, but then they're just like, oh, let's just keep doing it. Super

130
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,600
 bizarre. That obviously, first off, nowadays they would never do the train crash without like 100

131
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,240
 safety protocols in place. An environmental protection agency coming out and being like,

132
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
 well, you know, if this train wheel goes off this way, it's going to roll over a frog. You

133
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,560
 can't do that. And if it had, if it had these results, then everyone would get sued and everyone

134
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,520
 would disappear. It's just crazy. But anyway, yeah, I thought it was a weird story. So let's go

135
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,560
 ahead and move on to our next story. Now it doesn't involve brain juice and it doesn't involve train

136
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,200
 crashes, but it involves something so horrific. Now podcast listeners, you're going to be spared

137
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,560
 the photos, but the photos are going to be linked in the show notes. So you can go check them out.

138
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,040
 You're going to have to just go off my description of what these photos are for now. And then if

139
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,240
 you want to torture yourself later, click the links below. So let's get into it. There's a group of

140
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:14,800
 guys in Seattle that are into bodybuilding. Now when I say bodybuilding, I'm not talking about

141
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,560
 spending four hours in the gym, you know, trying to achieve the perfection of the human body,

142
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,600
 or trying to beat your strength records, or, you know, working out with your buddy and trying to

143
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,560
 one up each other. These guys are into the morphine of the human form into basically a caricature of

144
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,720
 what a man should look like. These guys look like cartoon characters. They look like somebody drew

145
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,240
 them. And I'm not saying there's I could be like, that guy looks like he was drawn by Todd McFarland.

146
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,280
 I mean, like look at the chiseled chest. Look at those amazing calves. They don't look like that.

147
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,120
 They look like a doodle. They're just these weird, they look weird. They have thin hips,

148
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,800
 and kind of a thin waist and like a really big cartoony chest and balls the size of a cantaloupe.

149
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,760
 So you go, okay, well, I know you can lift weights to get like a big chest. And you can do leg thing,

150
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,480
 get big legs. What exercises do you do to get balls the size of a cantaloupe? There aren't any.

151
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,920
 They started off by the all allegations, but they started off by injecting themselves with saline

152
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,920
 into the balls. So to like, like swell up. Then eventually the saline, I guess leaks or leaks

153
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,040
 on your Thanksgiving dinner. The saline is a temporary solution. So we have this group of guys

154
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,600
 that are into body modification to look like big, big old cartoon characters. They look like Steven

155
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,080
 Universe's dad. That's probably the best way I can describe it. If you've ever watched that show,

156
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,760
 I watched it one season because I was with a girl who was into it, but it was okay.

157
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,200
 You know, it was okay. But they look like Steven Universe's dad. They look like cartoon characters.

158
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,960
 So what happened was last year, one of these guys says, you know what, the saline's not cutting it

159
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:07,280
 for me. My balls, I want them to be huge. Let's get some silicone and inject them into my balls.

160
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:14,720
 Get big old, big old permanent testicles. And so he ends up going to a black market silicone

161
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,560
 injector, a young man known as Joe Quater. So Peter Dovac was the bodybuilder guy part of this group.

162
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,640
 And Joe Quater was the guy who did the injections. In 2017, Peter Dovac gets his testicles inflated

163
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,160
 with silicone. So they're the size of a coconut. And some of the silicone gets into his bloodstream,

164
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,080
 gives him an embolism, dies. The guy who injected it, Joe Quater,

165
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:48,720
 he was then going to be charged with manslaughter so he killed himself. Now there's probably about

166
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:58,560
 like six or seven guys in this group. So then now we're in the year 2018, on October 15th,

167
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,000
 Tank Hafertappen. Hafertappen is part of this group. And he goes, you know what,

168
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,200
 I gotta get them the big testicles. I don't know where he goes. He went to another black

169
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:19,040
 market silicone injector, injected with silicone, has an embolism, again, same thing, goes into a coma,

170
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,160
 dies. And all these guys are younger than me. I think they're in their 20s or their 30s.

171
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:32,320
 So this group of bodybuilders and big ball people is led by a guy known as Dylan Hafertappen.

172
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:40,000
 Dylan Hafertappen. Or he also goes by the name noodles and beef. Noodles and beef. So it's funny,

173
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,480
 the story I just told you, I was talking to one of my bosses at work. And I said, did you hear

174
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,680
 about that cult up in Seattle, you know, the bodybuilders? And she's like, no. And I was like,

175
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,200
 yeah, they, they do steroids apparently, or they work out all the time, but they're like,

176
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,920
 look like cartoon characters. And she's like, really? I was like, yeah. And then like,

177
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,200
 they get their balls and large of silicone and they're a couple of them had died. She's like,

178
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,080
 really? I go, yeah, and the guy in charge is called noodles and beef. And she goes, you're making that

179
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,280
 up. Like that's the part of the story she had a problem with noodles and beef. And to be fair,

180
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,240
 that is the worst nickname you could ever pick. That is the most unappetizing, you get to pick

181
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,160
 your own nickname. That's the one thing you get to do in life. Maybe other people give you a nickname,

182
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,120
 but generally, I guess you don't get to pick your own nickname, but the you get to pick your online

183
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,720
 alias. Let's put it that way, you kind of get to pick your avatar. Noodles and beef is what is in the

184
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,480
 toilet after you throw up. That is the most unappetizing three words possibly put together.

185
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,320
 Other than brain juice, Thanksgiving, noodles and beef is completely disgusting. But that's the name

186
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,200
 this guy goes by. He was married to Tank. That's why Tank shared the last name. And he has these,

187
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,280
 this group of guys, Tank was one of them, Peter was one of them, and a couple other ones, they all

188
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:01,760
 are just really big guys. And they're his pups. Now, those are all the facts of the story. Now

189
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,640
 we're going to get into the allegations. Tank's mom lives in Australia, and she got a call saying

190
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,640
 her son had died. And she was besides herself. She couldn't believe that her son was in a coma,

191
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,560
 that she didn't know, that she's like I would have flown out there to see him. They did a program

192
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,120
 in Australia where they profiled the mother. And she's like, look at these pictures of my son growing

193
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,280
 up. He looks like a normal person. Here are the photos of him after he went to Seattle and was

194
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,800
 hanging out with Dylan. He looks grotesque. Like he just looks like this cartoon character. He's

195
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,840
 super big. What did Dylan do to my son? What was going on here? She ends up saying, Dylan,

196
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,680
 will you please bring me my son's ashes? And Dylan's like, yeah, of course. And she had a news crew

197
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,360
 hiding in her house, like straight to catch a predator type of stuff. Dylan pulls up with his two

198
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,240
 business associates. They didn't look like they were his pups. They walk into the house with

199
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,000
 the ashes. And the mom sits down. I can't imagine a mother being brought her son's ashes. I can't

200
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,400
 imagine, and she had like her mother there and a couple other relatives. But I can't imagine the

201
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,440
 horror and the sadness that was going through her to have her son, like she saw her son, and now

202
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,280
 he's she's seen a container of him. And Dylan immediately realizes there's cameras around.

203
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,120
 He's like, what are these? And the woman's like, no, don't pay attention to those. Just sit down.

204
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,040
 Let's talk. And the mother just rips him for a straight five minutes. What did you do to my son?

205
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,040
 You know, you could should have could have called me. My son used to look normal. You tortured

206
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:42,160
 him mentally. You did all this horrible stuff. And before tank died, tank had a $200,000

207
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,000
 inheritance. Tank's brother is autistic. And when the father died, he split the inheritance in half.

208
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,880
 So 200,000 to take 200,000 to the autistic brother. And the idea was kind of what the deal was,

209
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,400
 was that if one of them passed away, the $200,000 would go to the other one. That seemed to be

210
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:08,080
 the deal. But before he died, tank changed his will. So Dylan got the $200,000. Now, to be fair,

211
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,400
 I think Dylan did not know about that. I think he knew that tank had changed the will, but they

212
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,600
 were married. But I don't necessarily think Dylan had him murdered or did anything like that for

213
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,920
 the $200,000. I don't think that's that's a true part of the story that I don't think that's a

214
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,680
 completely I think that's a complete allegation. I don't and even the mother wasn't necessarily

215
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,800
 saying you had him killed or anything like that. I think that was just a coincidence. It would make

216
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,640
 sense when you get married to change your will. But anyway, she was like, you tortured my son,

217
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,080
 you made him feel like he was trash, all this stuff. And eventually Dylan's like, you know what,

218
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,200
 I'm done. I'm out of here and he left. But when the mother said that Dylan had mentally tortured

219
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:55,040
 her son, that he had caused him anguish, that's because tank would post stuff online about how

220
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,640
 he was tormented by Dylan. And of course, Dylan denies everything. Dylan's like, I never, this is

221
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,000
 not true. This isn't true. I never said this. This is what tank is saying happened when he was still

222
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,880
 alive. So tank posted this thing called pup rules, which was a list of all of the rules

223
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,960
 that the followers of noodles and beef must do. You want to talk about a cult if these

224
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 allegations are true, this is what you would see in some sort of cult document. Now again,

225
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,240
 tank posted this and we don't know we can't talk to him and Dylan denies it but tank did post this

226
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,320
 stuff. So we just have to say that, you know, this is what tank posted. Here's some of the rules.

227
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,480
 This one, this one's about the mind. A pup will profess his love, his loyalty, and his devotion

228
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,720
 to his master at all opportunities he can. As a pup progresses deeper into his subspace,

229
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,680
 a pup may find his ability to create words and coherent sentences is diminished.

230
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,000
 Whimperine and I should say now all these dudes are gay. I don't know if that was implied,

231
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,400
 but this is they're all the Dylan was banging these dudes and maybe they were banging each other,

232
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,440
 but this is a total fetish thing. Okay, I just figured that I was like me, I didn't address that.

233
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,120
 Okay, so back to this. The ability to create words and coherent sentences is diminished.

234
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,320
 Whimpering and grunting are usually considered adequate substitution. But again, Dylan's like,

235
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,400
 no, I never never never wrote that. This is all I have nothing to do with that. I just am banging

236
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,240
 these dudes and I'm in love with these guys and it sucks that they died. Back to this pup rules.

237
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,120
 While a master has some responsibility in guiding his pup into his subspace,

238
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,760
 it is the primary responsibility of the pup to guide himself forever deeper into his subspace.

239
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,280
 The slave will strive diligently to remold the slave's body, activities, habits,

240
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,400
 actions, and attitudes in accordance to his master's desires. A pup has no sense of value or identity

241
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,440
 outside of that which is given to him by his master. When a pup does wrong or finds fault in

242
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,800
 himself, he is to internalize his flaws, dwell upon them, and then take all corrective actions he

243
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,160
 can to improve himself for his master. How many cults have we covered on this show? We had the

244
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:17,120
 cult in Brazil, the colonial dignidad, we had the restoration for the Ten Commandments in Africa.

245
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,040
 We've done a few. And this is this type of stuff, this self-flagellation is very, very common in

246
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,360
 these groups. Colonial dignidad was the German cult that was all about order and that

247
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,120
 guy was a chameleister, he was totally nuts, but it was all about like order and creating order in

248
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,560
 this paradise and things like that. And then you have groups that are about bringing about the will

249
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,040
 of God, we have groups that are about... and I'm talking about what they say they're about,

250
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,040
 not what they're actually about, it's all about power and money, but you have these cults that

251
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,600
 some are about bringing the Lord's work into the world, some of them are about taking on the

252
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,400
 non-believers, some of them are about preparing for the apocalypse. This one is sex-based. This is

253
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:04,080
 100% sex-based cult. They didn't have any plans of enlightenment or religious freedom or it's

254
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,840
 us against them, they're all just banging each other. It can... cults can really happen anywhere.

255
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,200
 Now this is where it got... so Tank wrote this or posted this and he, you know, he was saying that

256
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,680
 this what Dylan wrote, Dylan denies it, but this is the type of stuff the mother saw and was like

257
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,640
 my son's being tormented. And this is the part that is where it gets iffy with the silicone.

258
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,080
 Dylan's saying they did it on their own and the allegations are that he asked them or told them

259
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,560
 to go do it and that will be decided in a court of law and because I don't know honestly. He could

260
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,600
 just be talking about it so much and they go, "You know what? I really love my master, I'm going to

261
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,080
 go get this done," because they have tattoos that say property of Dylan or property of noodles and

262
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,240
 beef, one of the two. And he goes, "I never asked them to get that. They got that on their own."

263
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,600
 This is where we get into the body part. Master has explicit body goals for his pup regarding

264
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,560
 their weight, their muscle mass, their measurements, and their proportions. The pup will make all

265
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,080
 efforts possible to ensure these goals are realized and should never feel satisfied until his master

266
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,680
 is satisfied. There is always additional room for a pup to push their physical limits. Additionally,

267
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,120
 a pup will submit to all orders for body modifications including piercings, tattoos,

268
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,280
 scrotal, saline inflation, as well as body growth supplements including steroids and HGH

269
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,840
 in accordance to the wishes of the master. So according to this, it specifically says the

270
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,720
 saline, the temporary stuff. So that will protect Dylan to a point. He goes, "Hey man, I just told

271
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,000
 him to get saline injected into their balls instead of silicone." I think when you turn people

272
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,720
 into fetishes, when you turn people into sex objects, now people go, "Oh Jason, you objectified

273
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,120
 that woman because you said, 'Man, damn, look at, dude, she's hot.' Fine, whatever, I objectified her."

274
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,400
 But this, I don't go and then ask her, "Hey baby, become a bridesmaid and put on 40 pounds."

275
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,200
 There's objectification and then there's turning people into a literal fetish doll,

276
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:17,360
 into a object just for your sexual pleasure. Now, it is interesting, as I was reading into this,

277
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,920
 they said, "The thing with the silicone is that it looks completely disgusting." And you're like,

278
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,800
 "Well, of course, Jason, their balls are the size of a newborn baby. It is going to look disgusting,

279
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,880
 but it goes far than that." There was an expert, I was reading an article and they said, "You notice

280
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,760
 when these people get these silicone injections, they're always wearing clothes over their balls."

281
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,440
 Because this isn't, these aren't the first two people in the world who have had this done.

282
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,120
 The one guy made a living doing black market silicone injections. This stuff happens,

283
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,120
 people get it into their butt and they die, people get it into their scrotum, sometimes you live,

284
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,880
 sometimes you die. But this expert was saying they look absolutely disgusting, they look distended

285
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,840
 and veiny and all sorts of gross stuff. So when you put clothes on, if you're into this gigantic

286
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,200
 proportion body, you can put a clothes on it, wear like a tight bikini bottom and you're like,

287
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,680
 "Whoa, look at that giant nut sack, that's awesome." That's, I'm not saying that, that's

288
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,680
 the voice of somebody who's saying that, but when you take the clothes off, they, it looks gross,

289
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,640
 looks grosser than you would imagine, cantaloupe size testicles to look. Because it's just distended

290
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,920
 and lumpy, it's just not supposed to be down there. Silicone does tend to lump up. So, you know,

291
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,400
 it'll be interesting to see. There's other resources out there where Tank told these stories

292
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,120
 that about him being talked down to by Dylan, but again, it's hard to tell. You know, Dylan's

293
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,440
 denying all of it and Tank is dead, he can't answer Tony of it. We just can kind of go through

294
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,480
 posts and texts he sent to people here and there, people have kind of pieced it together. I don't

295
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,560
 think Dylan is liable for any criminal acts. I think he is totally protected to say,

296
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,560
 I never told them to get this stuff done. It will be interesting to see if he's open to civil

297
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:07,520
 action, because you, that takes a lower threshold of evidence and the mom may end up suing him and

298
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,240
 saying, I have this digital footprint of these things and I'm holding you responsible. That may

299
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:22,880
 happen, but when you, there's just that power dynamic, you have a very dynamic leader and then

300
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,920
 you have these men doing anything to please their leader. And then that's fairly common

301
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:38,160
 in cults and groups like that. But it'll be interesting to see if anything changes from this.

302
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:45,040
 If noodles and beef says, you know what, everyone get big, but don't do the, don't do the ball stuff.

303
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:52,720
 I always think it's weird when people focus on sex first and their life just begins to

304
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,600
 revolve around that. Like it's fun and all, but when it becomes, when you're basically like

305
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,400
 breaking yourself down and going into the subspace of a pup where it's okay to just whine and

306
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:12,080
 gurgle noises and inflate your body and get giant testicles and break down your mental and physical

307
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,960
 body to please someone else, when that's all you are, when all you are is the fetish, that's when

308
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,080
 it's really easy to get sucked up into this stuff. And from all appearance, I forgot what

309
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
 Tank's real name was honestly, but from all the parents, that wasn't Tank's not his real name,

310
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,160
 from all appearances Tank was just like a normal kid growing up in Australia who met noodles and

311
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,680
 beef online and then came out here and just fell in love, fell in love with noodles and beef,

312
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:46,000
 fell in love with the transformation and fell in love with pushing his body so hard to please

313
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,600
 his master that it ended up killing him. That's an easy trap to fall into. And I know the question

314
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,240
 you guys are all wondering. Jason. Okay, a bunch of guys got their balls inflated with silicone,

315
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,560
 really what's the difference between a guy doing a gay guy doing or a straight guy doesn't matter,

316
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,680
 what's the difference between a guy doing that and a girl getting a boob job?

317
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,240
 And I have the perfect answer for you.
