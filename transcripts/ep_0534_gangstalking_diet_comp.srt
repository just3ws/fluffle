1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Three children out flying a kite see something unusual.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Is it a UFO? Or something far worse?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we go back to the world of gangstalking.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 To take a look at the story of a man who said he lost ten pounds of muscle in three days.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Due to gangstalkers.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Either that, or he is seriously, seriously ill.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm a walk big doll.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hope you guys had a great weekend.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hope you guys had lots of fun this weekend, whatever you like to do.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I hope you guys did it.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 As long as it's not robbing banks, as long as you're not like,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 "Oh man, I really need a break from all this stress."

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Down the ski mask.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 You don't even need ski masks anymore.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The world we live in, you just walk into a bank wearing a mask.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Oh, those lucky bank robbers.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Max the Head.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Max the Head, thank you so much for supporting the show.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 You know, I'm gonna say this too, sorry to interrupt your introduction here.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Max, Max the Head's icon is Max Hedrum.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I'm gonna do a quick Dead Rabbit Recommends, guys.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 If you have not seen the television show, Max Hedrum,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 you are missing out.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 It is pure, like, 1986 bizarre Blade Runner sci-fi.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 It's so ahead of its time.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It told a future where there was more than three channels on the air.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 There was a thousand channels!

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And back when we were watching it, we're like,

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 "Whoa, a thousand channels? You can watch whatever you want on television."

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's dope, dude. Max Hedrum's really good.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I watched it as a kid.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And then I watched it again in the early 2000s.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I got it on DVD.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 It's really good if you haven't seen Max Hedrum yet.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Check it out.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 20 Minutes Into the Future is when that show takes place.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And I remember as a kid that blew me away.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 That was like one of those concepts.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I was like, "Whoa."

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Like, you'll never be to that point.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Really, really great cyberpunk television show.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 So thank you, Max the Head, for reminding me of that great show.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And I hope you guys do check out Max Hedrum.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But Max, that advertisement aside, maybe it's the real Max Hedrum who's supporting the show.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 That advertisement aside, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's okay too.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Totally understand.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Just help spread the word about the show.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That helps out so, so much.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So Max Hedrum, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to toss you the keys.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 We're going to start off in the--

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 You know what? Let's use the hair hang glider.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I think we've used that once before.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And there was a reason why we stopped using it.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 It was a stupid name.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 But Max, let's go ahead.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 You're going to fly this hang glider.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We're just all going to hold on to your feet and then someone holds on to my feet.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And we make a chain of podcast pals flying through the sky.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We are headed out to Capina Grande do Sol.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 That's in Brazil.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 When you see a ravine in front of us, go ahead.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 We're going to land on the ground.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Obviously we're not going to land in the cloud.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 We're not care bears.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 We're going to land on the ground and we're going to stand behind a rock.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 We're going to watch this action that's about to take place.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It's May 4th, 1997.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 It's a sunny spring day.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 We see three young boys flying a kite.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Look at this.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 This is so awesome.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 It's what everyone says in the first two minutes.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 They use a kite and then they're like, "I'm bored. Let's go watch Transformers."

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 They're flying this kite.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But three people flying one kite is a recipe for disaster.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 It gets tangled up in a tree and they're like, "Oh, shucks. Let's go untangle that."

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Apparently it's the three stooches.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 It's the three stooches' kids.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 "Oh, you wise guy. You got the kite tangled up."

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 They go over to the tree to untangle the kite.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Now the tree is at the edge of a ravine.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 They're over there and they're getting rid of it and untangle it.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 One of them goes, "Hey, hey, look, look."

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Points down at the ground and there's a dead chicken.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Now it's gross, right?

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Nobody likes seeing dead animals.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But these kids, they're a little savvy.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 It's not like this chicken had a heart attack or something like that.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And it's not like a chicken bone. It's a dead chicken.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And they're savvy enough to know in this area that chicken just didn't fall over dead.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 That chicken was most likely killed during some sort of ritual.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 This is what the kids surmise.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 So they don't really even pay that much attention to it.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 It's so common to them.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 They're like, "Oh, someone was casting a spell here."

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 "No, don't pay attention to that. Help me untangle this kite."

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And as they're getting the kite untangled from the tree,

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 all of a sudden something catches their attention coming out of the afternoon sky.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 They see a cloud descending.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 They said it looked like a trunk.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It was like a tree trunk just coming down from the sky slowly.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Now the dead chicken, spooky, but normal.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 That isn't normal. That isn't normal.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It's not mist coming down.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's not a little late afternoon fog.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 It's a cloud shaped like something clouds aren't normally shaped like.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And it's moving towards them.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So they're like, "Forget the kite. We can buy a new kite."

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 "We can't buy new lives."

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 They start running.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And at this point, two of the boys, the third boys,

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 "Yeah, he's gone, right? He's the smartest of the three."

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Two of them turn around and they go, "Okay, we've cleared the ravine."

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 "We're no longer, the clouds no longer coming by us."

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 "It looks like the clouds actually going to go into the ravine."

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 They turn around and they look and they see inside of the cloud

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 a humanoid who's completely brown.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Like someone took the silhouette of a human,

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 cut out all the detail and just colored it in with a brown crown.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Two boys look at each other.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Third boys already getting lemonade back at home.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 The two boys are looking at each other and this cloud is descending.

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 They see this figure inside this cloud and the cloud actually disappears

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 from the horizon.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 So now it's actually in the ravine.

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 They can't see the cloud anymore, but they figure it's continuing to the ravine floor.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And that's when they hear the terrified screams of a man echo from the ravine.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 The two boys turn, they run, and they don't stop until they reach their house.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 It's an interesting story.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It was from Carlos Alberto Mercado.

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I got the story from thinkaboutadox.com, which is a great repository of stuff.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 They got it from Carlos Alberto Mercado.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 What does this story mean?

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 You could take it as its face, which is a UFO.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 A vehicle descending from the sky into the ravine.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Had an occupant.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It was literally a UFO.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 They couldn't figure out what it was.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 It was cloud shaped.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 You have this humanoid inside of it.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 UFO descending and some guy was just in the ravine camping having a good old time.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 He saw a kite up there.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 He was going to retrieve later.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And then all of a sudden this alien got him.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I actually think the story is far more sinister than that.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Let's suppose this.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 The chicken was actually part of a ritual.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 This man was attempting to call forth some sort of not alien being, but a supernatural

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 being.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And this creature descended to earth and the ritual went bad.

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And the terrified screams that they heard wasn't a man being surprised by an alien visitor.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It was a man who realized in the final moments of his life that he was messing with forces

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 far out of his control.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 The story of magic going wrong like that is ageless.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's always been around.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 There's very few times where we've come across stories where people see it.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Where you have outside observers seeing it.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 YouTube's full of videos of teenagers or preteens playing with Ouija boards and then one of

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 their eyes turn black.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 They're all, "Ugh!"

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I mean, obviously that's fake, right?

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Oh, it's Ryan's fake, right?

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Because they're super spooky.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 For the most part, for the most part those are fake.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 To have someone actually possibly have viewed a ritual gone wrong and seen this supernatural

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 creature appear and basically punish the magic user for either getting the spell wrong, for

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 asking for something that couldn't be fulfilled, or just to punish humanity for their hubris.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Who knows.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 There's also a chance that a chicken had a heart attack and a UFO showed up.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 But I think it's creepier to think of a magic spell gone wrong.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And probably an undiscovered body at the bottom of that ravine.

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Now just bleached bones.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 The story was 23 years ago.

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Just a man went missing in the area, a local man who thought he knew the secrets of the

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 universe.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And then when he went missing one day, people were too scared to find out what really happened

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 to him.

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Max, I'm going to turn to you and I'm going to toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 We're leaving behind this ravine really fast, right?

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 In case this cloud comes after us.

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Hurry up, get in the carpenter copter.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 We're flying off.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Chicken's running.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 This other chicken's like, "No, no, save me, save me."

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 We wave into us.

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 We saved the chicken before that one.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 That was the cousin of the chicken who was dead.

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 We couldn't do anything for him.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 We're eating his cousin.

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 We take that ritualized, sacrificed chicken.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 We're all eating it.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 This is delicious, the cousin chicken.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It's like, "Yeah, yeah, I'd eat it too.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I'm pretty hungry if I was a cannibal.

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I'd eat him too."

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 We're leaving behind Brazil.

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 We are headed back to the United States.

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 So while we're flying out to America, let's talk about gangsta-- a quick overview on gangstaulking.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I actually have a ton of episodes that do on gangstaulking, but I want to space them out.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I want to space them out.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 You can only take so much insanity in a given two-week period.

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 They've been spread out every two weeks.

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Now, I recently got an email from Jimmy Moore, a longtime supporter of the show, a long-time listener.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And he actually said, "You know, it's funny because people will poo-poo gangstaulking,

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 but there is proof that it exists.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And you know what?

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 He's 100% right.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And I think we need to make a distinction between gangstaulking in practice and the conspiracy theory known as gangstaulking.

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The conspiracy theory known as gangstaulking is you are a normal individual who, for whatever reason, you're just chosen to be stalked.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 As opposed to this, let me read you this.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Jimmy Moore sent me an article.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 It was written by Dominic Tierney for The Atlantic.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And he's talking about, in this article, he's talking about the Stasi, the East German secret police that were around when Russia controlled the Iron Curtain and all that stuff.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Let me read you one of the things that the Stasi was doing to its own citizens.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 "The idea was to chip away at a dissident sanity so that he would lose the will to resist, or in the words of the Stasi guide, provoke and enforce internal conflicts and contradictions within hostile negative forces

223
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 that fragment, paralyze, disorganize and isolate the opponent.

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 The first step in a campaign was to identify the target's weak spots, then strike them over and over.

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Stasi agents might break into a dissident's apartment and move the pictures around, or change the time on the alarm clock.

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 They might mail a sex toy to a target's wife."

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 She's like, "Oh, no, the Stasi must have sent this."

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 She has like giant boutique bags.

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 She just went to the sex toy store.

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I was walking on the street, they put it in my hands.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 They might mail a sex toy to a target's wife or send postcards from an unknown woman demanding child support.

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And then they have a few more examples.

233
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 That totally happened.

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Totally happened.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 If you owe money to a gang, they're going to send several people to find out where you are at.

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 They are gang stalking you.

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But Creek Mob in Sacramento isn't going to break in your house and change the clock on your alarm.

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 You hope that's all that happens, right?

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 When you owe money.

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 That's not what's going to happen.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 If not the secret police, if the normal police, just the regular police, think you're up to something, they're going to put you under surveillance.

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 You may be up to something.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 You may not be up to something.

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 You may be up to something, but they think you're up to something else.

245
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Police are going to put you under surveillance for a long enough time, gather some evidence, and then either arrest you based on that evidence, or not arrest you.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Maybe arrest you for something else based on some other evidence.

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Maybe let the case go.

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Who knows?

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 But that's all real stuff.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And the key point in that Stasi article is they use the term dissident.

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 These are people that were either fighting the East German government or were believed to have been fighting the East German government.

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 There's a difference between that, and thank you Jimmy.

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Thank you very much for sending that, because it's absolutely fascinating.

254
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 There's a difference between that type of activity and this.

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 In October, they're going to have a UN meeting about cyber torture and electronic torture.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 This guy's given this presentation, Dr. Melzer, Dr. Nils Melzer, is going to give a presentation saying, "We need to stop thinking of torture as just breaking people's teeth, beating people up, breaking bones, stuff like that.

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 We need to start thinking of non-touch torture."

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Which is true, right?

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Which is true.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 The gangstalking communities jumped all over this, because they're like, "Oh, it's our time to shine. We can get in the UN."

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Do governments use torture against people?

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Sure. Do governments spy on their citizens?

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Sure.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 This is the difference here.

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 This is the difference between the Stasi dissident story and this.

266
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 This letter was actually submitted to Dr. Melzer's group to the UN, to the United Nations.

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Let me read you part of this here.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 "Over the last several years, the illegal torture program has become more psychosocial.

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 This happens to me every day, but a good example is several months ago, I was driving in a Home Depot parking lot."

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Just you viewers will know this is the second time gangstalking at Home Depot have intersected. It's weird.

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Two completely random stories both take place in a Home Depot parking lot.

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 That's a conspiracy theory worth looking into.

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 "When I was driving in a Home Depot parking lot, I stopped my vehicle to let a pedestrian cross.

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 The gentleman raised his arm to thank me. Exactly then my eye was electronically harassed, aka shocked.

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 This gentleman did not have a magic finger or a specialized cell phone.

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Rather, it was remote neural monitoring that Elon Musk and then it goes on to what Elon Musk is inventing."

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 That's the difference.

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Stasi breaking in, trying to mess with you psychologically, sending your wife sex toys.

279
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 You're trying to like, "Oh man, I wish Stasi was around nowadays."

280
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 No, you don't.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 That's different.

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Being under observation by the police, having a gang actually stalk you to get their money back,

283
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 is different than driving through Home Depot and, I mean, oh, it's funny because it makes you paranoid.

284
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I'm not paranoid that I'm being gangstalked.

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I'm more paranoid now that when I'm walking down the street and like there's a fly on my belly and I scratch it,

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 somebody's going to think I'm one of the enemy.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And I don't care. I mean, whatever you come after me, I'm going to beat the hell out of you, right?

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 But I don't even want to be on these people's radar.

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So that's the difference. That's the difference.

290
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 There is actual gangstalking out there.

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 There are people who are stalked by more than one individual.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It does happen.

293
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 It's either state-controlled or it's private citizens, i.e. organized crime.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 They're not waving to you.

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Get your eyeball checked out, bro.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Like, that is you having to get your eyeball checked out, right?

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 He does not have a neural link.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Elon Musk did not mail this dude.

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He's like, "Hey, go to Home Depot. You go to Home Depot, right?"

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 You just walk back and forth across the crosswalk all day long, right?

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Okay, so that's all you're going to do.

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 We're going to pay you just for eight hours to walk back and forth.

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Eventually, someone's going to need to get some nails.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Apparently, targeted individuals love Home Depot for some bizarre reason.

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And when you see someone, you're going to shock their eyeball.

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Get your eyeball checked out.

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 What's more likely that you're having a physical problem with your eyeball

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 or that Elon Musk invented something and gave to a dude at Home Depot to shock you?

309
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 What is more likely?

310
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Going from that, going from that, Max, let's land this carboner copter in this parking lot.

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 We really got to look at what's more likely.

312
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I'm not saying it's always the answer.

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 It's probably more likely in that first story it was a UFO,

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 or it's more likely the kids were making it up, right?

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 That's the most likely conclusion.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 But then it would be, you know, UFO or whatever.

317
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 So I get not always going to the most likely.

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 But if it involves my physical body, I'm like, "Oh my God, I got pain in my chest and my arm.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 My left arm's going numb. Looking around for anyone waving high to me.

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Must be the stasi."

321
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 There's a guy who posted a video on YouTube recently.

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And he's trying to inform the world.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 "Warn us, really? Warn us about the dangers of Dr. Pepper."

324
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Now we all know the dangers of Dr. Pepper.

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It's super disgusting.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It tastes like prune juice.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 It was invented to give you diarrhea.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 It's the grossest of all soft drinks.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 It's the Arby's of carbonated beverages.

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But that's not why he's warning us.

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It shouldn't be. I just did.

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 He's warning us because he has this bottle of Dr. Pepper.

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And he's showing us that you can tell that this is counterfeit Dr. Pepper.

334
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 This isn't real. This isn't the real disgusting stuff.

335
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 He can tell because it actually tastes good this time.

336
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 He's like, "Hmm, that's weird. I want another sip of this."

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Something must be afoot.

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 He's showing us this bottle of Dr. Pepper.

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And he said, "You can tell that it's fake because they put on the label by hand."

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 He goes, "When you buy authentic Dr. Pepper from the factory, labels are on perfectly."

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 But if you buy Dr. Pepper and the label is kind of like...

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 You know where the label on the 20-ounce bottle should be specific?

343
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 The 20-ounce bottle has that plastic label on it?

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 He says, "Look, you can tell where it's kind of messed up and stuff like that."

345
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He goes, "That's because this isn't actually Dr. Pepper. Somebody else did this."

346
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Now, first off, I want to say, I want to criticize the gangstalking community.

347
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 There's a way more efficient way to make counterfeit Dr. Pepper.

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 You leave the normal label on, you empty out the bottle, and then put the stuff in.

349
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And I'll say this, if you have the ability to give people eye shocks...

350
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Because I know what you're thinking, Jason.

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 If you already have the ability to give people eye shocks by raising your hand, first off,

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 that's a pretty dope superpower.

353
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 But secondly, you could easily put on a cap that looks like it was never opened.

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Because I know that's what you're going to say, "Well, what about the safety label?"

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Or maybe you're like, "Jason, I didn't even think about that."

356
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 You're taking notes.

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 He says that the taste is close, but it's slightly off.

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And he bought two bottles of it.

359
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's like, "Well, I know the gangstalking community is making counterfeit Dr. Pepper.

360
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I'll buy two of them. Double my chances of drinking counterfeit Dr. Pepper."

361
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 That was the normal part.

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 That honestly complaining about the product quality of Dr. Pepper, that's fine.

363
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 But then we have him say, "Normally when I drink them, they turn on the electricity."

364
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 That would be an easy observational thing.

365
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Like you notice, you drink Dr. Pepper, street light turns on.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 You would never make the connection all the times you drank Dr. Pepper and street light didn't turn on.

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 You just remember the times that it did. It's a confirmation bias.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 But he's not even talking about that so much.

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 He's saying that when he drinks this Dr. Pepper, scalar waves are fired at him.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Scalar waves. I had to look it up.

371
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I was vaguely familiar with the term.

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It was something that Tesla either hypothesized or invented.

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It depends on how you feel about it.

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 But it's scalar waves is this technology that's faster than light.

375
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's an energy that's faster than light.

376
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I'm not claiming that these are true because I honestly don't know.

377
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 But the scalar waves are faster than light and they can penetrate anything.

378
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 They can go through walls and tanks and cars and trains and ducks, whatever.

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 So if you hold all those things in front of you, don't worry about it.

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 You're still going to get your scalar waves.

381
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Now he says that so he drinks the Dr. Pepper.

382
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And that's when the electricity turns on and he's shot with these invisible,

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 faster than light waves that are penetrating his body.

384
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 He says that why they're doing this.

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I have to give him credit. He lays this out pretty coherently.

386
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 I don't agree with his conclusions, but he's actually more coherent

387
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 than a lot of targeted individuals are online.

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 He says they're shooting the scalar waves at me.

389
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 That's what's going on. And then what's happening is he is losing weight at a rapid pace.

390
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 He says on the first day he can feel it.

391
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 By the third day he's lost 10 pounds and he goes, "It's not fat.

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I'm losing muscle. I'm losing muscle mass."

393
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 He says that the reason why they're going through all of this trouble,

394
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 giving them counterfeit Dr. Pepper, hitting them with scalar waves,

395
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 turning him skinny in a week is because they're trying to turn him into a gay dude.

396
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 They're trying to turn him gay. Or if you don't like that hypothesis,

397
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 he says, "Or maybe not. Maybe they're just trying to turn me into a woman."

398
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So this whole process is designed to turn this man into either a gay dude or a woman.

399
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 A vast difference between the two, by the way.

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But it doesn't even just end with the Dr. Pepper.

401
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 So let's say he stopped drinking the Dr. Pepper because he went to go eat some donuts.

402
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He's starving. That's one of the things. He goes, "They put it in all the food.

403
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 They put it in all my food. I bought some donuts. They put it in the donuts.

404
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I ate the donuts. I'm getting skinny in a week."

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Turning into a gay man or a woman, I don't know.

406
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 But I haven't eaten in days. All my food is poisoned.

407
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I'm eating this junk food because I can at least see that.

408
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I find out that's poison, too.

409
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 He believes he's doing it to more than just him, but it's just to targeted individuals.

410
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 When we go into the story, they rearrange the shelves

411
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 because there's nothing more efficient than a retail staff, right?

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Haven't you ever walked into a store and everything's perfectly stocked?

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 So the fact that this conspiracy theory banks on retail staff

414
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 being able to change out all the poisoned items

415
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 every time a target individual leaves the store,

416
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 that is the most unbelievable part of it.

417
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 But he's eating donuts. He's drinking Dr. Pepper.

418
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 He says that most of his food is poisoned, but he is allowed.

419
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 He does try to drink Dr. Pepper, and he's definitely eating donuts and stuff like that.

420
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Halfway through this, he reveals he's diabetic.

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So he's having a physical response to eating nothing but sugar.

422
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 That's what's going on here.

423
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 He's actually very, very ill physically.

424
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Really, the reason why he's losing weight.

425
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 The reason why his body probably feels weird when he's drinking, quote, "counterfeit Dr. Pepper."

426
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 He feels like energy is being shot through his body.

427
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 It's probably because he's having some sort of diabetic reaction.

428
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 That's the bizarre crossroads we sit at when we talk about gangstalking.

429
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 There's so much truth involved in it, and then so much bizarreness as well.

430
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 People do get gangstalked by gangs, by police, by corrupt governments,

431
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 or even non-corrupt governments who think you're corrupt.

432
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Keep you under observation.

433
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Corporations wanting to sell you things?

434
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Sell you Dr. Pepper?

435
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 I'm going to get so many ads for Dr. Pepper after recording this episode, and you will too.

436
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And then you have people getting their eyeballs electrocuted at home depot.

437
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Then you have people who are drinking Dr. Pepper and thinking someone is beaming waves into their body.

438
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 That's not true.

439
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 What is true and tragic is that this man is very, very physically ill.

440
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I don't know if he's mentally ill.

441
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I'm not going to say that he's mentally ill, but he's physically ill to lose 10 pounds of muscle in three days.

442
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 To lose 5 pounds of muscles in three days would be alarming.

443
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Indulging in sugary substances because, I mean, if everything's poisoned, why not eat the best tasting poison, right?

444
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 The truth and the fiction are so perfectly layered over each other with gangstalking.

445
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 That's what makes it one of the most dangerous conspiracy theories out there.

446
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Because you can read book after book, steady sheet after steady sheet, article after article talking about,

447
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 surveillance talking about Orwell, talking about secret police, that when you look out your window

448
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 and you see the third white sedan drive through your neighborhood that day, you think you're in that article.

449
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 You think that steady sheet's about you.

450
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You think you are living a life that Orwell predicted.

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 That delusion becomes so great that at the end, you don't trust to go to the doctors.

452
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 You don't trust society when they're saying, "Hey, you don't look good."

453
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 It's so intense. This paranoia is so intense.

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 You don't even trust your own body when it's crying out for help.

455
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Your eyeball shouldn't get shocked.

456
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Your eyeball shouldn't lose muscle every single day.

457
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 But when the conspiracy is all that matters, even your own body may be working against you.
