1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 roads, streets, lanes, alleys.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,780
 You may know these as places to walk, but in the world of the paranormal, they mean

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,480
 so much more than that.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,360
 First off, we're going to take a look at the story of a woman who's walking through

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
 Russia.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,040
 Now that's not abnormal.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,240
 People do it all the time, but this woman is weird.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
 She shouldn't be doing that.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,240
 And then we take a look at a man who's just walking.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,400
 Hold on, let me get through the intro.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,040
 And then we take a look at the story of an old farm out in the middle of nowhere.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:49,600
 They're having a good old time in the Hootenanny until a stranger walks up to the house.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,520
 And then we take a look at a bizarre musical mystery.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,040
 In a folk singer goes missing.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,760
 People think suicide, people think the mob, but to this day, his fans proclaim he was

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,440
 taken by the aliens today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:18,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
 I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,040
 This episode is actually being recorded just minutes after yesterday's episode because

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,000
 I'm getting ready to wrestle a hog and I want to be in fighting shape and I want to have

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,240
 all my episodes recorded in case I get horribly injured.

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,480
 I just have to edit them.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,560
 The recording process is the most problematic part of it because it's where things can

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
 go wrong.

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
 Like the performance can be bad.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880
 The mic can be bad.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,160
 I can run out of things to say all sorts of stuff.

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,000
 So this is the technically the hardest part.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,240
 Once this part's done, I can just hit buttons and edit and then interact with you guys.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 Speaking of interacting with you guys, let me give a shout out starting off right now

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,400
 to our legacy Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command flying Frisbees.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,880
 Throwing Frisbees everywhere.

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,360
 That's what he's into I guess.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
 Paul Martinez.

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,280
 He's hovering on a Frisbee as he's throwing Frisbees around at us.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,840
 He's playing a little bit of that Frosh.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,640
 Paul, you're going to be our captain, our pilot's episode.

40
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,720
 If you guys hate Frisbee Calf or you guys can't spread the Patreon, that's fine too.

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
 Which helps read the word about the show.

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 Really really helps out a lot.

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,480
 You'll also see that it is.

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,640
 Fan Art Friday and today's selection for Fan Art Friday is from Super Awesome Robot.

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,880
 So give everyone a robot clap for the Super Awesome Robot.

46
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
 Thank you so much for Fan Art Friday.

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
 So Paul is now wearing a full-on Tron Legacy outfit.

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,280
 He's now throwing data discs around.

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
 It's super cool.

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
 I now have on my Tron Legacy outfit.

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
 I'm Renzler.

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,480
 But after him Cosplaying is one of the most underrated sci-fi films.

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 Let's go ahead Paul.

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,480
 To toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible, we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,240
 We're headed out to Siberia.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,240
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:19,400
 We were actually just in Russia yesterday.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,240
 You're president, we don't care what happens to you.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,440
 In the construction of this road in Siberia, they estimate between 250,000 to 1 million

60
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,400
 people died building this road.

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,360
 Or as it's known in Soviet Russia, Tuesday.

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,240
 When you were building this road and you died, you basically fell down on the ground.

63
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 Which tends to happen when you die, right?

64
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,720
 But the soil was too frozen to bury you.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,120
 Plus they don't have time.

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,320
 You're building this road, you got deadlines to meet.

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,760
 And it deadlines because everyone's dying to the tchhh.

68
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,280
 Maybe I should have taken more of a break between episodes.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,640
 It's called the Road of Bones because for a while there were bones littering the highway.

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,040
 The government has now apologized for that whole program.

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
 But that was the case.

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
 That's why they called it the Road of Bones.

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,160
 Now it's known as officially the Kol Yema Federal Highway.

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,680
 In 2017, a woman is sighted walking down the road.

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,360
 Again, not unusual.

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,440
 People are allowed to walk down the road all over the place.

77
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,880
 But truck drivers are driving by.

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,920
 See a girl walking on the side of the road.

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,760
 Cars driving by.

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,720
 Girls walking by.

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,880
 Truck drivers are like doing their routes coming back the other way.

82
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,760
 She's still walking.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,720
 Breaker breaker, do you see that young lady walking on the side of the road?

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
 Spooky bear, do you see that?

85
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,840
 Oh yes, pile of bones, pile of bones.

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
 I see that.

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 I'm coming up here.

88
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,160
 This woman is sighted on this road making a 1200 mile walk.

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,480
 She's sighted between Yaksdok and Magadan.

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,880
 Apparently she has made this 1200 mile walk multiple times.

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,200
 Because she's been seen all along the length of it multiple times.

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
 So you're like Jason, is this a phantom?

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,640
 She's in the back seat of Smokey Bear's big rig and then he takes her to the prom and

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
 then they get there and the back seat's empty.

95
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,280
 Nothing but a wet raincoat.

96
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,120
 No, there's a photo of this woman.

97
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,600
 Not a blurry photo late at night.

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,320
 That's the jump scare photo.

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,000
 There's a photo of this woman walking on the street.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,480
 It is a real woman that has been documented.

101
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,240
 The police have actually talked to this woman.

102
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
 What are you doing walking?

103
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,760
 It's a free country, isn't it?

104
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,160
 And their eyes shift from side to side.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,480
 They're like yeah, kind of.

106
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
 Nowadays.

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,880
 50 years ago it wasn't.

108
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
 Things like that.

109
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
 Bugger off.

110
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
 Truck drivers have stopped.

111
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,120
 Hey, you need a ride?

112
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,800
 She doesn't engage with anybody.

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,080
 She'll answer questions for the police because you kind of have to, but she just keeps walking.

114
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,800
 The police go, she's not breaking any laws.

115
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
 You are allowed to walk down the street.

116
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,800
 People who have like, hey, miss, you need a ride, you need a ride.

117
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
 Eventually they think she's mentally ill.

118
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
 They'll grab her.

119
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
 She freaks out.

120
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
 She starts screaming incoherently.

121
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
 You gotta run.

122
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
 You get in your car.

123
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,120
 She's in your back seat with a wet coat.

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,080
 She's strangling you with it.

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
 She's not equipped for winter travel.

126
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,080
 See, if you saw someone in a big park with a sled and a bunch of snow dogs, you'd be

127
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
 like, oh, that's fine.

128
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
 It's a little weird.

129
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
 It's a little weird.

130
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
 It's like holding up traffic.

131
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 But whatever.

132
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
 But she's walking.

133
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,680
 She's wearing, they said she's wearing a white jacket and blue jeans.

134
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,200
 And then she has like on like a coat.

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,120
 Not like a big old GI Joe winter soldier coat.

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
 Just a coat.

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,920
 She's never seen in a populated area.

138
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,680
 And oddly enough, no one has ever seen her eat.

139
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,760
 Which I'm sure she's like going off into the bushes and eating berries and stuff like that.

140
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 Squirrels.

141
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,680
 She's grabbing the rogue squirrel and taking a bite out of it.

142
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,400
 Trucks and cars are seeing her walk all this time.

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
 They've never seen her get to a destination.

144
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,720
 They've never seen her kick her feet up at a McDonald's.

145
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,240
 They have no idea why she's doing this walk.

146
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,720
 She's just seen walking.

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
 She was first reported in 2017.

148
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,960
 The last report I could find was in April of 2018.

149
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,520
 So it had at least a year, if not more.

150
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,720
 She may still be doing it now.

151
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,960
 It's just old news over there.

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 They're like woman walks.

153
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,880
 It's super great news the first time.

154
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
 And now people are like, yeah.

155
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,320
 I got that from the 40 and map too.

156
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,400
 That's a really cool resource.

157
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
 That's going to be in the show notes.

158
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,640
 You guys can look around.

159
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,180
 See if you find anything odd.

160
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,360
 But it's real.

161
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 This isn't a phantom.

162
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,200
 This isn't the ghost of a girl trying to get home after a drunk driving accident.

163
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,760
 This is a real woman walking 1200 miles multiple times through Siberia.

164
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,160
 Photographed and nobody knows why.

165
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,040
 Obviously it's probably some sort of mental illness, but it's just a weird story.

166
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,000
 And it's one of those things that no one will ever know the answer for.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
 We did that one story a long time ago about the guy in France who was just walking through

168
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
 the bushes dressed in a gas mask.

169
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,080
 And everyone is trying to follow him around.

170
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
 And then the newspaper published a story on him and he took all of his gear off and

171
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,040
 left it on a rock and said, now I'm dead.

172
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,480
 So we do have and we covered the flout, the floutest, the guy who was playing the recorder

173
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
 in Brazil.

174
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,360
 We have these weird people kind of hanging out.

175
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,000
 I met Joe Trombone in San Leandro.

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,720
 He's one of the greats.

177
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
 The rapping crazy man who'd get on a bus and rap for you.

178
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,000
 I think these people are always interesting when we run into these anomalies of humankind,

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,880
 people who are outside the edges, but not in like an edgy way.

180
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
 Not like an annoying way.

181
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,400
 Not like the person who's playing my chemical romance at top volume while you're trying

182
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,200
 to talk to the girl at the party.

183
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,240
 Just like in a cool, weird way.

184
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,400
 But this woman might also be into my chemical romance.

185
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
 So stay away.

186
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
 Stay away.

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,760
 If she gets in your vaccine, she reaches for your radio.

188
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,400
 Be prepared for Black Parade for 1200 miles.

189
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
 Listen to that album for 1200 miles.

190
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,400
 Paul, let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy.

191
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
 Let's give her a ride.

192
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
 She wants to ride with us because she's super cool.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
 She has on all the mascara.

194
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,120
 Yes, we will listen to Black Parade for the rest of the journey.

195
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
 The rest of the journey.

196
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,560
 I hope you guys are into that.

197
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,840
 Paul, take us out of Siberia.

198
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,960
 We are headed back to the United States.

199
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,040
 We are specifically going to Canada.

200
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,760
 I don't know if I know what's wrong.

201
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
 But that's near the United States.

202
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,560
 It's the United States little brother.

203
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,720
 We're headed up to Canada.

204
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,600
 Jason Jalopy's driving on the road.

205
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,100
 We get to Camperville.

206
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,440
 That's in Manitoba, Canada.

207
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:18,040
 The year is 1930.

208
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,160
 The winter storm pauses to take a deep breath.

209
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,280
 It's winter.

210
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
 It's late at night.

211
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,240
 The snow is falling.

212
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,720
 It's super cold outside.

213
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,400
 It's below 30 degrees and this family is fast asleep.

214
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,640
 They're wearing their PJs.

215
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,200
 They got their thermal socks on.

216
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,120
 Winter storm is wrapping around the building.

217
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,840
 Outside their dogs are going nuts.

218
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
 The dad wakes up, "Huh?

219
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
 What?

220
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
 What's going on?"

221
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,680
 And he goes and he looks out the window and the dogs are like, "Ugh!"

222
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,000
 They're now no longer barking.

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 They look like they're rabbit.

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,440
 It's just like foam coming out of their mouths.

225
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
 "Ugh!"

226
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,120
 Apparently they also sound like a man.

227
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,160
 The dog sounded like a 44-year-old man trying to record a podcast without waking up his

228
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
 neighbors.

229
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,320
 It was crazy.

230
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
 The dad's standing there.

231
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,040
 The rest of the family is looking through the window and they see a man standing in

232
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,560
 their front yard.

233
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,920
 Now the winter storm is pelting the building with snow.

234
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,240
 And it's also hitting the stranger.

235
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,880
 He's not immune to the weather.

236
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,960
 But he's dressed like he is.

237
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
 He's wearing a tuxedo.

238
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:33,960
 He's just standing out in the snow.

239
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,800
 The dogs are still just out of it.

240
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,280
 So the dad and the older brother, they open the door.

241
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
 "Wheeeeen!"

242
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,400
 "Super, super spooky door!"

243
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,160
 "I need to fix that!"

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,280
 The dad says.

245
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,080
 He walks out with his son.

246
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,440
 And the man is just standing there in the tuxedo.

247
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,560
 "What do you want?

248
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
 What's going on here?

249
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
 Why are you bugging my dogs?

250
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,760
 Why are you making them sound like a 44-year-old man trying to record a podcast late at night?"

251
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,160
 The man just stands there in the snow.

252
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,240
 He's like, "What does that even mean?"

253
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,480
 He's just standing there.

254
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,760
 So the father and his son begin to approach the man and the man takes a step backwards.

255
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,120
 And they get closer to him and he takes another step backwards.

256
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
 And they're like, "Okay, well now it's on.

257
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
 This guy's obviously just kind of being a jerk."

258
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
 And no one walks backward on my property.

259
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
 They keep walking towards him.

260
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,640
 He keeps walking backwards.

261
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,320
 Now he's walking backwards one step at a time.

262
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
 The men speed up.

263
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,480
 They start jogging towards him.

264
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,680
 He continues to take one step back.

265
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,600
 And that's when the men realize, and even the people witnessing this from the house,

266
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,520
 no matter how fast the men move towards this figure, they can never close the distance.

267
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,840
 And the man is constantly just taking one step backwards.

268
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,600
 They're running towards him.

269
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,040
 He takes one step backwards.

270
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,120
 They're still 20 feet away.

271
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,560
 They follow him up to a hill and then they just stop.

272
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,880
 And he's still just walking backwards.

273
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:25,760
 He walks backwards down the road and is soon swallowed by the winter storm.

274
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,640
 That's Dead Rev Radio creepypasta hour.

275
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,280
 Now I actually got that from thinkaboutadox.com.

276
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,480
 They got it from paranormal.com back in June 2003.

277
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,440
 I give a lot of credit to thinkaboutadox.com.

278
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,800
 They report stuff.

279
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,840
 I haven't been led wrong yet.

280
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,760
 So this story does sound a lot like creepypasta.

281
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,960
 I've never heard it before.

282
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
 I think it's really interesting.

283
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
 I think it's a creepy visual.

284
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,840
 Anything that plays with time and space like that.

285
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,920
 It's so funny because when I was reading the story, I imagine him as a tall, lanky guy.

286
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,280
 It doesn't actually say that in the notes.

287
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,560
 Never says that he's tall and lanky, but I think that's just kind of how you get it.

288
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,240
 It's interesting because the only visual description they don't say, and he had a creepy grin and

289
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,480
 real life blood was pouring out of his eyeballs.

290
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,760
 It was just that it was a guy in a tuxedo, which makes it creepier.

291
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,040
 You fill in your own details.

292
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,800
 I filled it in as like a lanky guy in a tuxedo, but as a man in a tuxedo, and no matter how

293
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,440
 fast they moved towards him, he was always able to stay away from him.

294
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,880
 He's just walking one step at a time.

295
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,320
 It's very, very simple story.

296
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,680
 Very, very simple story.

297
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,120
 Was it an alien intruder, some sort of phantom, a demonic entity, interdimensional traveler?

298
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,880
 You pretty much choose whatever you want with it.

299
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,800
 Very, very simple story, frightening visual, and the fact that it doesn't have an ending

300
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,280
 where it's like, "I'll be back to take your firstborn."

301
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,280
 It doesn't have an implication of why the creature was there.

302
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,360
 It makes it that creepier.

303
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,640
 We cover stories about some crazy kid in Brazil like we did earlier in the week who's beaten

304
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
 up chickens.

305
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
 You just go, "I don't have chickens.

306
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,600
 I'm not living in Brazil.

307
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,960
 I'm not worried about this Dennis the Menace-esque character messing up my life."

308
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,760
 This guy came out of nowhere, had no goal, and left.

309
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,360
 And that could happen to any of us.

310
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,720
 You could be walking to your car later tonight and you just see a figure standing there next

311
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
 to your car.

312
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,600
 I mean, there's nothing they did to start this and there was nothing they did to finish

313
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,800
 it, so you don't know why it was there.

314
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,240
 Most type of stories are fine, very unsettling.

315
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,640
 Also park underneath the street lights.

316
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,320
 But sometimes that doesn't even help, right?

317
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,320
 You're walking towards the car and your street lights like zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

318
00:14:39,320 --> 00:15:09,320
 You're walking towards the car and your street lights like zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

319
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:22,040
 We're in the 1960s, so we're dressed up.

320
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,880
 We got really cool clothes on and stuff like that.

321
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,800
 As opposed to the lame clothes we're wearing today, we got really cool clothes on.

322
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,240
 We're walking around LA.

323
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,200
 We're sitting at these cool nightclubs.

324
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,240
 We're hanging out with a bunch of old stars, but they weren't old back then.

325
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
 They were young.

326
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,080
 And there's a man on stage and he's tuning his guitar and this band's getting ready.

327
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,760
 Debbie Reynolds is sitting next to me and she goes, "Hey dude, you won't believe this

328
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,920
 dude is dope.

329
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,720
 This guy's super awesome."

330
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,440
 And I was like, "Who is it?"

331
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,800
 And Debbie Reynolds goes, "The only old star I can think of on the top of my head because

332
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,120
 I just watched 'Singin' From the Rain' a couple of weeks ago.

333
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,840
 I never saw it before."

334
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,000
 Debbie Reynolds goes, "Yeah, dude, this guy's killer.

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
 His name is Jim Sullivan."

336
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,920
 And he's sitting there and he gets his little pedestal ready.

337
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,520
 And he starts playing a jaunty little tune.

338
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,720
 And all of these rich, powerful people at LA are mesmerized by this simple folk singer

339
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,720
 singing simple folk songs.

340
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
 He was one of those guys.

341
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,160
 Jim Sullivan was one of those guys who wanted to make it.

342
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
 We all want to make it, right?

343
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,520
 Whatever your career, it could be you want to make it as a stockbroker or you want to

344
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
 make it as an artist.

345
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,320
 You want to make it as a mechanic.

346
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,680
 Everyone has dreams and aspirations, which is great.

347
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
 You got to have those.

348
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
 You got to keep moving forward.

349
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,800
 And Jim Sullivan was just like us.

350
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 His aspiration was music.

351
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,120
 And he actually kind of lucked out because his wife worked for Capitol Records.

352
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,480
 Now, she wasn't a producer.

353
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,520
 She was like a staff member there.

354
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,560
 She did her best to try to get his music in front of the people at Capitol Records, but

355
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,640
 it just wasn't successful.

356
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 She couldn't get them to really pick up the album.

357
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,080
 So you go, "Okay, you know, he's trying his best."

358
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:01,800
 He had this weird way of mesmerizing people where his first gigs were at very, very prestigious

359
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 nightclubs.

360
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,440
 And he's playing these songs.

361
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,800
 And now this is the 1960s, so folk music is huge right now.

362
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
 And the audiences are full of musicians.

363
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
 They're full of actors.

364
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,280
 They're full of these powerful people.

365
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,080
 And they're like, "Oh my God, this is really, really good music.

366
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,480
 This guy needs an album deal."

367
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,640
 He's like, "Yeah, I'm working on it.

368
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,280
 You know, my wife's trying to pull strings, but Capitol Records won't listen to it."

369
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,160
 He had a bunch of celebrity friends pool their money together.

370
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,000
 They pool their money together to get him studio time.

371
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,120
 And not only studio time, he's just a simple man with a guitar who's writing these songs.

372
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,900
 They have to get backing musicians for him.

373
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,680
 They get him studio time with the Wrecking Crew.

374
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,520
 The Wrecking Crew were studio musicians for some of the biggest acts at the time.

375
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,600
 This cost serious money.

376
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,920
 His friends really, really believed in Jim Sullivan.

377
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,120
 They got him the studio.

378
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,320
 They got him the Wrecking Crew.

379
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,800
 They got him the best of the best.

380
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,520
 And his first album was entitled UFO.

381
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,480
 It didn't take off, though.

382
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,400
 It was pure folk music, but it just didn't take off.

383
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,040
 1972, he does get signed to a record label.

384
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,320
 He gets signed to Playboy Records, the Playboy Company, decides to actually get into the

385
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 music business.

386
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,280
 And one of the very first acts, because this guy had such a great reputation, to launch

387
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,120
 their record company, they picked Jim Sullivan.

388
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,040
 But that album also flops.

389
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,880
 You can have the best music out there, the best art out there, and it just doesn't line

390
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
 up.

391
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,040
 And that's what happened to Jim Sullivan.

392
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,480
 His marriage started to fall apart.

393
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
 He had a child.

394
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,800
 That's the one the marriage started to fall apart.

395
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 He's like, "Barnie, the reason why we're raking up is you."

396
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,520
 No, they had a kid, but the marriage was starting to fall apart.

397
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,000
 He started to drink, which is never going to make things good.

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,840
 Starts to drink very, very heavily.

399
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,960
 And he says, "You know what?

400
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,880
 Maybe Los Angeles isn't the place for me to be."

401
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,640
 I'm going to try my luck in Nashville.

402
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,840
 So, honey, Barney, he gives a sign to Barney.

403
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,440
 He almost broke me and me and your mom up.

404
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,200
 He goes, "I'm going to go to Nashville.

405
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,560
 I'm going to try to make it there, and then I'll bring you guys out with me."

406
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
 Or get a divorce.

407
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,000
 You know, one or the other, this marriage isn't going so great.

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,520
 But he did still talk to his wife into this adventure we're going on.

409
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
 So he goes, "I'm going to go to Nashville."

410
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
 It's March 4th, 1975.

411
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
 At this point, he is loading up his Volkswagen Beetle, and he's going to make the trip from

412
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
 Los Angeles to Nashville.

413
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,600
 On the way out there, he stops at a motel in Santa Rosa, New Mexico.

414
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,160
 Goes in, gets a room, buys some vodka.

415
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,960
 Not a great thing to do, especially when you're on a road trip, but that's what he does.

416
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
 He's in for the night.

417
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
 He gets a hotel room.

418
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,800
 He buys some vodka.

419
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,960
 He calls his wife from the hotel room, and he goes, "I'm all right.

420
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,520
 You know, I'm down here in New Mexico.

421
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,760
 I'm not in Nashville just yet.

422
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,280
 The journey just began.

423
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
 What do you expect?

424
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
 What do you expect?"

425
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
 No, he goes, "I'm still headed there."

426
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,040
 But the wife's like, "What's going on?"

427
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,000
 She could tell something was off.

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,600
 She could tell something was off.

429
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,800
 She thought it was weird because when he called, he told her, "I'm all right.

430
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 Everything's okay."

431
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,240
 And she thought, "Well, yeah, you just left your New Mexico.

432
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
 You just left a couple of hours ago.

433
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,220
 What could go wrong between LA and New Mexico?"

434
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
 She thought that was weird.

435
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
 She could tell something was wrong.

436
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,000
 She starts pressing him for stuff.

437
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
 He goes, "You want to believe if I told you?"

438
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,080
 She asked him then, "Jim, what's the matter?

439
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,720
 Is anything wrong?"

440
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,960
 And he replied, "Forget it.

441
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,320
 Just forget I said anything.

442
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,760
 I'll call you from Nashville."

443
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:46,840
 Next day, 26 miles away from the hotel, he's seen walking near a remote ranch.

444
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,820
 He's walking away from a parked car.

445
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,820
 He was never seen again.

446
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,220
 When he didn't get to Nashville and he didn't call his wife, they started missing persons

447
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
 case on this.

448
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,180
 And what they figure out is that he got the hotel, but he never slept there.

449
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,340
 He got the motel room.

450
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,220
 He left his key in the motel room, never slept in the bed.

451
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,420
 He must have driven out that night.

452
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,220
 The last time he was seen was walking around that ranch 26 miles away.

453
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,880
 In his car, they found money, they found clothes, they found luggage, they found a box of unsold

454
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,920
 records and they found his guitar.

455
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,560
 And that's when his wife goes, "Okay, something's wrong because I'll tell you right now."

456
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,120
 He would leave all of that stuff, but he would never leave that guitar.

457
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,800
 If he ever needed to make money, he'd probably take the cash too, but she goes, "He needs

458
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
 that guitar to make money."

459
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,400
 That's his life.

460
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
 With that guitar, he can make it anywhere.

461
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,380
 So the fact that he left the guitar really, really made her afraid that something bad

462
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,420
 happened.

463
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,940
 Now the police were looking at the obvious.

464
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,660
 One suicide.

465
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,400
 He got out of his car, just walked into the wilderness and died on purpose.

466
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,540
 The other one was that the car maybe had some trouble and he walked to go get help and died

467
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
 of exposure.

468
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,660
 There was no reports of the car having trouble though, so that puzzled them.

469
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,220
 Then there's things like foul play.

470
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,020
 That he was forced to go out there, that somebody kidnapped him, that somebody murdered him,

471
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,500
 and his bleached bones are somewhere in the wilderness that would show evidence of him

472
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,600
 being murdered.

473
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 But of course, because his first album was titled UFO, the story that really took hold

474
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,540
 was the space brothers took him home.

475
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,920
 That he went out into the middle of nowhere, New Mexico, which is home of Roswell, and

476
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,660
 he got abducted by aliens.

477
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,740
 One of his best friends, Al Dobbs, this old famous actor who actually was one of the guys

478
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,700
 who helped raise money for him, he says, "Listen, I think it's really poetic to think that

479
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,900
 he's out there wandering somewhere, but I think something bad happened to the guy.

480
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,980
 I don't think that he got picked up by aliens or he's wandering the wilderness or anything

481
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
 like that."

482
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,340
 That was his take on it.

483
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,620
 But the fans of his, they're like, "How's Dobbs you big old party pooper?"

484
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,680
 Let's say that he went and hung out with aliens, because we don't know.

485
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,200
 And his album wasn't a success.

486
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,440
 His follow-up album wasn't a success, and it became a collector's item for decades.

487
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,800
 In the underground folk music scene, people would talk about Jim Sullivan, and this mystery

488
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 would be part of it.

489
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,120
 They're like, "Yeah, he recorded this album about UFOs.

490
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,080
 He recorded the song he goes on talking about just walking."

491
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,520
 The songs are really interesting songs.

492
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,260
 The song UFO is basically about, like, the alien brotherhood.

493
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,180
 If you saw UFO, would you believe it was Jesus, or would you believe Jesus was a UFO?

494
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,220
 It's a really interesting song.

495
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,300
 The album, I'll tell you this right now, the album is great.

496
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,260
 You guys who know that I listen to music, everyone listens to music, but I listen to

497
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,900
 West Coast 90s gangster rap, and I listen to pop music.

498
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,540
 And that's why I don't do a dead rabbit recommends music, because you guys don't want to hear

499
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,160
 me recommend Spice Ones 1996.

500
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,080
 It's a great album.

501
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,480
 But you guys who are going to listen to 1996 or Holotip, Taking No Shorts, or any of that

502
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
 stuff, you guys should.

503
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
 It's great.

504
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,920
 You guys aren't going to listen to Taylor Swift's 1989, unless you guys listen to it

505
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
 already.

506
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,760
 The reason why I don't do dead rabbit recommends for music, because music is such a personal

507
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
 thing.

508
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,560
 But my music tastes are pretty specific.

509
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,020
 I like Bubblegum Pop and 90s West Coast gangster rap in equal amounts.

510
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,500
 My MP3 player is almost a 50/50 split of those two.

511
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,900
 So when I was researching this story, I put in Jim Sullivan's UFO album.

512
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,540
 I don't know how many times I listened to it.

513
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,980
 It's like a half hour album, and it is so mellow and cool.

514
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,220
 You feel cool listening to it.

515
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,500
 And it's a really cool album to research to, because it's so mellow and just kind of underneath

516
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 everything.

517
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,400
 And you guys know that's not my type of music.

518
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,480
 So I really recommend that in the show notes, both albums are in there.

519
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,980
 You can listen to them on YouTube.

520
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,180
 And sure, you can buy them as well.

521
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,320
 Because what happened was, it was this cult collector's item.

522
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,880
 There was only so many copies of these albums pressed.

523
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,580
 It was a vanity press the first time.

524
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,640
 The second time it was a flop album from Playboy Records.

525
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,800
 And in 2010, this guy who had heard this, he's like, dude, this album is great.

526
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,120
 This guy is an amazing musician, and his story is just bonkers.

527
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,100
 He just walked into the desert.

528
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,700
 Whether or not he got abducted by aliens, he did just disappear without a trace.

529
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,460
 So this guy was able to buy the rights of both albums and reissued them in 2010, and

530
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,700
 they became a big hit.

531
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,220
 And you know why they became a big hit?

532
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,260
 Because the story of Jim Sullivan was covered on Coast to Coast AM.

533
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,020
 It's an interesting story.

534
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,540
 It's actually kind of heartwarming.

535
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:54,480
 And it does suck that he's passed on or walked away or lost or anything like that.

536
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,440
 But his music lived long past him.

537
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,320
 Like his legacy lived on.

538
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,240
 And it lived on through Coast to Coast AM because he had this album called UFO.

539
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,840
 And he very well might have been abducted by aliens.

540
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
 We don't know.

541
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,760
 If he had walked off willingly, he would have taken his guitar.

542
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,320
 And if it was some sort of mob hit, you figured they would have taken the cash.

543
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,840
 So what was going on?

544
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,380
 What did he see?

545
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,820
 And he told his wife, "Ah, forget it.

546
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,820
 Forget it.

547
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,900
 Forget I said anything."

548
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,940
 Did he see something in the sky?

549
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,020
 Was that simple song that he wrote about UFOs and contactees and spiritual enlightenment

550
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,620
 involving extraterrestrial space brothers?

551
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,540
 Did that trigger something?

552
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,300
 Maybe Jim Sullivan couldn't find an audience on Earth.

553
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,820
 But he found an audience that was out of this world.

554
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:55,560
 And then because his story involved aliens, 50 years later it was reported on an alien

555
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:03,000
 radio show and gained the earthly audience that he deserved all along.

556
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,780
 The story of Jim Sullivan transcends just a man walking into the desert and walking

557
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
 into mystery.

558
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:15,000
 It's a story of an artist who struggled but never gave up.

559
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,680
 Never gave up.

560
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:22,820
 He was just a man who would hit a barrier, readjust and try again.

561
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,060
 So whether or not Jim Sullivan was abducted by aliens and hopefully he was.

562
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,420
 Hopefully he wasn't murdered or he just didn't walk into the desert.

563
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,460
 Maybe he walked into a portal.

564
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
 Hopefully it's something like that.

565
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
 Right?

566
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,700
 Those are the happier endings because unfortunately he is missing.

567
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,060
 I can't just make him reappear.

568
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,940
 But hopefully he did pass on into some great grand cosmic adventure.

569
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,580
 But regardless of that, I think Jim Sullivan is a perfect example for us and our current

570
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,920
 90 days to a better you challenge.

571
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,180
 Right now we're all spending the next 90 days to be better than we are today.

572
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,880
 And Jim Sullivan is one of those people.

573
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,280
 It wasn't perfect.

574
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,720
 He had a drinking problem, his marriage was falling apart.

575
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,460
 None of our lives are perfect.

576
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,660
 But he kept having a goal and when he was stymied he would simply readjust and keep

577
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,260
 shooting for that goal.

578
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:20,340
 He wanted to be a musical legend so much that even his disappearance from the mortal

579
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,300
 world couldn't stop his drive.

580
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:37,140
 And here we are today in the year 2021 talking about a man who dreamed of being a music legend.
