1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 When a young man and his wife swing by Taco Bell to get a quick bite to eat, he's hoping

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:14,240
 he'll get a couple bean burritos and a mild case of diarrhea, but instead he finds himself

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,680
 in an odd predicament.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,360
 And then we meet a young mother who's having a really hard time grappling with a disturbing

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
 truth.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:32,560
 Is it possible that the man she married is truly a monster today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:43,920
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,960
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away first off walking

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,240
 into Dead Rabbit Command.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,200
 I always talk about you don't have to support the show financially, just help get the word

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
 out.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,640
 I'm going to introduce those guys who's getting the word out.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,640
 Everyone give a round of applause for Sir Chubb.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,360
 Yeah woohoo come on in.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,040
 I heard about him because he's a sir.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,520
 My liege Sir Chubb.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 Now the reason why he got selected to do this, like I say if you can't support the

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,920
 Patreon that's okay just help get the word out.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
 Sir Chubb.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,720
 I don't know if this is illegal or not.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,560
 I'm pretty sure this is illegal.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,060
 Pretty sure this is okay.

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,720
 Sir Chubb is like no please stop mentioning my name.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,240
 Sir Chubb is not his legal name either and also he's not actually a knight.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
 But Sir Chubb said that he was in Scotland.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm not mentioning this guy's name apparently I might be doxing him as well.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,240
 Sir Chubb told me that recently he was in an airport in Glasgow which is in Scotland

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 right?

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,360
 He was in an airport in Glasgow and he went I guess they have all these MacBooks set up

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,360
 and he changed all the default pages to Dead Rabbit Radio's website.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,200
 You're like Jason that's clearly illegal.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 I don't know.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
 I don't know.

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
 I think it's fine.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,000
 That's a great way to get the word out and go into an airport, follow security and talk

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
 about Dead Rabbit Radio.

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,000
 So Sir Chubb you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,280
 If you guys can't support the show financially or you can't possibly commit crimes to talk

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,920
 about the show that's fine too.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,280
 So there are more legal ways to talk about Dead Rabbit Radio.

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,760
 It always helps out a lot.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,240
 Now Sir Chubb let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,840
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,840
 We're headed all the way out to a Taco Bell.

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,560
 Sir Chubb drives us to the Taco Bell and now we're in the drive-thru and we're actually

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,680
 sitting right behind the narrator of this story.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,400
 According to a user known as Neb Gonegau, we're going to go ahead and call him Billy

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,920
 eight years ago.

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,440
 So that would have put us around what 2014, eight years ago it was nighttime and Billy

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,960
 and his wife will call her Tiffany, decide to get a quick bite to eat.

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,560
 You know he's talking to his wife, they're just driving on the road and they see that

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,840
 the drive-thru for the Taco Bell, it's not super crowded but there are a couple cars

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,720
 back from even ordering at the menu.

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,200
 They pull into the drive-thru and they're ready to fill their bellies full of processed

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
 lard.

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,240
 And they're in the drive-thru lane and they're talking and we've all been through drive-thru,

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,000
 sometimes they go super quick, sometimes they take a while.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 But what was odd is that as Billy was sitting here with his wife and they're waiting to

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,160
 go up to the menu part, waiting to actually place their order, they realize that the line

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,680
 seems to be stopped.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,360
 There seems to be no movement, the cars are just sitting where they are.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
 Ten minutes pass.

67
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,880
 And he didn't even realize that so much time had passed, but ten minutes passed and Billy

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,520
 sitting in his car and he's like, "Dude, what's going on?

69
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,880
 Like I figured maybe someone had a big order."

70
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:05,040
 And then he realizes that not only are the cars in front of him not moving, the people

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,360
 in the cars are not moving either.

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,960
 And you're like, "Jason, it's not like people generally have a dance party in their cars,

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,480
 but you know when you are sitting in a car, you'll fiddle with your radio or fiddle with

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,800
 your air conditioning or talk to other people in the car, talk to your wife."

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,840
 And he realizes that everyone in the two cars ahead of them that they can see, the two cars

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,600
 that they can see in front of them, the people are completely motionless in their vehicles.

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,320
 So he goes, "Oh, this is kind of weird.

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 Plus I'm hungry.

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,920
 There could be some sort of temporal distortion.

80
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,800
 Plus I got to run for the border."

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,440
 So he decides to pull out of the drive-through, which is a tricky thing, right?

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,560
 We've all had that instant where you're sitting in a drive-through and you go, "Ah, screw

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
 it.

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
 It'll be easier to go inside."

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
 And then all of a sudden it becomes a herculean task to reverse your car through the drive-through.

86
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,240
 And your worst fear is that at that moment someone will pull in behind you and you're

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
 like, "No, I'm stuck."

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,600
 He's luckily able to get out and pull into a parking spot.

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,840
 So he goes, "I'm just going to walk into the Taco Bell or order the food in there."

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,080
 So he gets out, he's been sitting in the drive-through for 10 minutes.

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,720
 He gets out of his car, he walks into the Taco Bell and things just get even stranger.

92
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,800
 Because when he walks in the Taco Bell he said, "You know, because it's nighttime, it's not

93
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,080
 super busy, but it's also not completely empty."

94
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,760
 He goes, "I walk into the Taco Bell and there's people ordering food.

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,800
 There's a cashier taking an order and there's people eating their food, a couple workers

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,040
 in the back that he can see."

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:43,400
 And right when he walks in, every single person in the Taco Bell turned and looked right at

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,480
 him.

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,080
 Then they turned away and went back to what they were doing.

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,080
 And it was so, it left such an uneasy feeling in Billy.

101
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,760
 He thought he might have walked into a robbery in progress, which would make sense why it

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
 was taking so long.

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,200
 It's kind of hard to make a chili cheese burrito and the gun in your face.

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,240
 Now, maybe I walked into a robbery in progress.

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,840
 Everyone stopped what they were doing, turned and looked at me, and then went back to what

106
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
 they were doing.

107
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,800
 And then he realized they weren't doing anything.

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,120
 Everyone turns and looks at him, they turn back and then they freeze into place.

109
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,960
 The guy was not taking an order.

110
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,880
 The register cashier guy was not taking an order.

111
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,280
 The man standing at the register was not talking about an order.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,680
 It was as quiet as a cemetery.

113
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,640
 People sitting at the tables were motionless.

114
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
 The man placing the order was motionless.

115
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,480
 The two employees he could see in the back in the kitchen area, motionless.

116
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,040
 Other than the movement to look at him and then look back away.

117
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,960
 There was no activity in the Taco Bell.

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,360
 It was completely silent as well.

119
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,400
 At that moment, Billy gets the overwhelming urge to leave.

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,880
 Like, this thing settles on him, this fear has finally gripped him.

121
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,040
 He turns around, walks out of the Taco Bell, gets in the car, and he's like, "I've never

122
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
 eaten to that day.

123
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
 A skeleton is writing this."

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,520
 He said that they just went and got Chinese food.

125
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,040
 And apparently that was totally normal.

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,440
 He didn't go in there and said, "Yeah, and Jack Burton was having a karate fight with

127
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
 three Chinese gods."

128
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,240
 Apparently the Chinese food restaurant was totally normal.

129
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,400
 But he goes, "I've never been able to make sense of that."

130
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,760
 He goes, "That happened eight years ago and I still can't figure it out."

131
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,160
 And he goes, "Actually the next day, I thought I was going to read in the news that there

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,360
 was a robbery at a local Taco Bell, but nothing.

133
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,040
 There was nothing in the news about any of this.

134
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,800
 There wasn't on the front page, Taco Bell frozen in time."

135
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,880
 Or a more mundane answer, you know, that there was a robbery.

136
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,360
 He could never figure it out.

137
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,920
 And so this day he can't figure it out and he insists post with this quote, "I felt

138
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 with every fiber of my being that I had stepped into a place I did not belong."

139
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,320
 Really interesting high strangeness story.

140
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,240
 We talk a lot about being out of place, being out of time, alternate universes.

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,840
 This is one of those things I do love these type of stories that are so mundane yet they

142
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
 veer into the world of the paranormal.

143
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,600
 Or how would you classify this?

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,040
 I did a story a long time ago about a haunted Wendy's that I experienced.

145
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,960
 It was terrifying.

146
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,160
 And I, it was something similar to this.

147
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,720
 You didn't feel welcome there.

148
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,280
 It was a very, it was the most quiet fast food restaurant I had ever been to.

149
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,360
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

150
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
 Very very disturbing feeling and that's not even including, that's not even including

151
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,200
 the monster that I saw that came out of the drive-thru window.

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,920
 So I kind of feel this dude's pain or feel this dude's mystery would be more apt, more

153
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
 apt word.

154
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,080
 But what a, what a bizarre story for us to look at because what is it?

155
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,480
 And then you start to think is because I had my, you know, one time it's just a weird event

156
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,640
 but two times you have to start to look at a pattern.

157
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,360
 We've been covering on and off on this show the black bedroom phenomenon.

158
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,040
 Oh, but those episodes in the show notes we talked about, originally it was just someone

159
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,880
 woke up in their entire bedroom was pitch black.

160
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
 They looked out into the street.

161
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
 All the street lights were off.

162
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,280
 The world was just covered in darkness.

163
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,000
 And you go Jason, generally when people wake up, it's dark.

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It was dark and in dark.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,880
 It was blacker than black.

166
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
 We covered that story.

167
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 It was kind of a one-off thing.

168
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
 And then I found like two or three more.

169
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,880
 So then you start to think, is this a phenomenon that deserves investigation that is happening

170
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,680
 more times that we know of and people don't talk about it.

171
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,480
 And the same thing when I had my weird Wendy's experience, just thought it was I've had some

172
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,240
 weird experiences, you know, but now that we found a second one, we have to start to

173
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,640
 look at what do they say like one is one is one thing.

174
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,080
 Two is a coincidence.

175
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,400
 Three is a phenomenon.

176
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
 So was there more to this?

177
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,120
 I mean, how many people are posting online about walking into fast food restaurants and

178
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,400
 just weird stuff happening?

179
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,680
 And even if they did post them online, someone has to find them.

180
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,240
 I did that story about two different people in two different parts of the world over two

181
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,360
 different time periods saw two halves of a horse fused together.

182
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,600
 You read the stories one off, it's weird, but you read both of them and you think, okay,

183
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,760
 is there something to this phenomenon and other people aren't reporting it.

184
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
 Who knows?

185
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,240
 It would be upsetting though, right?

186
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,400
 For sure, if you didn't get to talk Ovel.

187
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,800
 But secondly, like you would just feel like you had stumbled into a place where you shouldn't

188
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 be.

189
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
 It's not so weird that there were aliens walking around or they were speaking some sort of

190
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,480
 alien language or the Taco Bell menu look like Taco Bell menu from demolition man.

191
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,000
 It was not a menu he didn't recognize.

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,920
 It was just something was off.

193
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,840
 It wasn't anything so dramatic like that.

194
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,920
 It was just a weird feeling.

195
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,640
 And I wonder if there's more of them out there.

196
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,220
 And if there are, what does it mean?

197
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,960
 What does this phenomenon point to as a whole?

198
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
 We just don't know.

199
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,360
 It's just a bizarre story and is there anything more to it?

200
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,320
 I would say if anything, I know my experience with Wendy's is that I did feel there was

201
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,360
 a malevolent presence at that Wendy's.

202
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,680
 And every time I went there, something weird happened.

203
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,120
 This guy, I don't know if he went to the Taco Bell at any point after that in the past

204
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,600
 eight years and nothing else happened.

205
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,560
 But interesting, I guess I can message the guy and find out anything about that until

206
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,720
 then to see if there's a follow up.

207
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,080
 But a weird story nonetheless.

208
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,000
 The world of the paranormal man, people think it's only in the national parks, in the spooky

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,080
 cemeteries and the haunted houses.

210
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,200
 The great thing about the world of the paranormal is it can happen anywhere, anytime.

211
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,320
 It's not only the farmer in Alabama in the middle of the night he gets abducted by aliens.

212
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,600
 It can happen anywhere.

213
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,080
 You are never safe is the moral of that story.

214
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,880
 Sir Chubb, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

215
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,920
 We are leaving behind this Taco Bell.

216
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,800
 We are going to fly all the way out to North Carolina.

217
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,560
 We're in North Carolina.

218
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,280
 The year is 2020.

219
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,040
 It's August 2020.

220
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,040
 So this is a pretty recent story that we're going to be taking a look at.

221
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:53,460
 One thing I love about doing this podcast is this thing I call true crime in progress.

222
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,360
 So many true crime stories are the serial killers.

223
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
 Everything's settled.

224
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,760
 They've committed all these crimes.

225
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,440
 They're in prison or they're dead.

226
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,880
 These five part audio essays, whatever on Ted Bundy, blah, blah, blah, blah.

227
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,560
 This stuff's been done to death.

228
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
 No pun intended.

229
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,440
 It's been done to death.

230
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 And we say that a lot.

231
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,680
 Definitely there's a market for that.

232
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,360
 But I've been ingesting true crime stuff for so long.

233
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,760
 I kind of like finding the stuff no one talks about.

234
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,940
 A couple of times on this show we've done this thing called true crime in progress where

235
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,060
 we don't know how the story ends.

236
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,780
 It's not like an unsolved murder.

237
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,300
 It's like we're in the middle of this saga.

238
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,780
 Sir Chubb, go ahead and land this carbon helicopter in North Carolina.

239
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,100
 We're going to be walking around this unnamed town somewhere out there.

240
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,540
 We're just walking around the environment in North Carolina.

241
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,340
 We're going to meet someone who goes by the name Throse08.

242
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
 Throse08.

243
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,560
 And the reason why is that this is a throwaway count.

244
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,120
 The person who's talking about this does not want it connected to her really in any way.

245
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,040
 I actually tried, actually tried looking up to see if there were any articles about this.

246
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,680
 But I didn't find anything.

247
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,720
 We're going to go ahead and call this woman Meredith.

248
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,720
 And she's going to be telling us the story about her husband who we're just going to

249
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 call Joe.

250
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
 And if those are the real names, it was just a shot in the dark, right?

251
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
 Meredith over a series of posts.

252
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,140
 Over the course of two years, she writes all these different posts and I'm going to cobble

253
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,140
 the story together and tell it as best that I can.

254
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,380
 And hopefully you find this both entertaining and absolutely terrifying.

255
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,180
 And then, okay, let's take a look at it.

256
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,220
 Meredith tells a story of a young couple in love.

257
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,260
 And she says, you know, her and Joe really were destined for each other.

258
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,920
 They both came from what she described as good families.

259
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,760
 They both came from good homes with good families.

260
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,320
 They're both college educated white collar workers.

261
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,560
 They met at the local Episcopal church.

262
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,000
 Two strong Christian families finding each other through marriage.

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,860
 These two children who were raised as best they could be in the church, meet at a church

264
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,500
 and it is meant to be.

265
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,320
 Now Meredith had a child from a previous relationship.

266
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,500
 She doesn't specifically say she was married before this, but she has a child, a very young

267
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,060
 child from a previous relationship.

268
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,980
 And after her and Joe got married, they had three more children over the next few years.

269
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,000
 And in August of 2020, Joe's 40th birthday was coming up.

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,240
 He's quite a few years younger than me.

271
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,200
 40th birthday was coming up and she was saving money up to surprise him with a stay at the

272
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
 Ritz.

273
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,520
 The Ritz apparently is a nice hotel or something like that.

274
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,200
 They're not going to live on a cracker.

275
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
 They're going to, like, obviously that's a nice hotel.

276
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,440
 How poor are you?

277
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,000
 I actually had to look it up.

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,240
 The Ritz is like a nice hotel.

279
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,900
 I guess it's a chain of nice hotels.

280
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,700
 I thought maybe it was like one nice hotel in Paris.

281
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,820
 But no, there's like a bunch of them.

282
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,140
 So it's not super fancy if there's a ton of them.

283
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,060
 Then it's just like a hotel chain.

284
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,180
 That's like saying I want to go, I'm paying for the holiday in and you're like, oh, that

285
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
 sounds nice.

286
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,260
 Until you realize there's a thousand of them.

287
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,020
 The Ritz hotel, she is saving up money so she can take her husband to spend his 40th

288
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,220
 birthday at the Ritz.

289
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,080
 This isn't a marriage advice podcast so you know something must go wrong because they

290
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,880
 don't go to the Ritz.

291
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,440
 They don't even go to the cracker factory.

292
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
 Now Meredith says, listen, this wasn't a perfect marriage.

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,520
 No marriage is perfect.

294
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,440
 We did have our hiccups.

295
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:56,360
 But what happened was my husband, I'm going to tell the story too because I think the

296
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,460
 way she wrote it, the way she laid out the timeline of events is also very important

297
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,980
 for her mind state.

298
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,300
 And I should say I got this from, this is one of the reasons why I absolutely hate Reddit.

299
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,260
 I think it's a cesspool for goons and goblins and all sorts of awful people.

300
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,300
 There's a subreddit, you're like, "Jay, stop talking about that subreddit again that you

301
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
 hate."

302
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,620
 You did a whole episode that you think that it's possessed by demons.

303
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,020
 Is subreddit is disgusting.

304
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,620
 It's called sexual offender support.

305
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,420
 People have been trying to take it down forever.

306
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,320
 I have no idea why it's still up.

307
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,520
 It's a place for people who are convicted of sex crimes or are facing sex crime charges

308
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
 where they can get advice.

309
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,840
 I mean, sure, they've got to talk to their lawyers and stuff like that, but it's just

310
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,280
 a gross place to be.

311
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,000
 Imagine walking into a clubhouse where everyone there is a pedophile or a rapist or something

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 like that.

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,600
 It's not a clubhouse you want to be in at any point in time, yet Reddit allows this

314
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,880
 one to stay up for a long time.

315
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,380
 I get in arguments all the time about free speech on my Patreon discord and I may be

316
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
 wrong, right?

317
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,740
 People may say everyone has the right to free speech.

318
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,020
 Yeah, okay, but anyways, it's gross.

319
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,060
 This is super gross, but anyways, they have this.

320
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,780
 People have been trying to take it down.

321
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
 Sexual offender support.

322
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:15,740
 But anyways, so I was on this and I came across this saga and she's writing to get advice

323
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,220
 from these other pervos out there, right?

324
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,660
 Convicted or alleged.

325
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,440
 And she writes her original post and she says, "What role did alcohol play in your crimes?"

326
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,600
 This is the first time she's talking about this and she said, "Listen, my husband is

327
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,960
 being accused of a, quote, 'contact crime.'"

328
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,440
 So there's the non-contact crime, which is the child sexual abuse material, and the

329
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,400
 contact crime involves contact, right?

330
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,040
 Malestation.

331
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,720
 She's super cagey with the details, right?

332
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,220
 She's not telling us who or when or what or anything like that.

333
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,540
 But she says, "Listen, my husband, who is preparing to celebrate his 40th birthday at

334
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,140
 the Ritz, has recently been accused of a contact crime."

335
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,060
 And she says, "If he committed," that's her actual quote, quote, "If he committed,"

336
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:16,100
 unquote, "this crime he's being accused of, it would have happened when he was blackout

337
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,780
 drunk."

338
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,240
 The time that he was accused of doing this, he didn't have his right mental process is

339
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
 what she's saying.

340
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,560
 And she says, quote, "I keep thinking that if he weren't his right mind, he would never

341
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,780
 hurt anyone."

342
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,240
 She goes on to say that he, so he's been accused of this, but he was blackout drunk at the

343
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 time.

344
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,720
 He actually has now started attending AA meetings.

345
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,880
 And she goes, "Here's the thing, I have to say right up front that I have little kids,

346
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,240
 we have children together, and their safety is what's most important to me.

347
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,020
 But when she looks at all the evidence, when she's hearing these accusations, and she's

348
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,360
 talking to her husband, and she's thinking about everything, she says that she has found

349
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,740
 herself zero evidence that he is a predator or attracted to minors in any way, shape,

350
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,100
 or form."

351
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,780
 So she's thinking, could alcohol have played a part in this?

352
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,100
 Because he is not like this.

353
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,560
 He's being accused of this.

354
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,160
 And if he did it, it's so out of character for him.

355
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,880
 And she has this quote here, it says, quote, "It seems like this was some kind of weird

356
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,320
 blip when he was extremely stressed, deep into the absolute stupidity of active addiction,

357
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,900
 and holding a lot of resentments."

358
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,240
 So he acted out.

359
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,740
 Unquote.

360
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,300
 I'm not a fan, obviously, of spousal abuse.

361
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,340
 I don't think I'm taking a wild political stance on that.

362
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,740
 Not a fan of spousal abuse.

363
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,660
 I've never really been a victim of it.

364
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,340
 I'm sure I can think of a couple times that girls have thrown stuff at me.

365
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,020
 But I've had friends, both men and women, who have been in physically violent relationships.

366
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,100
 And it's horrible, right?

367
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
 It's absolutely horrible.

368
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,660
 And on different levels.

369
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,900
 Sometimes it's just people throwing stuff at each other.

370
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,340
 And then I've been in situations where, the one situation that I remember most clearly,

371
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,140
 she would beat him up.

372
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,020
 I knew a girl who would physically attack her husband.

373
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,460
 And he started fighting back and they would get in these knock-down drag-out fights.

374
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,540
 It's horrible, right?

375
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,940
 Not a fan of spousal abuse.

376
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,020
 I don't think anyone is.

377
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,460
 But the reason why I bring that up, and I'm not saying that it's ever okay, right?

378
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,060
 The reason why I bring that up is that when you make a statement like he was extremely

379
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:44,540
 stressed, he was addicted to something, he had a whole lot of resentment, so he "acted

380
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
 out."

381
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,540
 That's something that someone would say when they get decked by their partner.

382
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,620
 Or thrown against the wall, right?

383
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,940
 Go to work, you have a black eye.

384
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,180
 What in the world happened?

385
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,100
 Well, you know, things have been really stressful and they're normally not like this.

386
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
 They've never hit me before.

387
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
 They'll never hit me again.

388
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
 You know what I mean?

389
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,860
 That's the type of thing you would see going with physical action.

390
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,500
 I've never seen anything like that in regards to child molestation.

391
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,420
 I always just stressed.

392
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,820
 Just really, really stressed out at work.

393
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,780
 They've been giving them a lot of reports and he's trying to get the McKinsey account

394
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
 closed.

395
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,900
 So that's your first post.

396
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,100
 And you already start to see kind of a...

397
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,780
 I mean, I'm not even an arm-share psychologist.

398
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,020
 I'm basically like a hammock psychologist, right?

399
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,340
 Like anyone can kind of read into this, but I read it on a go.

400
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,740
 She isn't understanding the gravity of the situation.

401
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,300
 She's already making excuses in the first post.

402
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,100
 Now I found the latest...

403
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,140
 I came across the story because I found the newest post and I went and I backtracked and

404
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
 looked at all this stuff.

405
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,620
 So again, I'm reading all this stuff already knowing how this story ends, but that was

406
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
 really interesting.

407
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,620
 He's just acted out.

408
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
 He's under a lot of stress.

409
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,860
 The next post was in April of 2021.

410
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,700
 So quite a few months later, she's saying, "Listen, I want to know..."

411
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,140
 You know, we have a lot of young kids because this is a support group for these dudes, right?

412
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,000
 And women, women do it too, but Meredith is asking the support group.

413
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,860
 She goes, "How has life been for parents who have committed sex crimes?

414
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,760
 How has their life been on the registry?"

415
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
 So they have most states...

416
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,820
 I think all states in America now have a sex offender registry.

417
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,980
 There's been a big push to get those eliminated.

418
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,260
 There's actually been a big court case.

419
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,820
 I forgot what state it was in, but those may go away because they're saying that that's

420
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,740
 punishment after the crime.

421
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,460
 We'll see how that plays out, but she says, "So, you know, my husband's been accused of

422
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,080
 this crime and he's looking at taking a plea deal.

423
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,740
 The prosecutor in this case..."

424
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
 So now it's...

425
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,360
 She's still saying, you know, he's been accused, but it's in the court system.

426
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,740
 She goes, "The prosecutor's offering him a plea deal that involves 10 years on the registry.

427
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,160
 We have very, very young children and I'm concerned about things like, can he attend

428
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,820
 baseball games at their schools or PTA meetings?

429
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,320
 Can he do these things if he's on the registry?

430
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,860
 How hard of a life will it be for our children if we take this plea deal?"

431
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,420
 And it's interesting too because at this point, she is using the term "separated."

432
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
 They're not divorced.

433
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,780
 She does say, "We're not divorced."

434
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,620
 She uses the term "separated."

435
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,580
 So whatever has happened, again, she's being real occasioned with the details of this point,

436
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,080
 too.

437
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,260
 They're not together, which is probably a good idea because the kids, right?

438
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,660
 But she's still thinking of, you know, he'll get 10 years on the registry and maybe do

439
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,940
 a little bit of jail time.

440
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,780
 How would this affect the kids?

441
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,660
 And again, reading this stuff, apparently in most states, you have to get permission

442
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
 from the principal.

443
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,540
 You're on the sex offender registry and generally the principal's telling you to kick bricks.

444
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,420
 They don't want you around.

445
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,440
 He also has to, within this part of the plea deal, right, that he would have to attend sex

446
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,260
 offender treatment program, which should be the minimum, right?

447
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,700
 September 8th, though, we're going to jump ahead a couple more months.

448
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,020
 September 8th, 2021.

449
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:21,780
 Meredith receives a phone call from her husband, Joe.

450
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,500
 He said, "Listen, I've been waiting for this.

451
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,460
 I've been waiting for this day to come.

452
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,540
 I hope that it never would, but I'm going to be honest with you.

453
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:43,500
 Not only does Joe admit to sexually molesting a child, there's a second victim coming forward.

454
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,380
 Before Meredith gets any news any other way, Joe finds out that another one of his victims,

455
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,620
 so this is no longer a, if he committed it, this is no longer an alcohol blackout and

456
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,020
 stress at work.

457
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:02,420
 He knew there were multiple victims and he was hoping the other one wouldn't come forward.

458
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,060
 But now he has gotten word that another victim has come forward.

459
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,180
 Another victim is going to testify against him and he had a plan for this.

460
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,460
 He tells his wife, "Goodbye.

461
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,780
 I have written a full confession of my crimes.

462
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,060
 I have to get this stuff off my chest before I kill myself."

463
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,580
 You'll find these letters I left at home saying goodbye to the people I want to say goodbye

464
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,580
 to.

465
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,420
 "And I'm saying goodbye to you now."

466
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,460
 And she begins to plead with him to not do that.

467
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,620
 She begins to tell him, "Listen.

468
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,980
 If you die now, this will be your legacy.

469
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,620
 This will be the only thing people remember you for.

470
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,340
 You will have no chance to rectify the wrongs that you did.

471
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,860
 You will have no chance to plead your case.

472
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,340
 And I'm pleading to you now, Joe, please don't kill yourself.

473
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,780
 There is another way we will handle this.

474
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,740
 But you cannot kill yourself, Joe.

475
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,180
 Please.

476
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:13,140
 If you jump, your children will only remember you as the man who killed himself under the

477
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,980
 accusation of these crimes.

478
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,340
 And is that the legacy you want to leave them?

479
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,740
 Is that the legacy you want to leave me with?

480
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,980
 There is always hope, Joe, that things will get better.

481
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,660
 We take a plea deal.

482
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,700
 You do the registry.

483
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,500
 You get free and we rebuild.

484
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:44,300
 But if you kill yourself, your story ends today."

485
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,260
 She talks him down.

486
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,980
 She talks him down and he doesn't kill himself.

487
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,100
 And the court process continues.

488
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,020
 December 2021, so now we're two months later.

489
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,500
 And this is where we get the first real accounting of what happened.

490
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,100
 Because she has been very, very cagey with the details.

491
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,580
 But now as this seems to be getting even more real, now that there's other victims, now

492
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:19,380
 that they're coming closer to getting this plea deal done, now that her husband is actually

493
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,620
 in jail, because he was out during that time period, he was free to do what he wanted while

494
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,220
 this court process was going on when there was one victim.

495
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,900
 But now that there's multiple victims, he's arrested.

496
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,500
 Also I think the fact that he almost killed himself, they wanted to get him in jail, so

497
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,220
 he wouldn't have the opportunity to do that again.

498
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,660
 And this is when she says that the victims are their children.

499
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,260
 Now remember, this saga started in August 2020.

500
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,660
 She doesn't mention that detail until December 2021.

501
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,660
 They were their own kids.

502
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:04,700
 And she's making excuses like, "Well maybe he's black-eyed drunk, maybe he's stressed."

503
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:11,300
 That would be evil enough if it was somebody else's child, but your own children.

504
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,580
 Now we know there's at least two victims, we don't know if there's any more after that.

505
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,100
 We know there's at least two victims, and maybe only, hopefully right, you'd prefer

506
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,260
 zero.

507
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,500
 You'd prefer these people never having to do this, him never falling into the clutches

508
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 of this, for lack of a better term, demonic activity.

509
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,340
 Go to the hotel or the ritz, it's your 40th birthday, have a great time, and he never

510
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
 did this horrible act in the first place.

511
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
 That's what we would like.

512
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,620
 And then I just cover something else on my podcast.

513
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,580
 But this is what happened.

514
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,700
 But it did happen.

515
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,340
 And it happened to their own children.

516
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:51,700
 And from August 2020 to December 2021, she's talking so clinical about this stuff.

517
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,300
 Which again would be evil enough if it was somebody else's children, but their own children.

518
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,940
 Now I first came across this entire story when I read what she posted, and this is the very

519
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,340
 last time she posted.

520
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,000
 I read a post that popped up on July 12th, 2022.

521
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,300
 And from the very first sentence, I just thought, "Listen, I'm a very hopeful person,

522
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,380
 I'm an optimist."

523
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,620
 People always say, "For someone who has unending anxiety attacks, you're extremely optimistic.

524
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,700
 Very hopeful person.

525
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,900
 The next sunrise is always there, no matter what you're going through.

526
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,180
 Things can get better.

527
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:38,980
 You may have a bad day, a bad month, a bad year, a bad long time, but things can get better."

528
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,620
 But every so often, I come across statements like this.

529
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:53,860
 July 12th, 2022, Meredith writes this phrase, "She got a call from Joe from prison."

530
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,780
 He's in prison now, he's been sentenced.

531
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:08,980
 The phrase was this, "I got a call from Joe who, quote, is about six weeks into a 20-year

532
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
 sentence."

533
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:20,980
 Six weeks into a 20-year prison sentence.

534
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,820
 Think about the worst job you ever had.

535
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:33,420
 And knowing as bad as that job is, you have to do it for another 20 years.

536
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,700
 That's the first thing that popped in my head, because I can't comprehend this.

537
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,420
 Six weeks into a 20-year prison sentence.

538
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,300
 And on yesterday's episode, I said, "Listen, I would rather do 20 years for murder than

539
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,740
 five years for stuff against kids."

540
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,540
 And I stand by that statement.

541
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,220
 If you went into prison and you had killed a guy, I know a lot of people have gone to

542
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,180
 prison, done prison time, but one of them I was close friend to.

543
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,740
 He's doing 17 for life right now for stabbing a man to death.

544
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,740
 When he was 18 years old, he had just turned 18.

545
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,460
 One was high on meth and he stabbed the guy in the heart with a steak knife.

546
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,180
 We talked about that in yesterday's episode too.

547
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
 Don't do that.

548
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,860
 Stabbed a man in front of this man's girlfriend and toddler.

549
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
 Killed him.

550
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,860
 Died around on the kitchen floor.

551
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,860
 One stab right through the chest.

552
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
 Killed him.

553
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,780
 He's doing 17 to life.

554
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,020
 And he's well-adjusted in prison.

555
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,620
 And that would suck, right?

556
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:36,500
 I'm not saying that it would be great, but there's like bank robbery would be, bank

557
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,940
 robbery would be kind of cool to get caught for my list, my bucket list of crimes I want

558
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
 to commit.

559
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,460
 A skyjacking would be keen.

560
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,940
 You know what I mean versus this stuff, because yeah, sure you might get harassed if you're,

561
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,620
 if you killed a couple people, right?

562
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,300
 You might get harassed if you killed a couple people from a rival gang, but you guys know

563
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,460
 what I mean, right?

564
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:04,020
 If you went to prison because you skyjacked a 747 and then got beat up by Harrison Ford,

565
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,220
 the actor not playing the character from Air Force One, 90 year old Harrison Ford beat

566
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,020
 you up and then flew the plane and landed it in O'Hare Airport.

567
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,940
 You would be considered a pretty cool guy, even though you lost a fight to a 90 year old

568
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
 man.

569
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,020
 You took over a plane.

570
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,980
 And it wouldn't be fun to be in prison for 20 years at all, but if you're going to be

571
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,180
 in prison for 20 years, do something dope, right?

572
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:35,180
 And then I've read that statement six weeks into a 20 year sentence and I thought, what's

573
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
 so interesting about this?

574
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,660
 Because I'm a couple years older than this guy.

575
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,980
 I'm going to be 46 in two months.

576
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,300
 When I was 20 years old, I got in a lot of fist fights, right?

577
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:49,260
 When I was in my 20s, I was constantly getting in trouble, constantly having to talk my way

578
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,580
 out of situations or fight my way out of situations.

579
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,300
 And in the back of your mind, when you're 20 years old, in the back of your mind, you're

580
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,700
 thinking, this could go south really quickly, like my friend's friend who got in a fight

581
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,900
 and then a knife got pulled out and then he got the knife away from him and killed the

582
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,420
 other guy.

583
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,340
 You know, within a moment, he went from being the victim to the aggressor and killed the

584
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,580
 guy into 15 years.

585
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
 But we're all in our 20s, right?

586
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,460
 And I think, yeah, you know, I might get caught, I might accidentally punch someone and they

587
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,060
 fall down and they crack their head open and die.

588
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,540
 These are all things that you know of when you get in a street fight.

589
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,620
 And a lot of times, you know, you're just drunk, you're stumbling out of a bar, walking

590
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,740
 out of a street or whatever and you're getting these drunken brawls.

591
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,620
 So you're not really thinking.

592
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:34,380
 But when you're in your 20s, when I was in my 20s especially, the idea of doing 20 years

593
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,380
 in prison, whatever, I'm 20.

594
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,540
 Again, I wasn't looking for it.

595
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,660
 And I never did anything that would get me 20 years in prison.

596
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,540
 You know, like generally that is like skyjacking or murder or something like that.

597
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,460
 Which I mean, you get in a brawl, something bad happens and someone gets seriously injured,

598
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,460
 somebody dies.

599
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
 You'd get 20 years in prison.

600
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,140
 You're 20 years old, you're 22 years old, you're 25 years old, whatever.

601
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,380
 You can't really comprehend 20 years because you've only been alive for that period of

602
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,880
 time.

603
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,300
 So you do something dumb, you make a mistake or maybe you are a psychopath and you get

604
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,620
 arrested when you're 20, 22 and you get sentenced to 20 years.

605
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
 You get out when you're 42.

606
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,740
 You've got a whole life ahead of you.

607
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,140
 You can't comprehend it and even when it does happen because you've only been alive for

608
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,820
 that period of time.

609
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:30,220
 And that included baby time to you standing under the street light somewhere in Orangeville

610
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,260
 throwing punches at some dude you've never met before.

611
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,100
 And someone goes south, well you can't really comprehend a block of 20 years.

612
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,300
 But when you're 40 or 46, I am totally aware of what 20 years is.

613
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,620
 I've lived 20 years and then another 20 years.

614
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:54,500
 So for this guy to be 40 years old and to be sentenced to half of his existing life

615
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 already.

616
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,460
 He's 40 years old and now he has to do the next 20 years in prison for a disgusting crime

617
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,820
 that he will get no sympathy from anybody except these weirdos on Reddit.

618
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,180
 40 years old.

619
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,660
 He will get out when he's 60.

620
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,820
 And most states don't have time off for good behavior for sex crimes.

621
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,220
 So he will get out when most people are thinking about retiring.

622
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,700
 This is what's happened to him in six weeks of 20 years.

623
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,660
 I still have a hard time covering that.

624
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,300
 I have a 20 year sentence.

625
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,180
 All of his money is gone.

626
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,060
 The inmates are basically making him take the money because what happens is you can send

627
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,580
 money to someone's books.

628
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,000
 You send them into the commissary books and then the inmate can use that money to buy

629
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,940
 stuff like toothpaste, new shoes, little treats like top ramen or bags of Ritz crackers.

630
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,620
 That's ironic.

631
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,380
 And Meredith said when he was in jail I'd put money on his books and there would be

632
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
 no problem.

633
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,620
 But since he's been sent to this prison sorting center, which will then decide what prison

634
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,900
 he eventually ends up in, I put a bunch of money on his books so he could get some nice

635
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
 stuff.

636
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
 It's gone.

637
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,860
 It's all gone.

638
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,380
 He got basically extorted and they took all of his money.

639
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,520
 People will say give me your money and I'll protect you, but when that money runs out

640
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,720
 so does the protection.

641
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,160
 And it's quite possible that the guards themselves were telling other inmates, hey this guy's

642
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,360
 a real piece of work and he has $200 on his books this week.

643
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,160
 You know, something happens.

644
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,240
 He says at one point he woke up in his cell at 1am.

645
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,320
 There was another inmate standing in his cell.

646
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,740
 Not the inmate he was bunking with.

647
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:49,180
 Someone had gotten into his locked cell and Meredith goes he didn't tell me what happened

648
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
 after that.

649
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,620
 He just is telling me things aren't going good.

650
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
 Imagine that.

651
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,620
 Imagine like you lived in an environment with vicious criminals.

652
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:07,460
 Your neighbors are murderers and skyjackers and bank robbers.

653
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,420
 And then someone just walking to your house dude.

654
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,280
 Your little cell at one in the morning you're supposed to at least say you're in jail.

655
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,640
 People shouldn't be in prison.

656
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,320
 People shouldn't be able to get in and out of their cells, but you wake up at one in

657
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,180
 the morning there's a dude there standing there.

658
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:27,340
 And that's week six of 20 years.

659
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,500
 It's so insane to me.

660
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,080
 This saga, right?

661
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,480
 You could say Jason you say it's true crime and progress.

662
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,000
 We don't know how it ends, but this will probably be the last time she posts.

663
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 At this point she calls him her ex.

664
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,900
 So I believe a divorce has happened a couple months too late as far as I'm concerned.

665
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,700
 And he's in prison so the criminal justice system has ended, but this guy is now in

666
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:02,780
 the North Carolina prison system six weeks into a 20 year sentence and life is rough.

667
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:10,880
 He's a great color worker raised by a good family, brought up in the Episcopal Church.

668
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,160
 20 years.

669
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,560
 And if the story can't get any weirder, another thing that I love about this story is we get

670
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,880
 to see the mindset of the person telling it.

671
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,420
 Whatever happens to Joe on his journey through the North Carolina prison system, we won't

672
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420
 ever know.

673
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,820
 Again, that's not a real name.

674
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,980
 She's not posting anymore.

675
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,980
 Who knows?

676
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
 Maybe she'll post something.

677
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,700
 The people on the subreddit said, "Listen, sorting centers are really bad once he gets

678
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,460
 sent to an actual prison prison in North Carolina.

679
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,380
 Things may settle down, but who knows?"

680
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,740
 Even they were like, "Yeah, it can get really rough.

681
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,260
 It can get really, really rough."

682
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:01,200
 Their advice was quit putting money on his books, but if he's paying protection money,

683
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,640
 he doesn't have any money to pay protection for.

684
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,200
 Imagine again, like he's never thought about that stuff.

685
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,720
 He wasn't getting in street fights.

686
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,280
 The civilian through and through.

687
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,160
 Now he's having to think about commissary and getting killed every day, right?

688
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,680
 When you grow up in a bad neighborhood, when they talk about kids being institutionalized,

689
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,420
 being through elementary school, you're fighting in middle school, you drop out of high school,

690
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,420
 you go to prison.

691
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,820
 It's just like, "Okay, this is what happens.

692
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,780
 It's tragic."

693
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,500
 But this dude never was, he wasn't getting in fights.

694
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,340
 He wasn't doing all these minor crimes and doing some time in juvie and then doing like

695
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:44,220
 a couple years for car theft in prison when he's like 18, 19, and that.

696
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,100
 No, he just goes from being an upstanding citizen to 20 years in North Carolina prison

697
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,100
 system.

698
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,100
 Totally boggles my mind.

699
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,700
 Let's wrap it up by taking a look at Meredith.

700
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,860
 Because this is so fascinating.

701
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,860
 I find this so interesting.

702
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:06,200
 The ability to lie to yourself and to change the narrative, even though we can look and

703
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,780
 see the narrative that Meredith posted herself.

704
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,340
 Let's take a look at this.

705
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,420
 Remember how this started off?

706
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,380
 She said, "If he committed these crimes, it was due to alcohol, it was due to stress,

707
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,020
 he was blackout drunk, he had a lot of stuff going on."

708
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,780
 If he committed this crime, remember she only knew of the one victim to begin with.

709
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,900
 If he committed this crime, it was because of these things, but I've seen zero evidence

710
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,460
 that he had any attraction to children.

711
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,380
 She's really defending him, blaming on the alcohol, blaming on the stress.

712
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:43,340
 You'll get people going to the sexual offender subreddit to quote unquote troll.

713
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,020
 So you get these people to pop up from time to time and this dude jumped up and said,

714
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:52,140
 when she was talking about this stuff, they accused her of protecting a child molester.

715
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,260
 When she was talking about, you know, how do I send him money, what should I do?

716
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,940
 They're like, you're being gross.

717
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,300
 Like, why are you even protecting a child molester?

718
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,900
 Why do you even care about how he's doing in prison?

719
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,020
 And she responded with this.

720
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,580
 Someone said, "So you're protecting a child molester?"

721
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
 Question mark.

722
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,420
 And she responded with this, "Nope.

723
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,500
 I'm the one who reported him."

724
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,740
 I highly doubt that's true.

725
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,980
 Highly, highly doubt that's true.

726
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,780
 Because remember in the beginning, she didn't even believe that it happened.

727
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,940
 But here we are from August 2020 to July 2022.

728
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,580
 No, she was the one who reported him in the first place.

729
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,260
 Now listen, it's possible, right, that her child came to her and told her this and then

730
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,220
 she reported him to the authorities.

731
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,940
 But there is no, she did not make that statement at all until he is locked away in a federal

732
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,940
 prison.

733
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,660
 She actually was saying, I don't believe, there's zero evidence that this could have

734
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,660
 happened.

735
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,660
 He was really stressed out.

736
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,300
 He was, if it happened, remember, that's what's so interesting because she's using terms

737
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,580
 like, if he committed these crimes, it was when he was barred out drunk.

738
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,460
 But now she's saying she's the one who reported him.

739
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,940
 Maybe she did report him in the beginning, but I just find that so suspect.

740
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,820
 You make excuses, excuses, you're talking about plea deals.

741
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,580
 Why would you want plea deals for someone that you turned in?

742
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
 Nope.

743
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,380
 I'm the one who reported him.

744
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:36,340
 My personal read on that as a hammock psychologist is, the narrative is changing.

745
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,580
 The story is changing.

746
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:46,740
 To go from someone who stood by their man to, really in a disgusting way, right?

747
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,020
 Stood by her man while he was being accused of these horrible crimes against their own

748
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,020
 children.

749
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,740
 Again, it would be bad for anyone's children, but against their own children.

750
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:01,020
 And yet now she is the person who turned him in.

751
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,980
 She's the hero of the story.

752
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:13,660
 It's fascinating to take a look at a family that completely fell apart, a matter of months.

753
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,380
 Right?

754
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,740
 Watching this play out.

755
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,220
 She, a lot of people think plea deals are easy.

756
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,420
 You get a plea deal, you do three years.

757
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,580
 I'm sure the plea deal was 20.

758
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,580
 Right?

759
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,740
 He could have gotten 50 or he could have gotten life.

760
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,380
 We don't know exactly what the crimes are.

761
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,380
 I don't want to know.

762
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,660
 I don't want details on this type of stuff.

763
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,660
 I don't want to know.

764
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,940
 But the plea deal would have been 20 years.

765
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,780
 A lot of people go, "Oh, they're offering a plea deal, then it'll just be three years."

766
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,780
 No, no, no, no.

767
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,060
 Plead deals can still be high.

768
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:50,660
 To go from the person who is defending the perpetrator, if he committed it, to at the

769
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:57,780
 end of the saga, the last post where they state, "I'm the one who turned him in."

770
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,780
 Fascinating story of true crime.

771
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,340
 It's one I wish I didn't have to cover.

772
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
 Right?

773
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,780
 It's one that I wish this crime never took place.

774
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:08,980
 And I think if that's fair to say, with all true crime we cover, but a man in prison,

775
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,860
 a 40-year-old man in prison for the next 20 years for committing one of the most disgusting

776
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:18,260
 crimes, and now he's prey to the predators in that prison.

777
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,580
 And then his wife changing the narrative.

778
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,580
 Fascinating.

779
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,700
 Look, at human suffering and the way the human mind works.

780
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:37,580

 Bye.

789
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,520
 (upbeat music)
