1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 How close are we to an actual second American Civil War?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Baby Time Warps and Spooky Ghosts today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Hey everyone, I'm Jason Carpenter. Thanks for tuning in to Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 It's a kind of warm night. I don't have any fans. I wonder how easy the show is going to be to record in the winter time when it's super cold and I can't run a heater.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 We'll find out, I guess. I plan on still doing it by then.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I hope everyone had a good day today. Uh, yeah, that probably wasn't the best way to start off the show.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm sure that you guys have heard about that horrible shooting of that newspaper, that newspaper office.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 So it's come out that apparently the reason why he went in and shot up a newspaper was because they wrote an article on him called "Jarrod Wants to Be Your Friend"

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 where he had been accused or convicted of stalking someone on Facebook, a former high school student on Facebook, and he sued the newspaper and lost the case.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 He sued the newspaper and the girl he was stalking and the judge who was over the stalking case and he lost that case and he just thought he was treated so unfairly.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And then that was probably, I think, in 2014 or something like that.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And then today he walked into the newspaper office and shot by people.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 You know, here's the thing. There's a lot of stuff that's going to happen to people in life.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's going to make you think that you only have one way to deal with it.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 This guy, you know, all of us have done, gotten really angry and thought about doing stupid stuff in our life.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And 99% of the time we don't do it and guess what life goes on?

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 The things that you think were so important, they're not important anymore.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 You can look back two years, five years, ten years, and the farther back you look the more you're like, "Man, that really wasn't as important as I thought it was."

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And I almost went to jail or got horribly injured or horribly hurt somebody else over that.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And I'm glad that I didn't.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And this guy's going to be facing this decision for the rest of his life.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Yes, five people are dead and all of the people there who had to witness that and all the family members and this gentleman's family has to deal with it.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But most importantly, he's going to remember for the rest of his life, he's going to be thinking, "Oh, man, I can't believe I made that decision."

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And he could have not have made that decision.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And all we can do ourselves is to not make those decisions.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Whenever we get that angry, whenever we let that pressure build in us, we have to find another way to release it.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 You have to find another way to release it.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Otherwise you will regret it and other people will regret it.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And I've come across, I've had some rough stuff happen to me in my life and there's been some rough circumstances that I've gotten into the middle of.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And, you know, you just have to step back.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 There are decisions that I made that had I made the opposite decision I wouldn't be here.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And that's a fact that I'm aware of every day.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 So, I don't know, it's unfortunately too late for this guy and it's too late for his victims, but it's not too late for other people.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And if you feel like you need help, never hesitate to reach out to people around you or to professional organizations.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 If you're ever having feelings like this, take care of that.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Okay, so we're starting off a little dour, but I felt like we had to get that out.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Now let's go ahead and get the show going on a better note.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So, you know, I've talked a lot about Venus and I talked about how I would tell people that Venus was, I thought, had a jungle on it.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Because that's what I read in a book and no one ever corrected me.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And I remember mentioning that at one time to my dad and he never corrected me.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 He did correct me on the whale thing when I asked him if whales lived to be 500 years old and he's like, "No, where did you read that?"

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And I was thinking about it today too. I'm starting to think my parents, as much as they love me, they may have thought I was mentally retarded.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And I don't mean that as an insult because the reason why I say that is because if your son comes up to you and he's, you know, 13, 14 years old and tells you that there is a jungle on Venus and you don't correct them,

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 the reason why you don't correct them is because you kind of feel bad for them because that's probably the most...

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 You kind of are like, "Man, oh Lil Jason, hopefully society will take care of you."

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 The other day, I remember this the other day, when I was probably older than that, I think I might have been 15, I told my mom, I said, "I can prove evolution is not real.

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I have proof that evolution is not real." And my mom said, "Okay." And I said, "If we evolved randomly from monkeys, why do clothes fit us?"

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 My mom didn't respond to that. She didn't tell me, she didn't say, "Well, we made clothes to fit us. We didn't find clothes in the wilderness. We don't grow on trees. We have bodies and we put clothes on them.

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That's why clothes... But she didn't say anything of that. She didn't say anything like that at all.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And I never really thought... It was a couple days later, and I was like, "Oh, wait a second. We invented clothes. So clothes don't prove that evolution doesn't exist."

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 But I wonder what my mom was thinking when I said that. Was my mom thinking, "Yep, my husband's right. He might actually be mentally retarded."

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I remember my husband telling me that Jason thought dinosaurs lived on Venus, and now Jason has just come up to me and told me if evolution was true, why do clothes fit us?

53
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Oh, I hope society can take care of young Jason.

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I understand parents only want the best for their children, but at a certain point, it's like, Jason.

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 That's the most ridiculous thing one human being has ever said to another human being.

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 But no one ever called me out on it, and the end result is I end up having a podcast 30 years later where I talk about other nonsense stuff.

57
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And one of those nonsense things we're going to talk about is one of my favorite subjects, warps of all kinds.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I like time warps and dimensional warps and holes to other universes, black holes, white holes. I think white holes are fascinating, actually.

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But we have a new one.

60
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Now, when I said baby time warps in the beginning, I thought, you know what, people are probably going to think I'm talking about a time warp that affects babies.

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And while that would be awesome, while that would be actually a womb, I guess, is kind of a baby time warp because of like, baby comes out of it.

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Like, it starts off with like nothing. Anyways, the, so let's get back on topic.

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So there is apparently a new time warp, i.e. a baby time warp, near Las Vegas.

64
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And now, of course, the first headline of this, I love journalists.

65
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 My degree is in journalism. I love it. And one of the things I love, I love two things about journalism.

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I love the research. I love reading very well research stuff. We're going to go over that later.

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 But I also love opening lines of articles, which is a lost art because now with a lot of click baby stuff, they just kind of get you there.

68
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 It's all about the headline, the click baby headline. When you see articles have good opening lines, that's usually a sign of like a quote unquote classically trained journalist,

69
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 rather than being like, yep, I watched the last Jedi for five times last week and I'll tell you, no, you want to give them like a little hook.

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Here's the hook for this article. I'll put the link, I'll put the link in.

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Okay, so this is about a time warp in Vegas. Apparently what happens in Vegas may not actually stay in Vegas.

72
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I like that. I like that. A little smarmy, a little factual.

73
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So anyways, this paranormal researcher, which seems like an oxymoron sometimes, named Joshua Warren, claims he's the first person to ever discover a time warp,

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 which I will disagree with. I'm sure many people have discovered time warps before they've just fallen into them.

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But anyways, he said that he has, so apparently he has this device called a differential time rate meter, also known as a DT meter,

76
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 which I'm sure he just made up and it's some sort of like pocket radio.

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 But he was able to record a measurement showing time had been slowing down for 20 microseconds,

78
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 something that laws of physics prove should not occur.

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So in this warp area, time has slowed down for 20 microseconds.

80
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Now, there's a couple theories. One, is that he's making it up.

81
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Two, his equipment is faulty.

82
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Three, he doesn't know how to work his equipment. Four, the equipment is made up. Or five, there actually is a time warp there.

83
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Now, you can obviously pick whatever one of those fives suits you better.

84
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 My thing is, let's say there is a time warp there, and the only thing it does is it slows down time 20 microseconds, and it can be verifiably tested.

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I would say something like that, I think something like that probably scientifically could happen.

86
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 We'll get out of the paranormal thing right now, and it's a time warp to dinosaur land.

87
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And as science goes out, and they run on this stuff, and they're like, "Yeah, gravity works different here."

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Like, not works different, but the time is so based on pull of gravity, that you could say, "Yeah, there's something, there's like a huge iron deposit under here," or whatever.

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 So yeah, it slows down 20 microseconds as opposed to anyone else, and everyone packs up all their stuff.

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 There's always a thing like, you can have something that's like a quote unquote time warp, because technically time is being warped.

91
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 But that's not what we're talking about. When we talk about time warps, we're talking about you, like cavemen are crawling out of it, and like you're fighting, you know, robots from the future.

92
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 A time differential of 20 microseconds, leave that to the nerds in the lab.

93
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I want a warp that I like fall through, and then I'm like showing knights of the round table how to make gunpowder, which technically I don't know how to make gunpowder either.

94
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 But the point being is that that's a time warp. A UFO is not a little light in the sky that does zigzags and then disappears.

95
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 A UFO is an alien dropship. It's like an actual like shuttle craft with engines coming down and aliens disembarking and being like,

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 "We will cure your cancer if you give us people," or "choo choo choo choo choo choo!"

97
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 That's when people talk about aliens, that's what we mean.

98
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 You can point up in the sky, like if I go out with you into the woods, which I do not recommend going into the woods with me, but if we go out into the woods,

99
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 and you're like, "Hey, there's UFOs here," and you point up in the sky and I see little orange and blue lights like doing zigzags and flying around and disappearing, I'm gonna be like,

100
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 "Oh, okay, maybe that is UFOs." I don't care, but even if that is UFOs, that's totally lame. That is the lamest UFO.

101
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And they're like, "No, no, it's like intelligence from another planet." And if you came all the way from Alpha Centauri and all you can do is fly around in our sky doing zigzags, you're lame.

102
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 That's totally lame. I want to see hovercraft coming so close over the forest line, like squirrels are getting blown out of trees and stuff.

103
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 I want to see aliens disembarking in battle armor, or you can be the peaceful, stupid nerd aliens too with your glasses and your lab coats and wanting to make peace, fine, whatever.

104
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 But I would prefer the aliens that were wrestling. You know what actually bugs me the most is environmental aliens.

105
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I always hear stories about aliens and they're like, "Look, duck people," and they'll be like, "We have abducted you because your planet is environmental danger.

106
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Only if you change your ways will you..." That's so stupid. That is the... I would be so pissed if I got abducted by an alien and they lectured me on environmental concerns.

107
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 I'd be like, "Probe me, please." That would be so annoying.

108
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Give me the aliens who are like the Spock aliens, the Vulcans who are like, "They want to be peaceful, but maybe they're a little bit badass on the side, but they're like, "Hey, we want you to join this galactic union and we're relatively peaceful."

109
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I'll take those guys or give me the like, Rockham Sockham aliens. If I get abducted by a hippie alien, I'm going to be pissed.

110
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 So yeah, that's the thing. We talk about aliens. We talk about UFOs. We want aliens. We talk about time warps. I'd show me like a portal. Don't show me like a gravity sink.

111
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to the next topic. I think I'm going to do the Civil War one real quick, because a lot of people are concerned about it.

112
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 They view even did an episode on it. So a lot of people are concerned about the Second American Civil War and people like 31% of Americans think it'll happen in the next five years.

113
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I'm going to cover this real briefly, because it's actually kind of no nonsense. Here's the thing about the next American Civil War. Whoever starts it loses. That's the key.

114
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Because you're going to have, we have the government and you have the people and the average person in any country, America, Syria, China, wherever, they want to keep their kids healthy.

115
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They want to have a job. They want to drive around in their car. They want to enjoy their weekends. They want things to be relatively stable.

116
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 So whoever pops off first loses. That's just the way it's going to be. You can say the government is more right leaning, but if a bunch of right-winger militias start blowing stuff up, the government's not going to take that threat and go, "Ah, you know, it's whatever."

117
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 They will shut that down so quickly and the people who just want to go about their lives and raise their kids will also be like, "Shut it down, because it's affecting my life."

118
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Here's the thing, though. We have the left wing is mostly in the coastal cities and the big cities, and of course we're pretty evenly mixed when we look at voting patterns.

119
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 If they pop off, the Civil War lasts the year max, because the government will just choke out the cities and stop their supplies from coming in.

120
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 If the right wing flips out and it's the middle of a nation, it's going to be a far more long-drawn out war just because of the land mass. It's going to be hard.

121
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But again, it's not like they're going to have supply line issues and things like that. They have no navy.

122
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 It's actually fairly well balanced. The first American Civil War, the only American Civil War, was everyone had coastline and everyone had inland, and they both had supplies and they both had foreign allies and stuff like that.

123
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 My point is, I guess really I'm saying also, don't be too concerned about it, because everyone sees themselves as the heroes of this new revolution or this new Civil War,

124
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 and they always fail. These people jump up and they're like, "We're going to take this great action, we're going to inspire others to take action, so we're going to kill a bunch of cops, or we're going to blow up a bunch of abortion clinics,

125
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 or we're going to do this stuff and it's going to organize people, and they're going to... People just want to live their lives."

126
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 It takes a lot to push the average person to actually back a Civil War. We're not there yet.

127
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 All of this bleeding on Twitter, and all of these talking heads on the news, and all these tweets, and I already said that with Twitter, but you know what I mean?

128
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 It's echo chamber stuff. People are freaking out. We're not there yet. So don't be too concerned about it.

129
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I mean, obviously you should always be prepared with supplies and things like that in case something goes wrong, and I honestly probably want to want to live in a big city, but I think we'll be fine.

130
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So, I do... I just want to cover that real quickly. A lot of people are scared about it. I'm necessarily not.

131
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Although, where I'm at would kind of suck, because we'd probably get steamrolled as they're on their way to Portland if they're attacking the cities.

132
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 But, so, I want to talk about ghosts, and that's one of the topics that I haven't really talked about much.

133
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now, ghosts is kind of an overwhelming topic. There's so many types of ghosts, stuff like that.

134
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Now, I have a book. It's one of my favorite books of all time. I've actually bought multiple copies of it.

135
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 It's a book that I not only got signed by the author. I interviewed him when I was a journalist.

136
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I have bought copies for other people. I've given out my copies to people, and this book is called The National Directory of Haunted Places.

137
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I'm going to put the link below. It is the best book for ghost aficionados.

138
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And what it is, it is nearly every place in the United States with not only a description of the haunting, but address and contact information if you want to visit there.

139
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 It's amazing. It's an encyclopedia of ghosts, basically.

140
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Dennis William Halk, H-A-U-C-K.

141
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Nice guy, great author. It's a great book. It's a great competing.

142
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 We talked a lot about ghosts and the paranormal when I interviewed him. I'll save that information for later.

143
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Anyway, so I've been going through his book, and I found one. I found a story I wanted to talk about.

144
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 It's in Illinois. It's Hickory Hill. It's this old house. Illinois was not a slave state.

145
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 This guy bought this house. I don't remember his name. Let's see if I can see it real quick.

146
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It doesn't matter. It matters, because I saw it now.

147
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 John Crenshaw had this house, right? It's Hickory Hill.

148
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It was a three-story house. The first story was the den area, the living room and all that stuff.

149
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 The second story was where his wife and his kids slept.

150
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And in the third story, he kept slaves. He kept slaves because he owned a salt mining operation, because salt was super valuable back then.

151
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 He would capture free blacks and sell them into slavery.

152
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Black people would just be walking around because Illinois was not a slave state, and he would capture them and send them south.

153
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 He would also hire night writers, which is awesome as the name that is.

154
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's not that awesome, because they were people who caught runaway slaves.

155
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 He had night writers working for him. That name sounds awesome.

156
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 He had night writers working for him, and they would kidnap black people and take runaway slaves.

157
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Then he would keep them up here, up in his slave house, and then he would ship them back south.

158
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 When he sold them, he bred slaves up there. There's a horrible guy all around.

159
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 He died eventually because everybody dies. Then they ended up, you know, other people bought the house.

160
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It became this fame. Oh, and he got discovered for kicking the shit out of somebody, beating up a slave woman.

161
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Then they were like, "Wait a second. Oh, wait. You know what? Okay, so I skipped a couple things."

162
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Anyways, he was super successful. He was so rich at one point, he paid 1/7 of the taxes for the state of Illinois.

163
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 That's how much money he had. He just had a ton of money.

164
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Then one day he got arrested for beating up a slave woman.

165
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Here he goes. He was indicted for kidnapping a free black woman and her children.

166
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Again, this guy was super wealthy. Imagine if all of a sudden Bill Gates found out was running like a Filipino slavery ring.

167
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 He got indicted for that, but he wasn't put in jail, but he started losing civil court actions.

168
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 He started getting a lot of civil court actions against him.

169
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 More salt disposits were uncovered, so he was losing business.

170
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Then finally, a slave went nuts and chopped his leg off.

171
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 After that, he's like, "No more slaves." That was his wake up call. He's like, "Dude, these guys are nuts."

172
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Anyways, he dies eventually. They sell the house to these other people.

173
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 The attic is super haunted by all the ghost slaves. They're singing old slave songs, like hymns and stuff like that.

174
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 What was weird about this was that amateur exorcists said, "I'm going to spend the night in the attic and I will get rid of the ghosts."

175
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 He ended up running out of the attic, heifer through the night, and died a couple hours later.

176
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Then the legend started that no one can stay in the house until midnight, or stay in the house all night.

177
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 No one can stay on the third floor all night.

178
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Then people just started doing that over and over and over again, trying to do it, and nobody could do it.

179
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Eventually, a fire broke out in the house, and the owners were like, "Okay, no more tricks, no more people spend in the night."

180
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Finally, in 1978, a journalist was like, "I want to try to spend the night in the mansion."

181
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 The homeowners were like, "Okay."

182
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 He stayed the whole night, and he said, "It was really creepy up there. I heard a bunch of stuff, and I couldn't understand it."

183
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 He said he recorded some voices, but of course, that was back in the 70s, so any recording is gone now.

184
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 That's the story of the Hill House, what is that? What is it called? Hickory Hill.

185
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 That's the story of Hickory Hill. The house is still standing to this day.

186
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 What's weird is that it has 24-hour security around it. You can't get in it anymore.

187
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 No one's using it. They're talking about the state buying it, because it is a local piece of history, because it's the only place where slavery was in Illinois.

188
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Here's my thing. I've got a couple things to say about it.

189
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 First off, I'm going to link you to this article very, very when I was talking about investigative journalism.

190
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 This article is super well researched. I just had a great time reading it. It really goes into the history of Illinois, and the history of this Crenshaw guy, and everything like that.

191
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It's just a fascinating read. I love well-researched stuff.

192
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Secondly, I can understand you wanting to have security around your estate, because it's an old house and stuff like that.

193
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 I think the only reason why you would have 24-hour security around a house like that is if it really was haunted.

194
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I can understand you having security around a house at night, because you're afraid someone's going to break into it.

195
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 But why would you pay for 24-hour security if the house really wasn't haunted, and you didn't want people going up there and just getting beat up by ghosts, and then suing you?

196
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I don't see any other reason. I mean, I guess if you didn't want people vandalizing your house is a pretty good reason.

197
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 But you know what I mean? I would be more concerned that people would break in, and then you would never find them again, and then the mom sues you, and you're like, "Well, maybe the ghost got him?"

198
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I don't know. I don't know. Does that make any sense?

199
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I guess that's probably a common question you ask while listening to the show, if that makes any sense.

200
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 But 24-hour surveillance just seems pretty extreme for just a house in the middle of nowhere.

201
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Although, I don't know if it's actually in the middle of nowhere, I'm just assuming that, but yeah, I think it probably is haunted.

202
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 What would suck if you were a ghost is that you were a ghost trapped in a slave house.

203
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 That's the one thing I don't get about ghosts, is if you're a ghost, why would you hang out in the most miserable place ever?

204
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I would hang out in a movie theater.

205
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 If I was a ghost and I could float around, because obviously you can't, or you're at least invisible, you could sneak out the door and then just go to a movie theater,

206
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 or I would probably hang out. If I was a ghost, actually, I'd go underwater. I'd go walk around the bottom of the ocean and see what's down there.

207
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 But I don't buy the whole thing that, "Oh no, that's where a lot of tragedy happens, so that's where your ghost is stuck."

208
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Because spoiler alert, a lot of tragedies happen everywhere on the planet.

209
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Technically, you're a human Nagasaki. Shouldn't that be full of ghosts? Shouldn't there be 100,000 ghosts?

210
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 If you're going to do your laundry and the ghost is like, "Don't mind me. I've only been here a full 50 years."

211
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 There should be ghosts everywhere in those cities. There should be ghosts everywhere in every city.

212
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 The reason why they're not is either because ghosts don't exist, or ghosts are all at the bottom of the ocean, or in movie theaters.

213
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Okay, so I think that's going to wrap it up for this episode. We are going to be back tomorrow, as we all want to do, with another great episode.

214
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I think we're going to talk about... There was a particular thing. Oh yeah, yeah. I have some good stories for you tomorrow.

215
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 I like today's stories, though. I got my ghost story in, and we got the baby time warp.

216
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 The Civil War thing, we kind of glossed over, but, you know, again, it's not something I'm too worried about myself.

217
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I've been lived through Mayan, Indian, you know, Mayan calendars, and Nostradamus, the rise of the Antichrist, and Y2K, and the African rainforest being destroyed,

218
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 and Mad Max in the United States, and Nuclear Armageddon during the '80s. I've lived through so many horrible catastrophes that the media told me was going to happen tomorrow.

219
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And I'm still here, and you're still here. And everyone can be talking and beating the war drums, but remember, fear cells.

220
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Fear cells, and that's really what they're trying to get you to do. I know this show can be a little spooky.

221
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 It'll be a little spooky. I know you're afraid to go to Vegas now, because you might be 20 microseconds behind the rest of the world, but just remember, you know, they're just doing that.

222
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 In a week, two weeks from now, they'll be on to another story. They'll be talking about some other great catastrophe that's about to befall all of us or the world, or stuff like that.

223
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And just don't let it get you down. Always, you know, always keep your head up, and if you ever do, start to get too angry or too depressed.

224
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Remember, there's always people you can reach out to. So I want to go ahead and end on that note. You can always reach out to me.

225
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Email is deadrabbitradio@gmail.com. Website is deadrabbit.com. You can hit me up on Twitter @jasonocarpenter.

226
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I'm on there. I don't check Twitter that much, but I definitely check the email every day. And again, I think you guys are listening to the podcast.

227
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 We are going to pump out another 85 of these at the least. That's the goal. I don't see any reason why we can't hit that goal.

228
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And then we'll go from there. So I am out. Still don't have a slogan, but we'll see you tomorrow.

229
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:10,000
