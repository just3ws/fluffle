00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 Today is the beginning of Cursed episodes week. Every episode this week will be cursed,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,240
 so be prepared for spooky things to come out of your headphones and into your life.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
 Or just don't listen this week, you can do that as well.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,320
 First off, is there any truth to the story that Lady Gaga actually predicted 9/11,

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,880
 20 years after it happened? She waited this long to warn us.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,520
 And then we travel to the Philippines to meet a man who believes that watching

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,040
 spooky movies can invite demons into your life. I've heard that story since I was a kid.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,840
 However, he believes that Annabelle the Doll will actually come out of the movie

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,000
 and crawl into your soul today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,240
 Carbinar, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm actually sick.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,120
 I'm not having a great day, but it's a perfect time to start Cursed

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
 episodes week because in Cursed, with physical illness right now,

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,160
 have a headache, feel a little under the weather. It's not coronavirus.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,680
 It's just the other million viruses that exist in the world that I'm inflicted with.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
 This is a short week, I did have to take a long weekend, it's a terrible time to get sick,

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,480
 but what are you gonna do? I thank everyone for your patience.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,480
 Because we only have three episodes this week, I decided I have a couple of Cursed

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,080
 topics I've been sitting on. Not the second one, not tomorrow's episode. That one I just

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,960
 stumbled across and it's horrible, but we're gonna cover some Cursed episodes. So listen

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,760
 with caution. This episode I'm gonna be mentioning some demon names at the ending. I don't think

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,440
 it's gonna cause anything to happen to you, but if it does, welcome to Cursed episodes week.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,520
 But let's get the show started here. Let's introduce our newest Patreon supporter walking

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,360
 into Dead Rabbit Command. He's riding on the back of a dragon. It's a tiny dragon, has to be able

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,240
 to fit into the headquarters, but it's an adorable looking dragon. It looks like little foot from

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,880
 Land Before Time. That's just a Brontosaurus. Coming in on Brontosaurus, it's Adam Weil and

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,040
 everyone give a round of applause to Adam. He was all dressed up in like dragon armor,

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,760
 he had all this cool medieval stuff that he's walking in on a cartoon Brontosaurus. He's like,

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,840
 "Oh man, I gotta feed this stupid thing hay and stuff." Like yes, Adam. And while you're feeding

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
 little foot hay, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,400
 Patreon or if you guys don't feed hay to things, that's okay too. Just help spread the word about

32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,560
 the show. Really, really helps out a lot. We gotta get started. So Adam, I'm gonna touch the keys to

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,360
 the Dead Rabbit Dirgeable. Let's push little foot on board. He's on the rest of the adventures.

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,680
 He's gonna be cursed as well. Adam, I want you to take us out of Dead Rabbit Command and I want

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,520
 you to take us out to Hollywood, California. The reason why we're flying over Hollywood is because

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,040
 of the newest conspiracy theory that's hitting the internet. Two people believe in it. One person came

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,840
 up with it. One person believes in it. But who knows what is going to come of this? You're

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,600
 really covering a story. Only two people believe. Well, here's the thing. It got taken off of the

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,040
 subreddit conspiracy no poll, which is conspiracy subreddit no politics. So someone's trying to

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,760
 stop this story from getting out either that either that or their excuse of low quality content.

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,880
 One of the two, but nothing's low quality for Dead Rabbit Radio. I find this absolutely fascinating,

42
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,760
 not ingest actually find this fascinating. I cover so many conspiracy theories. I read

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,400
 three to four times the amount of stuff that I actually put on the show. A lot of stuff I dismiss

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,640
 as ARGs or LARPs or they're just dumb, just dumb conspiracy theories. This one's super basic. It's

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,480
 really easy. And I just don't know what to make of it. So if you went to the store in January,

46
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
 these were limited edition. I don't think they have them anymore, but there's photos,

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,080
 photographic evidence of this remains. There are Lady Gaga Oreo cookies for her new album Chromatic,

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,240
 which actually came out last year. So an Oreo headquarters, they're thinking, ladies and gentlemen,

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,800
 how do we get people to buy cookies based after a pop star? We can put her name on the whole box,

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,360
 someone says, and they go, that's a great idea. But they don't know me, how do they know there's

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,720
 Oreos in there? Maybe it's just the box of Lady Gaga. If you buy five of them, you can build a

52
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,280
 giant Lady Gaga yourself. Actually a normal sized Lady Gaga. I think she's like five foot one.

53
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
 But people sit around and they go, you're right. We want to showcase that these Oreo cookies are

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,720
 not just regular old black and white Oreo cookies. Black. Take that home, leave it to beaver. We need

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,480
 to show that it's the year 2020 when they made these. They just released them in 2021. We got to

56
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,360
 show that this is this year. So how do we let people know these aren't the bland boring cookies

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
 you knew from the past that we sell, that we're going to sell after this? But for this month,

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:54,000
 we're selling these. I know someone says, how about we draw an illustration on the package

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,400
 showing that her cookies are pink with green filling. Everyone goes, that's it, Jonathan,

60
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
 great idea. You've earned a promotion. I've never worked in a company like that. I imagine that's

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,880
 how that works, right? People just yell at ideas until everyone's promoted to CEO and then they

62
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,840
 start their own companies. So that's what they did. These Lady Gaga Oreos. Photo's going to be in

63
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
 the show notes. I was going to put it as the art for the episode, but I didn't want to get sued

64
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,280
 because of what I'm about to say. I don't want Oreo to come after me for trademark violation.

65
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,760
 You, was I saying Oreo this whole time? And then Hydrox. Hydrox, the generic cookies.

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,160
 They actually came first, oddly enough, but you have these Oreo cookies and there's an illustration

67
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,840
 on the bag of a giant gash, like someone ripped open the bag because nothing's more appetizing

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,120
 when you go to the grocery store to have an illustration. You go to buy some milk and it looks

69
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,560
 like it looks like someone's already opened it. There's a cartoon handprint on it, like your uncle

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,000
 got to it the night before you did and drank out of the jug. It looks like someone ripped a huge

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,520
 gash in the package, showing the green and pink Oreo cookies inside. But Professional Crew 99

72
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:14,080
 pointed this out on the subreddit conspiracy notepool. If you take a photo of this package of Lady

73
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,200
 Gaga cookies, which he apparently owns, because the photo he posted I think he actually took

74
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,080
 like himself, like he was holding it and he's like, "Should I eat these now or should I expose

75
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,440
 the truth to the world?" If you look at the cover of the Lady Gaga Oreo cookies, the gash,

76
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,760
 the aforementioned gash, the rip across the bag to show what the cookies look like, matches up,

77
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:46,640
 matches up to the hole in the side of the World Trade Center when a plane flew through it.

78
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,520
 What's interesting is Professional Crew 99 put this theory out there. I'd read it and I was

79
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,960
 immediately just like, "What are the implications of that?" She's not predicting it because it

80
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,160
 happened 20 years ago, so it's not predictive programming. Are we to believe that she's like

81
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,040
 celebrating the attack? Did she have final approval? Did they originally have like a little window in

82
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,840
 there and she's like, "You fools!" She throws the Oreo package to the ground, scaring all the CEOs.

83
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,920
 She goes, "How was anyone supposed to be reminded of 9/11 with this?" And they're like, "What? What

84
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,520
 are you talking about, Miss Gaga?" She's like, "What? I thought that was the whole reason why

85
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,600
 I was partnering with you. I tried to do this with the Kibler elves, but they weren't down with my

86
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,480
 9/11 imagery." Did Oreo cow-tow to her? Was she behind this? Was the designer behind it? I mean,

87
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,800
 I'll answer all those questions. It was an a- Here's the weirdest thing about this. It does

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,920
 look exactly like it. It does look exactly like it. It'll be in the show notes. I think it was an

89
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,080
 accident. Let me rephrase it. I hope it was an accident. You hope there's not someone at a cookie

90
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,800
 company or anywhere for that matter designing packaging to remind us of national tragedies.

91
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,000
 To add to all of this, of course, because this is the way it goes, she recently, again, this was on

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,320
 her chromatic album, she released a song called 9/11. I listened to it. It was good. I love early

93
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,840
 Lady Gaga stuff. I just haven't been a fan of hers recently. She's one of those, like Selena Gomez

94
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,720
 just gets better. This is a music podcast. I was in it. Selena Gomez just gets better with Time,

95
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,160
 Lady Gaga. This song was good, though. And the song is called, you're like Jason,

96
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,160
 you just said the song was tied to a national terrorist event. We don't care about your music

97
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:41,120
 review. This isn't Pitchfork, but it could be better than Pitchfork. I've only talked about Nickelodeon

98
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,440
 people from Nickelodeon and Disney shows, but I talk about them like they are hipster artists.

99
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
 First off, the song is called 9/11, not 9/11, but she's talking about her having to deal,

100
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,000
 like, takes anti-psychotic medication to deal with depression and she uses the term

101
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,040
 a pop of 9/11. Like, I get, I need emergency treatment. It's an interesting video. It's an

102
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,240
 interesting song. It doesn't really have anything to do with 9/11 other than the title of the song,

103
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,560
 but you, I have to address that. Like, it's, it is weird that she does have Oreo Cook-

104
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,040
 I'm like, let's just be frank. She has Oreo cookies that look like damage to the World Trade Center.

105
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,800
 The imagery is similar. I'm not going to say this guy's cuckoo, cuckoo, it does. And he's not,

106
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 it's interesting conspiracy theory because he's not saying this means X. He's just going, this is

107
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,040
 what I found. This other person popped into the subreddit, just the cat mom, um, popped into the

108
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,760
 subreddit and they were the ones who was like, yeah, you know, the 9/11 music video and what does

109
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,360
 that mean? I've been bipolar all my life and I've never taken a pill with 9/11 on it, so she must

110
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,520
 be made, which is a, that was an actual statement they made in their subreddit post and I, I thought

111
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,400
 it was interesting because we talked about that. I don't remember what the subject was last week,

112
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
 where, oh, the black eye club where people go and I've never had a black eye or I've never seen

113
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,120
 a black eye in real life. Therefore, everyone with a black eye is part of some Illuminati ritual.

114
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,080
 That's so bizarre that they will, that they're asking for physical proof of black eyes existing.

115
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,920
 They've never seen one in real life, but they'll believe in all sorts of other paranormal

116
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,280
 conspiracy phenomenon and that's kind of where we're at with this. I've never taken a pill,

117
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,200
 I'm bipolar, I'm not bipolar, but this person, they've never taken a pill that says 9/11 on it,

118
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,320
 so the fact that she was using that as a metaphor didn't make sense to her and that, that's the real

119
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,000
 reason why I wanted to cover this story is we are really getting bogged. I don't want to stand on my

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,680
 pedestal too long here, but let's all keep this brief, but I feel like we're getting boxed in to

121
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,280
 cultural imagery, or just not even cultural imagery, imagery. If you're an artist or a

122
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,000
 photographer or a music video director or a director in general and you have a scene with

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,200
 black and white tile on the floor, you like the way it looks, nope, you're part of the Illuminati,

124
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,320
 that's Masonic. You have a pyramid on your business card because you think, oh, that's kind of a cool

125
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,200
 thing, it's just like how everyone comes together and like lifts up the top, which is me on the CEO,

126
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,120
 no, you're part of the Illuminati, like basic imagery. Which to be fair, secret societies do

127
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,440
 use that stuff, they do use that stuff, I'm not saying it's always fake, but it's like you can't

128
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,720
 even have a rip on a bag without it somehow being tied into the death of 3,000 Americans.

129
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,640
 I would be flabbergasted if Oreo did this on purpose. And the thing is, I mentioned this again

130
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,880
 on the Black Eye Club, when Mitt Romney had a black guy that was kind of why I did that story,

131
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,080
 I said welcome Mitt Romney, you are now part of conspiracy culture for the rest of your life,

132
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,480
 no matter what you do, there will always be 100,000 weirdos who think that because you got a black

133
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,840
 eye because you're a 73 year old man, you're now part of some secret cabal. He ran for president,

134
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,640
 by the way, he's a supremely powerful person far beyond his black eye, right? I don't know why he

135
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:06,400
 was getting it now. But anyways, perfect example of this, Marina Abramovich. Now conspiracy theorists

136
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,400
 know that name, she was the one who popped out during the Clinton emails that were hacked linking

137
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,360
 John Podesta, that was the start of PizzaGate, that was the start of the pizza related napkins and

138
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,120
 the maps and the hot dogs and the pizza and all these weird code words. And that's on one side

139
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,560
 of it, and I do have serious questions about what those code words meant, and people being

140
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,000
 implicated, there's some serious questions there, but on the other hand you had Marina Abramovich,

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,840
 who she was tied into the whole Podesta thing by, she's an artist who did this thing called

142
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,720
 spirit cooking, she's a performance artist. I had never heard of her before this, most people had

143
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,280
 never heard of her before this. She was a performance artist, she was like Eastern Arthodox from

144
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,600
 Serbia, she immigrates to the United States and just starts doing all this wacky stuff, but it ends

145
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,720
 up with her doing this thing called spirit cooking where it has these weird rituals, she has like

146
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,080
 a spellbook/cookbook and it's like mixed milk with semen and blood and do whatever with it.

147
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,200
 John Podesta had gone to these art shows, Lady Gaga has gone to these art shows,

148
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,320
 she was recently hired by Microsoft for this big ad campaign, got a huge blowback

149
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,640
 because she's an occultist who was working with the Pizza Gate people and stuff like that,

150
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,600
 and Microsoft fired her from the campaign. Now I don't know Marina Abramovich personally,

151
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 the spirit cooking thing, out of context as out of it being art was super disgusting,

152
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,720
 and I remember reading this to me like these guys are all sickos, like what is this? I looked more

153
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,640
 into it and I found this very very fascinating. She was basically the Johnny Knoxville of the art

154
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,080
 scene. Her spirit cooking thing came later in life and that was something that old people,

155
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,520
 old rich people could sit down and go oh look it we're so daring and we're so enlightened and

156
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,160
 isn't this spooky and it's kind of like spooky Halloween. Her other things that she did, art

157
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,320
 installations, she was constantly trying to kill herself. Once she hooked up this, this was a real

158
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,320
 thing she did, and to show that her early, like she was a performance artist, she will be forever

159
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,720
 part of conspiracy culture. Her early stuff, she had this massive fan set up in an art room

160
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,760
 and she was walking towards it with her mouth wide open. She was trying to see how much

161
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,240
 wind that she can get in her lungs before she died, and people were sitting there and they're like

162
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,640
 "Stop Marina, stop, stop!" and she's walking towards the fan and she passes out and the audience pulls

163
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,840
 her out of the way of the fan and they basically save her life. She gets mad, she goes "You didn't

164
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,120
 let the art finish!" So she did it again, but this time she goes "There's only going to be one person

165
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
 in the room with me, it's going to be a cameraman. The audience is sitting in another room, I'm going

166
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,200
 to walk towards the fan. Cameraman, you cannot move me." She does the same thing, she's walking

167
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,560
 towards this fan with her mouth wide open, her lungs, her lungs inflate, she falls down, passes out

168
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,480
 and she's just like "Aww, she's just laying there on the ground getting blasted by this giant fan"

169
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,960
 and the cameraman is just filming it and the people are in the other room, they're like "What is going

170
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,200
 on? Is he going to let this woman die?" Of course he doesn't, spoiler alert, she's still alive.

171
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,880
 At one point she loaded a bunch of, this is a different art thing, she loaded a bunch of like oil

172
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,520
 in a car and drove the car into a museum. She let them know ahead of time, it wasn't like smoking

173
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,160
 in the bandits, but they cleared out this part of a museum and she just did donuts in the middle

174
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,800
 of the museum spraying oil and goo everywhere and then after, I don't know how many rotations,

175
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,280
 she gets out of the car and she goes "There's my sculpture" and she just walked away. At one point

176
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,720
 she took a drug that they give people with catatonia, catatonic state and it caused her muscles to

177
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,000
 seize up and she's freaking in front of an audience just freaking out and then after about 10 minutes

178
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,280
 they gave her medication that schizophrenics take to calm down. That was her art show, she was pushing

179
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,760
 her body to the extreme and in any other artist's repertoire, we wouldn't have known about it. I

180
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,880
 never would have known about this person had I not looked them up and I never would have looked

181
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,800
 them up if I hadn't heard about the spirit cooking thing, but that's hilarious, that's

182
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,520
 stuff hilarious, that's stuff hilarious. She got a partner and they both stuck a tube in each other's

183
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,080
 mouth and just breathed each other's oxygen until they both passed out from carbon dioxide,

184
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,280
 too much carbon dioxide. Like that's pretty funny, I'm like she wasn't supposed to be pen and teller,

185
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,040
 she wasn't supposed to be cracking jokes, but that's cutting edge stuff. She will always be

186
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,240
 remembered for spirit cooking. She's like grew up east, I don't want to be a Marina Abramovich

187
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,600
 apologist because for all I know she does do a bunch of weird stuff on the side, but her spirit

188
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,920
 cooking thing was what she will always be remembered for because the conspiracy theory culture is

189
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,440
 pushing that one. I was shocked when she got the Microsoft thing, I wasn't shocked by that, I was

190
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
 shocked that they fired her. I thought they would just be like whatever it's only 100,000 people

191
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,160
 out there, conspiracy theory culture is huge. There's a ton, it goes from all different angles,

192
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,480
 it's from people like us who have a couple conspiracy theories we believe in and were very

193
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,440
 interested in conspiracy theory culture to people who believe in literally everything put in front

194
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,880
 of them. And we'll never go see a Tom Hanks movie again because technically he's under house arrest

195
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,000
 in Australia still. Remember that whole thing? Remember Tom Hanks was in house arrest in Australia

196
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,440
 and Ellen had an ankle monitor on and now he's making movies and she has her talk show still.

197
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,760
 The whole, it's so bizarre, it's so bizarre, but the, and they've just moved on to other

198
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,880
 conspiracy theories and they, they won't ever address, oh no that's a hologram of Tom Hanks

199
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,840
 in that movie. That movie was shot 10 years ago. That's the sequel to the Verbs you fool.

200
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,520
 He's really under house arrest in Australia still. So Marina Abramovich, Lady Gaga, Oreos,

201
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,880
 Tom Hanks, these guys will always be a meshed in conspiracy theory culture and it's just a very,

202
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:56,400
 very interesting moment in time where you have any image, if you have anything in your movie or

203
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,280
 television show that can be counted, someone will count it up, divide it by two, add three to it

204
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,400
 and it'll make 666. So you just can't escape it. The question is how much can you tank of it?

205
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,200
 I have a buddy who works at a bookstore here in town. They have a pride flag. They have a pride

206
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,040
 flag on their window outside of their bookstore and a woman came in, this is probably about a

207
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,240
 couple months ago and accused the store of supporting pedophilia and then accused him of being a pedophile

208
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,000
 and he goes, okay, well I'm just gonna call the cops like you can leave now. He just kept going,

209
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,040
 you can leave, you can leave, you can leave. Apparently she's been doing that to businesses

210
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,240
 all over the town. They have a little pride flag stick around there. She goes in and tells them

211
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,760
 that they're supporting pedophilia and if they don't take it down, they are pedophile themselves.

212
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,800
 So that all stems from not Lady Gaga Oreo cookies, not like she was eating Oreo cookies

213
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,720
 while she was doing it. It stems from this idea that these hidden messages are everywhere and only

214
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,640
 the gifted and the wise can see these messages and everyone else is a sheep or worse. And what

215
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,120
 happens when that culture stops just pointing their finger and starts going with, Tom Hanks is

216
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,360
 a pedophile, there's nothing worse than a pedophile, it's my duty to do something about it. That's

217
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
 where I'm afraid this is all leading. So there we go, I actually didn't expect it to go that long,

218
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,480
 but let's go ahead and Adam, I look over at you, I didn't forget you, your little foot.

219
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,800
 Adam's like, damn it, little foot didn't support the Patreon. I did, we know you did Adam and

220
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,320
 that's why I'm tossing you the keys to the carboner copter. Take us out of here, we're leaving

221
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,440
 behind Hollywood, we are headed out to the Philippines. So while we're in the Philippines,

222
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,720
 we're going to meet an exorcist known as Ronnie E. Ablong. So Ronnie had recently posted on his

223
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:52,160
 Facebook a tale, a story of demonic possession, because he is an exorcist and he had met this woman

224
00:19:52,160 --> 00:20:00,160
 and for weeks he had been pulling demons out of her. CGI, 1990 CGI flying out of her mouth.

225
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,280
 Now he is not bragging on Facebook about the fact that he pulled 39 demons out of a woman.

226
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,320
 This is a warning man, I can't believe I'm being so flippant.

227
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:21,280
 Jason, you see five of these demons were actually from horror movies. Now not cool

228
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,760
 horror movies like pulling out Freddy Krueger and he has a one-liner, he's like, oh be back.

229
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,800
 I guess it's not a one-liner, that's just something he's going to do. Or pulling out, you

230
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,000
 know, leprechaun from the leprechaun films. I've actually tried writing leprechaun films myself.

231
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
 Maybe I'll do an episode on that someday. I actually have some spec scripts.

232
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,880
 Technically it's leprechaun fiction, but I call them spec scripts.

233
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,040
 He's pulling out all these demons, he's not pulling out any good horror demons.

234
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,960
 He says, listen, I'm pulling out demons from horror movies, you guys got to not watch these

235
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,720
 movies. So then he lists these demons. He goes Valak from the Nun 2018. Now he lists the year of

236
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,160
 the movies for these, right? Odd detail, like did he go Google the movies afterwards? That's Valak

237
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,360
 is coming out, he's like, hey Ronnie, I'll fight you again, but watch my movie, it's on Netflix.

238
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,840
 Like why does he, why, why do the years of the movie matter Ronnie? These are immortal demons.

239
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,480
 Anyways, Valak from the Nun never saw it. Pulled out Sylvia Ghanoush. Remember that famous demon

240
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,240
 Sylvia Ghanoush, Little Foot's all, I don't know. Nobody does. Sylvia Ganesh was from Drag Me to Hell,

241
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,120
 which was a great horror movie, which was a great horror movie. I recommend watching Drag Me to Hell.

242
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,800
 It's real kind of cheesy. It's Sam Raimi. I think he produced it. I don't know if he directed it, but

243
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:47,680
 Annabelle, she comes crawling out of this girl's mouth. Her head spinning around.

244
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,640
 And that is just the doll, right? Because in the movie Annabelle, which I saw the second one,

245
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,360
 I saw the prequel to Annabelle. The first one was super boring, but I can't be that boring. Demons

246
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,960
 are crawling out of it. Annabelle's not a demon, it's a possessed doll. So Sylvia Ghanoush was like

247
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,400
 a gypsy lady, so she was technically a demon because she was from Hell and Valak was a demon.

248
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,720
 But so Annabelle the doll is now a demon. I find that absolutely fascinating because it means that

249
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,760
 you could sit down tonight and invent a demon, and then that demon becomes real. Like that demon

250
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,640
 becomes part of the pantheon. You go, Jason, maybe I'm just... Maybe there's a real demon.

251
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,440
 Looks like a doll. That looks like a doll that's running around Hell and no one respects it.

252
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,240
 And then it gave me the idea for the doll demon movie, but I don't know. I like my idea better.

253
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,040
 Don't let Chris Chan know that, though otherwise we're going to get overrun by Sonic Chu demons.

254
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,440
 But remember there's five of them. He's already running out of ideas, right? If he's using like,

255
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,960
 Drag Me To Hell was good, but that's like a... I really enjoy that movie. I'd put it probably in my

256
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,560
 top, I don't know, 500 horror movies, but I wouldn't... It's like Sea List. Like no one knows of it.

257
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,280
 And then he's doing Annabelle the doll. Like he's already running out of stuff. Then he does

258
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:12,320
 Diane Walter, that fearsome demon that keeps kids awake. Diane Walter from Lights Out, which was

259
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,520
 an interesting movie. It was an interesting movie. I just remember the ghost blew her brains out,

260
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,360
 which I found very bizarre. It's not really a demon, again. It's just a character who turns into

261
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,800
 a ghost and then shoots herself with a ghost gun or hangs herself with a ghost rope. I don't remember,

262
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 but maybe none of that stuff happened. I'm thinking of something different, but anyways,

263
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,320
 Diane Walter. And then, and then to finish it off with the most frightening demon of all,

264
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,920
 he actually mentioned it second, but I had to build up courage to say this, Esme.

265
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,960
 Esme Cullen. Edward's mother from Twilight. Not a demon, by the way. A very, very attractive

266
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,160
 vampire woman. Not a demon. So after giving us this list of what really is fictional characters,

267
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,080
 right? He goes, "These are the demons that have possessed this young woman." And then,

268
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,320
 after going through that whole list, he has a warning. The best place to put a warning is after

269
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,560
 you've already read these things. Warning, please do not mention or pronounce their names,

270
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:21,840
 because doing so will empower them or you will be harassed. Well, if I have to choose between the two,

271
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,040
 it can empower them. Sure, I'm not going to harass someone else, except Esme. Esme, you know, you

272
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,920
 can swing on by my place, but don't put that after you've listed all the names, because what

273
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,160
 if someone's reading that Facebook post out loud? No one's reading the Facebook post out loud. No one's

274
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,680
 like, "Hey, honey, you want to hear something funny I read on the internet?" And I didn't finish

275
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,760
 reading it. I just heard the first paragraph. "Yeah, Bob, sure." He's reading this, then his wife's

276
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,200
 head spinning around, throwing up everywhere, walking with little rag doll physics. But what

277
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,600
 he's saying is that by watching these horror movies, you're actually inviting these demons

278
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:05,440
 into your life. That's old school, right? We've heard that since the 80s, even before that. But

279
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,080
 80s, 70s, 80s, those horror movies really took off. You know, if you watch this stuff, you're inviting

280
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,200
 that evil in. I think the worst thing you can get from watching Twilight is having a horrible view

281
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,080
 on how men should treat women, because Edward is one of the most abusive boyfriends in those movies.

282
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,120
 It's jaw-droppingly bad. He's a terrible boyfriend, but I don't think you're going to get possessed

283
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,360
 watching Twilight. I could, you could argue, here's my thing. And this is how we're going to wrap

284
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,640
 this up, because on the one hand, we're having a laugh at this. Annabelle the doll did not possess

285
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:46,480
 anybody. Right? I would put more credence to the theory that Oreo had something to do with 9/11

286
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,840
 than the fact that Annabelle the doll possessed the girl in the Philippines, or anywhere for that

287
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,200
 matter. Not to, oh my gosh, she possessed someone in Russia? Well, that makes sense. Here's the thing,

288
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,320
 I think most of this is pure poppycock. But, not all of it. I do believe, we've talked about this

289
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,840
 a lot on the show, I do believe that there are cursed films out there. I think if you can have

290
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,200
 an item that is haunted or possessed, like an Annabelle the doll, I actually believe that you

291
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,280
 can have a doll possessed by a paranormal, supernatural, or demonic force. I don't, I just

292
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,000
 don't think that doll could then possess you. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm not.

293
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,240
 So I believe that's possible, so why couldn't it possess a film reel or a videocassette? And I'm

294
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,520
 not saying that everyone who watches the Nun is going to get possessed, because then, see the reason

295
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,160
 why this doesn't make sense is you would have millions upon millions of people, none was a hit.

296
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,040
 You'd have a twilight even more, so you'd have millions upon millions upon millions of people

297
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,840
 possessed. If simply watching, you're telling me that President Biden never watched Twilight,

298
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,440
 or his daughter didn't. Does he have a daughter? His granddaughter, whatever. You're telling me

299
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,440
 that Vladimir Putin never sat down in his pajamas to watch Drag Me to Hell. He's like,

300
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,040
 "This is my favorite movie. It should be on IMDB trivia." Someone add that. Vladimir Putin's favorite

301
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,720
 movie. You're telling me that someone who, I hate to sound like a jerk, but who cares if a girl in

302
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,440
 the Philippines is possessed by Annabelle the Doll. Why would a demon be like, "Oh yes, I finally

303
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,480
 reached my master plan. It's puberty all over again." What? No, you'd be possessing senators,

304
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,320
 you'd be possessing presidents or generals, and then they would just be blowing each other up.

305
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,640
 I do believe people can be possessed by demons, but I think it's very difficult for them to do it.

306
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,120
 I think you could have people who are hardcore drug addicts who are doing all sorts of horrible

307
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,040
 things to themselves and to others and still not be demonically possessed. Demonically influenced,

308
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,960
 yes. But still able to reject the possession, still be able to have a little bit of sense of

309
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,360
 self so they're not like, "Ah, I'm going to give up this heroin, I'm going to become a senator,

310
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,880
 and soon I will take over the planet." But if I was a demon, I would be going after the big guns.

311
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'd be trying to possess generals and diplomats and things like that and causing international

312
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,840
 incidents and having massive war and destroying every holy book on the planet through nuclear

313
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,240
 annihilation and then the handful of survivors left would truly be under the thrall of the demonic

314
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:28,080
 lords. I want to be a doll, I want to be a doll, right? I want to be a spooky doll in some girl's

315
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,440
 bedroom, like moves slightly when the webcam is recording late at night. And what's funny is,

316
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,840
 like I said, I do believe that demons do possess things, but there has to be a disconnect between

317
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,960
 what we think demons want and what they actually want. If they wanted mass invasion, if they wanted

318
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,600
 to possess millions of people at once through popular culture, they would have won the second

319
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,480
 birth of a nation first aired. Everyone who saw that movie would have went home and their eyes

320
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,760
 glazed over, all possessed by demons picking up pitchforks and stabbing each other. That would

321
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,960
 that be the time to do it, not now. It's a very very interesting topic to me. I think the idea

322
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,080
 of demonic possession and the war between god and the demons and man and the demons,

323
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,160
 is a very very fascinating topic. But I think it gets trivialized when people go, "Oh, if you watch

324
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,720
 this horror movie, the demons are going to show up and possess you. Thirty-nine demons may show up

325
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,680
 and possess you." But you know, all that being said, going back to my original point, and I'll wrap

326
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,320
 it up like this, I do believe that there are, I do believe that there is the possibility that demons

327
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,280
 can get into media. The question is, what are they doing there and what's their end goal?

328
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,440
 I don't think it's just mere possession. And I don't think it's something that millions of people

329
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,440
 watch because you'd see millions of possessions. I think it could be the copy that you downloaded

330
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,560
 onto your computer that's just been sitting on your hard drive, that movie that you've been

331
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,480
 waiting to watch. It could be the book you picked up from the used bookstore

332
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,200
 that's sitting on your shelf right now, just waiting to be read by you and nobody else.

333
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:17,840
 Or it could be a webcomic, a webcomic that is so demonically influenced.

334
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,760
 It affected your life before you read it. That actually happened to me.

335
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,920
 That happened to me. But I will tell you that story later this week on Dead Rabbit Radio.

336
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:42,960
