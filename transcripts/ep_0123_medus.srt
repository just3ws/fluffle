1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 A series of articles in 1835 give...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Well, I guess it's 1835, so not a new definition, but we'll go with it.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 A series of articles in 1835 give an old definition to fake news.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And then we take a look at the horrific tragedy of the Medus.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And this one, you guys get to play along today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm a lot bigger now.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. No snow today.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 So that's awesome. So I'm good. I'm good. No snow.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Now, I wanted to let you guys know something, quick little update.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 So it is the winter break.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Everyone's kind of, for the most part, going back to...

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's coming up to winter break finals for some of you.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And then winter break.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 But anyways, people are going to be traveling to their homes, to the places that they came from,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 or maybe you're just where you're at right now.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 But you may have some free time.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And in this moment, I'm going to ask a favor of you guys.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I'm getting reviews, and that's awesome.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Definitely love getting reviews.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 That helps the channel get found on platforms like iTunes.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But I want to go a little old school with this.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 And we did this a while back, but I want to start it back up again.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I want flyers.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 So I have a link in the description below, either on YouTube or your podcast provider.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 You'll see a little link down there for a flyer.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I would like you guys to print that out and put that up around town.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I think that flyers are not used for podcasts.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I think it's something that will definitely stand out.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 We're going to have two versions of the flyer.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 One with the Dead Rabbit logo by Ash Black, which is the red and black logo.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And you can just print it out in black and white, dude.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 You don't got to do anything fancy.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And then the second one is the Dead Rabbit as above logo by Grant Scott.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And both of them are just going to be pretty bare bones.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But that would be awesome.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I know a lot of you guys have gotten back to me saying you're recommending me to your friends and family.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And that means a lot.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It definitely helps the show grow.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 But let's put up, let's go old school.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Let's do like, what are those things called?

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Basically a street team.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Street team.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Let's do it.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Let's get some, I put flyers up around my town.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And it works.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I went and flyered when I was a vacationing in California, put a bunch of flyers up in the Bay Area.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And have seen a permanent increase in my listenership from California.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 It definitely works because people love to find something.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 People base their stuff on recommendations from friends and family.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But we have a, we have, when you discover something yourself, like all of you have,

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 just kind of stumbled across this show and have fallen in love with it,

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 or maybe just fallen in like with it.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 But you just kind of stumble into the show and you click a link

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 or you see a little podcast download, you listen to it and you just like, this,

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I'm part of this because I discovered it.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 It's a human thing.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And it beats any sort of advertising that you can do.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 We have an advertised the show outside of putting up flyers and someone walks by and looks at it and goes,

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 that's weird.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What's this?

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And they're intrigued.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 So I would really, really appreciate it if you guys did that over the winter break and going forward.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But yeah, just throw a couple of flyers up.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And it's actually kind of cool.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I used to run a bunch of street teams back in the day.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 You kind of feel a bit like a vandal, but you're getting the word out.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 So, and don't vandalize.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Don't glue them to police cars or anything like that.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I'm not going to say don't spray paint my logo anywhere, but that's up to you.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 The first story we're going to talk about today is something I touched on yesterday with the Thomas Dick story,

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 the Thomas Dick and Mungo Dick story.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And he plays a small part in the story.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 The story is really interesting because it has a lot of parallels to today.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And it is considered the very, in human history, the very first mass media event.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So we're going back in time to the year 1835.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 We're in New York City.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So they didn't have skyscrapers.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 They just had scrapers.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 They didn't go all the way up to the sky, but it was a bustling city.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 You had all these newspapers that were constantly competing with each other.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And one of those newspapers was The Sun.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And they had, like I said, a ton of competition.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 They were a big newspaper and they actually had two things going for them that gave them an edge over their rivals.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 One, they had a steam-powered printing press.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 So they're like, "Oh, this thing can print three papers an hour. Just steam."

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 It actually allowed them to produce massive amounts of paper, but I just imagine it being really slow.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 There's like a guy playing a... What's those big pianos? Like an organ?

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 There's like a guy playing an organ to make it work and steam shooting out everywhere.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Kaliopee! Kaliopee was actually what I was looking for.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So the other element they had, and it's funny because nowadays when we think of old-timey newspapers,

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 we immediately think of this, but The Sun was, if not the first, one of the first,

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 and I actually think they were the first.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Newsboys. Newsies.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 The Sun said, "Hey, let's get a bunch of street urchins to go out there and yell extra, extra read all about it."

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 It was this huge breakthrough in marketing the media.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So you had the ability to produce a lot of newspapers within a day,

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 and you had these kids screeching at you all day long about what the newspaper was,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 so you couldn't really ignore the news.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And there was no radio, there was no television. This is what you had. This is where you got your information.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 One of their other major rivals had a fire at their printing press, so they were out of operation.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 The Sun's like, "Okay, this is working out really good for us."

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 People were buying their newspaper to read about the fire at the other newspaper company.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But they thought, "You know what? We need something big.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 We need a kill shot of a Whamdinger of an article."

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Is it a... is it a... it doesn't matter. Is it a Whamdinger?

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Anyways, we need this amazing article to finally knock Oliver competition off.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 So somebody, and we don't know who, no one has ever come forward to claim credit for creating this story.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But somebody said, "Let's write a six-day series about aliens."

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Aliens, I mean, people had thought about alien life, because Thomas Dick was talking about it,

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 and people were fascinated by the idea of life on other planets.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 People were... there were still unexplored parts of the planet.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 People were fascinated with life everywhere.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 But they said, "Let's..." and various cultures and stuff like that.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And they said, "Let's do a six-day series on aliens on the moon."

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And you just imagine the editorial board is like, "That... that just might work.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 One problem, we're a newspaper. We're not a fictional."

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But they're like, "No, we can write this in a way that people will think it is real."

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So the first... they had a little advertisement for it one day.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Just a little paragraph saying, "You know, this is what our series is going to be."

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 There was a scientist named Sir John Herschel.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So he was a knight. He was very, very highly regarded.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And they thought, "Let's just use this real dude's name to set up this fake story."

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Without his permission or anything. He wouldn't have given it, of course, because of what follows.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Imagine it would be the equivalent today as if someone said, "Let's say that we found these works of Carl Sagan,

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 and he has all this stuff about aliens."

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Like, he wrote these papers and then they're complete lies,

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 but you're attaching it to one of the preeminent scientists of the time.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 So they had this little paragraph and they're like,

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 "Sir John Herschel built this brand new telescope and it saw stuff on the moon."

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Stay tuned to our six-part series.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And people were like, "That's kind of intriguing." Just a little paragraph, though. Just a little teaser, right?

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And so the first article is basically that came out was like, set up the story line.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So they're like, "There's this telescope. It's the biggest telescope in the world at the time.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It was like 24 feet, the lens was like 24 feet in diameter.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And it had this special lighting mechanism inside of it so it could light up what it was seeing.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It would make what it was seeing bright and easily discernible.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Trust me, this made-up telescope sees some really, really detailed things on the moon.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 So it has to be super powerful.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And they're like, "All of this stuff is going to be presented in this very prestigious scientific magazine."

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I think it was the Journal of Edinburgh or something.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 The scientific magazine.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 But we, the Sun, have a sneak peek because one of his assistants told us what he saw.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 So before you read it in this actually real, super important scientific journal,

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 we're going to tell you what it is.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 So it's lending credibility to all this.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 The first article is like, he used the telescope and he saw these plants.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He saw like, first he was just looking at the detailed rocks,

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 but then he started noticing these red crimson, I guess that's the same thing,

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 but these crystals sticking off the rock.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Then he started seeing these flowers and these plants,

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 these weird geometrically shaped plants on the moon.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And that was pretty much the first article.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And people were like, "Oh my God, oh there's life on the moon."

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 This, this, scientists who's never lied to us before, saw all this crazy stuff.

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So the next day they're like, "Oh."

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Then then, then he looked at the telescope again,

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 and there was like bugs and animals walking around,

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 like bison-like creatures walking around on the surface of the moon.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 You can't see it with your telescope, but with his special telescope, you can see it.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And now people are really starting to get hooked on this story.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They're like, "There's creatures, it's not just plants, there's actual creatures on the moon."

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 The whole thing was fake obviously, but people started to say,

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 "Oh yeah, no, I was there when they packed up the telescope and shipped it off to..."

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I think it was in Scotland, it was where he was using it.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I know that this is true, so the myth was growing.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 People who had nothing to do with the line started to basically suffer some sort of mass delusion

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 and say, "No, no, no, it's totally true, I was there when this happened, I was there when this happened."

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And other newspapers at this point were like,

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 "This is probably fake, but we better cover it because it might not be fake."

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So the third day, they're like,

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 "Dude, guess what else he saw with that massive telescope that doesn't exist?"

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I mean, does exist. Beavers.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 But these beavers walk on two legs,

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 live in huts,

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 start fires, not just wildfires, but they can create fire,

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 and they carry their young like we do.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 They actually said that the beavers' houses were better constructed than the savages on our planet.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So I mean, a little bit of...

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 You can't have a newspaper article in the 1835 without a little bit of racism.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So these beavers, and people are like, "Oh my God, there was like cave beavers on the planet moon."

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 No, I mean, not on the planet moon. There's cave beavers on the moon.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 This, I cannot wait for tomorrow.

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 If this is only part three and six parts,

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 something has to beat the beaver.

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Because these guys rock.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And at this point, New York is electrified.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And the story starts to spread out of New York.

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Because again, they didn't have the mass communication we have now,

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 but newspapers in Boston started to pick it up,

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 and started to move further and further west.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And over time, it would start to cross the ocean and be big stories over there as well.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 But now we're at the fourth day, in New York's on the edge of its seat.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 You got little boys on the street going, "Extra, extra, read all about it.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Beavers carry babies like humans."

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Stuff like that.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 So day four.

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 We're at day four.

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 We've discovered a new species on the moon.

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Two arms, two legs.

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Bodies of men, really.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 They have bat wings.

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Their arms flip up.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And they have like wings from their wrists down to their thighs,

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 and they can glide across the moon.

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And with my super special telescope,

208
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I actually saw their lips moving as they talked.

209
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So they're smart like we are.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That's where the telescope...

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I don't care how powerful your telescope is,

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 you're not going to be able to see people's lips moving.

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But he's like, they're obviously conversing.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And, and, they do dirty things.

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 They have sex in public.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So, I mean, of course, that blows people's minds.

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 They're like, "Oh my god, they're just like these humanoid.

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 They're tall. They fly around and they do dirty things

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 that we're not allowed to do."

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Everyone's like, "Ugh."

221
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Girls are clutching their pearls, and women are fainting,

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and men are taking the newspaper to the bathroom.

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 They also had a lot of drawings of these guys, too.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 They had these old-timey wood drawings.

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But, again, other newspapers now are kind of starting to push back.

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I think it was the Herald who was like,

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 "This isn't real. This isn't real.

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 This is all made up."

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And other newspapers are still saying,

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 "We're going to present this article and we don't think it's real,

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 but you guys want to read it, so here you go."

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And to be fair, the Sun was pretty much mum on it.

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 They weren't like, "No, this is absolutely real."

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 They were just presenting the story.

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 But the thing is, is how do you beat?

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 You're only on day four, and now you have man-bats.

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And you have two more segments that go,

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 "How do you beat man-bats?"

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 You don't, really.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 The next day was like, "Oh, we found this weird temple,

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 and it was a huge temple that looked abandoned,

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 and on the top of the temple was like a globe,

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 and then there was like this gold, like a structure that looked like,

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 sculpture that looked like golden fire around the globe."

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And the article was like,

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 "Does that tell the story of a tragedy that once struck the moon,

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 or does it tell a story of a tragedy that will strike Earth?"

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Be back tomorrow for part six, and people weren't disappointed.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 That was a, that, it didn't add a new creature type,

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 but it added, it's basically the DLC.

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It didn't add a new creature type, but it added a new plot.

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It added a mystery. What is this structure?

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And then, and then on day six,

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 they're like, "Ah, there's just some more, there's just some more bad people."

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 They totally gave up on day six.

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 They basically, again, with the video game analogy,

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 they just did some recoloring on the enemies they already have.

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 They're like, "Ah, there's just some more bad people."

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And we noticed there were some bad people walking around the creepy structure,

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 and they were super beautiful.

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 They were like, "As beautiful as an angel."

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 They looked amazing, like they, they were jaw-droppingly beautiful.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So again, a very, very good telescope.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Now, of course, eventually, the story starts to get over to England,

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 where Sir John Herschel is, and he hears about it,

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and first he thinks it's funny.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 But then, everyone is asking, and no matter what he did, everyone's like,

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 "So what's going on with the creatures on the moon?"

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And he started to get really irritated.

270
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 He's like, "There's no creatures on the moon. That story's made up. The story's made up."

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 The lie began to fall apart, but this is the interesting thing.

272
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Nobody cared.

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And once it was discovered that it was a lie, a joke, nobody cared.

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 There wasn't this huge outrage.

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 The sun didn't suffer any sort of financial or circulation drop.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 People just went on with their lives.

277
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 People are like, "That was a, that was it. Thank you for making the past six days of my life really fun."

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And that was it, and everyone just went about their business.

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And it's notable because, looking back, people didn't realize how powerful the media had become,

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 that it could fool millions of people for a period of time with completely made up stuff.

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And they didn't recognize how powerful the media had become,

282
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 because it was the very first mass media event.

283
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Nowadays, we freak out over any, any even suggestion of fake news.

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 But back then, it was just an entertaining tale that people liked to hear.

285
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And it was published as the truth in this newspaper that normally published just the news.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 So it's an interesting story. Oh, and Thomas Dick, of course, that's where he came in.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 He shows up and he's like, "Yes, of course there's people on the moon."

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I predicted there was four billion people on the moon. That's where he showed up.

289
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So when this came out as being a hoax, it tarnished his reputation a bit

290
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 because he was trying to be on the science side, but for the general public, they just enjoyed a good story.

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 But yeah, first mass media event/science fiction story/a lesson in how to structure your reveals.

292
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Don't come out with man bats on day four.

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You got to save it, because otherwise you really got nowhere to go from there.

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 They could have said dragons. That probably would have been better.

295
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Okay, we're going to move on to our next story here.

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Our next story is The Wreck of the Medus.

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Now, it's in French. I'm not going to speak in French, but I actually have an interesting story about that,

298
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 but I'm running out of time, so.

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 The story, the ship is French. It's a French ship.

300
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 So whether or not I'm pronouncing Medus right, I apologize once again.

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It means jellyfish in French. I know that. It was this big boat. It was this big boat.

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now, before we get started, like I said, this story is interactive.

303
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I want you to pick a number between one and ten. Go ahead and get that number in your head.

304
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 That number, if you pick the right one, you will survive this story.

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 The Medus was a boat, a big old boat, and we're back in the year 1816.

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 We're headed to Segal, not Stephen, but to the African country.

307
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 France, the French were like, "Hey, we got to send this new governor down here.

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Let's get him on this boat. We'll send another couple boats with it.

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Be a short ride. No problem."

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Boats are chugging along. Now, the captain of the Medus,

311
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 it was controversial because he was promoted because of cronyism.

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 He had no real experience being a captain of a boat.

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 He just was popular with some people back home and they said, "We'll give you this boat."

314
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 He was very, very... He was an idiot, basically.

315
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 This boat has 400 people on it.

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 [Bowling]

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Going through the ocean, right?

318
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 What happens is the captain is dicking around.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 The boat keeps veering off course.

320
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 He goes, "You know what? I think I know a shortcut."

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Just all sorts of bad stuff.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 He ends up getting separated from the other ships that were in the little fleet that was going with him.

323
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 He's messing around and he's like, "You know what?

324
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I think we can cut some time off if we go closer to the coast."

325
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 More experienced sailors are like, "Okay, but this area might have some sandbars."

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 He's like, "Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 The only bar I care about is the one in Margaritaville."

328
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The boat's coming down the coast of Africa.

329
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Literally, the way I'm reading this article, I'm picturing it, is the captain and one of his buddies are having a chat.

330
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 As other people are running around the boat going,

331
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 "Oh, dude, what? Oh my God, we're super close to the land."

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 At one point, not the captain, another guy from his own volition,

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 grabs this depth measuring tool and throws it overboard

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 and finds out they're super close to the land.

335
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Again, this isn't like a rowboat. It's a ship that can hold 400 people.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 He's yelling to the captain, "Dude, dude, this is super dangerous. This is super, super dangerous."

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 At that point, the captain kind of wises up, ends his conversation,

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 and starts to try to control the ship, but it's too late.

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 [waves crashing]

340
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Water. It hits a sandbar.

341
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 It's 30 miles from where it needs to be.

342
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It's basically 30 miles from land.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 The other two ships don't even know where this ship is.

344
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 They don't have a radio, they don't have a phone, they don't have carrier pigeons, nothing like that.

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And so the captain's like, "Okay, this is bad, but we can stay here for a bit and figure stuff out."

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Storm starts rolling in and they're like, "Okay, now this is really bad. The ship has a hole in it.

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It's stuck on the land. We don't have enough lifeboats to get everyone off."

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And they go, "Okay, well, let's do this. Let's take the boats we have, the long boats,

349
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 and we'll just take turns. We'll go to the land, we'll come back, we'll go to the land, and come back."

350
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And then they're like, "We don't have time to do that," captain.

351
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 So then they come up with another plan. They go, "Let's build..."

352
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Because this is one of those things that if they don't do anything, they're all dead.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 So they go, "Let's build a giant raft that can put everyone...

354
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Everyone who can get into a longboat gets a longboat, which means the important people, including the captain.

355
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And then everyone else gets on this giant homemade raft that we're going to make and we'll tow it with the longboat."

356
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So they begin assembling this raft before a big storm hits.

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 I wonder how long it took them to create it, actually, now that I think about it.

358
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 But anyways, they build this giant raft. They named it "The Machine."

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Not a very good name, but they named it "Machine."

360
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 This raft is 66 feet long and 23 feet wide.

361
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And you're thinking, "That's pretty big," but they put on it 147 people.

362
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 So imagine 147 people being trapped in a place that's 66 feet long, 23 feet wide,

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 and that place can sink at any given moment.

364
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It wasn't the best constructed raft, but anyways, they're like, "It's going to have to do."

365
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 So everyone jumps on the raft. A couple of people said, "You know what? We're going to take our chances on...

366
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 We're just going to stay on the boat and you guys can send a rescue crew back for us."

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 The boats are not going anywhere. If a storm hits, we'll go underneath the boat

368
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 and hopefully we don't all get washed away.

369
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 So everyone said they're goodbyes. Well, not the people on the raft,

370
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 but they said they're goodbyes to the people on the boat.

371
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 The raft gets tied to the longboats. Longboats start rowing towards the shore, 30 miles.

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And they get... they don't get very far.

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And the people on the longboats start talking and they're just like, "Woohoo!"

374
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 They just go on as hard as they can. They keep looking back at this raft.

375
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Of 147 people, just like... it's not aerodynamic or not water dynamic, whatever it is.

376
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It's lagging them down. They're afraid a huge storm is going to come in and kill all of them.

377
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 They turn to the captain and go, "We got to cut it loose.

378
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 There's no way we're going to make it to shore with this raft on our tail."

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Now, can you imagine... now, this is where your interactive part starts to come in.

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 You're sitting on that raft and they threw a bunch of supplies on the raft,

381
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 but they were boat supplies, not survival supplies.

382
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 So they didn't have any sort of ability to steer the raft.

383
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 They didn't have any ability... they didn't have any navigation tools for the raft, no compass.

384
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 They didn't even bring water with them. They put all the ship's wine on the raft,

385
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 because again, they're just trying to carry the stuff from the raft to the mainland.

386
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 They didn't think it was going to be that hard.

387
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So they're about... let's say they maybe got you 5 miles, so you're 25 miles from land,

388
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 and you're on this raft, and it's hot, and only the center of the raft is super stable.

389
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So everyone kind of tries to stay in the center, so your legs are wet and you're sitting there,

390
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 and you look and you see people in the longboats kind of talking to each other.

391
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 You can't really hear what they're saying, and then you see the captain nod,

392
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 and people start cutting the ropes to your raft.

393
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Now, you know it's a death sentence.

394
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You absolutely know that if this raft just goes adrift 25 miles from land with no ability to steer it,

395
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 or maneuver it in any way, you can't like...

396
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Everyone on that side is like, "Hey, paddle your hands like you're toast."

397
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 The panic that must have been going through those people as those ropes were getting cut.

398
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 But the ropes are cut, the longboats just leave the raft of 147 people.

399
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Well, what are you going to do?

400
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Well, fights immediately break out on the raft,

401
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 because again, they're basically like, this, it's us or them.

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You had people form up into groups, you had sailors group up,

403
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 there was a contingent of Marines they grouped up,

404
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 and then you had the passengers who were just going on this trip, this diplomatic mission, who didn't,

405
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 weren't high enough to get into a boat, they're on this thing.

406
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 The very first night, okay, so it's bad, people are arguing,

407
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 you see one guy get stabbed, throw him overboard,

408
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 and because the center of the raft was the only stable part of the boat,

409
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 people kept jostling as they got into the middle of the raft, and then a fight would break out.

410
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 A fight to the death, because if you lost that fight, you were going either overboard,

411
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 or you were just going to be on the edge of the boat and go overboard anyway.

412
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 The first night passes, you go asleep, sun comes up the next morning, there's 20 bodies.

413
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Out of the 146 people, 20 people died that first night.

414
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Some were suicides, which you got to be pretty determined to be able to commit suicide on a raft.

415
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 In the middle of nowhere, what do you do, just drink a bunch of salt water, get splinters everywhere?

416
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I don't know how they killed themselves on a raft.

417
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Other people were murdered for a prime spot.

418
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 That would be a horrible thing to wake up to.

419
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 You wake up, 20 people are dead, you're like, oh no, that guy owed me money.

420
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 He's like, a bunch of splinters all over his body.

421
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 So now we're down 126 people.

422
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 So let's say if you picked the number five, you died that night, you're dead.

423
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 If you picked the number five, you're dead.

424
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Boats going along, like I said, they don't have any water, but they have a lot of wine,

425
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 but that's not going to keep you hydrated.

426
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 The machine, the rafts, going along.

427
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And I imagine at that point, it must be insanity, because we had the first 20 died that night.

428
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And then even more, dozens of people died fighting over that middle spot or losing that spot and falling off the boat.

429
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Basically imagine American gladiators, but it's just water everywhere and you die horrible death.

430
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 So they're fighting, some people are sitting in the middle, some people can't get to the middle,

431
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 and the boat tips too much, you just roll off and drown.

432
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 So let's say if you picked the number seven, that is your fate.

433
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 You're either beat to death by a French sailor, or you say, "I'd rather not get beat to death by a French sailor."

434
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I'll sit on the edge and then you just fall off and get eaten by a jellyfish, ironically.

435
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 A human says jellyfish eats you.

436
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 We're on day four, only 67 people left out of 146, so we've lost a good amount of people.

437
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 That's about half, so I'm going to get rid of two numbers now.

438
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 These people were eaten.

439
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Now not all of them, but at this point, and it's only day four, they're like, "We've got to start eating people.

440
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 We've got to start eating people, because we don't have no food. That's the only way to do it."

441
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 So people got either killed for food or there was still some guy committed suicide,

442
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 and they were like, "I'll just leave him there. I'm too tired to move him."

443
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 They eat him.

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But in that time period of, let's say if you picked the numbers 10, you get eaten.

445
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 You get eaten on this boat.

446
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Day eight.

447
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 It's day eight now.

448
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Boats.

449
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 It's in the middle of nowhere.

450
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I mean, they can't even see land at this point.

451
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 There's not a lot of people left on the boat.

452
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 You are, though.

453
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Let's see if you picked the lucky number.

454
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 If you picked any number other than the number I'm about to reveal, you just died of an embarrassing death you had.

455
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 If you picked one and two, let's say you had explosive diarrhea and just blew up,

456
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 and just showered everyone with it.

457
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 But anyways, so now there's a couple people left, and they're strong on the boat.

458
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 The ones who have maintained their strength this whole time, both mentally and physically, make a decision

459
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 to save what very little supplies we have left.

460
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 We have a bunch of beef, Jerry, and we have some soup of Sally.

461
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 There was one woman on the boat, and they don't say when she died, but apparently she did.

462
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 We have some soup of Sally over there, and we have this Tom Raman.

463
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 We don't have a lot of cannibalized food left, so we're going to have to throw all the wheat overboard.

464
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 We're just going to murder them, so we know that we'll live a little bit longer.

465
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 So the strong people, the mongos of the vessel, pick up the wheat and just toss them overboard.

466
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Or possibly kill them and ate them.

467
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 That's possible, too, but they definitely didn't make it.

468
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 So if you picked, you got turned into a tasty delicacy.

469
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 If you picked six, you got an STD from a starfish that got you in the middle of the night,

470
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 and if you picked, what other ones haven't I done?

471
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Eight or nine, you fell into the water, but your wrist got wrapped around a rope at the bottom of the machine.

472
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And so every time it came up a little bit from the wave, you would be able to get one breath of air,

473
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 but then it would go back down and hold you under water for 30 seconds, and then it would lift you up

474
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and you'd get one breath of air, and it would hold you down for 30 seconds.

475
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And that just goes on and on for about two days until you suffocate.

476
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So horrible death, guys.

477
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 You won.

478
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Actually, if you picked number three, you were one of the 15, which actually, out of 100, close to 150 people, 15 people lived.

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 So if you picked number three, you have survived the wreck of the medus.

480
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 You had a 10% chance of making it.

481
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Some people had sexual relations with the starfish.

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Some people had explosive diarrhea.

483
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Some people died in ways they actually died in on the medus.

484
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 This all came out.

485
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Eventually, of course, the 15 guys did get rescued, and the captain was held liable for it,

486
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 but not for, like, murder or anything like that he really should have been held liable for.

487
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He got held liable for basically abandoning his ship, and he served three years in jail.

488
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And that was it.

489
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And now the French have a law saying if you want to be promoted in the military, it has to be based on merit, not on who you know.

490
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So it didn't.

491
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 This incident did cause a lot of outrage in France, and it did become part of the law.

492
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And there's actually this famous picture called the wreck of the medus, or the raft of the medus, or something like that.

493
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It's this great renaissance-- not renaissance, that was earlier, but it's this great painting.

494
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 But people have also said that painting, it's kind of a symbol of hope,

495
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 because everyone's like, "Yay, look at the rescue boat."

496
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 It's that moment, rather than that first night where people are like cutting their throats with, you know, boat rope.

497
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 They're tying nautical knots around their neck.

498
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Like, it's this moment of hope, not this like horrible other eight days of what actually went on.

499
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 So people-- some people consider that painting to be a whitewash.

500
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 But I hope you lived.

501
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I hope you did not die during that little segment, especially not in some of the ways I made up.

502
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 But I hope you guys had fun either way.

503
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I had fun. I think that's an interesting story.

504
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Like I said, I like stories about-- I think being lost and seas very terrifying.

505
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I'm sure it happens all the time, and we never hear about it because no one gets rescued.

506
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 It's just the boat disappearing.

507
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio, a g-- and I don't-- I don't-- I don't do boats.

508
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 My dad's a big boat guy. I'm-- nah. I'm good.
