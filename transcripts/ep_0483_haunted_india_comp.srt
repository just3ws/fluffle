1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 When a gay man is found dead at the bottom of a cliff, it's real to suicide.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:14,700
 When 88 gay men are found dead at the bottom of cliffs, the police finally open an investigation.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,800
 And then we take a whirlwind tour of India to look at some of their amazing haunted places.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:29,000
 Amazing in air quotes because these places are ridiculously bizarre today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,600
 *music*

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,700
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,200
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are gonna have an awesome weekend.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,700
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporters.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,500
 It's the fabulous Leva's Timothy Leva and Beatrice Leva.

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,100
 Beatrice, you may remember.

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,000
 She's the one who broke the news about Forrest Finn's treasure being found and she sent us the 2028 man story.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
 Really, really appreciate that.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,700
 Both her whole family's fans of the show. It's totally awesome.

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,700
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just go ahead and get the word out about the show.

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,300
 That really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,700
 So Timothy, let me touch the keys of the carpenter copter.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,200
 *mimics carpenter*

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,300
 Catch him in your hand.

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,700
 Put him in the ignition.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,100
 Do helicopters even have keys now that I think about it?

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,300
 I think you just press buttons. Anyways, it doesn't matter.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,700
 Timothy, take us up in that beautiful carpenter copter. We're headed out to Australia.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,300
 *mimics carpenter*

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,500
 We're flying. We're cutting lines right over the beautiful Pacific Ocean.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
 This first story is a little dark.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,900
 So sorry about that, Timothy. Sorry that you're flying us today.

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,500
 We're gonna do a lot of traveling, so you'll be able to go to other places.

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,400
 You and Beatrice are gonna take turns, but we're flying over the Pacific Ocean.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,300
 We're headed out to Australia. We're specifically headed to Bluefish Point.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,700
 That's in North Head, Australia.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,100
 It's December 10th, 1988.

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,500
 There's a man named Scott Johnson. He's 27 years old.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,100
 He's a gay man. He moved from America to live in Australia with his lover.

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,500
 But when his naked body is found at the bottom of a cliff--

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
 I can't, I told you the story is gonna be dark.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,300
 When his naked body is found at the bottom of a cliff, it's ruled as a suicide.

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
 Now, his brother--

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,500
 This is one of those things that just happens to be serendipitous.

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 His brother was extremely wealthy, powerful man.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,300
 His brother's name is Steve Johnson. He's a tech entrepreneur.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,500
 He's the one who actually commercialized the first algorithm to send photographs online.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,700
 So he ended up selling that to AOL and got a job.

43
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,800
 He was like an executive with AOL after that.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,700
 Very, very powerful, rich man.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,600
 So when his brother commits suicide, he doesn't really buy it.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,300
 He doesn't really like-- It doesn't really make sense to him.

47
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,000
 What happens is, his brother's lover, who's still in Australia,

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,800
 one day calls up Steve and says, "Hey, there was another gay guy who was found at the bottom of this cliff."

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,900
 And police are starting to think that maybe your brother didn't kill himself.

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,200
 They're gonna start investigating this a little closer.

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
 Now, that call-- He got that call in 2005.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
 His brother died in 1988.

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,000
 So there's a long span of time where Steve had to deal with this idea that his brother killed himself.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,300
 Steve Johnson begins to use his contacts and his wealth,

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,700
 and he sends a team of private investigators down there.

56
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,900
 Because at first off, you think it's just a one-off thing, an unfortunate one-off thing.

57
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,200
 He didn't sit right with them, though. He sends a team of investigators down there.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,700
 They begin working with local law enforcement.

59
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
 They begin to put these together.

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,900
 So first you had Steve that was ruled as a suicide.

61
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,100
 The police opened this thing. It was called Operation Parabell.

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:56,200
 From 1976 to about the year 2000, the police were able to find 88 gay men

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,200
 who had jumped off the-- quote-unquote jumped off these cliffs over that around 30-year period.

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,800
 88.

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
 They had all been considered suicides or accidents.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,300
 One of the key details, the coroner kept going, it was a suicide. It was a suicide. It was a suicide.

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,100
 After about 20 years, after about 20 years of the coroner saying this,

68
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,600
 someone brought up to the coroner, "Yeah, you know that's where a lot of gay people go to like hook up?"

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,400
 The coroner is like, "What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's like a known area where gay men will go to hook up."

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,500
 And the coroner said, "Had I known that back then, when I first started looking at these bodies,

71
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,400
 I wouldn't have been so quick to say suicide."

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,700
 Because if a location is going to attract gay men to have hook-up sex,

73
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,900
 it's also going to attract people who hate gay people.

74
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,700
 So the coroner goes, "I kind of wish I had known that ahead of time."

75
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,700
 What did they find out? They've now ruled 27 of those 88 as homicides.

76
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,000
 They believe that 27 of those 88 deaths were homicides, were murdered.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,100
 And just recently, this is how I came across this story.

78
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,000
 In May 20th, 2020,

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,300
 police knock on Scott White's door. He's a 49-year-old man.

80
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,700
 Guy opens the door and he looks at the cops and he goes,

81
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,600
 "Yeah, I knew you were coming."

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,900
 This guy, Scott White, was at that area with Scott Johnson.

83
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,900
 December 10th, 1988, Scott White was standing there with Scott Johnson.

84
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,300
 And something happened that prompted Scott White to punch Scott Johnson

85
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,400
 and that man fell to his death off that cliff.

86
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
 He hasn't really admitted to saying why he did it.

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,900
 It's possible that he went there and was thinking about doing something

88
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,400
 and started Phil Guilty.

89
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,900
 It's possible that he went there with the intent to murder him.

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
 We don't know. He hasn't admitted to any of that yet.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,300
 But he does, he was there. He did do it.

92
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,100
 The motive is the question.

93
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,000
 The New South Wales Police did end up issuing this statement recently.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It said, "The New South Wales Police acknowledges, without qualification,

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,500
 both its and society's acceptance of gay bashings

96
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,900
 and shocking violence directed at gay men

97
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,100
 and the LGBT community between 1976 and the year 2000."

98
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,000
 There's just something that, you know, a couple guys get rowdy.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,800
 They beat up a gay dude. The police might investigate it.

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,700
 88 people falling off cliffs from 1976 to 2000.

101
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,000
 That's when you start to look at a possible conspiracy, a possible cover-up.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,700
 One, two, you know, that could be a coincidence.

103
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,000
 One's not even a coincidence. It's just a tragic thing.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,300
 But 88, 27 of them have been considered murderous.

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,100
 They don't think that the Scott White guy killed the other 26.

106
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,600
 They think it was other groups of people pushing them off the cliff.

107
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,400
 Horrifying, horrifying story.

108
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,100
 And for the longest time, no one was even investigating it.

109
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,400
 Timothy, get us out of here with this carpenter copter.

110
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,900
 Disturbing story.

111
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,600
 I actually debated whether or not it would be a good Friday story.

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,700
 Because it's something I tend to have more, I like to have more uplifting stuff on Fridays.

113
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,100
 But I think it's an important story.

114
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,600
 And I think it does have the happiest ending we can have.

115
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
 We have justice being served.

116
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,100
 We have a man's name being cleared that he didn't commit suicide.

117
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,700
 And you have a brother realizing that his, the justice for his brother was found.

118
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 So it's as good as an ending as we could hope for in this type of situation.

119
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,900
 Timothy, let's take us up in that carpenter copter.

120
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,200
 And while we are in midair, we're going to figure out some way to do this.

121
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,400
 We're going to move around.

122
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
 Okay, I'm going to hold the steering wheel.

123
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,300
 Beatrice, you are going to take Timothy's place.

124
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,400
 He has to sit in the back now.

125
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,500
 Fly us on out in this beautiful carpenter copter.

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,100
 We are headed out to India.

127
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,000
 (Batman sounds)

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,900
 We're flying.

129
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,500
 We are actually going to do a lot of stops this episode.

130
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,300
 First off, Beatrice, fly us over to Bandgad Fort.

131
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,900
 (Batman sounds)

132
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,500
 We're flying over this giant fort.

133
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,200
 It was built in 1573.

134
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,300
 So we're actually going to a little bit around that time period.

135
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,200
 Hit that button right there.

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
 We're going back in time.

137
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
 (Batman sounds)

138
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,700
 We're now flying over this giant earthworks fort.

139
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,900
 Massive fortress.

140
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,200
 10,000 people live inside of it.

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 We're in the Alwar district in the Rajasthan state of India.

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
 And now we're going to land.

143
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,200
 We're going to walk around and walk up to the front gate.

144
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,700
 Hey, let us in.

145
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
 And that's a magic word.

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,600
 That's the password to get in.

147
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,100
 (Batman sounds)

148
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,800
 The same way that the gate is opening up, not a constipated old man.

149
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,500
 We walk into the gate.

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,000
 Now, it's old timey.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It's like in the 1500s and everyone's like walking around doing their stuff.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,400
 But in the middle of town is the most beautiful woman around.

153
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,700
 It's Ratnavati.

154
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,400
 Ratnavati, she's the princess of Bangra.

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,000
 So Ratnavati is walking around and all the men are like...

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
 All the men are like wanting to marry her.

157
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
 Quote unquote, marry her.

158
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,400
 We know that what they really want to do.

159
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 But she has not taken a suitor yet.

160
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,000
 So all the men are like, "Oh, I can't wait to high shifts from side to side to marry her."

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
 But she's super beautiful.

162
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,300
 Everyone wants her.

163
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,800
 Most importantly though, in the background is this old man named Singh Haya.

164
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,500
 And he's like, "Ha ha ha.

165
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,400
 She is the one I must possess."

166
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,900
 Imagine Gaston, but disgusting looking.

167
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,400
 Actually imagine Gaston, but he's the beast.

168
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,700
 And he's also a super powerful wizard.

169
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,200
 And he's not the beast where he has a lovable heart.

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 Did the beast actually have a lovable heart?

171
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,100
 Wasn't he like a vein jerk?

172
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,700
 And then he turned into a monster and then someone stabbed him in the back and he goes,

173
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,000
 "Oh, maybe I shouldn't be such a horrible person."

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,900
 Did he really change that much?

175
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
 Like thinking about that story, he didn't really come around.

176
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,500
 He basically was just like, "Oh, no, I'm about to become a monster."

177
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
 She fell in love with him.

178
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,600
 But I don't think they never showed him like being nice to the cup, right?

179
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
 He wasn't like, "Oh, I'm not going to make you dance for my own enjoyment.

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,900
 I'm not going to eat food out of you anymore, Mrs. Bowl."

181
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,700
 Anyways, he's basically a monstrous man inside and out.

182
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,000
 And he's a super powerful wizard.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,700
 But he wants Rat Navati so bad that he watches her go into this perfume store all the time.

184
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
 And he knows what her favorite perfume is.

185
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,000
 And he's like, "Disguise?"

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,700
 He's basically disguised as a perfume bottle in the corner.

187
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,000
 A wizard-sized perfume bottle.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,800
 He realizes, "Hmm, that's your favorite perfume.

189
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,400
 What if I added a love potion to it?

190
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,100
 And then stands right next to her, should love me forever?"

191
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,800
 Here's a tip.

192
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,200
 I'm not an evil doer or anything like that.

193
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,400
 But don't announce your plans where your victim can hear it.

194
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,200
 "Ha ha!

195
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,100
 If only this bank knew I was going to rob it at 2.45pm!"

196
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,600
 Yes, I would like to withdraw $100, please.

197
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,100
 Yeah, you don't do that, right?

198
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,900
 Because he must have done it relatively in her earshot because she knows of the planet.

199
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,600
 So he goes and he creates a love concoction.

200
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
 He puts it in a bottle.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
 He makes it look like the bottle of the perfume she loves.

202
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,500
 And she walks up to it one day and he's sitting there.

203
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,800
 "Oh, yes, here she comes.

204
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,700
 Soon she'll be mine."

205
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,900
 And she picks up the perfume that has the love potion in it.

206
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,600
 And she knows if she sprays it on her, she'll fall in love with this horrible magician.

207
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,000
 She does really...

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,300
 It's quick thinking, right?

209
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,700
 On her...

210
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,300
 I guess the quick thinking is just don't even engage with the bottle.

211
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
 Because what if it accidentally had a crack in her or something like that?

212
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,300
 But anyways, she picks the bottle up and she smashes it against the boulder.

213
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,900
 And the wizard's like, "No!

214
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,400
 You figured out my plan.

215
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,300
 I'll just have to try another love spell."

216
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,100
 Wait.

217
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,000
 No.

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,700
 No!

219
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,500
 And he looks in the boulder.

220
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
 He's moving towards him.

221
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,300
 [makes a noise]

222
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,400
 And he's like, "No.

223
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,600
 No, the boulder can't love.

224
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 It has no soul."

225
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,400
 And the boulder starts chasing the wizard through the street.

226
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,200
 Because the boulder is madly in love with him.

227
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,700
 Eventually the boulder crushes the wizard.

228
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,900
 [makes a noise]

229
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,100
 All over the city streets.

230
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,500
 And then just lays on top of him.

231
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,600
 And he's underneath the boulder and he goes, "Uh, that was a pretty good trick.

232
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,600
 It was a pretty good trick, but now everyone in this city will."

233
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
 [makes a noise]

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
 Everyone's like, "Well, golly!

235
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
 I wonder what he cursed us with.

236
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,400
 I wonder what that evil wizard cursed us with.

237
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,600
 Everyone in the city is going to get rich and powerful.

238
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,100
 Woohoo!

239
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,400
 I'm not moving."

240
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
 Well, no.

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,000
 That's not what was at the curse.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,400
 He cursed everyone to die in the city.

243
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,600
 And sure enough, according to the legend,

244
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,400
 sometimes a couple days later, sometimes up to a year later,

245
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,700
 the city was laid siege by a rival army

246
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,900
 and slaughtered everyone in the city, including the princess.

247
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,800
 Nobody survived.

248
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,500
 So, apparently the battle is historical.

249
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 The question is, how much of the other stuff is historical?

250
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,600
 The princess might have actually been around.

251
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,100
 There could have been a wizard walking around,

252
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,800
 but I don't necessarily believe that he was able to concoct love potions.

253
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,700
 If the love potion was so powerful, it would make a boulder fall in love with you.

254
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,900
 The boulder grows giant cartoony eyelashes and big pink lips.

255
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,300
 I was trying to kiss you.

256
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,100
 If you gave that to a human, she would have been just as obsessed, right?

257
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,800
 Like, you want a girl to be into you, but at a certain point, you're like,

258
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,500
 "Uh, I gotta do my own thing.

259
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
 How magic spells the cast, babe?

260
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
 MMMMMM, I want you, I want you, I want you."

261
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,900
 Like, nobody wants that level of devotion.

262
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,500
 So, you probably put a little too much power in it anyways.

263
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 But it doesn't matter.

264
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,200
 He got his revenge, he cursed the fort for everybody to die.

265
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
 And I actually forgot this part of the story.

266
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,900
 This is a separate story.

267
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,900
 When they went to build the fort, there was an old wizard, a different wizard.

268
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,800
 Apparently, there's just a bunch of wizards in this area.

269
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,200
 There was another wizard, and they came to build this fort, and the people go,

270
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,400
 "Hey, we know you're like a powerful wizard and all that stuff,

271
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,300
 but we're gonna build a fort nearby."

272
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,500
 You know, just 'cause.

273
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,200
 And the wizard goes, "That's fine, I'll allow you to build the fort,

274
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,700
 but none of your buildings can be taller than my house."

275
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,300
 And for whatever reason, the fort people were nice enough to ask him permission.

276
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,500
 They obviously knew this guy was powerful enough that they should get his permission.

277
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,900
 But then they're like, "Whatever, we're just gonna build it as big as we want."

278
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,200
 So they built a giant anyways.

279
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
 He said, "You can build it, just don't make it taller than my house."

280
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,900
 'Cause he didn't want any shadows on his house.

281
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,300
 So he cursed it.

282
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,500
 Now, there's a lot of curses going around in the story.

283
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,000
 The one guy, he gets crushed by a rock, and he curses it,

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,900
 so everyone's going to get slaughtered.

285
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,800
 Ten thousand people remember, everyone's gonna get slaughtered in this thing, and it came true.

286
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,400
 This first wizard must have just been having an off day,

287
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,600
 'cause he goes, "If you build this fort bigger than my house,

288
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
 a horrible curse will befall you."

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 The curse is, there's no roofs.

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,600
 Roofs are constantly collapsing.

291
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,500
 So, I mean, the other guy did get ten thousand people killed.

292
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,900
 You just made it so shoddy engineering happens.

293
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,400
 Supposedly, I kept coming across this, and it may be true,

294
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,200
 but supposedly the Archaeological Survey of India, they're in charge of this.

295
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,500
 It still exists. It's a monument.

296
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
 You can go on tours.

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,900
 Only during the day, the Archaeological Survey has banned anyone from visiting it at night,

298
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,600
 'cause they said there's too many ghosts.

299
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
 They said it's too spooky.

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
 That's what it actually says in the government handbook.

301
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
 Too spooky. You can't go out there at night.

302
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
 There's a bunch of...

303
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
 There's like ten thousand ghosts.

304
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,800
 There might still be some love potion floating around.

305
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,900
 You might accidentally see a rock, and you're like,

306
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,800
 "Ooh, I'm gonna take a nap against this rock,"

307
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
 and then like you get it on your back.

308
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,500
 You get a little bit of love potion, goes through your shirt.

309
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,200
 And the next thing you see is a member of the Archaeological Survey of India walk by,

310
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
 and you're like, "Vaboo!"

311
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,900
 You're chasing them around all comically.

312
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,300
 They don't want that happening.

313
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,600
 So, that is our first stop on our Ghost Indian tour.

314
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,200
 Beatrice, move over. Let's let Timothy back in that Carbonarcopter.

315
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,700
 We're gonna take turns.

316
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,200
 We're headed out to the Lambi Dehar Mines in Masori.

317
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,300
 The Lambi Dehar Mines of Masori's, what this is known as.

318
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,200
 [imitates engine]

319
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,500
 Helicopter, we're leaving behind the fort.

320
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,300
 We're leaving behind that super cute boulder.

321
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,700
 Mmm. Checking it out.

322
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,300
 It's all shaped... It's all super shapely.

323
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,400
 Mmm. Looks like one of those fertility statues.

324
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,600
 Jason!

325
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,400
 Quit staring at the boulder.

326
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,100
 Give us directions.

327
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
 We're headed out to the Lambi Dehar Mines.

328
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,400
 It's in the Deraden district of Yatarkand.

329
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,600
 So, in this mine, this is giant mining system.

330
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,500
 Where back in time, there's just a bunch of miners.

331
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,300
 [imitates engine]

332
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,100
 The job, not the age group.

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,400
 Knocking down rocks and stuff like that.

334
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,900
 Making holes in mountains.

335
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,100
 So, when I'm saying back in time,

336
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
 this is one of those stories that I thought was so weird.

337
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,000
 Let me tell you this story,

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
 and then I'll tell you the time period that it takes place in.

339
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
 So, what's weird about this story is,

340
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,500
 I don't know much about the working conditions of India,

341
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,300
 but if this story is any...

342
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,600
 If this story is any example of what it's like to work in a mine in India,

343
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,300
 oh my god, this is insane.

344
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,200
 Because they're doing this mining operation, right?

345
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
 And it said that...

346
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,800
 There has to be something wrong.

347
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
 There has to be something wrong with...

348
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,700
 There has to be multiple errors with this passage.

349
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,500
 So, what's going on is they're working on this mine,

350
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,100
 and of course, when you're doing any sort of mining,

351
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,600
 it has a high fatality rate.

352
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,300
 A lot of people die mining.

353
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,400
 In this particular mine,

354
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,500
 50,000 people died.

355
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,600
 50,000 people died.

356
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,500
 You go, Jason, you know, mines are...

357
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,700
 You just said mines are super dangerous,

358
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,600
 and you know, this mine's probably been in operation for a long time,

359
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,200
 and maybe not had the best working conditions.

360
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
 I don't know what the unions are like over in India,

361
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
 or if the unions even exist.

362
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000
 50,000 people can die in mines in a given time period.

363
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,700
 I would agree with you if this story took place,

364
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,800
 like from the 1800s to today.

365
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,200
 50,000 people died in the 1990s.

366
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,600
 When we were listening to Ace of Base and watching TRL,

367
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,300
 50,000 people died mining in this place.

368
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
 Saved by the bell was still on the air, bro.

369
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
 50,000 people died, and there...

370
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,000
 I can't...

371
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,300
 What is going on over there?

372
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,400
 And the way that they died...

373
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
 50,000 people died, you figure, okay,

374
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,200
 maybe 100 fall down a shaft,

375
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,800
 a thousand, you know, just get lost in there.

376
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,000
 Most of these people died, almost all of them died,

377
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 from choking on their own blood.

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,700
 Okay?

379
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,400
 Like, I get it.

380
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,400
 People build bridges, people fall into the concrete as it's being poured,

381
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 like that great song of the highwaymen.

382
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
 That's where I get all my tragedies from, is country music songs.

383
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
 I did this story recently by the Hussack Tunnel.

384
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
 People are getting blown up doing that.

385
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
 50,000 people died.

386
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,600
 Most of them from vomiting blood.

387
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
 Who was like, "Ugh, what time is it?

388
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,300
 Oh, man, I'm running late.

389
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,600
 Better get to the choking blood mine."

390
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,400
 Hopefully, I'm not one of those guys who chokes on his own blood today.

391
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,600
 No, Surrey.

392
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 Nobody knows what's causing it.

393
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,800
 You go there, they give you all the protective gear possible.

394
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,400
 Will this help?

395
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,900
 I don't know.

396
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,100
 We don't know what's causing people to choke on their own blood.

397
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,400
 And honestly, I don't think they were handing out protective gear

398
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,600
 if 50,000 people died in the 1990s.

399
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
 Anyways, these choking blood mines,

400
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
 that's where these people worked.

401
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
 If 50,000 people died,

402
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,100
 I can only imagine there would have to be what,

403
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
 a million people working there.

404
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,800
 I hope it wasn't.

405
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,000
 They had a labor force of 55,000 people.

406
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,100
 And they're like, "Well, there's 5,000 of you left.

407
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,600
 Good job.

408
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
 Good thing you guys didn't choke on your own blood.

409
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,000
 I'll see you guys in the next mine."

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,700
 You're like, "What?

411
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,300
 Next mine?

412
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,000
 Apparently made it out of this one."

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,700
 People don't like to go to these mines.

414
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,900
 I wouldn't, right?

415
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,800
 I don't think you'll ever see the ghost hunters go out there.

416
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,900
 They're like, "Yeah, before we can go in here with our ghost equipment,

417
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,600
 what exactly caused everyone to choke on their own blood?"

418
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,000
 The foreman's like, "I don't know.

419
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,700
 He never could."

420
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,900
 [Groans]

421
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,500
 Blood's pouring out of his mouth.

422
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 I think ghost hunters, I think Zach Baggins is a little more intelligent,

423
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,800
 then go to a place where blood is just pouring out of people's throats.

424
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,600
 But the people in town don't go there.

425
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,800
 They don't go there at all.

426
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,500
 Why not?

427
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,400
 Why do you ask?

428
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,700
 Other than the fact that 50,000 humans died here,

429
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,500
 while Amy Grant still had a number one album.

430
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 Here's this quote of why they don't travel there.

431
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,500
 "Locals refuse to venture close to the mines after sunset,

432
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,400
 as they believe that the place is held by a witch,

433
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,900
 whose blood-curdling shrieks could be heard in the deathly silence of night."

434
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,600
 Oh yeah, dude.

435
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,900
 Thousands of people dying.

436
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,600
 The mysterious blood-coughing disease.

437
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,300
 Yeah, whatever.

438
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,800
 Wh-which?

439
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,700
 What?

440
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,000
 Do you hear a spooky noise in the distance?

441
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
 Oh no, a witch is screaming.

442
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,800
 I better go hide in this cave.

443
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,100
 I think the reason why you wouldn't go there wouldn't be the witch.

444
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,200
 The witch noise, which is probably just a fox.

445
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,200
 Don't go there because 50,000 people died there.

446
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,100
 Don't go there because while I was watching Terminator 2 at the movie theater,

447
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,700
 50,000 people were spilling blood out of their own throat into a cave floor.

448
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,100
 I don't care about the witch.

449
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,500
 I don't know if the mines are still on-

450
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,600
 I hope the mines still aren't in operation.

451
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 I don't even know what they're mining.

452
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,300
 They're mining hebo-globin.

453
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,000
 The CEOs, like, a little do they know what we really want is that sweet, sweet plasma.

454
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,300
 Mwah, they're throwing it up in a bucket.

455
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,000
 Anyways, Beatrice, Timothy.

456
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,500
 This time you guys are going to share control of the carbonic copter.

457
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,300
 Each are holding onto a joystick.

458
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,900
 It's going to make it super chaotic, but we are flying out to our last location we're visiting.

459
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,800
 We're flying out to Dow Hill.

460
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,100
 That's in Kersong in West Bengal.

461
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,500
 Now, I was getting most of this information from a website called OYO Travel Guide.

462
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,200
 This was an article entitled "Bone-Curtainling Adventures at India's Most Haunted Places."

463
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,200
 Actually, before we get into the last one, one of the places they listed was this bizarre story about this.

464
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
 A woman who said she was a princess and the British government owed her a bunch of money.

465
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,100
 They took all of her stuff and the government was like, "We don't really think you're a princess.

466
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,400
 We just think you're kind of nuts, but we will give you this patch of land called Malcha Mahal."

467
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,100
 So she went there, she was living with her kids.

468
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,000
 It was super gross.

469
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,700
 It was this rundown hunting lodge.

470
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,800
 And she is so disgusted with her living situation.

471
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,000
 She used to be a princess.

472
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,900
 And again, people are saying historically she actually wasn't a princess, but she felt she was owed more than this.

473
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,200
 So she decides to kill herself.

474
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,500
 Her two young kids are still there.

475
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,200
 She decides to kill herself by swallowing diamond dust.

476
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,700
 I mean, dude, I'm not, I am totally anti-suicide, but if you got to go,

477
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,700
 if you can swallow enough diamond dust to take you off the mortal plane, that's baller, dude.

478
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,000
 That's something that like, I think Rick Ross would want to do.

479
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,600
 That is straight up like a baller move.

480
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,400
 But, I mean, she leaves her two kids there and they're like, "No, no, our fortune!"

481
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
 Swallows all this diamond dust.

482
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,000
 That is actually, first off, that's a great name for a band.

483
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,600
 Secondly, if I knew someone who killed himself on diamond dust, I'd be like, "That's unfortunate."

484
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,400
 But I'm cutting that stomach open, dude.

485
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,200
 We're getting some of that diamond dust.

486
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
 Apparently she did have some money set aside.

487
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,500
 And then I had this great quote.

488
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,300
 I don't even know why I said we're going to the next location, because I wanted to include this one.

489
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,800
 Here's this quote about the--

490
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 So the kids are living on. Here's this quote.

491
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,900
 "The eerie story of how these two humans," referring to the kids.

492
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,400
 "The eerie story of how these two humans have survived here for so long,

493
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,300
 "in a place that does not have any electricity, water supply,

494
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
 "and is surrounded by trees and a forest is chilling.

495
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,700
 "They wear only black robes.

496
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,600
 "And the brother sometimes goes out on his bicycle to buy food and supplies."

497
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,400
 You kind of lose the mysterious quality, right?

498
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,900
 Like, if there's a bunch of hermets living in the woods,

499
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,800
 and you walk by the house late at night, and you might see a candlelight moving through the house and no electricity.

500
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,900
 And the next day, you see a guy in a black robe getting a slurpee.

501
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,100
 "Hey, Jason, how's it going?"

502
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,300
 "Oh, yeah, the hermit life's really good. Super spooky. I saw you walk by. I had that candle."

503
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,700
 "Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?"

504
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,800
 "Oh, the slurpee's so good."

505
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,900
 "Yeah, I'm going to get some beef jerky for my sister, and then I'm going to ride on my bike,

506
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,600
 wearing a hooded black cloak."

507
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,200
 "How's that part even possible?"

508
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
 "You know he took the cloak off.

509
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,300
 "You know, like when he's hanging at home with his sister, he's like, 'Oh, yes, we are servants of darkness.'

510
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,900
 "I need to go and get some more refreshments then he leaves."

511
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,700
 Puts his cloak and his backpack.

512
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,800
 He's all dressed up snazzy as a tank top on underneath,

513
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,500
 driving through town, playing video games in the arcade, and then comes back.

514
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,900
 He's like, "Ah, sister, you won't believe the madness outside."

515
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,000
 But anyways, so yeah, I just thought it was a funny visual. It doesn't everything do with ghosts.

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,600
 Those two kids are dead now too.

517
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,800
 I should say they did grow up to become adults, and they're dead.

518
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,500
 But that story was real. That story's actually documented.

519
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,900
 Let's, again, we're turning the carbonicopter back around.

520
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,600
 You guys are both in control of it. We're headed to Dow Hill.

521
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 That's in Kursong, West Bengal.

522
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,800
 We're going to wrap it up like this. This quote just speaks for itself.

523
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,100
 Remember, this is from that OYO travel guide, that article,

524
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,100
 "Bone-Curdling Adventures in India's Most Haunted Places."

525
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,000
 The Victoria, so this is a private school area.

526
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,100
 The Victoria Boys High School in Dow Hill Girls' Boarding School in Kursong, Darjeeling,

527
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,900
 are believed to be the residence of many spirits whose footsteps can be heard echoing through the hallways.

528
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,400
 There have been countless murdered bodies found in the woods surrounding the schools,

529
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,800
 and several locals and tourists report being followed by a headless boy who then disappears into the woods.

530
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,300
 That's classic ghost story stuff.

531
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,300
 We don't have 50,000 people coming down with a mysterious disease.

532
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,900
 We don't have rocks that fall in love with humans, or suicide via diamond dust.

533
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:28,300
 We have this great story. We have countless murdered bodies in the woods surrounding the school,

534
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,700
 and people being haunted by a headless boy who disappears into the woods.

535
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,700
 That's what we're here for, India. Thank you so much.

536
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,200
 Right underneath this story on that OYO travel website, there's a button.

537
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,700
 "Find best hotels in Darjeeling."

538
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,900
 I don't want to go to a hotel there, bro. You basically made it, so I never want to go to a hotel there.

539
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,800
 Who reads that? I mean, literally, there's a button right underneath that paragraph.

540
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,200
 Who's reading that and goes, "Honey, you know how we always talk about seeing a headless boy?

541
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,100
 I found the place. Countless bodies. Count me in. I can't wait to go."

542
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,600
 Oh, this is going to be so awesome. Like, who? Who? Who went mad, man?

543
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,500
 First off, they should have a tag.

544
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,000
 So any hotel that gets a reservation from that particular button,

545
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,600
 they put that person in a room far away from everyone else.

546
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,000
 If anyone read that passage and then tries to book a hotel in that area,

547
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,800
 they need to be completely segregated from society. Absolutely terrifying.

548
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,900
 India is one of the oldest cultures on the planet. I was actually surprised.

549
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,500
 There weren't many ghost stories.

550
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,400
 I went through about three or four top 10 most haunted places in India lists.

551
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,500
 A lot of them were repeated. These were the four most intriguing ones.

552
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,300
 And the one with the woman eating all the diamonds.

553
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,700
 I didn't even have a ghost in it. It was just kind of a weird location of visit.

554
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,900
 You can still see that hunting lodge.

555
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,500
 I was actually surprised that there weren't more ghost stories.

556
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 A lot of the hauntings could be happening out in the wilderness.

557
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,800
 It may not be an issue where you have a haunted house in the middle of town

558
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,000
 that everyone knows about, but it could be the hunting lodge

559
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,700
 or the clearing in the woods or the rugged mountain path.

560
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:19,000
 Because in a culture that old, everything has been tinged with memories.

561
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,100
 Everything should be carrying some sort of resonance.

562
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,800
 One of the reasons why we don't get a ton of ghost stories out of India

563
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,300
 is because a lot of people don't survive them.

564
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,200
 I had that story a long time ago, and it's one of the ones that I think about from time to time.

565
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,200
 We're close to 500 episodes on this show, and it's a story that pops up in my head all the time.

566
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,800
 There's about the two friends who were watching The Conjuring 2.

567
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 And one of them just died.

568
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,900
 One of them died in the movie theater.

569
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,300
 And then the friend was driving him to the hospital in an auto rickshaw.

570
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,800
 And they've never been seen since.

571
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,600
 The rickshaw's gone.

572
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 The body's gone.

573
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,200
 The guy driving the rickshaw completely disappeared.

574
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,300
 And that's what I mean.

575
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,800
 Think about it.

576
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,400
 We're almost at 500 episodes, and all the stories I've told,

577
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
 there are a few stories that stick with me.

578
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,000
 That's one of them.

579
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,600
 That's one of them.

580
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,800
 I think that we may not have a huge variety of ghost stories in India.

581
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 The country's so huge.

582
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,900
 The country's so old that I think it would be much easier

583
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,200
 to go missing in that country, to be walking down that rugged path,

584
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,900
 be whistling as you're hiking through that forest,

585
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,400
 to walk into that house at the very, very edge of town, and simply go missing.

586
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
 Your loved ones would look for you, of course, but would they ever find you?

587
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,300
 These are the ghost stories we hear of, is because these are the ghost stories

588
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,400
 that people come back from and are able to tell us.

589
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,700
 "Oh, I was out there.

590
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,400
 I saw a witch as they wiped blood away from their mouth."

591
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
 "Where'd you get that cough at?"

592
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
 "Oh, no big deal."

593
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,900
 "The one with park services and tour guides and all that stuff."

594
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,200
 But the true hauntings, the terrifying hauntings,

595
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,000
 are the ones you don't come back from.

596
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,500
 And if you don't survive the encounter to tell the story,

597
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,300
 it never will end up on a top 10 list.
