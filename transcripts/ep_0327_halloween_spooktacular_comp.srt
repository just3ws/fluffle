1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 (music)

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,880
 Hey you, yeah you over there.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,080
 What are you doing?

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,360
 Just wasting away.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,160
 That's it.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,560
 You're now a member of the Paranormal Police.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,960
 (imitates dog barking)

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,320
 No, you're not a Juggalo.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,000
 That's actually the sound of a police siren.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,520
 You might be Juggalo, I don't know.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,720
 But anyways, it doesn't matter.

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,600
 It's a police siren.

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
 You are now a member of the Paranormal Police.

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,560
 And we're going on some investigations, baby.

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,520
 We're gonna take a look at six different

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
 situations that the Paranormal Police may face.

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
 All of them real, asterisks maybe.

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
 All of them reportedly real.

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,680
 All of them we will be involved in.

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,240
 And yes, this is an interactive adventure on the Halloween special

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,680
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,400
 (singing)

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,320
 Bad boys, what you want?

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,520
 What you gonna do?

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,800
 Oh, when they come for you, tell me what you gonna do?

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,200
 What you gonna do?

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,800
 (upbeat music)

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 (upbeat music)

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 (upbeat music)

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
 (upbeat music)

31
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,960
 I'm having a great day.

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

35
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,400
 This is the Halloween episode.

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 So I also hope you're having a safe and spooky Halloween.

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
 Now, today's gonna be a long episode.

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
 Yesterday was a long episode.

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
 Tomorrow there will be no episode.

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,280
 I'm gonna take a three day weekend.

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,440
 Just to let you know this as well,

42
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,440
 on Halloween night, to October 31st at 8 p.m.

43
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,160
 Pacific Standard Time, I'm going to be doing a live stream on YouTube.

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,080
 So join us over on YouTube and ask me questions.

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,760
 We'll be talking, I'll be walking and showing you some of the spooky parts of Hood River.

46
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,240
 Now, when I say spooky parts of Hood River,

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
 I mean the spooky parts of Hood River from point A to point B,

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
 because I'm gonna be leaving one party as I'm headed to the

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
 Sun Diver album release party at the River City Saloon,

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,200
 which I invite all you guys to come to see as well.

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,120
 But we're gonna be walking through Hood River.

52
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,720
 You guys, feel free to ask me questions.

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,920
 We're gonna be talking and stuff like that.

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
 I did a test yesterday of the live stream and it seemed to work.

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,160
 The audio quality was okay and I will try to take,

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,840
 I know I can take the audio from the YouTube and turn it into the podcast.

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
 I don't know how compelling it would be because a lot of times,

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,320
 the questions are popping up on the screen, but we'll see how it goes.

59
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,680
 We'll see how it goes.

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,560
 I don't like, I always consider this show more of a podcast than a YouTube channel,

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,880
 but YouTube offers me that live option that podcasts doesn't,

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,080
 otherwise I would prefer to do it on both or podcast on first and then have a transfer.

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,600
 But it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, okay?

64
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,120
 That's neither here nor there.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,240
 But I wanna invite everyone, no matter where you listen to the show,

66
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,600
 October 31st, 8pm, I'll be on live stream.

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,440
 And if you miss it, like I said, I can upload it to the podcast and it'll be on YouTube as well.

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
 Apparently there was some controversy because I showed my face and people are like,

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
 "Oh, you're exactly what I thought you would look like."

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
 And other people are like, "You're totally the opposite of what I thought you would look like."

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,200
 My Facebook profile gets linked on the show notes.

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
 You guys have had a year and a half to see what I look like.

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,000
 It is no mystery to how I appear, but apparently that was the case.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
 So, if you're curious, I had a friend, Irbud actually said,

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,280
 "Don't show your face, bro, because people have an idea of what you look like and it will throw

76
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,600
 them off."

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,280
 And I've come across it too.

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
 There's a lot of YouTubers that I've never seen their face and then when I see their face,

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
 I'm like, "Ah, it doesn't ruin it for me, but it definitely makes me see them differently."

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
 So if you wanna keep the mystery, don't watch the live stream.

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
 You wanna know what it looked like, you could have found out after the very first episode

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,400
 when I posted my Facebook profile on there.

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,440
 Let's go ahead and get started.

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
 Now, we're gonna hop in the police car, bro.

85
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,280
 "Bad boys, whatcha want? Whatcha gonna do?"

86
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
 And as you're getting in the cop car, you're like,

87
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
 "Are you gonna sing that song the whole time?"

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,160
 And I go, "You damn right I am."

89
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,040
 That song is an American tradition.

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,880
 Don't mess with inner circle.

91
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720
 "Bad boys!"

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
 But I can't sing it too much, because then I'll get a copyright violation.

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,360
 Okay, so get in, get in the car, and we both have on our police uniforms,

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
 our polyester blue police uniforms.

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
 You're going classic with this one.

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,920
 The old uniforms, not the all black uniforms they have today.

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
 Hurry up, get in the car, dude.

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
 You're making me do this long intro.

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
 You finally get in the car.

100
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
 You're a little mad that I yelled at you.

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,480
 Starting the car, apparently we drive a out of service hot wheel car.

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,040
 There's no car that makes that noise.

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
 Maybe a dune buggy that's tipped over.

104
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
 So we're driving this car.

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
 I didn't know why I didn't come up with this.

106
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,200
 We're driving the Jason Jalopy.

107
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,000
 We've just slapped a siren on the top of it.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
 A big Ecto one siren.

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,000
 So then, the intro is taking way too long.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,200
 Okay, just pick a number between one and six.

111
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,480
 Let's get started.

112
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,280
 I'm the grumpy old police officer, and you're the young, fresh-eyed recruit.

113
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,640
 Where are we going today, Jason?

114
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,160
 Are we going to fight any bad guys?

115
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,680
 Yeah, we're going to fight the bad guys of alcoholism and my ex-wife.

116
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,320
 Okay, maybe not that dark of a cop.

117
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
 And anyway, let's just get started.

118
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
 I don't know why this is taking so long.

119
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,800
 Pick a number between one and six, please.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,920
 So I can start.

121
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,360
 Okay, you have your number between one and six.

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
 It's about time, rookie.

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
 We got a call.

124
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,600
 We got a call to a Thai food restaurant.

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
 We're going to a Thai food restaurant.

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,080
 We're going to Windsor, Connecticut.

127
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,200
 Windsor, Connecticut.

128
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,720
 I know that's not how you pronounce it.

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
 It's May 29th, 2019.

130
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,480
 We get a call to a Thai restaurant, and we walk in and I'm like,

131
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,120
 I'm going to take two orders of your spiciest food.

132
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
 And the guy's like, "Yes, sir."

133
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,880
 And as they're preparing it, we're looking around.

134
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
 I wonder why they called us here.

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,640
 It doesn't seem to be any ghosts or anything like that.

136
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,840
 And the guy brings out the bowls of the spicy, spicy food,

137
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,640
 sets them on the counter, and I push them both to you.

138
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,440
 And I go, "Eat it, rookie. Eat it.

139
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,560
 We're hazing you today.

140
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,040
 You have to eat the spicy, spicy food.

141
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,960
 I'm putting extra spices in it.

142
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
 I brought spices from home.

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
 Gotta eat it, bro."

144
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,400
 So you're eating it.

145
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
 Because what are you going to do?

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,600
 You're basically a fictional slave.

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,880
 You're doing what I say.

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
 You're eating this food.

149
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
 You're like, "I hate this podcast.

150
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,520
 I'm not listening to it anymore as you're crying."

151
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
 And I look up and then I kind of nudge you with my shoulder.

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,320
 I'm like, "Hey, rookie, rookie, look."

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,920
 I'm nudging you more spices are falling,

154
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,800
 just sitting on a shelf or falling into your food.

155
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
 I'm like, "Look up. Look up."

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,920
 And there's like a black liquid dripping from the ceiling.

157
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,760
 And you're like, "Oh, he's still eating this stuff."

158
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,880
 And you see like a drop.

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
 And it's dropping like right behind the counter, right?

160
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
 And that's when you look down and you realize

161
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,040
 that you thought there was some soy sauce on your Thai food,

162
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,920
 but they're actually, you can match you apparently.

163
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,480
 You have the eyes of a CSI computer.

164
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,000
 You can match the fluid, the color of the fluid

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,400
 dropping from the ceiling to the color of the fluid

166
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
 in your spicy, spicy food.

167
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,960
 And as you can barely see through your now swelling eyeballs,

168
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,640
 you're like, it matches the same compute, compute, same liquid.

169
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,480
 Viscosity matches.

170
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,240
 What had happened, this true story, by the way,

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,760
 this just happened, is there's this Thai restaurant

172
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,200
 and it's called the Siam Corner, in case you're interested.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,440
 They noticed that there was a black leak on their ceiling

174
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
 right behind their counter.

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
 And they're like, "Well, that's weird.

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
 I wonder what's going on there."

177
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,040
 And then one day, a bunch of guys in bio-azard suits

178
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,680
 walk through the door and we're in there.

179
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
 You're eating your spicy food.

180
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,680
 We're investigating this.

181
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,920
 A bunch of dudes in bio-azard suit show up.

182
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,600
 They're like, "Lock the doors.

183
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,120
 No one in. No one out.

184
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
 Contain the plague."

185
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,240
 And you look over at me and I'm now wearing a bio-azard suit.

186
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
 I brought one with me.

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,120
 You're still eating the spicy food.

188
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,640
 [clears throat]

189
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
 The black colored spicy food.

190
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,760
 You're like, "What?"

191
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,480
 The bio-azard suit guys wrestling you to the ground.

192
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
 "Get down. Get down.

193
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,320
 Spit it out. Spit it out."

194
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,240
 They're giving you a stomach bump.

195
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,880
 What it was was that around the same time,

196
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,720
 someone did a welfare check on an elderly resident

197
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,200
 or a resident, I don't actually know the person's age,

198
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,880
 above the Thai shop was a bunch of apartments.

199
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,080
 And this dude died in his bed and for three days

200
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
 had been rotting and basically liquefying

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,800
 and dripping through the floor into the Thai food restaurant.

202
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,480
 Now, there's no indication that anyone got served

203
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,080
 like got served food with dead man drip on it.

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,880
 However, I'm sure at least one person like,

205
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
 because that one little drip going,

206
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
 and then like the little CGI,

207
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,960
 the little CGI drip falling slowly to the ground,

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,320
 headed towards a bowl of delicious pho.

209
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,600
 So if you pick number one,

210
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,840
 the next time you go into a restaurant,

211
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,360
 the next time you go into a restaurant,

212
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,160
 you're going to get a delicious helping of whatever food it is.

213
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,600
 Soup, pizza, the next time you're eating at a restaurant,

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
 you'll be looking up at the ceiling.

215
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,400
 You don't see, you're waiting for that drip.

216
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,840
 You're like, "Oh, I picked number one.

217
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,120
 Something's going to drip in my food.

218
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
 That's what this is going to be right."

219
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,960
 And then all of a sudden,

220
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,280
 [Gasps]

221
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,120
 you get possessed by the spirit of the leaking man,

222
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
 and you feel yourself fighting for control of your body.

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
 But you're too weak, and then you climb up the building,

224
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,560
 you leave the restaurant,

225
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
 and then you climb up to the roof of the building,

226
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
 or if there's an apartment above the restaurant,

227
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,880
 you just sign a lease, sign a six-month lease with them.

228
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,840
 They do a credit check.

229
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,960
 It takes a little bit longer,

230
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,800
 but if it's just a one-story building,

231
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,840
 you climb up on the roof, and then you die.

232
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,560
 The ghost basically blows your heart up.

233
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
 [Exhales]

234
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
 Like a balloon full of blood, and then you die.

235
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
 And no one will discover you for three days

236
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
 until you drip into somebody's food,

237
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,800
 and the circle of death is complete once more.

238
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,840
 And I thought you were just going to eat a rotted body.

239
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,040
 You become a rotted body,

240
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,960
 and you become something somebody else eats.

241
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,280
 [Sings]

242
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
 Hop back in the cop cart.

243
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
 So if you pick number one,

244
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,600
 you're not back in the cop cart.

245
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
 You're just rotting on a roof for a while.

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,320
 You, though, rookie, get back in the cop cart.

247
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
 You're like, "Oh, my stomach, dude.

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
 Can we get some, like, Pepto Bismol?"

249
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,960
 No. You're being haze.

250
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
 You got to eat that spicy, spicy food.

251
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,640
 I even brought you some takeout.

252
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
 So I ordered some to go, and you're like,

253
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:38,640
 "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

 [Sings]

255
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
 Over there, that's what their sirens actually sound like.

256
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
 I don't know that.

257
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
 I see that in movies.

258
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,080
 I'm assuming that's true.

259
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
 Here's a question for you.

260
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
 This is going to be a long episode, by the way.

261
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,320
 Here's a question for you.

262
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
 If the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower

263
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,840
 had gotten a fight, who would win?

264
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,440
 And before you go, that's stupid.

265
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,520
 The Statue of Liberty would obviously win.

266
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,960
 I think you have to figure,

267
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,120
 I don't know how tall either of them are.

268
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,360
 And yes, the Statue of Liberty, if it came to life,

269
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
 has, like, flame.

270
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,840
 But technically, it doesn't.

271
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,720
 It just has a weapon in the shape of flame,

272
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
 and it's hollow.

273
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
 But the Eiffel Tower, I'm pretty sure, is bigger.

274
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,760
 And even though that's kind of hollow, too,

275
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
 has-- it ends on a giant point.

276
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
 Like, where would you hit?

277
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,360
 Basically, the Statue of Liberty versus the Eiffel Tower

278
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
 would be the equivalent of a human trying to fight a triangle.

279
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
 Like, there's really not much to hit a triangle.

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,640
 So we'll see.

282
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,080

284
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,560
 Which one would win?

 Statue of Liberty or Eiffel Tower?

286
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
 Anyways, oh dude, and then while they're fighting,

287
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
 the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

288
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 It's like coming over the horizon,

289
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
 being like, I will defeat the weakest one

290
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
 at the end of this battle.

291
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,440
 Anyways, so we're in Paris, France.

292
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,240
 The long episode.

293
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,440
 It's a Halloween episode.

294
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
 It's October 27, 2019.

295
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,640
 So just a couple days ago.

296
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,920
 It's a 9.30 PM showing of Joker.

297
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,840
 The good but not great movie starring Joaquin Phoenix.

298
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,520
 I really wish it was great.

299
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,560
 But it is enjoyed.

300
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,280
 So anyways, people are in here watching Joker,

301
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,440
 and he is dispensing his own brand of bizarre justice.

302
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,280
 He's just kind of shooting people in the face.

303
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,480
 But anyways, he's doing this thing.

304
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
 Joker's doing this thing.

305
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
 And we get to the theater.

306
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,240
 Wow.

307
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
 Come on.

308
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,800
 Get out of there.

309
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
 And your stomach really hurts.

310
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,040
 So I was like, come on.

311
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,600
 We have to go.

312
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
 We're going to go see a movie.

313
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
 You're like, can I use the restroom first?

314
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
 I'm like, yes, you can use the restroom first.

315
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
 But then afterwards, come out of the restroom.

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,920
 So I mean, obviously you're not going

317
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,440
 to stay in the restroom forever.

318
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,400
 You might considering how much Thai food you ate.

319
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,240
 But okay, after you're done with the restroom,

320
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,400
 I have two giant bags of popcorn.

321
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,760
 And I'm like, here you go, Roque.

322
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,120
 No, just joking.

323
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
 So let's-- you have like--

324
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,800
 you be-- I have a balloon fetish.

325
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,280
 I'm just trying to fatten you up by the end of the episode.

326
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,720
 So we walk into the theater.

327
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
 We're coming in halfway through the movie.

328
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
 And I'm being super loud.

329
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
 I'm being as tall.

330
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
 I'm making myself as big as I can.

331
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,280
 Like I'm fighting a bear.

332
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,880
 So I can block the projector just to be a jerk.

333
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,080
 I don't have to do that.

334
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
 Has no relevancy on the story.

335
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,160
 I'm like, I make--

336
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,520
 this is how I'm hazing you this time.

337
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,760
 I'm going to get up on your shoulders

338
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,520
 to make myself extra big.

339
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,360
 And make you walk me to my chair.

340
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
 And then eventually, after I ruin a good 10 minutes

341
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,440
 of the movie, we find our chairs.

342
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,080
 And we sit down.

343
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,200
 So now we're sitting there.

344
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,280
 And I go, dude, I have to pee.

345
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
 So I get back on your shoulders.

346
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,560
 And you walk me back out of the theater.

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
 Making bear noises the whole time.

349
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,680
 But anyways, after I'm done peeing,

350
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,640
 and you walk me back to my chair, we're sitting in there.

351
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,400
 And at that point, the real story starts.

352
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,080
 The story that we're here for.

353
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,880
 There's a guy in the back of the theater going,

354
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,840
 it's political.

355
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
 We were like, what?

356
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,080
 I'm looking around.

357
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
 Like, it's weird.

358
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
 A couple minutes passed.

359
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,480
 Then the guy goes, it's political.

360
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,280
 What is going on?

361
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,600
 And people start being like, dude, shut up.

362
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,800
 We're trying to watch this movie.

363
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,200
 And we are--

364
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,280
 yeah, this bear man show up.

365
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,120
 We're trying to watch this movie.

366
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,880
 Quit it's political.

367
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,280
 People are like, dude, you really, really need to be quiet.

368
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,600
 And people are starting to get really agitated.

369
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
 And then the guy jumps up and says,

370
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,120
 Allah Akbar.

371
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
 And people flip out and begin running out of the theater.

372
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,400
 Now, a couple of people run and they tackle this dude.

373
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,600
 And he's able to squirm his way out of their grip.

374
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,680
 At this point, people are saying, he has a gun.

375
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,240
 He has a gun.

376
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,200
 He has a gun.

377
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,280
 And the dude jumps out of this group,

378
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,760
 like this melee that's going on surrounding him.

379
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,120
 Other people are jumping over seats

380
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,800
 and trying to get out of the fire exits.

381
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
 He's able to get out of fire exit,

382
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,840
 takes off into the Parisian night.

383
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,680
 Eventually, he is arrested.

384
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,200
 And when the cops arrest him

385
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
 and when everyone's trying to make sense of what happened,

386
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,840
 turns out that this guy is known for doing this.

387
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,400
 Now, it's actually quite clever.

388
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,480
 This is a scam he does where he--

389
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,680
 he's done this on a train too.

390
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
 He'll jump up and say Allah Akbar.

391
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,720
 And everyone freaks out.

392
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
 And then he has an accomplice who steals all the cellphones

393
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,880
 and purses left behind by the people running for their lives.

394
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,960
 So to be fair, that is a pretty good scam.

395
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,320
 Like, I can see that happening.

396
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
 It's also a terroristic threat.

397
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,120
 In the United States, you would get a really rough sentence for that.

398
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,920
 I'm sure-- I'm sure Paris law is pretty similar.

399
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,440
 What I thought was funny about this,

400
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 the theater at the time when this guy jumps up

401
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,080
 and screams Allah Akbar and someone else is yelling,

402
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,040
 he has a gun, he has a gun,

403
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
 which is most likely the accomplice.

404
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,960
 The theater was packed.

405
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,800
 It holds about 400 people.

406
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 It had 200 people in this theater,

407
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,400
 which is bigger than I think any theater I've been into in years.

408
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,680
 200 people in this theater.

409
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
 25 of them immediately jumped up and ran for the fire exits.

410
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,040
 The other 175 people stayed and watched the movie.

411
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,600
 And they just kind of turned around

412
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
 and there's a fight breaking out behind him.

413
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
 Someone's going, he has a gun, he has a gun.

414
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,760
 And they just turn back to the screen and watch the movie.

415
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,120
 And the management-- management for the theater had this to say

416
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,200
 about the whole incident all around.

417
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,040
 Quote, "The movie attacks a specific kind of viewer,

418
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
 notably people who are against the system.

419
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,760
 There have been minor incidents in other theaters.

420
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 So basically they're like, it's a Joker audience.

421
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,800
 You wouldn't understand.

422
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,760
 Like this is something that happens when you go to see Joker.

423
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,400
 So if you pick number four,

424
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,360
 if you pick number four,

425
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
 you're going to wish that you'd pick number one.

426
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,680
 I'll tell you that.

427
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
 If you pick number four,

428
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,240
 you go into a movie theater in Paris showing the movie Joker.

429
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
 And you walk in and you're like, I know if there is a bomb threat,

430
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
 I know it's going to be fake.

431
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,760
 I'm totally fine with that.

432
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,520
 I mean, it's not the best way in my afternoon,

433
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,200
 but it's going to happen, right?

434
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,280
 You walk into the theater and you sit down

435
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,800
 and you're waiting for the movie to come up.

436
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
 But the movie doesn't start right away.

437
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,560
 What happens instead is everyone else in this theater,

438
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,080
 so there's another 199 people you're going to show up,

439
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,560
 they're all cosplaying as the Joker,

440
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,640
 and they're all doing a really, really bad job of it.

441
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,680
 They're all like 15 years old wearing purple suits,

442
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,240
 trying to say, you know how I got these scars

443
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,840
 and they're getting the quotes wrong.

444
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,760
 You want to know about scars?

445
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,640
 One of the kids says to you, another person goes scars.

446
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,920
 How do they work?

447
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,360
 And you're like, oh my God.

448
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,000
 And then the doors get cemented shut,

449
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,080
 but every day people throw food in the theater

450
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,800
 so you don't starve to death and water rains down.

451
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,120
 I don't know.

452
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,840
 This is getting bizarre.

453
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,360
 The point is that you live forever in a theater

454
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
 of people who do bad Joker impressions.

455
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,720
 I would rather rot on building than be trapped

456
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
 with a bunch of Joker cosplayers.

457
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,120
 I don't have a problem with one Joker cosplayer,

458
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,680
 but the 199 of them for eternity, that's pushing it.

459
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,520
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next dude here.

460
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,640
 So we're hopping in the, well, let's hop back in the Jason Jollopy.

461
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
 We're going to a place of an unknown origin.

462
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,240
 So basically where the wrestlers come from.

463
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,560
 Whenever there was wrestlers that were supposed to be mysterious,

464
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,280
 what was the name of, like, from Parts Unknown?

465
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,960
 We're going to Parts Unknown, right?

466
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,040
 We're just driving through the timeless void at this point.

467
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,280
 We're going to drive to this place.

468
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,640
 Now this is from Reddit.

469
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,160
 So we're going to Reddit, Illinois or something like that.

470
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,160
 Reddit had a thread about EMTs, like medical professionals, cops,

471
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,560
 stuff like that, having paranormal experiences.

472
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,280
 So we're going to visit a couple of those throughout this episode.

473
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,240
 This first one is from a Redditor named compsci2000.

474
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,360
 I'm assuming that, that, tell me that does not sound like the most exciting username ever.

475
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,720
 I'm not a huge fan.

476
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,480
 I actually got banned from a, uh, uh, what is it?

477
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
 A subreddit recently.

478
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,720
 So I'm not a huge fan of Reddit to begin with.

479
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,440
 I got banned from the podcast subreddit or they were blocking my post.

480
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,680
 It would probably be a better way to say that, which I guess the ban.

481
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,400
 So whatever.

482
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,680
 Reddit sucks.

483
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,560
 But anyway, so just promote my Sean Reddit for me

484
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,960
 because they won't let me do it anymore.

485
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
 We're going to compsci2000 was an EMT.

486
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
 He's an EMT, right?

487
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
 And we're EMTs now.

488
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,320
 So wow.

489
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
 Jump out of our car.

490
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
 Sorry if that was kind of loud.

491
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,640
 Jump out of our cars.

492
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,600
 We're changing our copy uniforms to EMT uniforms.

493
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,840
 We walk up and there's this dude laying in the sidewalk or laying on the side of the street.

494
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
 You're like Jason, you're really bad EMT.

495
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,920
 If you can't tell the difference between a sidewalk and just any particular side of the street.

496
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,560
 And I'm like, shut up, shut up knucklehead.

497
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,960
 We're the three stooges, but there's only two of us.

498
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,840
 Unless you're listening to this in the group and then there's like six of us.

499
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,360
 But anyways, we're walking around the scene and there's a mangled body underneath a bicycle.

500
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,920
 And I'm like, well, our work's done.

501
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,600
 Poked with a stick doesn't move.

502
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,560
 Nope, time to go.

503
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,880
 And you're like, no Jason, no, we have to do the life saving technique.

504
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,160
 You actually went to training.

505
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,960
 I didn't.

506
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
 I was too cool for that.

507
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,080
 I was sitting in the back of EMT class with my feet up on the other guy's desk.

508
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
 My sunglasses on.

509
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
 I'm like, whatever you say, doc, when do I get to bang chicks?

510
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,440
 And everyone's like, oh, Jason and the teacher's like, I see me after class, Jason.

511
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,280
 You need to pay more attention to save people's lives.

512
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
 And then I'm banging the teacher.

513
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,800
 So I didn't do nothing.

514
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,480
 I didn't learn nothing.

515
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,920
 You did nerd.

516
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,360
 So anyways, I'm wearing a leather EMT jacket.

517
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,800
 Just poking the body of the stick.

518
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,080
 Come on, let's go to the bar.

519
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,040
 This body's dead.

520
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,600
 And you're like, no, I'm going to check the pulse.

521
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,000
 I mean, to be fair, to go back to the original story, this dude's head is smashed to bits.

522
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
 Let me go back to the actual story now.

523
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,320
 The Redditor said, we get there and there's just tons of blood.

524
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,160
 This dude's head is caved in.

525
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,320
 His teeth are all knocked out.

526
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
 His skin's all tore up and stuff like that.

527
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,960
 And his buddy gets down on the ground and starts checking the pulse of the body.

528
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
 And the guy's like, I'm going to call it in.

529
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,520
 This guy looks dead.

530
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,480
 I mean, his head's basically just smushed.

531
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,960
 It's like someone stepped on a mashed potato.

532
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,240
 Well, no, mashed potatoes already mashed.

533
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
 It's like someone stepped on a baked potato.

534
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,880
 Pfft.

535
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
 I didn't go to a culinary school either.

536
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,200
 I don't know if they're true to mashed potatoes or baked potatoes.

537
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,880
 Anyways, so as they're sitting around, his buddy's taking the pulse.

538
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
 The biker, there should be assumed because there was a bike nearby.

539
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,080
 I was just saying to some random dude, it was a guy on a bike who got hit by a car.

540
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
 Is how he started this.

541
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
 He could sit by a car and someone reports it in.

542
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,600
 There's a body there.

543
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,720
 There's a bike there.

544
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,760
 The guy jumps up to his feet, turns to us, gets a huge smile on his face,

545
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,320
 and tries to get on his bike.

546
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,360
 And the two EMTs in real life start wrestling with the guy and eventually he throws the bike

547
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,040
 to the ground and takes off through the forest, running the whole way.

548
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,120
 And the partner turns to the Redditor.

549
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
 So you turn to me.

550
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
 Wait, no, I don't want to be the Redditor.

551
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,520
 I turn to you.

552
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,720
 You're the Redditor.

553
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,680
 And I go, he had no effing pulse, man.

554
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,160
 So apparently the guy was getting his pulse taken,

555
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,520
 dude on the ground was getting his pulse taken.

556
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,560
 There was no pulse.

557
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,200
 And then he jumped up and took off into the woods.

558
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,080
 Now the EMT says, I don't know what happened to the person.

559
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,320
 Like our job kind of ends when the situation ends.

560
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,240
 A lot of times, it's funny because you think of medical personnel as being on the level of

561
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
 like firefighters and police officers.

562
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,360
 They tend to work for private corporations.

563
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,160
 It's not the same.

564
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,800
 Like obviously they're all heroes and they all help each other and help us.

565
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,320
 I'm not knocking them like that, but I'm saying like firefighters and police departments are

566
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,800
 managed by, they're pretty much city run things or county run things.

567
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 EMTs are like, oh, that's a private business.

568
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,080
 So there's no responsibility to follow.

569
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,400
 Like the police don't have to call the EMT and be like, oh yeah,

570
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,960
 we found that guy.

571
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
 He was at his grandma's house in the middle of the woods.

572
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
 His brains are coming out of his head.

573
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
 So that is possible.

574
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
 The fact that he had no pulse and he jumped up and ran away makes it a little more spooky.

575
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,640
 But there are people who suffer horrible injuries and then go into shock and take off running.

576
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,560
 I remember when I was a kid, my dad told me a story that once he saw a guy

577
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,120
 getting a really bad motorcycle accident and his helmet cracked open and he said,

578
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,040
 I could see his brain inside of his skull and he started to take off running and we had to

579
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,200
 like hold him there until the ambulance got there.

580
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
 And I remember going, did he survive him?

581
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,160
 I was like, I don't know.

582
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,640
 Like again, he's not going to call the hospital and be like, dude,

583
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,080
 that may, it's just something that happened.

584
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
 But it happened like back in the 70s.

585
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,920
 Like I may not even be wearing a helmet now that I think about it because it happened so long ago.

586
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,920
 But if you pick number six, if you pick number six,

587
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,280
 one day you're going to be riding your bike and you get home fine.

588
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,200
 No problem.

589
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,920
 They're not going to have you hit by a car because that's gruesome.

590
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,680
 Instead, you're going to walk into your house and you're going to be sitting there reading the

591
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,840
 newspaper because apparently it's 1984 and people still read the newspaper.

592
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,160
 You got a pipe in your mouth and you hear a psss.

593
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,800
 It's not the sound of someone pouring a can of sprite.

594
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,400
 Delicious, delicious sprite.

595
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
 It's the sound of glass breaking.

596
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,440
 It still sounds like sprite, but anyways, you get up and put your newspaper down,

597
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,960
 put on your slippers, put on your house slippers, and you see your back window busted open.

598
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
 You're like, oh, that's horrible.

599
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,680
 The insurance paper alone is going to be.

600
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,440
 And then while you're thinking about that because you're a nerd, you think about insurance stuff,

601
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,840
 you see a figure dart to the left and then dart to the right.

602
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,640
 You're like, okay, obviously someone's in here.

603
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
 Then must be my insurance adjuster already here to work on the window.

604
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,080
 But you're wrong.

605
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,440
 As you're looking for the cause of the break and behind you,

606
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,160
 you smell the unmistakable smell of recently exposed human brains.

607
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,520
 You're like, I haven't smelled that smell.

608
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,160
 I haven't smelled that smell since last week.

609
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,000
 And you turn around and behind you will be a man with a busted open head,

610
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
 no teeth, a wide smile.

611
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,960
 And he looks at you and he goes, let's go for a ride.

612
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:25,760
 And then for the rest of eternity, he's riding a bicycle and you have to sit on the handlebars

613
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,960
 of his broken bicycle as he rides through neighborhoods constantly getting hit by cars.

614
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,000
 And you're like, no, let's go ahead.

615
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,800
 I think I know, I know it sucks when I have to do this, but this episode is running extremely long.

616
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,720
 I might have to get rid of a number here.

617
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,160
 I think I'm going to get rid of number two.

618
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,600
 It's actually, I'm going to save number two for its own segment.

619
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,040
 Because number two actually is a really interesting one.

620
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,120
 I was originally going to have it end out this episode,

621
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,960
 but we're going to save it for its own episode.

622
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,680
 So if you pick number two, you save it, save it.

623
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,520
 But now pick a number between, no, not between, you can pick either five or three.

624
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,560
 Because if you pick number two, you simply just have to wait.

625
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
 You sit in a void.

626
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
 No, no, no, no, no, I'm never going to give you that option.

627
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,920
 Because then you just go like, well, I picked number two, so nothing bad happened to me.

628
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,360
 You have to pick five or three.

629
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,000
 You have to do it.

630
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,200
 So now we're going back to one of these Reddit stories where we have a person named,

631
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,040
 I Hate Arizona, saying they were a 911 dispatcher and they had these experiences.

632
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,000
 So we're going to change out of our EMT outfits.

633
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,160
 I'm going to keep my leather jacket though, because pretty dope.

634
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,240
 Look at, oh man, it really makes my arms look thick.

635
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,120
 Look at my shoulders.

636
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,520
 You're like, Jason, whatever, dude.

637
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,880
 And so anyways, we're walking and we got to put on 9/11.

638
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,000
 I don't know why I've been saying that recently.

639
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
 It's 911.

640
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,040
 There was a time when people were saying dial 9/11 and people, especially children,

641
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,960
 were having a hard time finding the number 11 on the phone as their mom's dying.

642
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,920
 And they're like, there's no 11, which makes sense for a kid.

643
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,560
 I never get tired.

644
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,680
 I never get tired of stories about little kids saving people.

645
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,920
 I always think those are so adorable.

646
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,880
 I never get tired of stories about people saving people in general.

647
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,560
 Sometimes I'll just watch YouTube videos of people saving lives,

648
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,280
 people lifting cars off of people and things like that.

649
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,640
 But when you hear about like six year old saves three year olds life,

650
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,600
 I'm like, aww.

651
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
 Or puppies saving people, all that stuff.

652
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
 Find that super adorable.

653
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,400
 Anyways, I have a story about that.

654
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,760
 I'll share it another time.

655
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,040
 But anyways, so where is it going?

656
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,360
 Oh yeah.

657
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,200
 So we're walking into the 911 dispatcher office.

658
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,040
 And we walk in there and they're like, hey, you guys must be the new recruits.

659
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,720
 I am not a recruit.

660
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,680
 I am a veteran.

661
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,280
 This is the recruit as I point my thumb at you.

662
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,680
 This guy, this guy right here, this is the recruit.

663
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,520
 He doesn't have this cool leather jacket.

664
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
 So because we're new there, we're going to be taking the same calls.

665
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,720
 Okay.

666
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,680
 We start, we're there.

667
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,280
 We're going to be here for a couple of weeks.

668
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
 So we're going to have to get a place together.

669
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,640
 We're going to have to get an apartment.

670
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
 And I get the top bunk.

671
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
 You're like, Jason, we can just get separate rooms.

672
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
 I get the top bunk.

673
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,440
 So we get a two bedroom apartment, but both bedrooms have bunk beds in them.

674
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,040
 And whatever bedroom you're in, I'm always sleeping in the top bunk.

675
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,520
 It's like Schrodinger's bunk.

676
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,600
 Like you don't know, no matter which room you pick, I'm at the top bunk.

677
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,480
 Am I on both top bunks at the same time?

678
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,760
 You don't know.

679
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,120
 You won't know until you open that door and find out which bunk I'm on,

680
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,040
 but I'm always on the bunk on top of you.

681
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,960
 Because over a few weeks, this Redditor says that they were getting phone calls

682
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,080
 from somebody they called Mr. Blue.

683
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,800
 Not his real name.

684
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,080
 He's not a superhero.

685
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,800
 He's not a member of the Mr. Happy family.

686
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 What were those names of those giant head people?

687
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
 They were like giant circle.

688
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,760
 I think it was Mr. Happys, right?

689
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
 They were just a circle with legs and arms.

690
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,400
 And there was like Mr. Happy and Mr. Sad and Mr. It doesn't matter.

691
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,720
 It doesn't matter what the names of those guys were.

692
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,600
 He's not one of those.

693
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,760
 He's an actual human being and Mr. Blue is just a pseudonym.

694
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,120
 And every night he would call up.

695
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,200
 And we're getting his phone call.

696
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,520
 911, what's your emergency?

697
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,000
 Yeah, I got the doll problem again, guys.

698
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
 It's Mr. Blue.

699
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
 I know you're calling me that behind my back.

700
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
 I'm okay with it.

701
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,680
 My toes and my fingers are kind of blue at this point.

702
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
 But I got the doll problem again.

703
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,480
 I'm like, well, Mr. Blue, you've called us quite a few times about the doll problem.

704
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
 Why don't you tell us one more time what the doll problem is?

705
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,320
 Well, you see, at night the dolls get up and they walk around.

706
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,560
 My wife's dolls, by the way.

707
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,280
 These aren't just dolls that are coming from neighbors' houses.

708
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,880
 I'm not at a KB toy store.

709
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,480
 The dolls, my wife has been collecting dolls and they walk around.

710
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,600
 Okay, that's pretty creepy, sir.

711
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,520
 Well, we can send out a unit.

712
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,640
 No, no, no, it's fine.

713
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,720
 I just want you guys to know about the dolls.

714
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,680
 Okay, Mr. Blue, have a good night.

715
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,400
 Good night.

716
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,440
 Good night, sirs.

717
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,760
 Click.

718
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,840
 And I turn to you and I go, well, here's the thing.

719
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,000
 If you look right here in our 911 system, it says that he has dementia.

720
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,880
 So we're going to assume that this guy is just nuts,

721
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,520
 that dolls aren't actually walking around.

722
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
 And I turn back to my workstation and then I go,

723
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,680
 "Did you just pee your pants, dude?"

724
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,120
 And you're like, "Yes, dude, dolls scare me so badly.

725
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,560
 I hate these phone calls.

726
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,160
 Can I please get another job?"

727
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,920
 Every night he calls and talks about the dolls.

728
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,520
 I'm like, "No, dude, get a grip.

729
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,960
 There's no such thing as haunted dolls.

730
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,280
 The dolls, it's impossible for an inanimate object to walk around on its own.

731
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,560
 It's flat out impossible."

732
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,160
 This guy called in every night saying that his dolls,

733
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,240
 his wife's dolls were walking around.

734
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,960
 And then we get a report that there's been a death at his house.

735
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,720
 His wife has passed away.

736
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
 And that's when we start getting a new set of calls.

737
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,120
 911, what's your emergency?

738
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:24,560
 The dolls, the dolls, they took my wife.

739
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,640
 Look over at you.

740
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 Puddle already appearing.

741
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,760
 Your Mr. Blue, yes, yes.

742
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,400
 My wife used to be here.

743
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,640
 But the dolls took her.

744
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,360
 They took her away from me.

745
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,360
 They kidnapped her and they won't bring her back.

746
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,800
 I want my wife back.

747
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,520
 I want my wife back.

748
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,000
 You want us to send some deputies out?

749
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,400
 Please.

750
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,360
 They can help me find my wife, right?

751
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,720
 And they can stop the dolls.

752
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,760
 They will definitely send some deputies out.

753
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,520
 Me and you are looking at each other a little more serious this time.

754
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,800
 Yeah, Mr. Blue, yeah, we'll send some deputies out.

755
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,280
 Now, this was a nightly thing.

756
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,000
 He would make these phone calls, calling about the dolls, chasing them around.

757
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,680
 He's walking with his walker.

758
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,200
 Little dolls are chasing him.

759
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,560
 He's like hanging on the chandelier.

760
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,880
 They're like have little forks getting ready to poke them.

761
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,320
 Get out of my house, Dagnev it.

762
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
 But once his wife passed away, the calls became a little creepier

763
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,480
 because he's believing that the dolls took his wife.

764
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480
 And then to make things even scarier,

765
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,200
 one day we're listening on the phone call.

766
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,480
 This is from the Reddit post, but now it's us because it's more dynamic.

767
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,880
 We're listening on the 911 call.

768
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,520
 We're getting the call.

769
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,880
 911, what's your emergency?

770
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,520
 There's a man in my couch.

771
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,200
 What?

772
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,080
 There's a man in my couch.

773
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,880
 And he's laughing at me.

774
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,480
 He's laughing at me.

775
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,520
 He's living in my couch and he won't go away and he won't stop laughing.

776
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,600
 You want us to send a deputy out?

777
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,840
 Yes.

778
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,880
 Maybe he can stop the laughing.

779
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,960
 Now obviously this is going to all be chalked up to...

780
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,400
 Oh wait, let me in the call first.

781
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,040
 Click.

782
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,520
 Turn to you.

783
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,680
 Obviously this is going to all be chalked up to dementia.

784
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,360
 It's because we have like this idea of dolls being creepy,

785
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,760
 which I don't think they're creepy, but dolls being creepy.

786
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,680
 Paranormal beliefs in the beginning.

787
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,960
 This guy lives in the middle of the desert.

788
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,600
 It's Arizona.

789
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
 The whole place is in the middle of the desert.

790
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,480
 How's all these creepy elements?

791
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
 But the Redditor also posts this.

792
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,720
 911, what's your emergency?

793
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,960
 I'm snapping my fingers.

794
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,600
 Get over here.

795
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,120
 It's Mr. Blue again.

796
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,840
 Get down and get that.

797
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,560
 Get the headphones on.

798
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,360
 You're like, "Damn it.

799
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,640
 You're wearing a diaper this time."

800
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,160
 I'm like, "Just get down."

801
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,440
 911, what's your emergency?

802
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,280
 It's the dolls.

803
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,080
 It's the dolls.

804
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,280
 They're still running around.

805
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,400
 They're still doing their thing.

806
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,760
 They won't bring my wife back.

807
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,160
 Well, sir, what?

808
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,880
 Is there anything?

809
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,680
 Mr. Blue shushes us.

810
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,360
 And then we hear a...

811
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,600
 In the background.

812
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,720
 Mr. Blue, is there someone there with you?

813
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,400
 Yes, there's someone there with me.

814
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
 Listen, it's the dolls.

815
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:19,120
 You have to send somebody.

816
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,680
 You have to send somebody.

817
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,800
 Please, they won't.

818
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,360
 Leave me alone.

819
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,520
 The Redditor, I Hate Arizona, says that sometimes he would be shushed.

820
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,000
 And you could hear the pitter-patter of little feet running in the background.

821
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,680
 That is most likely not true.

822
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,600
 It's actually physically impossible.

823
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,720
 I would believe more likely it was a ghost

824
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,120
 making the sound of a little footprint

825
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,800
 than an actual doll being able to move its legs in a fashion like that.

826
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,840
 But anyways, the Redditor doesn't actually say,

827
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,520
 "Yes, I know for sure there were little dolls running around."

828
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,240
 But it sounded sometimes that Mr. Blue was shishmeaning.

829
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,440
 It would sound like dolls running around.

830
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,800
 Eventually, though, the call stopped coming in.

831
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,440
 And the 911 operator has no idea what happened to Mr. Blue.

832
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,720
 But if you picked number five, you do.

833
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,040
 If you picked number five, one day you're sitting at home

834
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,680
 and you hear the pitter-patter of little feet behind you.

835
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
 And then you remember you have a puppy.

836
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,360
 You're like, "Oh, come here, Jules."

837
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,720
 And I'm petting your puppy.

838
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,320
 Not a doll was not a doll.

839
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,040
 But that night when you're sleeping in bed

840
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,840
 and your stomach starts to hurt, you're like, "Ugh, oh, my stomach.

841
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,080
 What is my stomach hurt so much?"

842
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,040
 And you get up, you hop off your bed to go to the bathroom

843
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,480
 and you walk into the bathroom and you're like, "That's weird.

844
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
 I can't reach the doorknob.

845
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,520
 The door is so high."

846
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,240
 Oh, and also my arms are plastic.

847
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,120
 "Oh, no!"

848
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,160
 And you're looking down and you can see your fingers slowly

849
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,400
 become plastic and little plastic fingernails

850
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,000
 and they become hard and crunchy.

851
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,640
 You're like, "No!"

852
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,200
 And you're shrinking and you're becoming a plastic little doll.

853
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,360
 Basically, you're turning into a doll similar to my haunted doll, Veronica,

854
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
 which I'll do an update on shortly.

855
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,360
 But eeeewww, you shrink down and now you're a little doll.

856
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,320
 And then bing!

857
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,880
 You're teleported to an old man's house on the edge of forever.

858
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,440
 Just desert surrounding it for miles and miles.

859
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,680
 Stark Arizona night sky.

860
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,200
 Permanently fixed over this house.

861
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,920
 A hellish dimension, if you will.

862
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,000
 And you're just a doll in a collection sitting there.

863
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,840
 And there's this old man with dementia walking around the apartment,

864
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,960
 constantly babbling about the dolls following him

865
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,240
 and them kidnapping his wife and how he can stop them.

866
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,680
 And he doesn't know what to do.

867
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,920
 And you're sitting there trapped in this doll body.

868
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,760
 And every night he walks into the doll collection room and he goes,

869
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,600
 "Why are you following me?

870
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,960
 Why are you following me?"

871
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,080
 But you realize that none of the dolls move.

872
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:05,280
 You're all just stuck there, posed in perfect position forever.

873
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,720
 And you also realize that the other dolls around you are people as well, trapped in this form.

874
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,760
 And every so often Mr. Blue comes in and he's so infuriated about being followed by you guys.

875
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,040
 That he grabs a doll at random and destroys it, pulls the arms off, cuts the body open.

876
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,920
 And as he does that, real life flesh and blood pours from these dolls.

877
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,440
 And then he throws them in a heap in a corner, broken and abused.

878
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
 And he leaves the room.

879
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,000
 And you can see them from where you're at.

880
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,040
 You can see their eyes still hold life, still hold human thoughts.

881
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,920
 They're not dead, just an eternal broken pain.

882
00:37:51,920 --> 00:38:00,000
 If you pick number five, you stand there as a doll, not able to move, not able to react.

883
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,600
 Knowing at some point Mr. Blue will come into the room and at random,

884
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,280
 choose you for eternal torture.

885
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,960
 And how's that for a Halloween?

886
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,040
 How's that for a Halloween episode?

887
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,560
 But we still got one more.

888
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,520
 We still got one more.

889
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,960
 I don't think I'm going to be able to top that though.

890
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
 I really should go out on top.

891
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,480
 But we picked one more.

892
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,200
 I'm like, oh, if you pick number three, you're number five.

893
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,320
 We got one more case to investigate here.

894
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
 This is also, we're going to end it with another Reddit post here.

895
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,400
 So hop back into the Jason Jalopy.

896
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,040
 If you're a little doll person, we have to help you up.

897
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
 I don't know why you're heavy, you're a doll.

898
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,520
 You weigh nothing, I'm just going to put you in the car.

899
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,880
 And then actually know you're trapped in the old man's house.

900
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,680
 You don't even get out.

901
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,520
 Sorry guys, you're trapped there forever.

902
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,120
 We are going to, this place has no location.

903
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,560
 So we're just going to say, this one takes place in your hometown.

904
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,640
 So we're in your hometown, we're driving around, you're like,

905
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,840
 oh, that's the park where I had my first Yu-Gi-Oh! battle.

906
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,920
 And I used my millennial medallion and I beat off the dark magician.

907
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,880
 Beat off the, yeah, you beat off the dark magician, all right?

908
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
 You're like, I didn't mean it like that.

909
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,520
 I didn't mean it like that.

910
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,840
 We're going, we're driving around your neighborhood.

911
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,080
 You're like, I really don't want you to know where I live.

912
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,320
 Jason and I was like, no, no, we're going to find out.

913
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,160
 I'm pulling you up in the database.

914
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,520
 I'm like, oh, there you live.

915
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,480
 I'm writing it down on a slip of paper, putting it in my pocket.

916
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,560
 I'll be visiting you later, jerk.

917
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,040
 You're like, what?

918
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,960
 I've been totally nice to you this whole episode.

919
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,640
 The whole world's mean to Jason.

920
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,880
 Jason's going to get his revenge.

921
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,840
 You're like, what are you talking about?

922
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,760
 You always say things are going great for you.

923
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,240
 Yeah, yeah, the facade is becoming too much to keep up.

924
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,560
 Honking to people in traffic.

925
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,520
 Get out of the way.

926
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:41,920
 Get out.

927
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,880
 You're like, dude, you're a cop.

928
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,840
 You just turned your siren on.

929
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,880
 I'm like, oh yeah, driving around.

930
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,440
 So we're in this dude's, we're cops.

931
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,880
 So we get a call, unit 91, unit 91.

932
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,560
 Why don't you go into this house?

933
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,880
 It's very unprofessional police department.

934
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,640
 Very, they don't use the right call signs.

935
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
 They just tell people to go to your house.

936
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,200
 Oh yes.

937
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,440
 Yes.

938
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,720
 I'll go to that house.

939
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,120
 Let's go.

940
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,600
 Driving around.

941
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,840
 Now this is from a Reddit user name SMW2102.

942
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,320
 So we jump in.

943
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,000
 So the two we jump in, we go into this guy's house,

944
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,760
 but since I already said the original version,

945
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
 we're going to get a trampoline.

946
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,280
 There's an open door that we can go through,

947
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
 but I pull out a trampoline.

948
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
 You're like, Jason, you really don't have to take things.

949
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,080
 So literally you just told me I beat off a dark magician.

950
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,640
 And now boing, boing, we jump.

951
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,280
 Woo.

952
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,000
 And we land in the second story roof.

953
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,360
 Pshh.

954
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,560
 Break through the roof.

955
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,240
 Now there's a real medical crisis going on downstairs.

956
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,600
 There's a serious problem, but instead I wanted to do that.

957
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,760
 And now I'm like, oh man, I put a hole in the roof.

958
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,720
 I'm repairing the roof.

959
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,600
 You're like, Jason, just do what you're supposed to do.

960
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,160
 You're a cop.

961
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,840
 I'm like, we can't leave this open.

962
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,640
 What a fracoon.

963
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,440
 So I make you sit there and sand wood down.

964
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
 I'm like measuring stuff.

965
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,200
 There's screaming going on downstairs.

966
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,560
 I'm like, mm-hmm.

967
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,160
 Oh, measure twice.

968
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,800
 Cut once.

969
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,480
 Mm-mm, cut and stuff.

970
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
 Anyways, we've repaired the roof.

971
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,680
 We walked downstairs.

972
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,360
 Now this is what's going on downstairs.

973
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,040
 There's this dude flipping out.

974
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,920
 He's been flipping out for like four hours at this point

975
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,280
 because we were repairing the roof.

976
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,440
 And the mom's like, I don't know what to do.

977
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,240
 Let's send my son.

978
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,520
 He's on some sort of drug.

979
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,480
 He's totally flipping out.

980
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,120
 He's like 20 years old flipping out.

981
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,040
 Well, okay, that's a lot of detail, ma'am.

982
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,760
 By the way, did you know that you have a termite problem?

983
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,920
 We discovered a couple of nests when we were fixing your roof

984
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,520
 and she's like, what are you--

985
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,680
 first off, how'd you guys come downstairs?

986
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,720
 Like, that was weird.

987
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,640
 But no, no, forget the termite problem.

988
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,840
 Forget the termites, okay?

989
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,560
 He's saying that there's a man hanging in his bedroom.

990
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,040
 Now, my son's really, really into drugs.

991
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,680
 And I'm kind of concerned that there might be.

992
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,920
 I don't want to go in there.

993
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,560
 Guy, son's like, I'm assuming he's a tweaker.

994
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
 It says that he-- of an unknown drug.

995
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,320
 But I'm pretty sure I know what drug it is.

996
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,000
 It's probably meth.

997
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,520
 And he's like, picking at a skin, picking at a skin in the corner.

998
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,120
 And we walk over to him and we're like, hey, son, what's going on?

999
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,920
 And he's like, dad?

1000
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,600
 And I'm like, no, son is a figure of speech.

1001
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,640
 He's like, aw.

1002
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,840
 And then we go, listen, dude, what's going on?

1003
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,040
 He's like, there's a man in my room.

1004
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,080
 There's a man in my room.

1005
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,880
 He's hanging.

1006
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,400
 He's hanging.

1007
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,240
 Yeah, I don't want to go in there.

1008
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,040
 There's a man in there.

1009
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,200
 And he has the uniform.

1010
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,280
 The uniform, he's dressed like a soldier man, soldier--

1011
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,760
 10-hut soldier, soldier person.

1012
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,600
 I don't know why he's a rain man.

1013
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,840
 Doing meth doesn't turn you into a cross between a bad joker

1014
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,040
 impression and rain man.

1015
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,160
 But apparently, that's what happened to this guy.

1016
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,440
 So we're standing around.

1017
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,520
 We're getting really annoyed by having to talk to this guy.

1018
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,360
 I can't stand talking to meth addicts.

1019
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,480
 I've had a lot of experience talking to meth addicts over my life.

1020
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,000
 And they're really, really annoying.

1021
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,840
 We're standing-- that's my-- that's my-- if I pick number five or whatever,

1022
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,560
 I'd be a doll trapped in a house with a meth addict.

1023
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,400
 Um, he's-- we were like, OK, I'm totally just like whatever, dude.

1024
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,080
 And you're like more compassionate.

1025
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,160
 And you're like, no, sir, tell us more.

1026
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,920
 Talk very loudly in Jason's ear about your experiences,

1027
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,000
 because now you have the power to get back at me.

1028
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,040
 And the man stands up.

1029
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,480
 He gets right in my face.

1030
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,600
 I can smell the meth coming off of him.

1031
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,400
 I can smell the formaldehyde coming off of his skin.

1032
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,600
 There's a man with a uniform in my-- in my room.

1033
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,640
 And he's hanging.

1034
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,440
 He's hanging.

1035
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,400
 Fine.

1036
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,760
 Let's go check it out.

1037
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,560
 So we walk into his room, and it's a filthy, disgusting, absolutely gross,

1038
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,800
 as you would expect the room of a drug addict to be.

1039
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,280
 No hanging man, though.

1040
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,800
 So meth-induced delusion, some sort of drug-induced delusion.

1041
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,040
 We walk in, we tell the mom, well, luckily--

1042
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,720
 no, there isn't a real human being hanging in your son's bedroom.

1043
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,400
 Unluckily, your son has a horrible drug problem.

1044
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
 He's having psychosis right now.

1045
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,280
 We should take him in.

1046
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,480
 We should take him in.

1047
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,200
 So we call up some backup, and I'm like, we need some backup here.

1048
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,400
 We're going to escort this guy down.

1049
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,920
 We're going to do some evidence collection here,

1050
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,960
 because there's a lot of drugs.

1051
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,800
 And also, if you have a saw horse, that'd be great,

1052
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,720
 because I saw a lot of pipe work I wanted to fix in their attic.

1053
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,800
 I wanted to do some-- they're like, why are you talking about--

1054
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,080
 we're no more home improvements, but we'll send out someone else.

1055
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,280
 So another police car pulls up, and one of the guys

1056
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,520
 who gets out of that police car, one of the assisting officers,

1057
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,160
 is a veteran.

1058
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,880
 He's been there longer than me, because you know how long I've been with the police horse.

1059
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,840
 So anyways, this veteran-- this is all according to the Reddit post--

1060
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,880
 the veteran comes up and says, what's going on, officers?

1061
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,520
 And I was like, oh, well, you know, this--

1062
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,720
 I just told him this story.

1063
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,080
 I just told you.

1064
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,720
 And he's like, oh, yes, yes, very interesting.

1065
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,080
 And he pulls us aside.

1066
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,760
 He goes, hey, mom, stay over there.

1067
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,320
 Stay over there.

1068
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,680
 I want to talk to these cops.

1069
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,640
 And we go into the room, and the veteran cop says,

1070
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,480
 you want to hear a weird story?

1071
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,440
 We're like, of course.

1072
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,120
 We're listening to Dead Ravir Radio.

1073
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,440
 I'm recording it, and he's listening to it.

1074
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,680
 So yes, the veteran goes, here, have a seat in this filthy, filthy bedroom.

1075
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,200
 And we're like, nah, we'd rather stand.

1076
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
 And the cop's like, yeah, I was trying to check you.

1077
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,600
 And it's sitting down on a human poop, which is everywhere.

1078
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,280
 But here's the actual story.

1079
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,040
 I came to this house years ago, and there was a man who committed suicide in this room.

1080
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,400
 Really?

1081
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:26,560
 Yeah.

1082
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,120
 Yeah, a man committed suicide in this room.

1083
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,600
 He was an elderly World War II veteran.

1084
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,920
 And he hung himself wearing his uniform.

1085
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,040
 We look at each other, and then we kind of look around the room,

1086
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
 see where a good place would be to hang yourself.

1087
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,280
 And we realize that it's right in between where the three of us are standing.

1088
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,720
 So we all kind of move away, walk out of the room.

1089
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,200
 And then I push you back in, and I shut the door.

1090
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,720
 And you're like, let me out, let me out, let me out.

1091
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,200
 And me and the veteran police officer chuckle.

1092
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,640
 We're like, ah, rookies.

1093
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,440
 You're like, no, no, let me out, let me out.

1094
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,480
 You know, meth psychosis, really sort of any drug psychosis,

1095
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,680
 a lot of times people think it breaks down the veil.

1096
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,040
 This is not an endorsement of these types of drugs.

1097
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,440
 People are like, oh dude, I really want a paranormal experience.

1098
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,360
 What if I do crack?

1099
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,720
 No, that's not the way it works.

1100
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,680
 But it's possible that this place did have a haunting that just plays out all the time.

1101
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,880
 But when your mind--

1102
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,200
 Sorry, leg cramp.

1103
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,000
 But when your mind is in the right mental state,

1104
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,680
 i.e. completely blitzed off drugs, it may be more common to see these things.

1105
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,920
 Meth psychosis, a lot of times people see demons, DMT, people see clockwork elves,

1106
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,880
 acid, mushrooms, any sort of drug that kind of alters your state.

1107
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,520
 It really, almost all drugs alter your state of perception.

1108
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
 Opaloid's not so much.

1109
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,680
 But like marijuana kind of changes the way your brain patterns thinking all that.

1110
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,800
 So anyways, any of those drugs can, people think, help you see these things.

1111
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,640
 If they can, that's not a good way to see these things.

1112
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,000
 Meditation or focusing or whatever would probably be a more healthy way to try to see the paranormal.

1113
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,240
 But it is possible that there was a haunting here that was playing all the time.

1114
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,920
 This guy's drug-induced psychosis allowed him to see it.

1115
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,360
 Or it's possible that it was just a drug-induced psychosis.

1116
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,160
 And the Redditor says, "I thought as a rational person that when they bought the home,

1117
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,720
 when that family, the mom and the son, moved into the home,

1118
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,520
 that the realtor said, 'Hey, an old man hung himself in this bedroom.'

1119
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,480
 I doubt that.

1120
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,680
 But as a skeptic, that's what the Redditor was saying.

1121
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,880
 She may have known this information and the son may have known this information.

1122
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,480
 And that's why he had that vision, because he already knew someone in an army uniform hung himself.

1123
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,120
 But it's unlikely.

1124
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,240
 But possible. That's far more possible than an actual ghost hanging.

1125
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,160
 But let's get to the meat of the matter.

1126
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,920
 If you picked number three, all of a sudden you're teleported to World War II.

1127
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,520
 Run people, soldiers over that hill.

1128
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,440
 And you're like, "Oh no, this is totally weird."

1129
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,840
 And you like jump up and you're in the body of a World War II dude running around,

1130
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,680
 just a normal human in World War II.

1131
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,040
 There's nothing special about you.

1132
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,840
 You're running around.

1133
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,320
 Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft

1134
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:25,920
 *Pfft* Shoot Nazis. Oh my guts! I mean, ah, mind guts!

1135
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,880
 Shootin. Fight your way through Germany.

1136
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,200
 You're riding a tank.

1137
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,920
 You get to Germany and you win.

1138
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,040
 Yay, you win the war. Spoiler alert, America wins.

1139
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,360
 Well, technically America, Britain, France, and a couple other people.

1140
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,600
 But we all know the truth. America wins World War II.

1141
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,240
 Yay! Russia kind of helped. Didn't do much.

1142
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,520
 You know, just kind of slackers really.

1143
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,440
 That's the way history looks at them, bunch of slackers.

1144
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,680
 Lost like maybe a thousand people of themselves, killed maybe 500 Nazis.

1145
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,360
 It wasn't a big deal on Eastern Front.

1146
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,800
 But the Western Front, USA, USA.

1147
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,160
 You come back to the United States, you meet some blonde Betty.

1148
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,760
 She actually looks like Blondie from the comic strip Blondie in Dagwood,

1149
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,440
 which is a really hot woman.

1150
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,160
 Has the little curlers in her hair, smoking a cigarette.

1151
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,160
 Hey, veteran, why don't you come over here and kiss her on the subway?

1152
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,760
 Apparently.

1153
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,680
 Just kiss her. You fall in love with her. You're a baby boomer.

1154
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,960
 You guys end up having three beautiful little kids.

1155
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,640
 Aww, so cute.

1156
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,880
 And you end up working at a job. You get an entry-level job.

1157
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,320
 You work. You work really, really hard at that job.

1158
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,960
 And you get promoted to manager.

1159
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,800
 And then you get promoted from manager to director.

1160
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,320
 And then you started out.

1161
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,560
 You were fighting in the trenches.

1162
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,080
 Not literally, because there are no trenches.

1163
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,480
 You were fighting in the fields of World War II as a young 20-year-old man.

1164
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,120
 You got married, worked your way up from the first company you worked for.

1165
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,240
 You are now running that company.

1166
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,720
 You are now CEO because people saw your pluck, your determination.

1167
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
 Didn't matter about your college degree.

1168
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,240
 Didn't matter about your connections.

1169
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,600
 You were in an era of American society where you could start off at the bottom

1170
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,880
 and end up at the top.

1171
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,040
 You are a CEO of a company because you were the best employee they ever had.

1172
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,160
 You end up retiring from that company.

1173
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,240
 What a great life.

1174
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,880
 You're surrounded by your kids, your grandkids.

1175
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,280
 But your body's starting to get old.

1176
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,040
 And you know it's time to say goodbye.

1177
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,400
 So you walk out into your vast estate that you've purchased with your money,

1178
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,320
 with your wealth that you've earned through hard work and determination.

1179
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,000
 You sit down next to your wife and you look out at the sunset and you go,

1180
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,240
 "I don't think I'm going to survive another day."

1181
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,080
 And she's like, "No, please stay with me."

1182
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,600
 And you're like, "No."

1183
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,920
 And then I realized that a good portion of my audience is women.

1184
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,600
 I have actually gotten a good portion.

1185
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:04,160
 So if I just, that's the expectation of your own gender.

1186
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,560
 Sorry.

1187
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,640
 So if I just realized that I have a lot of women listeners.

1188
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,040
 So it's, if you are a woman, everything's reversed.

1189
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,880
 You're the first woman fighting World War II.

1190
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,280
 They make a battlefield video game about you.

1191
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,760
 You end up becoming the first female CEO.

1192
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,800
 It's all the same stuff.

1193
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,400
 Just the word first female is in front of everything I said.

1194
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,120
 And you're married to a really hot buff dude.

1195
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,000
 Really hot buff dude.

1196
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,280
 So I don't, there's no comic strip.

1197
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,120
 You're married, you're married to that dude from Garfield.

1198
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,760
 What is his name?

1199
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,400
 Jim.

1200
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,160
 That's who you're married to.

1201
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,240
 But anyways, was that his name?

1202
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,800
 It doesn't matter.

1203
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,280
 It doesn't matter.

1204
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,240
 It's not the new story.

1205
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:52,400
 Anyways, so man or woman, you are married to a comic strip character.

1206
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,520
 You have the perfect life.

1207
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,680
 World War II veteran.

1208
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,400
 And you're sitting there on your Vasta state and you go,

1209
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,520
 "I think tonight is the last night I have on earth."

1210
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,280
 And then you die surrounded by loved ones.

1211
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,160
 You lived a great life.

1212
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,240
 The end.

1213
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,480
 So if you pick number three, you win.

1214
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,160
 So you won.

1215
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,400
 You won the game.

1216
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,440
 Jason, that's not really spooky.

1217
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,200
 You got people turning into dolls.

1218
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,640
 Come on dude.

1219
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,040
 I'm a World War II veteran who ended life successfully.

1220
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,280
 I thought I'm not going to turn into a hanging ghost

1221
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,840
 or I'm not going to become a meth addict or something like that.

1222
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,800
 No, no.

1223
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:43,280
 Because sometimes, sometimes, the spookiest thing is the thing we can never have.

1224
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:52,240
 Because in a world of the paranormal, in a world of killer dolls, monsters in the closet,

1225
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,920
 and beasts ready to rip us limb from limb,

1226
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,080
 a peaceful death is something.

1227
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,840
 None of us are allowed to have anymore.

1228
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,880
 So before you go out on Halloween, before that sun sets and that darkness starts,

1229
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,680
 make sure you're prepared for the real monsters out there

1230
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:25,520
 that will do anything they can to keep you from having a peaceful, beautiful death.

1231
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,720
 Monsters, monsters in the darkness are monster vision.

1232
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,840
 They're following you right now.

1233
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,600
 If you're listening to it, there's a monster behind you.

1234
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,160
 Ah, if you're backstool wall, it's coming out of the wall.

1235
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,720
 I'm totally fine.

1236
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,920
 I'm driving my car.

1237
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,160
 Nope.

1238
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,000
 There's a little ghost kid underneath, underneath your car.

1239
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,360
 Not underneath your car.

1240
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,760
 He's underneath your seat and little hands are reaching out right now to grab your foot

1241
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,440
 and push it onto the gas pedal.

1242
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,520
 I'm not worried about it.

1243
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,640
 I'm on a swing set.

1244
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,600
 There's totally fine.

1245
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,000
 Nope.

1246
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,680
 There's a little ghost kid pushing you.

1247
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,400
 You're like, that's nice.

1248
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,840
 That's no, he's pushing you off.

1249
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,040
 I'm not scared.

1250
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,240
 I'm laying in bed.

1251
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,480
 Yes.

1252
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,600
 And right behind you right now, there's a ghost walking up behind you.

1253
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,000
 You're like, that's fine.

1254
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,560
 I'm not laying.

1255
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,360
 I'm laying on my back.

1256
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,240
 I don't worry about it.

1257
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,920
 Well, then there's like two arms coming out of both sides of your bed.

1258
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,840
 Raise your sharp claws.

1259
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,000
 You're like, Jason, you're just going to keep.

1260
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,880
 You listen on spooky stuff.

1261
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,800
 I'm in the shower listening to this episode.

1262
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,320
 Ooh, sexy.

1263
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:37,760
 Watching your body get all soapy and the sponge moving all over the curves of your body.

1264
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,920
 But then there's just me sitting on the toilet watching you shower.

1265
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,560
 You're like, no.

1266
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,760
 Have a safe, have a safe, happy Halloween, guys.

1267
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,560
