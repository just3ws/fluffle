1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Was Ariana Grande haunted by a demon? Did she actually have concrete proof of the existence of ghosts?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we take a look at one of the supposed seven gateways of hell.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Does the devil really come out twice a year at Stoll Cemetery? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I just woke up.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I know it could probably argued that it's not really considered a nap if you go to bed at 7pm.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 But man, I was so tired when I got off work today. I was at dinner and then I just kind of started...

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 You ever see like a baby? Like just not off and like fall over? That was pretty much me.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And I thought, I still gotta record my podcast. I mean, I know what I'm gonna talk about, but I still need to sit down.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 The whole process takes about two hours, about an hour and a half plus uploading it to YouTube.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And I was like, I can't. I can't do it. So, and I was like, oh, just wait till tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And then I guess, you know, people get upset when you say something's gonna come out and it doesn't.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Rightfully so. I know there are gonna be times where I can't actually get an episode out on a certain day just out of sickness or technological issues.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 But I was like, okay, I'm gonna go to bed. I'm gonna go to bed at 7pm. I'm gonna take a nap.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And then I'm gonna wake up. When I wake up, I set my alarm clock for midnight and I was like, okay.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But I ended up only sleeping for probably about two hours. It's 9 o'clock now.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And I feel more awake. I knew that I could probably have recorded the podcast as sleepy as I was, but I wouldn't have been able to edit it.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And honestly, it probably wouldn't have sounded that great if I did it while I was that sleepy.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 One thing I have noticed, and you may, if you listen back to the intro I just did, I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what,

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 but I dropped words and left off the end of words, almost every sentence, in that past intro.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Like now I'm having to concentrate to make sure that I get those words in there, because I really did just wake up maybe like 10, 20 minutes ago.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I am quite sleepy. So that's a little puzzle for you. You can go back and go, man, he really did drop a lot of words in those sentences,

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 but he just kept on going. So let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So the first thing I wanted to talk about was Ariana Grande. Now, Ariana Grande, pop superstar.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I don't really think she needs more introduction than that. She's 25 years old. She looks like she's 16.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I actually used to watch that show she was on, Victorious. It's funny, because she was probably the most entertaining/most annoying character on that show.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 But yeah, out of all of them, she wasn't the one I thought would be, world famous, but it's cool that she is. I enjoy her music.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And you know, her music's pretty good. I do have probably four, the first four or five albums.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I'm not for sure. I haven't bought anything recently, but yeah, it's enjoyable. I enjoy a good rap music and I enjoy top 40 pop music.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's a weird combination, but so Ariana Grande, but it's not like Kanye West where I will be like, oh, I really like Kanye West,

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 even though he's like a total weirdo. I make excuses for him because I like him so much.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Ariana Grande is a pop star who I buy albums from. There are some artists that I will defend to the death.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So when Kanye West is floating around on a glass stage or dressing up as like a giant block person or doing that incredibly insane Saturday Night Live performance,

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I'll be like, no, you guys just don't understand the genius of Kanye West.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Ariana Grande is like, oh, she is a good pop star. She's good at what she does.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I'm always afraid she's going to blow her vocal cords out, though.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I remember, anyways, it's enough talking, it's enough of me reminiscing about Ariana Grande. Let's get onto the story.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So Ariana Grande, she said that she had a encounter with ghosts/demons, really demons.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Now, everyone kind of has a story about ghosts and demons. Well, most people do, but very rarely are they so big in the public eye

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 that they're interviewed by Complex Magazine and it's just like a weird aside in this article.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 The interviewer is like, oh, you have nice hair. Oh, you know, what's good for your next project.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And then the conversation starts to steer towards the dark, the macabre.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And so what happened was this is the story that Ariana Grande told to Complex Magazine in 2013.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So she went to Kansas City. She was on tour, I'm assuming, because I don't think that's an area that Ariana Grande would normally hang out in.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But anyways, first she said she's really into ghost stuff, paranormal stuff, which I will say, guys, the boob hill, I'm telling you,

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 if you express an interest in the paranormal, girls will flock to you, even Ariana Grande will flock to you.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So Ariana Grande is in Kansas City. And first she says they go visit a haunted castle.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Now I looked that up and there's no castles in Kansas, but there is something called the Sours Castle, which is a haunted building.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And I think that's what she was referring to. And I looked at the hauntings there and it was just like a ball of light or like the shadow of a dude walks.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I was like, I'm not going to spend time talking about it. But anyways, so she went there. She probably thought the same thing.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And then her and her friends were like, let's go to Stoll Cemetery. So Stoll Cemetery is considered one of the seven gateways to hell.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It's one of the seven places on earth that the devil can enter into our reality. And we'll get into more in that in a second.

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 But let me finish the Ariana Grande portion of this story. So Ariana Grande is talking to Complex Magazine and she says that the Pope won't fly over Stoll Cemetery.

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So in the, I think it was the 70s or the 80s when Pope John Paul was flying, not like Superman, but his jets.

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Not his jet will not fly over the cemetery. He had the pilot divert his plane so it wouldn't fly over Stoll Cemetery because it's unholy land.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 We'll get more into that as well. But anyways, so the Pope's plane won't fly over it.

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Her and her friends went there at night and the car, the smell of the car was full of sulfur.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And Ariana Grande started to feel sick. There's just this negative energy filled the car up. And then there was a fly in the car.

60
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Now a fly is the sign of a demon. We'll get into that. We'll address all of these things.

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But let me tell you the rest of this story. There's a fly in the car. Now she rolls down the window and she yells out to Stoll Cemetery.

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 We apologize. We didn't mean to disrupt your peace. And she takes a picture, which I take it as a human.

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 So let's say like some kids are like bugging you and you're sitting there and then someone goes, we're sorry.

64
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 We didn't mean to disrupt your peace. And you're thinking, oh, those are good kids.

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And then they pull out a camera and take a picture of you and drive off.

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And this picture apparently showed three distinct faces, which Ariana Grande described as textbook demons.

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So you imagine like horns, maybe a long face, big grin, things like that.

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Now of course the interviewer for Complex Magazine asks what any normal person would ask right away.

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Where's the picture? And not in an accusatory tone.

70
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 She's like, wow, that's an amazing story. I want to see that picture. She deleted it because it was possessed, basically.

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 It was a dark picture. She said she tried to send the picture to her manager.

72
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And when she put it as an attachment in the email or sent it through SMS or however she did, it said this file is too large.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It's 666 megabytes. Oh, dude.

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And then she said she started to see this shadowy figure. So this is actually from the interview.

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 This is what Ariana Grande said. "I was going to sleep about two weeks ago."

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Now 2013, not now. "I had just gone off the phone and as soon as I closed my eyes I heard this really loud rumble right by my head."

77
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 When I opened my eyes it stopped immediately.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But when I closed my eyes, it started again with whispers.

79
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Every time I closed my eyes I started seeing these really disturbing images with like red shapes.

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Then I opened my eyes and got back on the phone and I was like, I'm really scared and I don't want to go to bed tonight.

81
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And then I scooched over to the left side of my bed because that's where the best service is in the room.

82
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And there was this massive black matter. I don't know what it was.

83
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 It was like a cloud of something black right next to me. I started crying. I was on the phone like, what do I do? What do I do?

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And they said, not the ghost. Not the ghost. The person on the phone said, tell it to F off.

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I thought, I'm not going to do that. It's going to upset it.

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So I'm just going to chill and not feed into it and because all it wants is my fear, it feeds on fear.

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I watched it move to the front of my bed and then I fell asleep on the phone.

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 I woke up and it was gone. The next night my friend Tyler was staying with me.

89
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 She said she was trying to sleep and her body felt paralyzed.

90
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And she described the exact same thing I saw.

91
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And then the interviewer goes, alrighty then and moves on to the next topic, which I guess the interviewer really was there to do an article for Complex Magazine about the lives and times of his glamorous singer.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 But she seemed like she was just like, very dismissive of her.

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And that's the thing when people tell paranormal stories, things like that.

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I try to be when it's face to face. I know when I was reading that it was kind of smart of me, but I'm going to get into elements of that, elements of her whole story.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Generally when people tell me a story face to face, no matter how incredulous it is, I'll be like, oh yeah, that's really interesting.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And then, of course, there's a point where you have to break it off.

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 But a lot of times when people have these experiences, unless they're lying right to your face, which happens time to time, to them it's almost like a religious experience.

98
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And they're also really reluctant to tell people.

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 So when you tell a story to someone and you go, alrighty then, then they're really going to stop sharing those stories with anyone.

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And these are just personal stories that people go through.

101
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 So let's look at this quickly, because there's a couple of elements that I want to touch on here.

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And I'll start off by doing this.

103
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So in, because I'll forget otherwise, I had a plan and then I realized something while I was reading her quote.

104
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 So let me touch on what this is.

105
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 There may be a biological answer to this, but the thing where she says that she closed her eyes

106
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 and she would hear something and then she opened them and it went away.

107
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 She closed her eyes and she would hear a noise.

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 She opened it and it went away.

109
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I didn't repeat myself. That actually happened a few times.

110
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So I've experienced that.

111
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And I don't know if I never thought, when I read this story, when I was prepping the story, that didn't stick out to me.

112
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It wasn't until I was kind of taking my time reading it.

113
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 That happened to me.

114
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It happened to me one time where I was trying to sleep and there was something.

115
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I'll tell the story. This episode is probably just going to end up running long, but I was sleeping at my grandma's house in my room bordering the backyard,

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 which is where I said there's been some, I had paranormal experiences with shadow people and things like that.

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I remember one night because I didn't really have a bed.

118
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I had like a futon mattress on the floor.

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And one night I was sure, and so it was a futon mattress on the floor and then cement underneath.

120
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 It was surprisingly comfy. I can kind of sleep anywhere.

121
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And I had my little cat, Remy. He was hanging out in there. He was asleep.

122
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But as I'm laying on my little futon on the cement.

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And I remember one night I went to go to sleep and I shut the light off and I closed my eyes.

124
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And I felt all over my back, on my neck and my head, I felt fingertips pushing through the mattress.

125
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 It felt like probably 20, 30 hands.

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 All just kind of trying to lift me with fingertips.

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I felt them all over from my back to my neck.

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Immediately opened my eyes, turned on the light.

129
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I was like, that's obviously impossible. Like nothing could do that.

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 But it totally creeped me out and I'm sitting there, the lights on.

131
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I closed my eyes and I start to feel it again.

132
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 All these, and it was only when I closed my eyes when I felt all of these fingers,

133
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 it felt like someone, felt like a bunch of people under me were kind of poking me with their whole hand.

134
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It was very, very disconcerting.

135
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And so I opened my eyes again and that happened a few times.

136
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And then eventually I was like, this has to be, this is either really happening and this is all they're going to do,

137
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 or it's all in my head.

138
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And so just like Ariana Grande, I just made the decision to fall asleep.

139
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So that is an interesting part of her story because I've experienced it myself.

140
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And I've said that before, there's a lot of stuff that I read that I'll kind of dismiss out of hand

141
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 because I haven't experienced it. That's just part of kind of being a skeptic and not really knowing where,

142
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 where the division between someone telling the entertaining story and somebody actually telling the truth.

143
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 But I've experienced that where you only, it only happens when you close your eyes,

144
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 but there could actually be some sort of psychological component to that.

145
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 That being said, let's go back and talk about the other issues with her story.

146
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So the idea of a photo being 666 megabytes, that's possible,

147
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 but the thing is, that part didn't necessarily ring true because generally you can send files,

148
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 correct me if I'm wrong, in 2013 even, a file that's 666 megabytes isn't incredibly large.

149
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Now it could have been that the file was 666 gigabytes and that wouldn't be impossible to send.

150
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It could be that she, I'll say this, I don't think she made the story up.

151
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 I think there may be parts of it that aren't, there absolutely are parts of it that aren't factually correct,

152
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 but I don't think she's making it up and you'll see what I mean.

153
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So let's take it apart though. She has the file, 666 megabytes, the number 666 is the mark of the beast.

154
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 There's even debate about that, whether or not that's the actual mark of the beast,

155
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 but it's generally assumed with satanic imagery that file should still be allowed to be sent, dead.

156
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And it's possible that it was 666 gigabytes as she misread it.

157
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 It's possible that that part of the story is not entirely true, but again, I think the other elements of her story are true,

158
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 so I don't think she's making that up.

159
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Is there a chance that she took a photo and it had proof of demonic activity on it and it was 666 megabytes/gigabytes?

160
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's possible, I think that's probably the weakest part of her story, honestly.

161
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 I think that's the part of her story that I'm questioning a little bit,

162
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 but for whatever reason she had a photo and she deleted it.

163
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Now, the fly in the car, that's a sign of the devil, Bales' old bub was the Lord of Flies.

164
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 That could be a coincidence that she's driving her car and there's a single fly in her car,

165
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 and to jump to the conclusion, I can understand if she just saw the fly in her car and jumped to that conclusion, it may be ridiculous,

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 but when she's connecting it with the smell of sulfur and the ghosts, the negative activity where she was at,

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I mean, she would actually make a pretty decent paranormal investigator because she didn't say there was just a fly in the car,

168
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 and that means demons. There was other elements that added to it, but I'm assuming there actually was a fly in the car.

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 I'm assuming, again, I don't think she's lying, but the biggest issue with this story,

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 it's wrapped in a bunch of mythology that can easily be dismissed, that Ariana Grande wasn't being trying to be a liar about it,

171
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 it's actually just not factually true, and that's the story, the legend of Stoll Cemetery.

172
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So let's talk about that briefly, this episode is definitely going to run long.

173
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So Stoll Cemetery is a spooky, well, I shouldn't say spooky, it's a cemetery in the middle of Kansas,

174
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 and it doesn't get explored a lot, there's never been a paranormal investigator show shot out in Stoll Cemetery,

175
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 despite its legendary reputation as being one of the seven gateways to hell, and there's a few reasons why one, it's out in the middle of nowhere.

176
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 But so this town of Stoll was founded in 1857, it's only a few buildings, it's not even really a city, it's an unincorporated town.

177
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So to people who don't live in America, there's basically like, we have cities and we have suburbs,

178
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 and then every so often there's little breakaway towns, sometimes they're on the edge of suburbs, sometimes in the middle of nowhere,

179
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 but they're not considered an actual city, it's just buildings, a place people live.

180
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 You have to incorporate to become a city.

181
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So Stoll was a little town, in 1912 it only had 31 people, the max amount of people that it has had is about 50 people.

182
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 There may be a few more people there now, but it's just a very, very small town.

183
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Before Karsit was a two hour trip to the nearest town.

184
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Now Stoll, the city of Stoll had two major tragedies.

185
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 One was they were doing a controlled burn on a field and a little boy got lost in the field and he got circled by fire and burnt it up.

186
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 The second big tragedy they had in that town was one person went missing and they later found him hanging from a tree.

187
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Now those wouldn't even be on the radar for most cities, townships in America.

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 But when you only have 30 to 50 people, one death is a big deal.

189
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And the little boy dying in the burning fields, horrible.

190
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And the guy hanging from the tree, those are horrible incidences, but they're not these major tragedies in most cities that have 10,000 people, 20,000 people so on and so forth.

191
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Now the first time Stoll Cemetery is exactly what it sounds like. It's just the cemetery.

192
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Apparently there was a professor at the University of Kansas who would tell the students at the college that Stoll Cemetery was a gateway to hell.

193
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 It was one of the seven gateways. He would tell this story to college kids.

194
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 It sounds a lot like me, just kind of just riffing on, you know, riffing to people.

195
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And in 1974 the University of Kansas was the newspaper for the University of Kansas.

196
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 They ran a story about Stoll Cemetery as one of the gateways to hell.

197
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 That's where the legend started. No one, other than this professor, there was really nobody else talking about this.

198
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And the newspaper ran this article and it totally took off.

199
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 The article posits, the article says that the gateway opens at midnight on the spring equinox and on Halloween and that is when the devil can pop out of it.

200
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 There is a church there, the evangelical Emanuel church that is now possessed by the devil.

201
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The church has been torn down now, but it had no roof at a time and the legend went that even on rainy nights with no roof the inside of the church was bone dry.

202
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 It was the power of the devil keeping the rain out.

203
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Seems like an odd power for the devil. Why would he care if the church got wet? Does he not like water?

204
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Don't tell me it's because hell's on fire, but anyway, so he would keep water from getting into the church.

205
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 There was legends that there were rich witch trials in Kansas. There never were. There was no record of them, at least.

206
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 So this legend just grew and grew and grew. In 1980 people just started ascending upon this little town of 50 people.

207
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 They were rowdy teens and college students, they were like, "Yeah, we're going to be here. We're going to see the devil show up on the equinox.

208
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 We're going to watch the devil come out on Halloween."

209
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It ended up peaking in 1988. 500 people showed up on Halloween and nothing happened, of course. They trashed the graveyard.

210
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Now cops are stationed there, generally on those two days, but they usually have a guard as well.

211
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 In 1999 a news crew showed up to be like, "Hey, we're going to investigate this story."

212
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And they got ran off by the townspeople. They're like, "We don't want you here. You guys are just trash in the place and everything like that.

213
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 We got all these looky-loos coming."

214
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And that's the second reason why no ghost investigator show has ever come out here is because townspeople don't want them.

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 They don't want any publicity. They're not in.

216
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 They could easily turn into a tourist town and have gift shops where they sell little gateway toys and little demon figurines.

217
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And people would go there and they'd look around the cemetery for a while and then they'd blow $100 in their gift shop.

218
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 But they refuse to do that. The people in town don't want any attention whatsoever.

219
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 So no one can investigate it. No ghost shows can show up nothing.

220
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Now, Supernatural, the Stoll Cemetery is a big part of their mythology.

221
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 One, the two Winchester boys were actually born in Kansas.

222
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And Kripke, Eric Kripke, the creator of the show, Supernatural, said he did that.

223
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 He placed them there because of Stoll Cemetery.

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And then the season finale for season five, this great huge battle, takes place in Stoll Cemetery

225
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 because they're going to face down the devil and they have to do it at one of the gateways to hell.

226
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And I will say this briefly. Again, episodes are running long, but first five seasons of Supernatural are great.

227
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 If you're into the Supernatural, if you're into like action shows, mystery shows, and X-Files type,

228
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 check out the first five seasons of Supernatural. They were great.

229
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Now, the seasons after that, they've been hit or miss, but the first five seasons of Supernatural are really, really good television

230
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 if you're into this type of stuff. Definitely the first five seasons.

231
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So it was interesting. I was reading an article.

232
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 A reporter did go out to Stoll Cemeteries. It was a very, very well-written article.

233
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I'll put it in the show notes, of course, but he said, he goes, "You know, I watched the Supernatural and I read all this stuff about it.

234
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And you think it's this cemetery in the middle of nowhere. He goes, "The town itself is in the middle of nowhere."

235
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Well, the cemetery is like right off the freeway, and there's a bunch of houses facing it.

236
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 So he goes, "I pulled up, and on one side of me was just cars flying by.

237
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 On the other side of me was a bunch of townspeople sitting on their porch staring at me."

238
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 He goes, "It was not what I expected." He goes, "I expected this spooky cemetery."

239
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 He goes, "It's just regular cemetery. It's just very noisy. There's people all...

240
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Really, there's witnesses all around June, things like that."

241
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I'm assuming Ariana's grande's car was probably going down that freeway.

242
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Maybe they took a short detour, but it's totally accessible if you can get to the town.

243
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And the story that the Pope's plane refused to fly over Stoll Cemetery completely made up.

244
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 The reference to that said it was in a Time magazine article.

245
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 The Pope never said that. The pilot never said that. There's no confirmation that it ever happened.

246
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Completely made up story. The Pope has no problem flying the Pope plane over Stoll Cemetery.

247
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But I will say this. It is really weird that the townspeople don't want any attention.

248
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Because again, Roswell, their entire tourist industry, millions of dollars a year

249
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 based on holding up this idea that aliens crashed there.

250
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And you can look at all other sorts of Winchester Mystery House.

251
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 You can look at all these other touristy trap places in America and really around the world

252
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 that are like the most haunted city in the world. The most haunted house in the world.

253
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 You know, this is a haunted tree. Come visit the haunted tree and go to our gift shop.

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 So it's one of two things. Either the people in Stoll really do not want

255
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 a bunch of people coming around poking around their graveyard.

256
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Or they're possibly covering something up.

257
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Is it really a gateway to hell? And is it so ingrained in that area that the people who live there,

258
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 rather than making a quick buck from people like Ariana Grande and every paranormal ghost show in the world,

259
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 rather than bringing them there and making millions of dollars, what if they know what's really there?

260
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And the town is almost infected by some sort of dark spirit, some sort of dark energy

261
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 almost controlling the town. Keep them away. Keep them away so they don't know what really goes on here.

262
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 The Pope will fly his plane over it. But on the ground is there something darker covering up

263
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 what's really going on in the town of Stoll. I can almost just imagine this town that looks normal at night.

264
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Just 50 people. Even that seems bizarre that it's still so small, but it's normal during the day.

265
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It's closed off to outsiders. How do they have 50 people yet enough cops to guard the cemetery?

266
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 The more you think about it, the creepier it sounds. It almost seems plausible that you have this town

267
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 that is set up for one reason and one reason only. To guard the gateway to hell.

268
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And not to guard it in the sense that Sam and Dean Winchester would go to shut it down,

269
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 but to work for some sort of supernatural darkness that's there.

270
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Guardians. It's the ones that keep people away all year around.

271
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 So those two nights when the gateway does open, the dark ones can enter our world unseen.

272
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 They could make a lot of money. I could be putting sinister implications on a town that would just rather be left alone.

273
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 A small town with an old, quiet, slow way of life.

274
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 But sometimes the cover-up is what ends up making things more suspicious.

275
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Is there anything at Stoll Cemetery? We may never know, but it's likely that the people in the town of Stoll definitely have the answer.
