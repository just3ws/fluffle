1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Is there really a group of Russians who worship a cartoon mouse?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at the interesting phenomenon known as "sky jellyfish"

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Are some UFOs actually living organisms?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm feeling a lot better.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 A lot better. And that's the thing, I knew I just had to write it out for a day or two.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 But on a ton of water weight, but I already lost five pounds of that just today

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 because I went back on to my keto diet.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And I'm doing fine without the lost inches. I just yesterday was really rough.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You know, here's a little tip. You know, it's interesting because I'm recording this day by day

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 and it's an entertainment program, but it almost doubles as a journal.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That months from now or years from now when I'm listening back to this

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 or to people who will find the show later on, they're listening to the show, you know, years from now.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 They'll go, "Man, that guy sounded like he was really in kind of a rough bind for this past couple episodes."

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And when I listen back to it, I'll be like, "Oh yeah, I remember. I didn't feel good."

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 But history just marches on. Time just marches on.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 These uncomfortable days I've been going through are just going to become memories.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 That's one of the things that always kind of keeps me pushing along.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Your bad day today will be an inconsequential three or four years from now.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It sucks and your job sucks and you had a really crummy day and a lot of bad stuff happened.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 But five, six years from now, you'll be like, "Oh yeah, I remember that happening."

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It will just be a memory instead of the big event that it is right now. Always keeps me going.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Now, this first story here is a story that was a request.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I actually, when I was doing the episodes on the Sherry Shriner cult,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I got a request from Izspecial on YouTube.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And Izspecial said, "Hey, have you heard of the Gadget cult? The Gadget Hackwrench cult in Russia?"

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It's a bunch of Russian people who worship the cartoon mouse Gadget from Rescue Rangers.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And I said, "No, I hadn't heard of it. I'll look into it."

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Now, I had a working knowledge of a fan base of Gadget Hackwrench, but we'll get to that in a second.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I did look up this cult, though. It's an interesting story. Thanks for the recommendation, Izspecial.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 It's an interesting story because there isn't one.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 What it is is there is a series of photos of what appeared to be a bunch of people of Slavic descent,

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 most likely Russian, I don't know, gathered around photos of Gadget Hackwrench.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And she was from Chippendales Rescue Rangers. It was that stupid cartoon. I couldn't stand it.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 It was never as good as DuckTales. It wasn't as good as Gummy Bears. It wasn't as good as Tailspin.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Those are all such classic, classic Disney cartoons. I didn't like Darkwing Duck.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I didn't like Chippendales Rescue Rangers. But out of all of those series,

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I would have to say that, yes, Gadget probably is the sexiest out of all the characters in those shows.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Scrooge McDuck could pull off a, you know, he was a little sexy, sexy little duck man,

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 but, you know, playing it straight, it's Gadget.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So I can understand why out of all of them you'd pick her.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But anyways, there's all these photos of a bunch of Slavic people,

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 a bunch of Russians, Eastern Europeans, is probably a more appropriate term,

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 standing around pictures of Gadget Hackwrench.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Multiple photos of this. Some of them are marching down the street carrying a banner with her.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Some of them are having some sort of meal and there's like a big picture of Gadget standing there.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 There was nothing backing any of this up. The photos, this is what's so bizarre.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 The photos are most likely real, but every article I found regarding this group was all speculation.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 They're like, "Here's this group. They worship Gadget Hackwrench, but there's no specifics.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 There's no like, "This is the founder of the group. This is the city that they're in.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 This is when these photos were taken." The information was all over the place.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Some of them said, "Oh no, here's like the 10 Commandments of Gadget Hackwrench.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Here's like, she's supposed to be the Christ figure and then some ugly fat mouse, some bad guy mouse.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Like, oh no, fat cat, fat cat, who was also in Rescue Rangers, represents like the Antichrist.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But like, here's a quote, "There were even plans for erecting the Temple of Gadget,

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 which was supposed to look like a hexagonal pole in the form of a nut up to 20 meters high.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Alas, this idea required a lot of money, so the cult follower was had to abandon it.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 There's no proof of that at all." All of these quotes, they're not actually given any attribution.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 They call her supposedly "Gadget Lightbringer," but it's almost like these photos popped up

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 and then there was a backstory created for them.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 One of the websites mentioned that this was set up on a website called thefandome.com.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Fandome.com, which is basically a collection of fandoms.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So I joined, thanks is special, because it linked to my Facebook profile, so my photos on this website now.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I joined it and I joined specifically the fandom for Chimadales Rescue Rangers.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 There wasn't one specifically for Gadget.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 They only had 12 members, 58% of them were from Russia because it shows a little like demographic geography map thingy,

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 which shows where people are.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And yeah, my photo, my photo is linked to that.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I'm now the 13th member of this Chimadales Rescue Ranger group on the fandom.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But for all the photos and all of the publicity this thing has gotten,

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 you'd think there would almost even be more people like me who were joining just to see what the whole balloon was all about.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 There's nothing.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I think that the photos are most likely real, but I think the backstory is made up.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 We've seen, you know, a good example of that, we did a photo about the falling man.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 There's that famous photo of like the ghost falling into frame of the old family.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 It turned out to be a hoax, but had an elaborate backstory written about that photo.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 None of it was true. None of it was true.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 A lot of the details of like what the ghost is doing, it was all made up, and I think that's what we're looking at here.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But I did know there was a kernel or a nut of truth regarding this,

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 because before I went on 4chan long, long, long, long time ago, back in like 2008, 2007,

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I discovered a website called Encyclopedia Dramatica and they basically profile,

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 they're kind of like the old version of Kiwi Farms, which is, they profile all the weird people on the internet.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And Encyclopedia Dramatica had a very, very detailed article about a group of people who love the Rescue Ranger so much,

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 that one of them would draw perverted cartoons where him and Gadget Hack wrench are banging.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 He's a normal human sized guy, and it's still a little cartoon mouse.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Very, very bizarre. He was also 56 in 2007, so he was much older.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 He wasn't like, I'm sure a lot of these guys who fantasize about banging this mouse,

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 grew up watching Chibanel's Rescue Rangers, but he would have been in his 30s when that show came on, so quite odd.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And he was a big member of a website called the Acorn, what was it called?

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 The Acorn Cafe, Acorn Cafe. I went there too.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So this website was super active back in 2008, as of today, still in operation.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 The last, last forum post was May 10th, 2019, when I was researching the story, which was about two weeks ago.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So it's still very active. There are people out there who love the Rescue Ranger so much, they're still talking about it.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 The show sucked. She was, yes, top tier of a bunch of unsexy ducks and orangutans and stuff like that. Fine, sure.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But that's a long time we'd be talking about it. People have their passion.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 I will say this, they did talk about going to a discord, so I'm sure a lot of the other boards on this Acorn Cafe are now just underground.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 They're inaccessible to us. But there's still something so, and I've used this term a couple of times regarding websites,

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 something still so charming about forums, little animated gifs, little like emoticons, like dancing around as you're trying to read stuff.

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I love that stuff. I love old internet. I really do. It just definitely has a different feel to it.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So is there a Russian cult that worships Gadget Hackwrench? Most likely not.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Is there a subculture of people around the world that still worship Gadget Hackwrench? I believe so.

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I think they know better than to be photographed doing it, but I could be wrong.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 The photos could be real. The photos could be members of the Acorn Cafe, finally out and about in their pride, their love of this cartoon mouse.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 But the idea of them thinking that Gadget is some sort of Christ figure, they're going to build a giant nut, a giant screw nut.

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I think all that stuff is backstory that's been made up. But still, subcultures fascinate me.

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I'm sure the writers of that show are, I'm sure they know about it, and I'm sure they're totally shocked.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I watched a documentary on My Little Pony, like behind the scenes, My Little Pony stuff.

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And you could tell it really took them, it really kind of shocked them, the type of fan base that they had.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But I mean, what are you going to do? You can't pick your fans. You can't pick your fans.

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I pick fans who make me register on a Chippendale Rescue Ranger forum, which now my Facebook photo is assigned to it.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Those are my fans. No one's building giant statues of me that I know of.

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Maybe you are. Maybe you will. Maybe I will be the leader of my own subculture. Who knows? Most likely not.

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And if I am, don't draw cartoons of you banging me, because that is a line too far.

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Let's go, unless I'm mouse-sized, because then it's just kind of funny. Don't do it, actually. No, no, no, even if I'm mouse-sized.

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now, our next story also is a subculture.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Now, I always find this fascinating when groups splinter. It happens a lot in the paranormal world.

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So, you have people who believe in aliens. Most people, if you ask people, "Do you believe in aliens?"

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 The general answer is yes, but I don't think they visit Earth. They go, "Yeah, I believe in aliens. Statistically, there's probably aliens. I just don't believe they visit Earth."

122
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And I think that's the most common, there's very few people who go, "No."

123
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 We're the only life form in the universe that has any sort of intelligence. Or Earth is the only planet that has intelligence.

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Or not even intelligence. People will go, "Yeah, I believe in aliens, but they're probably like microbes a thousand light years away."

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And you'll be like, "Yeah, I mean, that's an alien." Kind of lame alien, but it's an alien nonetheless.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 So that's what most people say. And then you have a subgroup of that who say, "Yes, aliens are real and they visit Earth."

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And then you start to splinter underneath that. Some of them say aliens are here and they're a bunch of hippies, and they're trying to prevent climate change.

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Some of them say, "Yes, aliens are here and they're shape-shifting reptilians and they're evil."

129
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Some people say aliens are interdimensional. Some people say aliens are demons.

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So, you have, and they're all related to that first branch of people saying, "Yes, I believe in aliens."

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And then you see all these splinters.

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Now, we've covered people who believe aliens are demons. We've covered interdimensional aliens, kind of.

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Not as much as I want to, but that's a really broad topic.

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Reptilians, we cover a lot of stuff like that.

135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But there's a certain subgroup that we've never actually really covered, and that is aliens or UFOs themselves are alive.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 That UFOs are a living organism.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And within that group, because that's a sizable amount of people who believe that, probably like two, three hundred thousand,

138
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 within that group, there is a more specific breakdown.

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I find all this stuff fascinating.

140
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 There's even a more specific breakdown that says, "Some UFOs are UFOs, but some UFOs are Sky Jellyfishes."

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Jelly-fi? No, it'd be jellyfishes, because you say that you sleep with the fishes.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 You don't go, "You sleep with the fies!"

143
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Sky Jellyfishes.

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 What's interesting about this phenomenon is there's a lot of people who believe in it,

145
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and the answer is set up so plainly that I found the answer within maybe twenty, thirty minutes of researching this.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So what I do is I type in the term and start reading articles and clicking around.

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 When you type in Sky Jellyfish, you're going to get a lot of articles about the phenomenon,

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 and then you'll get one or two articles that use that term.

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 That use that term, and you go, "Hmm, I'll open that in another window, and I'll get to that in a second."

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So Sky Jellyfishes, we have the first sighting.

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So people say the first sighting of UFOs was, I think, over a mount.

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Adams or Mount Shasta was an airline pilot, or was a fighter jet pilot in the 1940s or something like that.

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 They go, "That's the first modern UFO sighting."

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 But then you go, "Oh, now they're flying around Germany back in the 1400s," and all that stuff.

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 So we know the first sighting of a Sky Jellyfish.

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And really, a Sky Jellyfish is exactly what it sounds like.

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It looks like a big translucent jellyfish floating around.

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Very, very obvious. If you've never seen a jellyfish before, it looks like a snot with legs, just kind of floating around.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So that's what it looks like in the sky. It looks like a big translucent thing, because there's photos of this thing.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 First sighting, it was a 1974 in the Netherlands.

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 They've been seen for decades since. They're still seen today, but they're not as common as people see UFOs.

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So that's why people who believe in Sky Jellyfishes don't believe...

163
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It sounds so weird, jellyfishes.

164
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 People who believe in Sky Jellyfishes because they're not very common, they also will say, "Yes, UFOs are real. That's a separate phenomenon."

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But there are these things called Sky Jellyfishes.

166
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Photographs, tons of photographs of these things.

167
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 I shouldn't say tons. Tens of photographs of these things.

168
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And really, it was... There's a pioneer in the field of Sky Jellyfish studies.

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 His name is Trevor James Constable, which is kind of a dope name.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It should actually be reversed. Constable Trevor James, would it be better?

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 He was a researcher. He wrote about aviation. He was not an idiot. He wasn't like a loon bag.

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 But he ended up coming up with this theory.

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Actually, he first off started researching Oregon, which is the sexy energy of the universe.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 That makes your pelvis thrust when you're around it and they had all these organs.

175
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 We covered that on another episode too. That was also related to Sherry Shreiner.

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Oregon and UFOs are usually closely related.

177
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And I'm sure the people who really believe in Oregon hate that, but they are.

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Anyways, he was researching Oregon and Trevor came up with this thing.

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 He started using a camera with ultraviolet lenses and high-speed film.

180
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He's trying to capture energy orgon. He's trying to capture proof that organs float around in the sky.

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But instead, he captures something else.

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 He begins to take photographs of Sky Jellyfishes.

183
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And that's when he comes to the idea. He actually believed firmly that all UFOs were living organisms. All of them.

184
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And Sky Jellyfishes were... So weird. Were a separate type of organism.

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 He called these things macrobacteria. And some of them are as small as a quarter.

186
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Some of them are as big as a half a mile. That seems like such a large range that technically anything could be a macrobacteria.

187
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I could be a macrobacteria. I'm in between the size of a quarter and a half a mile long.

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Anyways, so he believes that these things and he believes that they're invisible to the naked eye.

189
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But they can be picked up on radar and they can be picked up on special types of film.

190
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And then you go, "Wait a second, Jason. If they're invisible to the naked eye, why do people see them?"

191
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Good question. He never answers that.

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Anyways, you have to start crafting this. He comes out with this theory and people start believing it.

193
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And what's interesting is you then have to kind of start to fill in the blank.

194
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So you may say, "Hey listen, I have a photograph of this thing. I think all UFOs are living bacteria."

195
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 What happens is you make up this thing and he believes it's true. He doesn't believe it's made up.

196
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 But you start saying this thing and then people are going to start taking no one UFO phenomenon and asking,

197
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 "How does the jellyfish do that?" So the question is,

198
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 "How do UFOs are known to just fly around the sky real quick and then just disappear?"

199
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And the answer is, "Will sky jellyfish can turn invisible?" At will.

200
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I'm like, "I guess that kind of makes sense."

201
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And then someone goes, "Why is it that UFOs are always..." This is my favorite part.

202
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 "Why is it that UFOs are always seen around cattle medallions?"

203
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But you're saying that UFOs are living organisms.

204
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And his answer is, "Good question. Let me make something up real quick."

205
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 He turns around and he's like, "I don't know. What am I going to answer?"

206
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 He turns back and he goes, "Actually, that's a good question."

207
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 He goes, "Sky jellyfish eat cows." They eat them.

208
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That's what the cow medallions are, is that the jellyfish are eating the cows.

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 People are like, "I guess that kind of makes sense."

210
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 But why is it that people, they've just recently been doing cattle medallions.

211
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 They haven't been doing cattle medallions all throughout history.

212
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 If these things have always been living around in the Earth,

213
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 how come cattle medallions are only from like the 1970s, 1980s?

214
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He turns back around and he's like, "Oh, I got it. I got it."

215
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Radar makes them mad.

216
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 That's why they eat cows.

217
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Because they're mad at the radar and people are like, "Ugh, I guess that kind of makes sense."

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 You have to fill in those blanks. It's so weird.

219
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Because the theory itself just doesn't hold water.

220
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 The main things when we think about UFOs is they are metallic.

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 That's kind of hard to be a living organism.

222
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But you can say they're just really shiny, hard organisms, maybe like flying turtles.

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 But they're metallic. They give off lots of lights and you can go,

224
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 "Well, jellyfish are translucent and they have glow in the dark jellyfish."

225
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Okay, they're extremely maneuverable.

226
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 No one to go faster than our fastest fighter jets, even today.

227
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 That doesn't wash with any sort of biological entity.

228
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They're not cheetahs. And even then, a jet can outrun a cheetah.

229
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 So they're highly maneuverable.

230
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 They tend to knock people out, cause lost time, abduct people, take them inside and probe them.

231
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Is jellyfish just sticking a little tendril up your butthole?

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 When you really start to ask questions about how these could be real things,

233
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 it starts to fall apart.

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But to his credit, he did explain cattle mutilations.

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 So what are sky jellyfishes?

236
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 There are a lot of photos of, again, not a lot, there's like tens of photos of these things.

237
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 People have seen them both through photographs and with the naked eye.

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 What are these things?

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Now, a lot of the photographs are fake.

240
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Yes, a lot of photographs of every paranormal thing is fake.

241
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 A lot of photographs on Instagram are fake. Very easy to fake stuff.

242
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But what are these?

243
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Is there a legitimate reason for the sky jellyfish?

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 There's a sky jellyfish that was reported recently up in the sky.

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And it looked up and saw a jellyfish shaped creature in the sky.

246
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Here's a quote from an article regarding that sighting.

247
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 According to Jonathan McDowell at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

248
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 this is just one of many spectacular formations this kind of rocket can make.

249
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 As the core stage rocket plume balloons out in the thin air high in the atmosphere,

250
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 the cross at the top of the formation was made by the Suez 4 boosters.

251
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 It looked so interesting because we're not used to seeing gas dynamics in a near vacuum.

252
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 At that altitude, there's not really any weather to interfere with the gases.

253
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So the gases form very regular formations and take up a lot of space, says McDowell.

254
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So this photograph that showed, yes, a jellyfish-like cloud floating way up in the sky was caused by a rocket.

255
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 All the boosters coming off.

256
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And it was so high up where the atmosphere was so much thinner, the smoke and the exhaustion,

257
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 everything had a lot of places to expand.

258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 So it made this weird shape.

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 That's why they weren't seen before in 1974, because we weren't using that type of rocket with that type of booster that high up.

260
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Makes sense.

261
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Totally makes sense.

262
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 If we were seeing jellyfish, if we could go back to the 1400s like other UFOs you see them in the sky, sure.

263
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 But the fact that they happened in 1974, long after we're sending people to the moon,

264
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 maybe not long after, five years after we're sending people to the moon, we're shooting rockets up or shooting satellites up,

265
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 it makes sense, one, that they happened after the space race.

266
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Two, that they're not seen very commonly because rockets, it takes the perfect blend of the right type of rocket,

267
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 popping off in the right type of way in the right level of the atmosphere.

268
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But when it does, you will see a giant jellyfish appear.

269
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 An easy answer to a question nobody really asked.

270
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 The question was, what's that in the sky?

271
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Now maybe him with his infrared high-speed camera, he was picking up a more detailed vision,

272
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 a detailed picture of what was up there.

273
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And then worked backwards and created a story based on the photographs he had.

274
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And the reason why I like these two stories being together is that's really what the gadget-cold thing is.

275
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 People see these photos online and they made up a story to explain the photos.

276
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Rather than trying to track down and interview the people in the photos, which may be hard, may be impossible,

277
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 and someone may have and they go, "Oh, we're just joking around.

278
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 One of our friends really likes stupid cartoons and we made him stand in front of a poster of it."

279
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Could be a legit cult.

280
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 We know there are people who like the Rescue Rangers, but this whole backstory about gadget being a Christ-like figure,

281
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I believe that part is made up.

282
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I think people are just masturbating to pictures of a cartoon mouse.

283
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 The bigger the picture, the better.

284
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I think that's what's going on here.

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Not masturbating to jellyfish, but I think someone came up with a photograph to Phenomenon

286
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 and then worked backwards and created this whole backstory to these things.

287
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 They're called Amoeba Constabola, which is actually named after himself.

288
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Not like Constellation, I think it's like Constable, like his name.

289
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Macrobacteria and all this stuff.

290
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I was capturing this Phenomenon, this Explained Phenomenon, if you asked the right person the right questions, they could have said,

291
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 "Oh, yeah, it was on that date. That was because there's this rocket boost.

292
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 This rocket boost you're coming apart."

293
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 You want to know what is funny, though, is that even though there's a rational explanation for the Sky Jellyfish Phenomenon,

294
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I think the idea that UFOs are alive is actually far more logical than them coming from another planet.

295
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 I think the distances are far too vast.

296
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I've always thought that aliens are from another dimension or from here.

297
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They live under the ground or under the water or something like that.

298
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And I mean, you could go, Jason, those are both completely ludicrous,

299
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 but I think the only reason why people believe aliens are from another planet is because that's what sci-fi tells us.

300
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 If Jules Verne, if H.D. Wells were like, "Oh, these aliens popped out of a rift underneath the Earth and they came up in these UFOs,"

301
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I think people would assume that aliens would just be baked in with the mythology.

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 I think if Star Trek was about a ship that went to other dimensions instead of other planets,

303
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 today when people saw UFOs, they'd be like, "Oh, they must be from other dimensions."

304
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So I think that the idea that aliens come from other planets is just baked into the mythology that were taught.

305
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 So we accept that.

306
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Coming from another planet really is no more ludicrous than if they're already here or from another dimension,

307
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 or that it's just a living form that we can't identify in the sky.

308
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Some... I don't know if they're giant amoebas.

309
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I'm not saying that... I actually don't... I'm not saying I believe it at all,

310
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 but I'm saying it is actually more logical to believe it is some sort of life form that exists on the planet Earth

311
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 rather than it flying hundreds of thousands of millions of light years or whatever it is to get here.

312
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 For what?

313
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 To land on our crops and draw faces and it doesn't make any sense.

314
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 The idea of an amoeba getting mad at radar, messing up his brain, eating a cow is just...

315
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 is actually more plausible than aliens abducting cows with sci-fi technology and then just dumping the carcass

316
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 like a bunch of hillbillies. Doesn't make sense.

317
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But it's funny because we do have to look at, when you look at this weird... high strangeness,

318
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 when we look at this weird stuff, we have to go, "What's the most logical answer?"

319
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And luckily for these guys, a jellyfish floating around in the sky that eats cows that sometimes can be seen

320
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 and sometimes cannot be seen makes more sense than having to create a civilization that can create

321
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 interstellar travel that has the fuel to go, interstellar lengths that can live long enough to do that,

322
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 that can't be spotted, approaching Earth and da-da-da-da-da.

323
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 That's what I mean about subcultures. When I talked early on and I was listing all of them,

324
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 everyone has legitimate reasons to believe or not believe in a particular subculture.

325
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I don't believe in alien reptiles because I don't see world leaders laying on rocks to regulate their body temperature.

326
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I don't find eggs everywhere, so I don't believe in shapeshifting reptilians.

327
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I think that's stupid, but I honestly think sky jellyfish is more logical than that, than the reptilians.

328
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 But so everyone has their own reason to believe and not believe.

329
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And it's this weird thing that because everyone is locked into their own subculture,

330
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 they're not opening themselves up to other things that may be true.

331
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I actually, this is a new ending for this episode.

332
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I originally ended it where I went on this big thing about mythology and mythmaking and stuff like that.

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And I started making dinner and I thought, you know what?

334
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I actually think that this is plausible.

335
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I was thinking, I'm too smart to believe in sky jellyfish. These guys are stupid.

336
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 But the more I thought about it as I was making dinner, I thought, why?

337
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Why couldn't they be big old jellyfish rolling around in the sky?

338
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Maybe the rockets are another thing. Maybe they both exist.

339
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Maybe the rockets are a cover-up. I don't know.

340
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 But there's a lot of stuff I don't know.

341
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I don't know if the gadget cult is real.

342
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I don't know if there's a bunch of macro bacteria floating around in the sky.

343
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 But I do know that 99% of the stuff that I look into is absolutely ridiculous.

344
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And so when I find something that is slightly, kind of makes me second guess myself while I'm cooking dinner,

345
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 I think that one might be true.

346
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Probably not. But might be.

347
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 So does that mean we should stop using radar? No.

348
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Does that mean the next time a cow mutilation happens, you should think, hmm, maybe a jellyfish got it.

349
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Maybe. But I definitely would think twice.

350
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Before lambasting a theory that sounds completely ridiculous and can almost be proven on its face to be wrong.

351
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Because for all we know, we are the macro bacteria.

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Humanity is just a small piece of a big puzzle.

353
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And when you're a small piece of a big puzzle, you can't see the whole picture that it paints.

354
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 You only see the little tiny piece that you are in the entire mosaic of reality.
