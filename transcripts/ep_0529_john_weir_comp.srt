1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 A man travels home to see his family and ends up bringing more than gifts, gifts to tea.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,000
 Then we take a look at a story that's happening right now.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
 Is it possible that there's a werewolf loose in New York?

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,600
 And if that story is implausible, is the truth actually more disturbing today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:30,400
 [Music]

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,800
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,600
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Nathan.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,600
 Nathan, thanks for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,800
 You are going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,200
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,400
 Just help get the word out about the show. That also really helps the show grow.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,800
 Nathan, let's go ahead and hop in the Carpenter Caboose.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,200
 Because this story actually involves a train, so we got to lock up this caboose thingy.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
 Nathan's like, "I don't even get to drive this thing!"

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,600
 It just gets pulled by another train.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,600
 But you get a whistle and you get this cool little hat.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
 Nathan, how about that?

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
 [Buzzer]

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,200
 He's totally fine. So we're in the Carpenter Caboose.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:48,200
 Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,200
 He has these three giant duffel bags and he gets off the train and his family's waving from the station.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,600
 Come on, Martin, come on, Melvin, we forgot your name.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,200
 We forgot your name. It's been so long. Come here, Melvin.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,800
 They're giving him hugs and stuff like that.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 Oh man, these bags are really heavy. He's like, "Yeah, I had to do a lot of packing

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
 because I'm going to stay here for a while."

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,000
 So his mom knew that he was having a rough time in Louisville.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,600
 "Come spend some time with me, Melvin. We'll sort things out."

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 And then carrying these bags.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,200
 What have you got in these bags, dude? He's like, "Oh, just a bunch of clothes.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,200
 Just a bunch of stuff that a normal human would bring with him on vacation to see his family."

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,600
 About a day passes, day or two passes, and Melvin's walking around the house.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,000
 And his mom goes, "Hey, Melvin, aren't those the same clothes you were wearing

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,600
 when you got off the train that you're wearing right now?"

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,000
 I was like, "Oh yeah, yeah, I'll change in a second. You know, just comfortable.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,400
 You know the rule, never change your clothes until the fourth day of vacation."

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
 And then he walks out of the room. The mom's like, "Hmm, I've never heard that rule before."

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
 The next day, the mom realizes that Melvin's been here and he has an unpacked.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,400
 There's just these three duffel bags sitting in the bedroom that he's in.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,800
 And he has an unpacked. And then Melvin walks by. He's wearing the same clothes still.

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,000
 She's like, "Hmm." She's like, "Something is fishy."

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,200
 And the next day after that, he's like, "Hey, mom. Mom.

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
 I was wondering if you could take me to the store."

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
 She's like, "Yeah, sure. What store do you want to go to?"

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
 And he goes, "Well, the clothing store. I need to buy new clothes

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,800
 because it's now day four and I'm wearing the same clothes I wore when you picked me up."

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,600
 The mom's like, "Hmm. It's another clue. It's another clue to this mystery."

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,000
 He must have not brought clothes with him. But the key to the mystery was,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 she has like this chart. She has like this. When Melvin goes to bed,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 she goes in the basement. She has this giant, giant piece of cork board.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
 And it's like pictures of Melvin. It's like day one.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,600
 He's wearing the same clothes. Picture of Melvin eating an ice cream cone.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,200
 Day two, he's wearing the same clothes. All these strings are all attaching to everything.

57
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
 She's trying to figure out the mystery. And then there's the biggest clue.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
 Really, this should have been the only clue you needed, right?

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
 This should have been the first and only clue.

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
 You should have been like, "Melvin, what's in the bag?"

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:04,800
 The bags, the bags also were super disgusting and they smelled really, really bad.

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 Like, you don't need to be like, "That's interesting. Dear diary.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,200
 Today's day four and my son's wearing the same jacket."

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 Oh, also his bags smell like rotting flesh.

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 So, this all culminated on September 15th, 2020.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,200
 The son wants to go to the library. And the mom is all too happy to drop him off at the library

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,200
 because she is thinking when he's off at the library, I'm going to go home and look in the bags.

68
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,200
 So she drops him off at the library. She does exactly that.

69
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
 I don't have to tell you. She does exactly that.

70
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:43,200
 And when she gets home and she opens the bag up, she finds a human head and a bunch of organs.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,200
 So I have a couple of questions here for who gets to the main question.

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 What happened? But here's my question.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 This is going to get gory here, but was the person, why three duffel bags would have been my first question?

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 I mean, unless you were the juggernauts, I think you could fit most of a human,

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
 most of a dismembered human into one bag.

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,200
 But he had three bags. And apparently he didn't bring any clothes.

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,200
 Apparently if he had worn clothes, he probably could have gone away with this.

78
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,200
 Because the mom didn't seem to be too alarmed by the horrible smell.

79
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,200
 So what happened? Those are my questions about it. Your questions are what happened?

80
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:25,200
 She called the cops, which must be one of the hardest things to do is for a parent to turn in their own children.

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
 She called the cops, but you have to in this case, right?

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,200
 You don't want to wait for his side of the story. What? Those aren't my bags.

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,200
 What happened was the cops found out more about the story.

84
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,200
 The victim was LaDondra Ellington, 31 years old, was dating Melvin.

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,200
 Something happened. He got upset at her because he's confessed this to the police apparently.

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,200
 And he chopped her up in Louisville, Kentucky. She'd have been dead for a month.

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 After a month of a heart and a lung and a head rolling around in a couple different bags.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,200
 The smell, I don't understand how they just weren't leaking blood out.

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
 It didn't look like he was carrying three duffel bags full of strawberry jam.

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 And I don't also know how the body parts was parsed out.

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 I don't know why I'm fascinated by that, but he could have put it all just in like a little backpack.

92
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 Right? Because they found her torso in Louisville, Kentucky.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 Once the police realized she was missing. I don't know if nobody reported her missing or something like that,

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 but they did find her torso in Louisville, Kentucky.

95
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 You love this? And you love all this for a Monday episode?

96
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 You've been waiting all weekend for a funny dead rabbit radio?

97
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
 They're like, "Jason, this is an awful way to start your week."

98
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 But it's just so bizarre that this guy, one, was keeping body parts with him.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,200
 That's just bizarre thing, number one. Two, carrying them around, crossing state lines.

100
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 And three, bringing them to your mom's house? I just find that so weird.

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,200
 They said he wanted to keep a piece of her with him.

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 I have no other way to segue from that.

103
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,200
 So I turn to Nathan, Nathan tips his little railroad cap to me,

104
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,200
 blowing on his whistle, and that whistle blow is actually bringing down the carpenter copter.

105
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 [Copter chomping]

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
 And it lands. We're going to hop on board.

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
 Nathan, get out of the controls of this thing. We are headed out.

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
 [Copter chomping]

109
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 This is an interesting story because it's happening right now.

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,200
 It's actually been developing over the past couple of days and we've reached the culmination of it.

111
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 This is a weird story. And here's the thing.

112
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,200
 A lot of you guys are going to say it's a lark, and you guys might be right.

113
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 But I want you to decide, I kind of talked about this in the intro,

114
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 what is more disturbing than the story is real, or he's making it all up?

115
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 Because they're both. Even if it is a lark, it's not one that you would ever want to do.

116
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 I want to give a shout out to Reddit user HappyLink9518,

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 because they were the ones who posted this in Unresolved Mysteries,

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
 one of the subreddits I'm subscribed to. It got scrubbed.

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,200
 People are really trying to contain this story into a certain board,

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
 because it's spread very, very rapidly.

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
 So it's got scrubbed, but I'm glad that I saw it because it's a super weird story.

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 So thanks again for that. Nathan, we're flying this carpenter copter through a sunny suburb,

123
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,200
 we have video footage of this guy's neighborhood, and we're going to land on the street.

124
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:28,200
 In May of 2020, this guy named John Weir, who also goes by Weir Wolf,

125
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,200
 starts a Reddit account, this very, very unassuming Reddit account.

126
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 Then he starts a YouTube channel on September 7th, 2020, called The Big Bad Critic.

127
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,200
 And in his first video, he proclaims what he wants to do with the channel.

128
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
 He's wearing a Weir Wolf mask, and he does a review of the Weir Wolf mask,

129
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
 and he talks about how much he loves Weir Wolves, and there's no other channels out there

130
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
 that are only reviewing Weir Wolf stuff.

131
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
 Now I know what you're thinking, "How many videos can you get out of that?"

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
 And here, let's take a look at the Stephen King book, and next...

133
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 I hope someone writes another book! I've already covered the five Weir Wolf books out there,

134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,200
 and I'm not doing Twilight, but I might have to unless someone writes a book before my next video.

135
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
 There's not a lot of content with that.

136
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 Anyways, he has this Weir Wolf mask on, he's reviewing it,

137
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,200
 he's saying that it's actually really hard to breathe in, and it's covered in his sweat.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,200
 He takes the mask off, he doesn't show his face at this point.

139
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
 He takes the mask off, he's showing us the sweat in the mask.

140
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,200
 He's like, "Look at how this glistens, look how sweaty this is."

141
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
 He puts the mask back on. Now while you're watching this video,

142
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,200
 it's maybe like 12 minutes long, and you start to hear a baby cry in the background.

143
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
 [baby crying]

144
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
 And he's kind of ignoring it, he's continuing to do his video.

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
 He's trying to do his video in one take.

146
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
 And then the video goes, "Well guys, like and subscribe.

147
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,200
 If you want to see more of my sweat, I'll be back later."

148
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
 And then the video ends where he does start it up, you can tell it's later

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 because the light quality has dropped and the camera's a little more dingy.

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 He's holding his little baby dude, he has this tiny little baby.

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 And it's one of those babies that can't move its arms yet.

152
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,200
 It has them like they're poked out straight, you know, because they're like,

153
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,200
 "What are these things? I'm barely learning that I have arms.

154
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
 I'm just developing as a human being, so I'm just going to hold my arms out straight

155
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
 unless she gives me something and then I'm going to hold it."

156
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 One of those babies, like that young, the dumb one, the dumb level of baby.

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 He's holding his baby and he comes back, he has to wear old mask on still.

158
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 And he's feeding his baby and he kind of just finishes the video like that.

159
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 It's like, "Yeah, my baby was crying on how to give him some milk."

160
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
 Little baby's dude is named Freddy.

161
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,200
 And all the information with names and things like that is information that he has given to us.

162
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,200
 He's fully given his full name, names of his kids, and I don't think the name of his wife may be, but...

163
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 So that was on September 7th.

164
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,200
 And also, it is very... because we're going to take a look at the psychological makeup, supposedly, of this guy.

165
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,200
 Again, I said I'm not going to say whether or not it's a lark or not, but again, this could all be made up.

166
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,200
 But he says in this video, he goes, "I love werewolves because they're free.

167
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
 Because they're non-stifling, and it's something that I always wanted to explore."

168
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,200
 What's interesting is that he uses the word "stifling" multiple times in this first video.

169
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,200
 He wants to describe his real life, how he feels like he's stifled.

170
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 And then the other two times, describing the mask. He says the mask is very stifling twice.

171
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
 Which is an odd word. I mean, unless he was on his Word of the Day calendar,

172
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 that's not a word people use three times in 12 minutes to describe two different things.

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,200
 And the first time he was talking about himself feeling stifled, and now this mask of this werewolf

174
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
 that's supposed to give him the freedom of being a beast, he also finds stifling.

175
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
 Very, very weird setup. That was on September 10th.

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,200
 And the video was actually entitled, "The Baby Interrupted Me. The Big Bad Critic Tries to Review a Werewolf Mask."

177
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
 So even in his first video, he's a little upset about the kid.

178
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,200
 September 14th, someone under the username, "I ought to be thrown away."

179
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,200
 He posts on his subreddit called, "Am I the a-hole?" But the real word.

180
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,200
 Actually, you know, there probably will be cussing in this segment, so I know a lot of you guys listen to the show with your kids.

181
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,200
 They're like, "Dude, I sent my kid out of the room when you were telling the story about the dismembered woman in the duffel bags."

182
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 Fair enough. "Am I the a-hole?" is the subreddit.

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,200
 And he basically, you can go and you can ask questions being like, "Hey, I did this because my wife is doing that.

184
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
 Am I the a-hole?" And people will vote you up and down, maybe give you some advice.

185
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,200
 A lot of times, you're not the a-hole. A lot of times, you just want to hear that, "No, what you did by not inviting your stepmom to your wedding,

186
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,200
 because she actually used to sleep with your husband?" to be stuff like that. You're not the a-hole.

187
00:12:51,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 But he posts on there about, "Am I the a-hole?" because my baby had explosive diarrhea while my wife, who works at home,

188
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,200
 was doing a business meeting downstairs. He's 30 years old. This John Weir character is 30 years old.

189
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 And his baby had explosive diarrhea and it shot all over their clean laundry and all over him and all over the wall.

190
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:22,200
 It's pretty funny, right? That's pretty funny. And then he's super mad and he's up there yelling to his wife who's downstairs,

191
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 "Come up here, come up here. Oh no, it's such a mess, such a mess." And she came upstairs and she was livid that he couldn't take care of this himself.

192
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,200
 Now, they have two kids. One of them is much older. One of them, I think, is like eight, maybe.

193
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 We've never seen his face because he wears a werewolf mask, too, when they're doing these videos.

194
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,200
 But he leaves this M-I-D-A-hole saying, "Am I in the wrong?" because I don't know, I can't clean all this stuff up.

195
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,200
 And I was really mad that my baby pooped all over me and I got poop in my arms. My arms are hairy.

196
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 So I don't know why I emphasized that word, but, you know, it take a long time to wash out.

197
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 So I wanted my wife up here to help. People said, "Yeah, you're a terrible person. You're 30 years old.

198
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,200
 It's your responsibility. You're a dad. It's your responsibility to clean up poop."

199
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,200
 So this guy who posted an M-I-D-A-hole talking about, you know, my baby, my wife, all this stuff,

200
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,200
 someone went back, or actually multiple people went back into his post history because they found out

201
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,200
 I ought to be thrown away is actually his main account that he started in May.

202
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 It shows his real name. It links to his YouTube channel.

203
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:31,200
 And there's another post they find called, "I legit can't stand my baby."

204
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,200
 Written by, I ought to be thrown away. Let me read you part of this.

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 "He's my second kid. The first never annoyed me. This one is just way higher maintenance and impossible to soothe.

206
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:50,200
 And before you ask, yes, he's fed and his diaper is clean. This little punk just doesn't know how to shut up."

207
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,200
 This is a baby who can't even move its arms, bro.

208
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
 So he goes on and on. He just really talks trash about his baby in this thing.

209
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200
 Hopefully this red post isn't there when his baby grows up. Trash is this baby.

210
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,200
 And it says in it, "I think my baby has GERD, which is like some digestive thing."

211
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
 And people are like, "That's why your baby's upset." Because it has like a little medical problem.

212
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,200
 And holding it in front of the camera and getting upset and kind of like just being upset while you're trying to feed it isn't helping.

213
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 It isn't helping this baby. People find that post and Reddit goes nuts.

214
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
 Then that's the thing. It started to spread to all these other subred--

215
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
 I'm not subscribed to M.I.D.A. Whole or Off My Chest or any of these other ones,

216
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,200
 but it started to spread out into the Reddit community to the point where it was on unresolved mysteries.

217
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,200
 And it got taken down because they're trying to contain this nonsense.

218
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,200
 Later that same day, so that post goes viral on Reddit.

219
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,200
 And later that same day, he posts a new YouTube video called "I Hate Reddit."

220
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 I'll get back to werewolf reviews as soon as possible.

221
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,200
 And there's a video of him still wearing the werewolf mask holding his baby.

222
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 He's reading some of these quotes off from these mean Reddit comments.

223
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,200
 And he starts to tell the story. He goes, "All I ever wanted to do was be a dad."

224
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
 "All I ever wanted to do was be a dad."

225
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,200
 And now people are telling me on Reddit that I'm a terrible father and I shouldn't be a dad.

226
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
 And he starts to get choked up, starts to get upset.

227
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
 And he goes, "And all I ever wanted to do was be a dad."

228
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 And just about two weeks ago, my wife yelled at me, yelled at me and said that I was a shitty dad.

229
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
 And now he's kind of trying to speak between broken sobs.

230
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 He goes, "That was the most hurtful thing anyone can say to me."

231
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,200
 And now everyone's saying it to me and I don't know how to process it.

232
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,200
 Now you go, Jason, are you really doing a segment about a guy who loves werewolf masks?

233
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,200
 Who's having a hard time raising a quote unquote problem child?

234
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,200
 He's not as patient as his first one. He's not as patient as he was with his first one.

235
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:58,200
 Are you really doing your main segment about a guy who got a glimpse of what the internet can possibly do to a normal person?

236
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 Is this your whole segment? No, because this is where stuff gets weird.

237
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 He says in this video, "If I was an actual werewolf, no one would fuck with me."

238
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
 They'd all be scared.

239
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 He actually starts to believe he's turning into a werewolf.

240
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 I think if this story is real, this is where he snapped.

241
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 Because everything before this point, I mean, being angry at your baby, people get angry at their babies.

242
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
 People get very, very frustrated at their children. It's one in the morning.

243
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
 It's the ninth night in a row. They haven't been able to sleep that much.

244
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,200
 The baby's screaming, "What do you want? What do you want? What do you want?"

245
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,200
 People get frustrated at babies. And then you realize, "Oh, he's just a baby.

246
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
 He can't tell me what it wants." And I have to try to figure this out.

247
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 Let's put her in the car and drive around the block that seems to usually put her to sleep.

248
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
 People get frustrated at babies. And it's sad because babies are helpless,

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
 and people usually feel really bad when they get upset at the baby.

250
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 Most people don't post about it online, though. See, most of the people keep those feelings.

251
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
 It makes them feel like bad parents because they never share it.

252
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
 So they think they're the only bad parent. Every other parent out there, they see the Facebook photos

253
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 and they're holding the happy baby. It makes them feel alone, but every parent goes through that at some point.

254
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,200
 But people don't post about it online because people don't even talk about it in real life.

255
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,200
 This guy posted about it online, and I think he had a bit of a mental breakdown at this point

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
 because all these people telling him, "You're a terrible dad. You're a terrible dad."

257
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,200
 On September 16th, he begins telling people on Reddit and YouTube.

258
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
 Now everything's kind of lining up at the same time.

259
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,200
 So on September 16th, he tells a story. He had a dream that he was a werewolf.

260
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
 And he also says he wished he had this dream all the time.

261
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 It's very rare that he dreams he's a werewolf.

262
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 He wishes he could disappear into that dream world.

263
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,200
 On September 16th, he has a dream that a cat is trying to attack his cat.

264
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,200
 And he turns into a werewolf and he's running through the streets of New York.

265
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,200
 And he grabs the feral cat and he bites the feral cat.

266
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:06,200
 And then he realizes he wakes up and his cat, his real life cat, is in his teeth.

267
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,200
 And he's "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

268
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 He's biting it and it runs away. And he bit the cat so hard that on the 17th, he's talking on Reddit, "Hey guys, hey, hey, I know you guys are harassing me for talking trash about my baby, but do you know where I can buy black market cat antibiotics?

269
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 Because I bit my cat and if I take him to the vet, the vet's going to see a set of human teeth on this cat and I'll get in trouble.

270
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,200
 So is there a place where I can buy cat antibiotics?" And people are like, "Go to the hospital, dude!"

271
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
 Something is going on. First off, take your cat to the vet.

272
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:49,200
 Secondly, then you go to the hospital because something's going on. He's like, "I didn't mean to, I just bit it in my sleep. I bit that delicious, mmm, so tasty cat in my sleep."

273
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,200
 That was on the 16th, September 17th, he posts a video called "She Doesn't Take Me Seriously."

274
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,200
 Apparently, it's all pretty much dark. You can't really see what's going on, but he's recording all of these videos with his cell phone now.

275
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,200
 He's trying to wake his wife up. "Hey, wake up. Wake up." She's like, "What is it? What is it?" He's like, "You need to lock me in the garage."

276
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 She's like, "What?" He goes, "You need to lock me in the garage because I'm becoming a werewolf."

277
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:22,200
 She's like, "Go to bed! John, go to bed! You're being an idiot! Go to bed!" He's like, "No, you don't understand. If you don't lock me in the garage, I can't control myself."

278
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:30,200
 Video pretty much ends there. And that makes sense. She does ignore him because really, at that point, you would just be feeding into the delusion.

279
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,200
 September 18th, he posts a video. He's like, "I can't be in the house." This is where he starts to get real creepy, see?

280
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:51,200
 "I can't sleep in the house because I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt my family. If I bit my son the way I bit that cat, I would probably kill him. I have to stay away from my family. Otherwise, I might eat them."

281
00:20:51,200 --> 00:21:00,200
 Good night, guys! Like and subscribe if you like this video. He goes to bed and the video then continues. The last half of the video is him waking up in the morning.

282
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 He's like, "Oh, no, no!" And there's like a branch. There's like a little branch laying on the ground. And he's like, "Here's what happened."

283
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:15,200
 So he starts like videotaping. He goes, "See this patch of wet grass? That must have been where I slept, like a dog."

284
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 And I probably have ticks. And then look at this branch. See that branch on the ground? You see this tree, how it leads up to the roof of the house?

285
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,200
 I must have turned into a werewolf in the middle of the night and tried to climb the tree to get into the house and then fell.

286
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,200
 And he goes, "If I had knocked on the door and someone had opened that door, who knows what would have happened?"

287
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:44,200
 And the video just kind of ends. Let's take a look at his blog real quick, because he wrote this blog entry while all this stuff is going on.

288
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 He tells about this dream he had, another werewolf dream. This is where he states, "I wish I could dreamt I was a werewolf all the time."

289
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:56,200
 He dreams that he's in a warehouse. No pun intended. He's in a warehouse and his two kids are behind him.

290
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 And a mob breaks into the warehouse and they surround him. And he's like, "No, stay away from me!"

291
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 And my kids, I said, "My kids first! Stay away from me!" And the crowd surrounds him and they're yelling mean things at him.

292
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,200
 And then he looks at his hands and he has werewolf hands. And he begins to growl.

293
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,200
 He says he can smell the fear of the crowd. It smelled... I forgot what he said. It smelled like mayonnaise and dust.

294
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 Something like that. Let me look that back up. He said it smelled... This is what fear smells like, apparently.

295
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 It smells like gasoline mixed with blue cheese. So, I mean, you heard it from a werewolf who might argue I'm not a werewolf,

296
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,200
 but apparently that's what fear smells like. Anyways, gasoline and blue cheese. And so everyone runs away.

297
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:48,200
 See, they're scared of him in his true form. The beast has been unleashed. But one guy comes towards him and he mauls the dude up or something like that.

298
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,200
 And then he wakes up and that is fine. That's just some weirdo dream. Whatever. But this is what he writes in his blog.

299
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,200
 Again, this is very, very telling. "Then my alarm went off before anything happened.

300
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 When I woke up I had no claws, no fangs. All I had was a flabby gut, weak hands, and a tear-stained pillow.

301
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:21,200
 It was just a dream. The power I felt in there was false. In reality, I'm a 30-year-old man with no friends who works a shitty retail job

302
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,200
 and now might be losing his only hobby because of stupid shits on the Internet."

303
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 At one point he talks on Reddit where he says that, and again, this was like people were going around locating these things.

304
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:44,200
 I found this one where he said, "I might get fired from my job. I hate my job because I got called into the office because I took too many days off work.

305
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:52,200
 I took three days off work recently. But I used those three days very well. I used those three days to work on my YouTube channel.

306
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,200
 And when the YouTube channel blows up, I won't eat a job." So he says, "Artists need to take that risk.

307
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,200
 If you're an artist, you need to risk a steady paycheck to do your art." Which, fine, fine.

308
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:14,200
 I agree to that to a certain point, but when you're married with two kids, you have to do your art in the minutes that you have to yourself.

309
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 That's the reason why I'm not married and have kids, so I can do what I do. It's just the way it works.

310
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,200
 So, it's sacrifices, right? And he asks kids, "You gotta take care of it. You gotta go to the job."

311
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,200
 But anyways, anyways, so that was his mindset. So, then he does this video, I'm not really gonna go into detail with,

312
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,200
 because really there's nothing to say. His wife says, "Listen, if you're really a werewolf, if you show me video footage of yourself becoming a werewolf,

313
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,200
 I will believe you. But other than that, you just need to change the baby's diaper and go to work."

314
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,200
 So there's an hour-long video of YouTube of him running around...

315
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 There's an hour-long video on YouTube of an adult man running around his garage, tearing his shirt off, and yelling.

316
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 But I- you can't even say it's that, because the audio- there's something wrong with the audio, so it clips out every half-second.

317
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 So he's like, "Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,

318
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:44,200
 He's running around his garage. He goes, "Yeah, sure. I didn't physically turn into a werewolf. I thought I was a werewolf, though. And look how easily my shirt ripped off."

319
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,200
 And he goes, "And I was throwing stuff around like it was paper." Now, I will give him this. I will give him this.

320
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:59,200
 He did rip off that shirt pretty easily. Like, it came off like Hulk Hogan. That's obviously easy to f*ck you.

321
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,200
 He's like, "Well, if I'm sold, werewolves exist!" That shirt came right off of him. It's easy to fake.

322
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,200
 You just take a little razor blade, you cut some slices in the shirt ahead of time, and you just grab and rip it open.

323
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:18,200
 But shirts aren't easy to rip off of you. That's kind of the point of- the point of a shirt's design is that it stays on you.

324
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,200
 So the fact that he can just grab it from the center and rip it off- it was- I will give you this, John. That was impressive.

325
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:33,200
 But I- I- I- Whether or not that means you're a werewolf, who knows. This all came to a head yesterday, because he put a video out,

326
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:41,200
 and this is why it was on Unresolved Mysteries. This is why it was kind of a pressing matter. He puts a video out yesterday, entitled,

327
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,200
 "I know this will be used as legal evidence. It will count as a confession. It wasn't my fault."

328
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,200
 So this video is him walking through the woods, his face fully visible. He says, "Last night I changed into a werewolf."

329
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:03,200
 He didn't see it, but I know that the wolf is inside of me. I know it only comes out at night, but I still feel like I have this beast inside of me.

330
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,200
 So I'm out in this walk. Oh, it feels so good being outside. I just want to walk by myself. I don't want to be around anyone,

331
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,200
 because who knows what might happen. And he goes on and on. And then he goes- he stops, and he goes,

332
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,200
 "There's someone on the trail ahead of me," and the camera turns, and you see like a blurry, humanoid figure down the street, down this dirt trail.

333
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 And he begins running, running, and he looks into the camera and he goes, "She won't even know what happened."

334
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:37,200
 And he's running, running, running, and then the camera conveniently, or realistically, goes black. Like it's in his pocket or something.

335
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,200
 And you hear him trying to growl a bit, and you hear a woman going, "What are you doing? What are you doing?"

336
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:50,200
 And then starts screaming, and the video just ends. That is 100% the most larpiest part of this story, right?

337
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 And it's funny, because that was my entrance point to the story. That was the first thing I saw.

338
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,200
 It was actually in the bathroom. It was actually in the bathroom. I pulled that video up, and I was like, "Dang it!"

339
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,200
 I had to come out of the bathroom. I had to download that video, because I have these apps on my computer,

340
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,200
 because I thought the video wouldn't be up for very long. I thought either he was going to remove it, or YouTube would remove it.

341
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,200
 But it got me off the toilet. John, I gotta say that. There's not many stories that get me off the toilet.

342
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,200
 Anyways, he weighs too much information, but that's the most larpiest part of it.

343
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 And then I had to research it back. But let me finish this story before we kind of go into a little bit of detail.

344
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:37,200
 I'm going a little long here, but the last piece of communication we've had from John is on Reddit, and it is entitled "F".

345
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,200
 The F word. If he says the word again, I'm just self-censoring. "F!" he exclaimed. "I'm done today."

346
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,200
 This is after he attacked the woman in the woods. He's now gone into the garage and home, and barricaded himself in.

347
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:59,200
 He feels like he is a danger to his family. This is what he said. Kyle's banging on the door, crying. That's his oldest son.

348
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:07,200
 Telling me he's scared and wants to see me. Sandy, his wife, says she's going to smash the back door with the sledge from the shed

349
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,200
 and come get me if I don't open up my own. My barricade might hold, but it's not a chance I'm willing to take.

350
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:21,200
 If she gets that door open, she and Kyle and the baby will die. I'm begging her to stop, but her mind is made up.

351
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:31,200
 Then it ends with this. He says some other stuff. Then it ends with this. "I love you, Kyle. I love you, Freddie. You boys are my entire world. Goodbye."

352
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 There's been no new developments. I actually was putting off, I'm recording this story much, much later than I normally record episodes.

353
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,200
 Seeing if anything else popped up. As of now, there's no other developments.

354
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 A lot of people think this story is a lark, and it's funny because I've gone back and forth on it.

355
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,200
 On the one hand, it involves a man turning into a werewolf, right?

356
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 And as much as I like the idea of cryptids and stuff like that, a lot of them I'm like, "Oh, it's a superstition. There's a reason why this creature runs around in the forest.

357
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,200
 It's to tell kids don't go into the forest." Basically, boogie man type legends, but they're 500 years old.

358
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,200
 I'd love for werewolves, vampires, mummies. Mummies are real, but you know what I mean? Like, walking around.

359
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,200
 That'd be cool if they actually existed. So long as they stay away from me.

360
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,200
 But you really have to like, alien... I think the fact that aliens exist, I can wrap my head around that.

361
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,200
 That's kind of an obvious one, versus a werewolf existing. It's far less plausible.

362
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,200
 But whatever. Like, all considerate plausible.

363
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
 Just because he says he's turning into a werewolf, I don't automatically dismiss it.

364
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,200
 But he has this life-long obsession with werewolves. He has a werewolf review channel, and then conveniently he turns into a werewolf.

365
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,200
 And he says, "I wasn't bit by anything. I did bite a cat, but I wasn't bit by anything."

366
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,200
 A lot of people are saying it's a lark. I don't believe this man is actually turning into a wolf.

367
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
 I don't believe this adult man is actually turning into a werewolf.

368
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 But there are... So that really leaves two things. One, well, he did rip that shirt off, Jason, so there is that compelling evidence.

369
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
 But one, he's having a mental breakdown.

370
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:16,200
 This is actually, we're watching in real time, a man fall underneath the thumb of the internet, which is very unforgiving.

371
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,200
 And the key to getting past it is to simply not respond. To not respond at all.

372
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,200
 Your Twitter will blow up for a day or two, but it will always subside.

373
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,200
 It's when you start engaging with them, is when it keeps getting worse.

374
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,200
 I believe... Here's the thing. I do believe that he needs to go to some parenting classes, at the very least.

375
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,200
 He needs to... Just because these issues are... I keep saying they're normal, doesn't mean that you just ignore them.

376
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,200
 You should go to see someone and go, "Why am I having these things? Why am I thinking so negatively towards my own offspring?"

377
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,200
 I'm not saying ignore it, but don't feel like you're the worst person alive because you have those feelings.

378
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,200
 A lot of people do, but there's treatment, there's counseling available for that.

379
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:08,200
 There's also the... And this is what a lot of people are going... So it's possible he's having a mental breakdown and he thinks he's a werewolf.

380
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,200
 And he may or may not have attacked that woman. Right? If he's having a mental breakdown and he thinks he's a werewolf,

381
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,200
 he didn't turn a werewolf and attack that woman in the middle of the woods. He may have just attacked a woman and just beat her up.

382
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,200
 We don't know. But then the other people say it's a lark. This is all just the lark that he's using to promote his YouTube channel.

383
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,200
 Or maybe this will turn out to be like some movie project he's working on and he'll come out and his name's really not John Weir.

384
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,200
 His name's Weir John or whatever. And it'll turn all be a lark. And that's what a lot of people are kind of leaning on at this point.

385
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,200
 That's my gut instinct because the YouTube channel was just set up a couple of days before all of this started.

386
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,200
 And the Reddit account was just a couple of months before as well. The reason why I don't think it's a lark.

387
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,200
 The reason why I don't think it's a lark, even though it has so many larky... Lark is live action role play for those of you who don't know.

388
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:03,200
 It's basically fake. It's a fake thing. It's like, "Oh no, I've been kidnapped in a bunch of videos where this girl's in the back of a van."

389
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,200
 She's like, "Oh, I stole the kidnapper's phone. She's posting these videos to your YouTube channel."

390
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,200
 And everyone gets super concerned and it turns out that it's actually a short movie they're working on or something like that.

391
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:19,200
 The reason why I don't think this is a lark, because I've seen a lot of larks, but I've never seen a lark that uses a baby as a prop.

392
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,200
 If this is fake, people are going to be even more upset.

393
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,200
 Because even if he's like, "Oh no, this baby doesn't have Gerd and I'm actually a loving father and here's these photos.

394
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,200
 Here's a 24-hour surveillance footage of me being a loving father."

395
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:41,200
 Even if he's somehow able to prove that this was all fake and that it was a lark, the fact that a baby was involved as a prop.

396
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,200
 He shows footage. I didn't look at this, but he has pictures apparently of his cat with a bite wound.

397
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
 It's like, "Does this look infected? Do you know where I can get some cat antibiotics?"

398
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,200
 That's high-level larking. I've never seen anything like that.

399
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,200
 I've seen stuff like Missing Girl 229 or whatever it was. That was one of the first big ones that came.

400
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,200
 The girl was investigating a cult and then she disappeared and everyone was wondering what happened to her YouTube channel.

401
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 It turns out it was a piece of art. It was a short film or something like that.

402
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,200
 I've never seen anyone use a living baby as a prop. This baby's real.

403
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
 It's moving around during Constance and stuff like that.

404
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 You could have a lark where you talk about a baby off-screen and never show it or never say how much you hate the baby.

405
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:36,200
 I'm sure babies have walked in the background of Marble Hornets, but I've never seen a lark where someone is expressing disdain towards a baby.

406
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:43,200
 And then it turned out to be fake because he is definitely very put off when this baby is on screen for this thing.

407
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:53,200
 So it could be a lark, but again, I think it's most likely that this man is facing the wrath of the internet.

408
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,200
 And it's not helping anyone, obviously. I can understand people getting really worked up about this.

409
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:10,200
 Because you see this guy posting stuff about how much he hates his baby and you don't know how to help, but one of the ways not to help is to go to all of his forums.

410
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,200
 Because I was looking all over the every YouTube video he's done, every time he's posted something, people talk trash about him being a bad dad.

411
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
 And that's not going to get him the help that he needs.

412
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,200
 But I think a lot of the people who are actually, like people have said, I've been up several nights trying to figure out what to do.

413
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:35,200
 I think that's the people feel very -- you have two groups of people you have, people who feel very helpless because they're seeing a situation where a man hates his baby.

414
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,200
 And then you have people who are trolls, they're just like getting those little dings of endorphin.

415
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:49,200
 And those two groups coming together just created this monumental wave and cracked this guy's mind.

416
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:58,200
 So as I'm recording this, somewhere in New York, the police could be investigating an assault in the middle of the woods.

417
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:09,200
 The police could be driving up to a house right now where a man has busted out of his garage and began chasing his wife and children until they locked themselves in their car and he's banging on the window.

418
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:17,200
 It's possible the police show up and question them and it turns out that this was all some sort of viral gimmick and the police officers are just shaking their head.

419
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,200
 Because even they know this was a bad idea, this guy's going to have a really hard time returning to normal.

420
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,200
 Well, did I call it or did I call it? This is actually Jason recording while I'm editing the episode and we did get an update.

421
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,200
 The police showed up at this two-touse for a wellness check.

422
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,200
 So I'm recording this a couple hours after I recorded that episode.

423
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,200
 He has now returned to Reddit and has admitted that it was all fake.

424
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:55,200
 He says the name John Weir should have been a clue to all of us, see, because Johann Weir was one of the first physicians to recognize clinical lycanthropy.

425
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,200
 He goes on to say it was an ARG and he was planning eventually to reveal that it was all fake.

426
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:09,200
 He came out of it because other people were getting accused of being him and that person got run off of Reddit because they thought it was his alternate account.

427
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,200
 And he said that while he was posting this stuff and he goes, "Yeah, it was all made up. My family's totally fine.

428
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,200
 Cops just showed up at my door to do a wellness break."

429
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
 But don't worry, he's going to do a "Ask Me Anything" pretty soon.

430
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,200
 If you have any questions and then he ends it with this, "Thanks for caring and again, I'm truly sorry for the role I played in causing you emotional pain.

431
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,200
 I hope you have somebody to talk to in reference to this person."

432
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:38,200
 This one person who got ran off of Reddit because they thought it was John Weir's alternate account started talking about wanting to kill themselves.

433
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:45,200
 Because they said, "I already have emotional problems and I'm getting hundreds of emails telling me I'm a bad dad and I'm not John Weir.

434
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:53,200
 I'm not even a dad and they're already having some emotional stability issues and then they get brought into all this thing."

435
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,200
 I hope you have somebody to talk to if you want an anonymous person to vent to or if you want to tell me off, my chat messages are open if you need some catharsis.

436
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
 Be well.

437
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,200
 And people are furious because again, this has been going on for days.

438
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,200
 You can do a lark, you can do an ARG, more power to you.

439
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,200
 But when you involve a baby, babies and pets, right?

440
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,200
 Oh, look at this lark I'm doing where I'm beating dogs up.

441
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:27,200
 I'm pretending like the dogs aren't actually hurt, but I stomp around my house saying I hate dogs and then the camera gets put down and it's all black for a second and then you hear the sound of a dog in pain.

442
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
 People aren't going to deal with that well.

443
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
 So it was a lark.

444
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
 It was a lark.

445
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:39,200
 I'm actually going to, I'm inserting this now, but I like the ending I have for the episode even though it's 100% fictional.

446
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
 But I wanted to update you guys on that.

447
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
 It was funny.

448
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,200
 I'm about 10 minutes away from finalizing the episode.

449
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,200
 I was editing that and I go, "I'm going to check one last time."

450
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
 So there we go.

451
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
 John Weary doesn't exist.

452
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
 It's a fictional character.

453
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
 It was all a lark.

454
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
 He involved his own baby in it.

455
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
 Yelling at his baby on camera.

456
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
 Not a good idea.

457
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,200
 I mean, I'm not wishing hell on this guy, obviously.

458
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
 It was a stupid decision and it's going to haunt him for a while.

459
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:14,200
 I'm not saying everyone has to go and brigade against him or anything like that, but bad, bad, bad choice of props, dude.

460
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
 Bad choice of props.

461
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
 But I wanted to give you that update from the future.

462
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,200
 So now you get to hear this exciting ending to an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

463
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:33,200
 But then, because of the weird world we live in, there's a chance that there is a werewolf stalking the neighborhood.

464
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,200
 He got out of the garage and he's looking in the windows now for his next victims.

465
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,200
 Claws bloody, teeth ready to eat.

466
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,200
 He climbs up a sycamore tree and howls into the distance.

467
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,200
 Because this world was not built for both man and wolf.

468
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,200
 In a world where werewolves really exist, it is the true apex predator.

469
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,200
 We don't have a stockpile of silver bullets.

470
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,200
 We don't have the apparatus that would be needed to find and to take down a werewolf.

471
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,200
 And what if it's a family of werewolves?

472
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
 His wife snarling in the tree next to him.

473
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:22,200
 His oldest son silently perched on a branch looking for someone delicious to eat.

474
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
 And then a little baby werewolf.

475
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:31,200
 A little baby werewolf who can't move its arms yet, but is looking at the world through yellow werewolf eyes.

476
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,200
 This is a world that no one would want to live in.

477
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,200
 Except for the man known as John Weir.

478
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
