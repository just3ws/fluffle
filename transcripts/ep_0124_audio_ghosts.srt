1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A dispute at a workplace becomes a close encounter of the sword kind.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then I'm going to share some personal stories I have that involve ghosts

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 and the ability to both mimic a human voice

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 and to make your screams silent today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [music]

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hello everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 You know what Tesla should have invented?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 You know, I wonder if these exist, but a quiet heater.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Most heaters are quite noisy.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm saying this because I'm freezing right now.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 It is super cold here.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I think it's probably about 35, 34 degrees this night.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I can't run my heater because I'm recording.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 So, and also, I did have another story planned for tonight.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That was a story that's been on the Conspiracy Iceberg for a while.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I'm not going to reveal what it is just yet, but what happened was I had just...

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I'll reveal it.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So, Monday's episode, we're going to do the Paleolithic Deep State.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Do cavemen secretly run the world?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And I had just...

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 The story was prepped. It was ready to go because the reason why I'm saying this,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I try to do two Conspiracy Iceberg stories a week.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 That's kind of been my setup.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 A minimum one.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 But so that one, I had ready to go.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And I knew what I was going to talk about.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And I came across some brand new information on it that gave me a whole new angle to go on the story.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So, we're going to wait a little bit for that.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And so, because of that, I'm going to talk about one of my personal experiences.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We'll get to that in a second.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I tend not to like to talk about my personal experiences,

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 not because I'm shy or anything,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 but because I can't...

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 There's nothing I can really link to that.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I'll see if I can try to find some articles that relate to this experience,

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 but I always try to give you stories that I can provide backup for.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But we've done stuff...

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 The Stanley Hotel episode was mostly based on my experiences,

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 and then the Shadow People invasion.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But even those had some links.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So, we'll see.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 The ghost stories I'm going to tell you are quite odd.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Okay, I wanted to tell this story real quick.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 It's from New News,

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 and we're traveling again back to the year 2004.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And this is a short one.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 It's such a bizarre story.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We're in 2004.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 We're in the United States.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And we're in a company called Peerless Steel Corporation.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 They make bolts and stuff.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Actually, they don't...

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I just really looked at my notes.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 They make metal powder for brakes.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So they don't make bolts.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 But anyway, they make just a giant Frankenstein bolt.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And there was this guy who's at work.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 He got picked on all the time.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 All the time.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 But one guy in particular was always picking on him.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And I thought it was a little ironic that the company was named Peerless,

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and this guy had no peers.

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But anyway, so he's sitting at work,

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 and he's like...

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 (humming)

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 He might have been humming a copyright song,

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 but I don't know.

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I'm gonna use a non-copyrighted song.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And he's humming...

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And he's sharpening this.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 He's hit or miss.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I bet you never miss, huh?

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 The song came out like 14 years later.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 But anyways, he's working on something,

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 and people are kind of like,

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 "Hey, dude, what are you working on?"

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And he's like,

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 "I'm building a sword."

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 People are like, "What?"

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And you know, it's a metalwork company.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 They're probably always building weird stuff.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 We used to build baseball bats and wood shop in high school.

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 They don't allow you to do that anymore, I don't think.

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But anyways...

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 (humming)

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 But you never miss, huh?

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 You got a boy sharpening, making the sword after a couple of days,

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 and no one really thought anything of it.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 After a couple of days, he must have...

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He's just been like,

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 "Oh, holds the sword up."

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And then goes,

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 "Everyone leave, except for you, bully."

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And everyone's like...

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And you know, the thing is,

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 is at any point they could have said,

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 "Dude, stop making a sword at work."

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 "Dude, on your own time, and then leave it at home."

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 But anyways, he's like,

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 "Everyone just go home.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I have business with this guy."

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And the other dudes don't go home.

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 They do leave because the guy has a sword.

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 They go outside, they call the police.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And then the guy with the sword just walks up

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and just hits the bully on the back of the head so hard,

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 nearly decapitates him.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Basically just like a barbarian killing blow.

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And then he leaves, he runs away.

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 So, actually, no, before the cops,

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 they call the cops and he runs away.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And before the cops get there,

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 he comes back to the factory,

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 sits down, and as the cops are pulling up,

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 he's drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette.

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And it's weird because at any point

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 they could have said,

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 "Stop building a sword."

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 But they didn't.

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 They probably just thought he was kind of a harmless guy.

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You know, the article's quite vague because

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 I had to find a newer version of the article

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 that I could link to.

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It's such an old event.

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But they don't really say what he was being bullied with.

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 He was being bullied because they were like,

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 "I bet you can't make a sword, loser."

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I'll self-show you."

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 But yeah, nuts, dude.

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I can't imagine any workplace now

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 somebody making a weapon and it going unnoticed.

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Unless it was like the cool guy that no one messed with.

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Like, he's so cool.

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 He can make all the swords he wants.

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 But for the most part, if you...

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I think in workplaces today,

139
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 if you walked around making gun noises with your fingers,

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 you'd probably get dragged into HR,

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 let alone making a three-foot long sword.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 It probably wasn't three feet long, but anyways,

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 it was a long sword.

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And took place two days before Halloween.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Actually, you know, maybe they thought he was making it

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 for a Halloween costume.

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Still, they want to let you do that today.

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Okay, that's that story.

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So let's go ahead and talk about

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 some creepy things that happened to me involving ghosts.

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And it's something that was very disconcerting.

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 There were two particular events because

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 it changed the way I looked at paranormal threats.

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And it's always kind of colored my attitude towards

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 the paranormal and personal safety.

156
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So the first story, a little bit of background.

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Now, I know I have a lot of listeners around the world.

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 We only have like 60% of our listenership is in the United States.

159
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 The rest of it is global.

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But in America, in most major cities,

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 people have seen these, and so I have to explain this real quick.

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 What happens is you'll see places of business.

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 You'll see real estate companies or burger shops or whatever.

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And there will be a dancing guy on a street corner with a sign.

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 They dance around and they spin the sign around

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 and they kind of do crazy tricks.

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And the sign says, you know, like, "Eat at Mr. Pickle's Restaurant Shop."

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Or buy your home at Honey and Vinegar Real Estate, whatever it is.

169
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So you see them around.

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 They actually get paid pretty well.

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It's like $15 an hour to just sit there on a street corner,

172
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 kind of dance around a bit and spin this sign.

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And, you know, you're listening to your own music.

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 You don't give you music to dance to.

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 You kind of pick it out.

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 You're crunkin' with the sign. No one can read it.

177
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But remember, there's always -- I've done a lot of odd jobs in my life.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And I don't necessarily mean that as a turn of phrase.

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I've worked at a crematory for a while.

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I've done -- I've been a nanny.

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I've done all sorts of crazy jobs.

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Those two jobs weren't back-to-back,

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 but I've had all sorts of crazy, small jobs in my life.

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I've worked for a psychic phone network for a while.

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 That was a depressing job, I'll tell that story someday.

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But I remember once I was like, "Oh, you know, I could dance around for $15 an hour."

187
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And there was an ad of a newspaper for dancing guy on street corner.

188
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And I was like, "I can do that. It's $15 an hour, you know?"

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And this was back in '98, so $15 was a lot of money back then.

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But anyway, so I remember calling them up and they said,

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 "Well, here's the thing. What we need you to do first, you need to prove your medal."

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And I'm like, "Dance competition?" And they're like, "No, not a dance competition."

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 They go, "What we're gonna have you do is you're gonna put up --

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 it was for a real estate company.

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 They'll go all along this main route.

196
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It was Hazel Avenue in Orangevale, Citrus Heights, Sacramento area.

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But it was in Orangevale, down Hazel.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 You're gonna put these signs up for this new real estate development.

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And each Friday night, I had to put them up.

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And by Sunday afternoon, I had to take them down.

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Otherwise, they got fined because they weren't allowed to advertise during the week.

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It was actually the only job I ever got fired from because I couldn't --

203
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I never took the signs -- I'd always leave like one or two signs up.

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I'd miss them and they'd end up getting fined.

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 But I remember the guy came to give me my supplies.

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 He gave me a sledgehammer and a bunch of wooden stakes.

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And I was like, "Okay, this is cool because whether or not the job is any fun,

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I can at least fight vampires."

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And I remember him telling me -- he goes, "Listen, listen, kid."

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Because I was probably like 19. He goes, "Listen, kid."

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 He might not have said, "Kid," but anyways, he's like chomping a cigar.

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 He's like, "Listen, kid, you got this job.

213
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 You're gonna put these signs up on Friday nights.

214
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 You're gonna take them down on Sunday afternoons.

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And if you do a good job -- if you do a good job."

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Quote. He actually said this.

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 "If you do a good job, someday you'll be that guy dancing on the street corner."

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And I'm thinking, "I'm beneath him? I'm beneath the Mr. Pickles guy?"

219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Like, I was a rung below him and I ended up getting fired from that job.

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But, so, there was also this field off -- it was off of Hazel Avenue.

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 There was this large field.

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And we had gone there -- me and my friends had gone there a couple of times ghost hunting.

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Because it was creepy. We had seen some shadow men there.

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 We had seen -- I had seen a shadow man there.

225
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And I have a unique experience.

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Well, here, I'll tell this shadow man story here.

227
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 So, me and my friends rolled up to this field, because it sets the tone for this area.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 It looked like when you stood on the edge of the field.

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 It was right off of Hazel, if you know the area, but near Gold River.

230
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 But anyways, when you stood on the edge of the field, it looked like the field went on for a --

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 like, it looked like it went on forever.

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It didn't, obviously.

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 But in the middle of the suburban area, there was just this large field that had never been developed.

234
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I remember once I rolled up there with my friends.

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And I said, "We all get out of our car when we're walking around."

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And there was this one guy who was like, "I don't believe in ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts."

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And back then, I was like, totally believed in ghosts.

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Every ghost story was true, all that stuff.

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 We rolled up to this field, and I was like, "Yeah, this place is pretty creepy."

240
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And the dude who didn't believe in anything, he was standing there with his girlfriend.

241
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And we had probably like six, seven people with us. I think we took a couple cars.

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And dude was standing there on the edge of the field, and I saw a shadow person.

243
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Okay, and let me say this, too.

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Of course, all these stories you take with a grain of salt, like, they did happen.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 They're 100% true.

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But if you don't believe them, that's fine.

247
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Because again, it's just one person telling a story to you.

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And I have nothing to back it up.

249
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But anyway, so I was standing there, and this dude who didn't believe in ghosts or nothing like that,

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 he was just walking around standing there with his girlfriend.

251
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And we're just kind of milling about.

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And I see a shadow person standing right behind him.

253
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Now, I'm walking towards the shadow person, and the dude's name was Chris.

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I'm walking up basically behind Chris.

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He's looking in one direction, and I see the shadow person standing behind him.

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And it was one of those weird things where I remember the shadow person almost having color in it.

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 It was such a bizarre thing.

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But I couldn't describe it.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 It basically was a shadow-shaped human, but there was a little bit of color.

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 It was so bizarre.

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And I walked up to-- and I didn't tell Chris what was going on.

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 I didn't tell him what I saw anything, or it's like, "Don't move! There's a spooky guy!"

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I didn't-- none of that stuff.

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I just walked up behind him, and I'm now maybe a foot and a half, two feet behind Chris.

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And again, he's not aware of what I'm doing.

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And I put my hands where the shadow person was, and didn't tell anyone what I was doing.

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I just kind of pushed, kind of walked up to behind Chris, and again, there's still a foot between me and Chris.

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I put-- maybe even further, maybe two or three feet.

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I put my hands up to where the shadow person was, and when I did, Chris's knees buckled.

270
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Like, I saw him physically, kind of like, buckled down.

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And again, I didn't tell him anything that I was doing.

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And he turned around, and he's like, "What happened?"

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And I was like, "There was something behind you."

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And I walked up to it, and I touched it, and he goes, "I don't like this, man. I don't like this."

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And we hung out there for-- we were there for maybe just a few more minutes, and he's like, "I don't like this at all."

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And the plan was then to go to-- I think it wasn't Sherry's caros at the time.

277
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 So we drive back down Hazel, go to caros.

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 We all pull into the parking lot, because we had multiple vehicles.

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And we get out, and Chris and his girlfriend at the time, and they're like, "We're out."

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And I'm like, "What's the matter?" He's like, "I don't feel good, dude. I don't feel good."

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And he just left. And it was a weird experience, and that wasn't the only experience we had at that field.

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 A lot of times you would just get an eerie sense, or you would hear something moving around in the trees, which that could just be wildlife.

283
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But that shadow person standing behind him was always kind of a weird-- I knew then that that area, a particular area, was haunted.

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And so, this two stories collide.

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 So at one point, I had my sledgehammer. I was out in that area, because it was right off the road where I'd put the signs up.

286
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And one day I was rolling with my boys, and I had my little brother there as well.

287
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 So I had two of my friends who weren't there for the shadow people stuff.

288
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 It was two other friends that I went ghost hunting with, because I did it a lot in my 20s.

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 I was there with them and my little brother. We pull up to that field, and while we're there and we're like looking for ghosts,

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 a car full of high schoolers showed up.

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Now, I don't want to oversell it, but Orangevale and Citrus Heights may have calmed down a bit,

292
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 but Orangevale has always been basically, even though it's part of a large city, it's a suburb of a suburb,

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 you get in fights really-- I got in a lot of fights. I got in a lot of fights back then.

294
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And you would just get in fights with people. And you would just have to-- basically whenever you went out, you're like,

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 "Ah, there's a chance that I'm going to get in a fight tonight." It was just something that you had to deal with.

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So these high schoolers rolled up, looking for a fight. I'm standing there with my friends.

297
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 We're all like, "Hey, let's go find ghosts. Maybe I could get an EVP." But we would still beat the shit out of people.

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Like, you just-- again, it didn't matter what click you ran with, you had to be prepared to fight.

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And so anyways, this car full of high school students rolled up, and they're like,

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 "Hey, what are you guys doing? You're just talking trash, right?"

301
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I'm not trying to be like a tough guy or nothing. I had my boys with me. It wasn't like-- I feel like I'm trying to make myself to be out

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 some sort of badass, but-- these dudes roll up and they're talking trash, and I'm just kind of letting them talk trash.

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 You know, they're-- because I'm holding a sledgehammer. I'm holding a-- and these sledgehammer that I got was like a minute--

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 it was like a miniature sledgehammer. So it was probably about three feet long, because it was just for driving wooden stakes.

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And it wasn't a full, giant, long sledgehammer, but they roll up and I'm just kind of-- I have it kind of down at my waist,

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 and the car doesn't see it, because it's nighttime. They're talking trash, and I'm like, "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm."

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And when I decide to make my move, I just raise the sledgehammer. I'm like, "Get out of your car, dude."

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And the car, obviously, they take off, because they're like, "No matter what, if we think we could take this kind of fistfight,

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 yeah, he has his sledgehammer." And again, not telling that story because I'm some sort of badass, because I'm not,

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 but I'm telling that story because of what happened next.

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 So we're out there for longer, because we're not going to let these guys ruin our night. We had a whole night of ghost hunting planned,

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 and I'll tell you, we had a bunch of weird stuff happen that night. But this particular thing is this particular story.

313
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So we're out there for a bit longer, and I was like, "Dude, I got a piss, dude. I'm going to go behind this building."

314
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And it was basically like a-- there was a-- the big field, but then if you walk the block, there was like this little mini mall type of thing,

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 but it had like auto repair shop and stuff like that. But for some reason, we left--

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Actually, I think I didn't want to piss in the haunted field. So I go over around the corner--

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 We drive the car a bit, I jump out, I go around the corner, and I start peeing.

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 As I'm continuing-- as I'm still peeing, so, it's hanging out, urinating all over this person's business.

319
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 My brother and my two friends come running around the corner, and I'm like, "Yo, dude, dude, what the hell, dude? I got-- I got my dick out.

320
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And they're like, "What are you guys doing?" And they all look at each other, and they go, "Were you just screaming?"

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And I was like, "No." And they're like, "We just heard you screaming, dude. You were just screaming for help, like at the top of your lungs."

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And my little brother's like, "We thought that car circled back around." And they all jumped out, and you guys were fighting.

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And I was like, "No, dude, look, I'm pissing. There's nobody around me."

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And all three of them were like, "Dude, we all heard you scream for help, like as loud as you could."

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And you can imagine, I think, if you listen to this podcast, how loud and get sometimes I have to sometimes gait the audio.

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 But I was-- and we got into-- me and these guys, I was like, "I had to zip up." But I was like, "No, I wasn't screaming."

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And they're like, "Dude, we 100% heard you screaming for your life." And I thought about it.

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 As we were driving around, I thought-- and these guys, we had all done ghost hunting together.

329
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And we had a rule. And this is a rule I generally have with ghost hunting. No pranks. No jokes.

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Like, if we're out in a location, don't go, "Oh, I just forgot I left my oven on."

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 None of that, because it totally defeats the purpose.

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 When you went out with me to do this type of stuff, no jokes, no jumping out and scaring people,

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 no saying you saw stuff when you didn't see stuff, that was our rule.

334
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And especially my little brother wouldn't have been on it, because he was new to kind of hanging out with us.

335
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 He would have said, "Nah, let's not do that." So I trust him 100% when they said that they actually thought they heard me yelling.

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And I thought about it, and we all kind of talked about it throughout the night. We did more ghost hunting and stuff.

337
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 But the fact that-- okay, so something imitated my voice.

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Something said, "Help me, help me," whatever, screaming at the top of my lungs while I was completely silent.

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And again, I would never pull a prank on them like that.

340
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So we have an experience where a ghost is able to mimic the voice of a person and say new phrases.

341
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 It's not simply that you walk in a haunted house and you go, "Is anyone here?" and you hear back, "Is anyone here?"

342
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 It wasn't really creepy enough, obviously, but it wasn't an echo. It was new thoughts and new ideas in my voice getting those people to my area.

343
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Now here's the creepy thing about that. There's always that idea, like, "Let's say that your out ghost hunting."

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 You trust the people you're with, you should, at least.

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And something gathers you all in one spot.

346
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 You hear someone cry enough for help and everyone goes to a particular spot and they're like, "I swore I heard Jason in the middle of the woods."

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And everyone goes there and that's where that force, that darkness, wants you at that moment.

348
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Or even creepier, it spreads you out.

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 So one person hears my voice over here, and my little brother hears my voice over here, and my third friend hears my voice over here,

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 and they start going, "He's over here, he's over here." No, no, no, I swear it's coming from over here, and the group starts to spread out.

351
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Very chilling. I've never run into that. Now I didn't hear it myself, but again, it's interesting to think that something could imitate you and basically lay a trap.

352
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 But the second story I'm going to tell is far more troubling.

353
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I had a friend that was also into the paranormal. I think she went on a couple ghost hunts with us,

354
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 but she wasn't one of the regulars. And her name was Dana, and she was a good friend of mine, and she had a pet cockatoo,

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 which is a bird that talked. I forgot what the name of it was. It was super vicious, dude. It would chase you around the house, it would bite you, it was nuts.

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It's absolutely nuts. But you know, it was her pet, so what are you going to do?

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 And we hung out a lot, we stayed up talking and things like that. No big deal.

358
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I spent the night at her house a couple times, but it was total just friend thing.

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And so I remember one night, and she, oh, and she, the reason why I would stay the night at her house, because her house, she would,

360
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 she claimed multiple times, "My house is haunted. My house is haunted. You should stay the night. My house is haunted."

361
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And so, so I stayed the night at her house a couple times. And again, like, we would just stay up talking and then we would go to sleep.

362
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I would sleep on the couch, and she had a bedroom upstairs with her bird.

363
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Not the bird wasn't in the bed, but you know, she shared a bedroom with her bird, who I forgot the name of. I feel bad.

364
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I wonder if he's still alive, because I know birds live a long time. But anyways, I remember one night, and again, I was really into ghost hunting

365
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and really into, like, looking at magical rituals online and just getting in, getting in over my head.

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 This all, these, both of these stories, happened around the time of the Shadow People invasion that I was talking about,

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 where I was just seeing more stuff than I wanted to. My curiosity was more than peaked, and it was just, I was seeing it everywhere.

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So, one night, I'm downstairs. She's upstairs. And her mom also thought that, "Oh, and here's a new trusting story about her mom, too.

369
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I should tell this story just because it's so bizarre." She said, "You know, my mom had a childhood sweetheart, and they were in high school together.

370
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And he wanted to marry her when they graduated. He goes, "I want to marry you, but first, the first thing I want to do is I want to hitchhike across the United States."

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And we're talking, this is back in, like, the year 1971. He said, "I want to hitchhike across the United States.

372
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I want to have this great adventure, and when I come back, I want to settle down and marry you."

373
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And she's like, "That sounds fine. You know, he sounds like this rough-and-tumble guy." He just disappeared.

374
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The family never knew what happened to him. Dana's mom never heard from him again. He just vanished. He's gone.

375
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So maybe he found a new life somewhere, or who knows? But he just disappeared. And of course, you know, 70s and 80s was kind of the height of the serial killer,

376
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 especially the roaming serial killer, so it's always kind of a creepy story. But anyway, so one night, you know, Dana would talk about her house being haunted and things like that.

377
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And her mother also thought it was haunted, and I knew her mom. I met her mom. And one night, we're going to bed.

378
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And I go, "Okay, I'm just going to fall asleep on the couch." And she's like, "Okay, good night." And she goes upstairs.

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Now, I have this thing where I don't like couches that are in the middle of a living room. I don't like being around where something can, like, come up over the couch.

380
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 From behind, I like my couches to be against the wall. But it wasn't my house. What are we going to do? Rearrange her couch?

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I fall asleep on the couch. I wake up in the middle of the night. Now, I'm not going to say it was three in the morning, the witching hour, but it was quite late.

382
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I woke up with a start, like, something just, and I'm laying down on the couch. I'm laying down on my side. And I remember waking up and almost instantly popping up.

383
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 So I'm laying down on the couch sideways, and something wakes me up. And all of a sudden, I'm sitting up on the couch, and my feet are touching the ground.

384
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So it's just like this one movement up. And the living room was completely silent. And I heard what could only be...

385
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 This is going to sound so ridiculous. And again, if you guys don't believe me, I understand. But I heard what sounded like a creepy, deep laugh.

386
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Like a ho ho ho ho ho. And the living room wasn't... I remember this vividly. The living room wasn't, like, pitch black.

387
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I remember the living room was lit up with the little blue electronic lights that you see on, like, a VCR or a microwave light, you know, microwave display, stuff like that.

388
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It wasn't completely pitch black, but it wasn't... Not everything was visible. But I had enough light to see details in the living room.

389
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And I sat up and I heard a ho ho ho ho ho ho. I sat there perfectly still. And the only way I can describe it, it's going to be hard to do over the podcast.

390
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But I'm sitting up and there's nothing, you know, there's nothing behind the couch. Like, the couch is just sitting in the middle of the living room.

391
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And it was like if you're sitting in a chair and someone passed their hand...

392
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 If someone... Okay, imagine you're sitting in a chair in the middle of a room. Imagine if someone was standing behind you and put their arms straight out and then moved their arm over your head.

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Just enough that you see their hand moving from one side to the other.

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So you knew there was someone behind you. If someone was standing behind you with arm perfectly extended, palm down, and they move their hand from one side to another, like, over your head.

395
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Just enough that you can see the fingers. That's what I saw. I just saw a hand kind of appear right over my right, like, from the vision of my right eye, and then just move like someone was passing their hand over the top of my head.

396
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 But just enough that I could see the hand. And again, I...

397
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I can't even think of words to describe the hand. I mean, it looked like a normal five-fingered hand, but it had...

398
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It didn't seem like a shadow person's hand. I just can't think of a word to describe it. It was unearthly, obviously. It wasn't a human.

399
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And I could tell it wasn't a human. And I sat there in her living room and I go, "Dana? Dana?

400
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Dana!" And I'm waiting to hear her say something. She's upstairs. And I'm being much louder than I am on the podcast.

401
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And I have my backpack. And I get up and I grab my backpack. And at this point, I'm yelling, "Dana? Dana? I'm leaving. The door's going to be unlocked."

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Which probably isn't the smartest thing to yell. But I'm going, "Dana? Dana? I'm leaving. The door's going to be unlocked, but I have to get out of here."

403
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Me thinking that if she just heard me yelling, "Dana?" a couple of times, she just didn't think anything of it, or she was just kind of waking up.

404
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Now I'm saying, "I'm out. Your front door's going to be unlocked." This wasn't the best area. We're in Antelope now, actually, where she was at.

405
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 So it was better in the Orangevale. But I'm like, "And I'm saying this as I'm leaving the house. Because I don't want to be there anymore."

406
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And I shut her door and I leave. I go home and I was at my grandma's house at this time. So again, that's where all that other shadow stuff was happening.

407
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I go home. I get a call like at 6 or 7 in the morning. And it's Dana. She goes, "Dude, where are you?" Because we're just going to hang out the next day.

408
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 She's like, "Dude, where are you? What's going on?" I go, "Dude, I'm home." I came home, dude. Your house was way too creepy. I couldn't be there.

409
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And she's like, "What's going on?" I ended up driving back out there to talk to her in person.

410
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 I said, "Dude, so here's what happened." And I told her the story. I just told you. I said, "I'm sitting here. Something woke me up. I heard this laugh. I saw this hand pass over the top of my head."

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And she's not interrupting me. She's just looking at me the whole time. And I go and then I yelled your name like three times and you didn't respond.

412
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And then I said, "Hey, I'm leaving. Like as loud as I could. Your front door's unlocked." And I left.

413
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And she waited until I got done telling the story and she looks at me and she goes, "That's impossible, Jason. It's impossible."

414
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 What do you mean? She goes, "If you had yelled my name, I would have heard it." And I'm like, "I yelled your name."

415
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 She goes, "You might have yelled my name. You probably did." But she says, "You can hear..."

416
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 The way that the living room and the house was just built, it was like a tract home. It was like a cookie gutter home.

417
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 She said the way it was built was that there was a vent that went from the kitchen right into her bedroom.

418
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And she goes, "I can smell what my mom's cooking through the vent." She goes, "Sometimes if I listen closely enough, I can hear the grease crackle in the frying pan from my bedroom, because the acoustics through that vent are that good."

419
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 She said, "There is no way that I shouldn't have been able to hear you yell." And she goes, "And even if I didn't, even if I was dead asleep..."

420
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 She said, "My bird, my pet bird, wakes up at literally any noise whatsoever." And it's magnified for that bird.

421
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 She goes, "If I'm downstairs..." And I say the bird's name, upstairs he will start crying or doing whatever birds do.

422
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Because she goes, "There is no way you could have yelled my name and I didn't wake up, and especially for my bird not to have just totally lost it because someone's screaming my name."

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Because I say the bird's name downstairs, the bird will respond upstairs because it hears me. And I remember we talked about it for a while.

424
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Because she believed that I did that. The question was why didn't she hear it? And why didn't the bird hear it with the acoustics?

425
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 The idea of a ghost being able to mimic your voice is creepy enough. But the ability to silence you is terrifying.

426
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 The idea that when you go ghost hunting, if I go, "Hey guys, let's stay in a group. Let's not split up when we're in this area."

427
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 But then for whatever reason, you don't split up. You simply go into a room. You go, "Hey, I'm going to check out in here." And someone else is outside that room.

428
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 The idea that then you could be begging for your life, and the person right outside that room doesn't hear anything.

429
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Or you're in a forest and you slightly get separated for whatever reason.

430
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Something happens to them and they're screaming for help, screaming for assistance. And the other people are completely oblivious.

431
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 It's not outside the realm of possibility when you're talking about any sort of... sound is basically energy. It's waves.

432
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And if you're able to disrupt those waves, you can disrupt the message. Sound is something that we take for granted.

433
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 We think if someone's in the next room and they cry out for help, you should be able to hear them. It's simply a sound wave coming through a wall.

434
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 But there is something out there that can disrupt that sound wave. There is something out there that can make the loudest cry for help.

435
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Completely silent to even the most sensitive ears. You're never safe from these things.

436
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And when they want to silence you, they can and they will.

437
