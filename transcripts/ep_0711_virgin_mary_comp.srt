1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 How do you catch a criminal who leaves no traces?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,340
 And then we wrap up season 14 with possibly our most terrifying story yet.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,700
 Is it possible for demonic forces to disguise themselves as holy icons today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:28,460
 [Music]

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,560
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,060
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,060
 First off, let's take a look at our Fan Art Friday submission.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,660
 This is a brand new submission from Adam Carter.

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,160
 Look, this is awesome. I love this.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,860
 It says Dead Rabbit Radio in this really cool font.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,160
 We have the Dead Rabbit with his third eye floating over his head.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,660
 There's like a cyberpunk biomechanical look and a little in-joke here.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,160
 You'll see on his shirt if you guys are driving. Don't look.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,360
 We'll get it later on his shirt.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,660
 It says, "Monkeys do not exist in Bask,"

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,260
 which is the logo on my Patreon supporter sticker.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,560
 So that is from Adam Carter.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,160
 Adam, thank you so much for this totally awesome artwork.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,360
 Really, really appreciate it.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,860
 Great way to end off season 14 with this amazing piece of artwork.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,160
 This is it. This is the final episode of season 14,

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,960
 and I'm taking the entire month of July off.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,360
 The show will not return until the beginning of August.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,860
 It is a vacation that I need.

26
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,360
 Normally, I take two week breaks,

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,960
 but this time I'm going to be doing traveling.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,660
 I normally travel during the summer,

29
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,460
 so I will be gone for the month of July.

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,760
 No new Dead Rabbit Radio episodes, except on July 18th,

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,360
 the long prophesized day of an alien invasion,

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,160
 alien encounter, alien disclosure,

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,760
 however you want to describe it.

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,360
 None of it's going to happen, right?

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,560
 None of it's going to happen, but we are going to do a July 18th.

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,060
 Alien Invasion Special brought to you by the Quiet Place Part 2.

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,960
 Tune in for that.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,260
 Join the YouTube channel.

39
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,260
 Subscribe to the YouTube channel, so you guys can be there for that.

40
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,760
 If you guys don't do the YouTube thing, that's totally fine.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,860
 I'm going to take the audio and upload it to the podcast.

42
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,560
 But if you're there during the livestream,

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,760
 you'll be able to ask me questions.

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,860
 We're going to have a conversation,

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,360
 outrun some aliens, maybe make love to a sexy reptilian.

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,860
 We've just got to see what happens.

47
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,160
 We'll see what happens on July 18th.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,360
 So get your strawberry or ice cream ready for that amazing event.

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,460
 Speaking of amazing, let's welcome in today's legacy Patreon supporter.

50
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,260
 It's Big Bug Nowadays.

51
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,960
 Everyone give a round of applause to Big Bug Nowadays.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,660
 It's a giant beetle walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

53
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,060
 Big Bug, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,760
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I get it.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 It's totally fine.

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,560
 There's a lot of people that I watch all their content to

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,860
 and never give them a dime.

58
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,760
 But I spread the word about the show.

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,260
 I'll spread the word right now.

60
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,560
 Omrecker, if you guys like video game Dead by Daylight,

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,860
 check out Omrecker's channel on YouTube.

62
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,360
 He's really my favorite content creator right now

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,860
 and it has been for a long time.

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,160
 So if you guys can't support the Patreon,

65
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,460
 just spread the word about the show because I get it.

66
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,960
 Not everyone can donate money.

67
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,660
 That's totally fine.

68
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,460
 Just spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

69
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,760
 Let's go ahead and get this bad boy started with Big Bug at the wheel of the Jason Jalopy.

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,160
 I'm going to toss you those keys.

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,260
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,660
 We are headed out to a drug den

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,460
 in the middle of the United States.

74
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,960
 [imitates gunshots]

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,360
 Big Bug and Big Bug is like, "Right, I'm driving this old beat-up Jalopy car."

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,260
 We're headed into this drug den.

77
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,460
 There's a bunch of bodyguards standing there with mean-looking sunglasses

78
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,760
 and their sunglasses have sunglasses.

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,860
 It's like the scariest place you've ever been

80
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,060
 and we see all these drug dealers sitting around

81
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,260
 and they're like, "You know, instead of sitting in this warehouse,

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,760
 we shouldn't be out dealing drugs.

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,860
 That is what our job is."

84
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,960
 But no, they're all in this location right now

85
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,260
 and the big boss walks out onto the balcony.

86
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,460
 'Cause I imagine this is straight from like an '80s Seagal movie.

87
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,260
 It's a warehouse with this balcony and this boss comes out

88
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,260
 and his sunglasses have sunglasses and those sunglasses have sunglasses.

89
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,060
 That's how you know how in charge this guy is.

90
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,560
 He walks out and he takes his sunglasses off.

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,560
 It takes a while because first the one pair of sunglasses have to take the sunglasses.

92
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,160
 You're like, "Okay, Jason, the joke wasn't funny to begin with.

93
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,260
 Now it's actually making me unsubscribe to your show."

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,160
 After about 30 minutes of sunglasses being taken off quantum sunglasses,

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,260
 the boss goes, "Hey, all you drug dealers out there."

96
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,660
 That's how he doesn't learn their names.

97
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,660
 He's not a really good boss.

98
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,960
 He doesn't know his employees.

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
 All you drug dealers and drug dealerettes.

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,760
 People are like, "That's not a thing.

101
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,960
 You don't call a female a drug dealer, a drug dealer."

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,460
 And he goes, "It doesn't matter.

103
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,860
 I'm here to tell you guys that I have discovered the best new app around."

104
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,960
 And they're like, "What?"

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,360
 And he pulls out this cell phone and he goes,

106
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,260
 "This is a nom."

107
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,160
 And everyone's like, "What's a nom?"

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,260
 Here, I'll tell you what.

109
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,060
 That long intro.

110
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,560
 Let me just tell you what a nom is.

111
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,460
 That was just the theater of the mind.

112
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,560
 Back a couple episodes.

113
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,160
 It was maybe about 20, 30 episodes ago.

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,560
 I'll put it in the show notes.

115
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,460
 I did a story about this thing called "IncroChat."

116
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,060
 We've covered it a couple times on this podcast, actually.

117
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:13,060
 It was a super secure app for your phone that was untraceable.

118
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,860
 So you were able to send drug dealing messages to your drug dealers and your drug dealerettes.

119
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,060
 And you were able to swap photos.

120
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,960
 You're like, "Look at all these people I massacred."

121
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,760
 Everyone's like, "Oh, man.

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,560
 I wish I could have massacred that many people."

123
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,460
 It was a way for criminals to talk to each other,

124
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,360
 but eventually Interpol was able to hack into it.

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,660
 And they arrested a ton of people within a short matter of time

126
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,360
 because the criminals were talking openly.

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
 They figured, you know, we can say all this stuff.

128
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,060
 They're not going to be able to hack this system where Interpol did hack it

129
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,160
 and they arrested all these people.

130
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,060
 We've covered it a couple times.

131
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,460
 Very fascinating.

132
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,060
 Well, of course, someone else is going to take their place.

133
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,960
 And there were competitors to "IncroChat" at the time.

134
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,460
 It's just like how the feds shut down Silk Road,

135
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,360
 the drug dealing website on the dark web.

136
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,460
 Silk Road 2.0 popped up shortly after.

137
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,360
 There are other websites vying for control at the same time.

138
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
 You're never going to be able to knock all these down.

139
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,160
 So what really jumps into prominence is Anom.

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,660
 Anom, A-N-O-M, was set up in 2018

141
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,360
 and criminals began flocking to this incredibly secure network.

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,560
 Anom, this is so interesting

143
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
 because you figure there's a bunch of criminals, right?

144
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,060
 You figure they just all worked out of these warehouses.

145
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,260
 And in alleyways, they actually had a distribution team.

146
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,960
 Anom actually had people go out to know and criminal hideouts.

147
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,460
 I mean, talk about cold calling, right?

148
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,060
 This is more like cold cocking.

149
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,660
 Ch-ch-ch.

150
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,460
 You get a gun in your head.

151
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,260
 You're like, "Uh..."

152
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,960
 You're like, "Jason, just end this show.

153
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,160
 Just end this episode.

154
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,560
 Take your break now."

155
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,860
 Because this is like your worst joke ever.

156
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,460
 You walk in, you have to sell these phones to these drug dealers.

157
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,160
 But they do.

158
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,960
 Anom actually has a distribution team that went out

159
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,360
 and they actually, they had a marketing slogan for this.

160
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
 They have a marketing slogan for this.

161
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,860
 It's for criminals, by criminals.

162
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,260
 I mean, I might be a criminal.

163
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,360
 I might be a drug dealer.

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,260
 I don't want another criminal developing my app.

165
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,160
 How do I know you're not going to steal my identity?

166
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,560
 I think the fact that who would steal Pablo Escobar's identity, right?

167
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,660
 Because he's just going to kill you and get it back.

168
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,460
 This Anom program goes out and it's actually tied to specific phones.

169
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,060
 The phones have the...

170
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,460
 They're not even really phones.

171
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,960
 They have no voice ability.

172
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,260
 They have no camera ability.

173
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,360
 They have no ability to be tracked.

174
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,160
 You could only send secure messages through the Anom app.

175
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,560
 So it was a basically a bricked phone.

176
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,860
 It could only do one thing.

177
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,460
 But what it did was essential to criminals.

178
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,860
 It allowed them to communicate with each other undetected.

179
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,260
 And I didn't know this existed in the...

180
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,760
 It makes sense.

181
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,360
 But in the underworld, there is a thing known as a criminal influencer.

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,860
 So it's exactly what it sounds like.

183
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,360
 It's the Kim Kardashian.

184
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,460
 It's the Kim Kardashian.

185
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,160
 It's Kilo Kardashian.

186
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
 It's people in the criminal underworld that other criminals look up to.

187
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,560
 What they say has more weight.

188
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,860
 So once the Anom...

189
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,460
 Just like how you want to have some sort of diet shake, some weight loss shake or whatever.

190
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,760
 You send it to the Kardashians.

191
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,260
 You pay them money and they'll talk about it.

192
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,460
 Anom, this was so good.

193
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,660
 They were selling these phones and some of them fell into hands of high level criminal and influencers.

194
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,160
 And they began spreading the word.

195
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
 This is the app.

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,060
 If you guys want to murder people and not get caught, everyone's like, "Yeah, who doesn't want to do that?"

197
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
 We're criminals.

198
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,960
 Well, then Anom is the app for you.

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,360
 This was spreading like wildfire and the feds were like, "Dude, they knew this app existed, but they don't know how to stop it."

200
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,960
 It's just like in-crow chat.

201
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,160
 Anom is spreading throughout the criminal world.

202
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,960
 You can only...

203
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,760
 And the fact that it was hard to get ahold of them.

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,660
 You could only buy them through the black market or you met or knew one of these distributors.

205
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,560
 But they did have 12,000 of these devices spread around the world.

206
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,460
 Well, on June 8th, 2021, this is worldwide.

207
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,360
 This all happens pretty much in a 48-hour period.

208
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,360
 9,000 law enforcement officers spread around the world, hit up 700 different locations,

209
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,660
 arrest 800 people within a 48-hour period.

210
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,360
 They seized 32 tons of drugs, 48 million dollars in various currencies.

211
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,060
 50 different drug labs shut down around the world in a 48-hour period,

212
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,360
 including the largest clandestine lab in Germany history.

213
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,760
 It was a worldwide bust, June 8th, 2021.

214
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,660
 So how did the FBI...

215
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,260
 This is...

216
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,960
 I love this story.

217
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,960
 How did the FBI break Anom?

218
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,160
 In-crow chat had just got broken earlier this year.

219
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,460
 Did they use the same tools?

220
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,860
 Was there the same sort of development kit between In-crow chat and Anom?

221
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,860
 It turns out a couple of years ago, there were some American law enforcement officers in Australia.

222
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,360
 And they were talking to their counterparts in Australia, just sitting back during a couple beers at a bar.

223
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,060
 And they were talking about this problem of these In-crow chat type things, these anonymous services for criminals.

224
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,560
 They started talking about these encrypted services that criminals are starting to use.

225
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,660
 And they began kind of thinking about it and joking about it.

226
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,960
 And they go, "What if we started one?"

227
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:16,160
 Anom was 100% fully designed, funded and distributed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States.

228
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,860
 They developed this app.

229
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,060
 Gave their phone, gave a bunch of...

230
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,560
 Turned their undercover agents into a distribution team.

231
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,860
 They heard who the top dogs were on all these different levels.

232
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,360
 They knew who they followed the criminal influencers on criminal gram.

233
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
 They distributed these phones.

234
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,460
 They sold them.

235
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,860
 They did tech support on them.

236
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,460
 From day one, the FBI was immediately monitoring all of these communications that these people were like,

237
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,760
 "Dude, this thing is so encrypted. Nobody knows where I'm at right now.

238
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,160
 Look at me." And he's like stepping on a witness's face.

239
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 I caught this guy. He was a rat.

240
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,960
 It turns out, and I wonder if this is what prompted them to make the raid on June 8th,

241
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,260
 because they had been following...

242
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,460
 This program's been out since 2018.

243
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,160
 They stopped a bunch of murders.

244
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,460
 They stopped a bunch of murders.

245
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,260
 And I'm sure there were probably other murders in the previous three years.

246
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,960
 People are now upset about...

247
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,560
 They're like, "Hey, you could have stopped my nephew's murder."

248
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,960
 But they were talking about a family of five was about to get slaughtered, and the agents came in,

249
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
 removed the family, arrested everyone.

250
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,260
 And people are really pissed at the influencers too now.

251
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,960
 Because it becomes part of a thing like, one,

252
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,060
 the FBI got you or whatever jurisdiction you're in, because this was a worldwide thing.

253
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,860
 But then you're also mad at the people who said, "Hey, dude, why don't you talk about all those crimes

254
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,360
 on this really cool, secure app called Enom?"

255
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,060
 There's a criminal right now.

256
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,360
 Sorry, alleged criminal.

257
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,560
 He hasn't been convicted yet, but his name is Hakon Ayik.

258
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,660
 He's a drug trafficker.

259
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,260
 Alleged drug trafficker.

260
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,460
 Australia's trying to get him.

261
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,860
 He's in Turkey.

262
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,660
 In this article, the Australian authorities are openly taunting him.

263
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,660
 They go, "Hey! Hey, Hakon, hey! Remember when you gave all the people the Enom app?

264
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
 Because we know that you did that?

265
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,860
 Because we were the Enom app, and we have all those messages of you?

266
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,460
 Yeah, you should turn yourself into us.

267
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,760
 Because trust us, there's a lot of people who are after you right now

268
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,560
 that don't want to put handcuffs on you.

269
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,360
 Or if they do want to put handcuffs on you, it doesn't end with you in a cell having three hots and a cot.

270
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
 So the influencers who are like, "Oh, yeah, this is totally dope."

271
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,560
 They're the ones that weren't arrested.

272
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,560
 They probably should turn themselves into authorities, because I imagine a lot of people are really pissed off.

273
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,960
 That story is so fascinating to me, because I always, for me, I know a lot of people love the true crime

274
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,460
 stuff like the serial killers and stuff like that.

275
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,660
 To me, it's always about the constant one-upping of law enforcement in the criminal world.

276
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,060
 That, to me, is more interesting than Ted Bundy stuff.

277
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,560
 I mean, I guess that stuff's interesting in the beginning, but you heard it once.

278
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,960
 You heard it a thousand times. All the serial killers are the same.

279
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,460
 This is an on-go, and it will continue to see this.

280
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,860
 This on-going escalation between law enforcement and the criminal underworld, and it's so fascinating to watch.

281
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,160
 The other day I was in a local gift shop. I was walking around with Sabine.

282
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,260
 They had a little sign up in their shop saying, "No photographs."

283
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,660
 "No photographs of any of the items."

284
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,560
 And I asked the shopkeeper, "Hey, what's that picture for?"

285
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,160
 And she goes, "Oh, you know, this is kind of weird, but what people have been doing?"

286
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,360
 Apparently, this is something that's been going on, because I thought maybe you'd have people looking stuff up on Amazon,

287
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,260
 which people do do that. They're going to a shop, they're looking for stuff on Amazon,

288
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,660
 they'll leave and they'll buy on Amazon.

289
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,760
 And I think I didn't mention that. She goes, "No, what we actually have that sign up for?"

290
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,360
 It's because this is kind of a hoity-toity gift shop.

291
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,860
 She goes, "We've had problems with this, and law enforcement has said this."

292
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:46,360
 People will go into shops. They'll tell their drug dealer, "Hey, I will get you some stuff for in exchange for drugs."

293
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,560
 It used to just be that you would shoplift things from Walmart and then take them and you would pawn them for, you know, pennies on a dollar.

294
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,260
 Now, the drug dealer will say, "I want like this game and I want this Xbox controller,

295
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,860
 and I want these candles for my girlfriend, and that's what you steal."

296
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,860
 So you get more money, because if you're just stealing random stuff, they'll say,

297
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,260
 "Oh, I'll give you a couple bucks for all of this."

298
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,960
 But if it's something they really want, they really want that candleabra.

299
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,460
 I mean, it's an interesting thing. Again, that escalation of crime and technology,

300
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,160
 I didn't understand. I still don't understand what's at a gift store, right?

301
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
 Like, this is like I said, like it's a high-falutin gift store.

302
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,160
 So it's not like anyone's coming in there to get like scented candles.

303
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,960
 Like, what drug? It's the most aromatheraputic drug dealer in town.

304
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,060
 He's just taking bubble baths all day long.

305
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,360
 But anyway, so yeah, the technology in the criminal world and the police trying to outsmart them,

306
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,860
 that to me is the most interesting part of true crime.

307
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,460
 Serial killer.

308
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
 Dime it doesn't.

309
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,760
 Unfortunately, right? There's a lot of them.

310
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,560
 But we still covered the unusual ones.

311
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,260
 Like we did on Monday. That story was really, really creepy.

312
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,860
 You should check that one out. I'll put it in the show notes, but...

313
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,860
 I like that stuff as well, but it needs to be a little spookified.

314
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,260
 Speaking of spookified, let's go ahead and move on to our final story of the season.

315
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,060
 Big bug. I'm gonna toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

316
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,960
 We are leaving behind this drug den. It's in ruins.

317
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,460
 The police have raided the place. We caught all the drugs. We stole all the drugs.

318
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,460
 We're gonna sell them and we're gonna fund my vacation that I'm gonna be taking.

319
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,760
 But for now, before we commit multiple felonies, fly us on out to

320
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,460
 Litmanova Slocavia.

321
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,560
 [imitates a song]

322
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,160
 This story is interesting. It may offend some people.

323
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,560
 But I hope you stick with me.

324
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,660
 I actually end up offending you more the longer the episode goes, but...

325
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,360
 I have a theory.

326
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,160
 We're in Litmanova Slocavia.

327
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,360
 It's August 5th, 1991.

328
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,560
 It's 6 p.m. It's quite early in the evening.

329
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,760
 And there's three girls staying overnight in a cabin up on a hill.

330
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,460
 The rest of their families are back in town. They're not terribly far away.

331
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,760
 But this is a nice time for these three girls to be just spending some time together.

332
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,360
 We don't have the ages of them. The fact that they're alone on the hill, I would...

333
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,160
 I mean, if they weren't goalie, they could be any age.

334
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,160
 But I'm assuming they're probably like late teens, early 20s, somewhere in there.

335
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 We have Katka Seslokova.

336
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,660
 Ivatekka Korkakova. And Mikaluis Seskala.

337
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,260
 They're sitting outside the cabin right now. They have a little bonfire going.

338
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,460
 They're just enjoying each other's company. And then off in the forest, they hear a...

339
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,160
 [snoring]

340
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,860
 They don't hear Donald Duck. They don't hear Donald Duck coming.

341
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,960
 They hear a crackling sound in the forest.

342
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,360
 You know, it starts off soft. It's in the distance.

343
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,460
 They're not really thinking anything of it, but it starts to get louder.

344
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,560
 It starts to get closer.

345
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,960
 But they don't see what could be causing this noise. It's starting to scare them.

346
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,060
 So they go inside their cabin.

347
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,760
 They seek the shelter of their cabin, and they lock the door, and they're just sitting in there.

348
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,960
 And they're like, "What do you think that noise was?" I don't know.

349
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,460
 And then they hear...

350
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,060
 [humming]

351
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,960
 That is... [laughing]

352
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,960
 If you couldn't place the sound of that, if you don't have amazing ears, you're gonna be like,

353
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,660
 "This isn't the sound like that at all, Jason. It sounds like you're about to start singing.

354
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,860
 Rock and Robin."

355
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,360
 They heard the sound of rattling tin outside of the door.

356
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,760
 And that noise is getting louder and louder as well.

357
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,760
 [humming]

358
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,060
 And so anyways, then...

359
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,560
 Boom!

360
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,760
 They hear the sound of something slam against the door.

361
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,760
 And they said the force of it and the loudness of it...

362
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,660
 To them, it felt like someone was up on a nearby hill and threw something really, really heavy at the door.

363
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,260
 Like, it was just a forceful impact at the door.

364
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:02,660
 So these three girls get on their knees, and they begin to pray to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

365
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,360
 So this is the part where you might start getting offended. I apologize.

366
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,760
 This is just such a bizarre story.

367
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,360
 They begin praying to the Virgin Mary, and a glow begins to appear in the middle of this cabin.

368
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,060
 [humming]

369
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:25,160
 There's this illuminated figure now standing in their cabin, and is the Blessed Virgin Mary.

370
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:32,460
 She's standing in this cabin, and she walks over to the girls and she stands there as if she's listening to their prayers.

371
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,760
 She's described as, you would imagine the Virgin Mary to look like.

372
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,960
 A white dress, blue cloak, and a blue transparent veil was covered in her face.

373
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,560
 She also had a crown in her hand. She held the rosary.

374
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:55,260
 Now, you would think the girls would feel protected by this maternal figure. The maternal figure, really!

375
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,860
 They're hearing all this horrible stuff outside. They prayed to the Virgin Mary, and now she is here.

376
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:09,860
 But instead, these girls become overwhelmed with intense fear.

377
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:19,660
 They run past this apparition of the Virgin Mary, run out the front door, and begin running back to their town.

378
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,760
 [panting]

379
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,760
 They're running through the wilderness, back to their homes, and that's when one of them turns around.

380
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,060
 The Virgin Mary is chasing them.

381
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:39,960
 They say that no matter how fast they were running, she was only two steps behind them.

382
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
 I do have to say this as a commentary. I don't know, because it's totally different.

383
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:51,760
 I don't know if she was floating after them, which would be interesting, or she was running, which would be weird, right?

384
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,060
 Because whenever we think of seeing Jesus, you never expect to see him moving.

385
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,660
 Because we never see him move. We've seen him move in movies, but that's not really him.

386
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,760
 But you know what I mean? Imagine right now that you're standing there, and then Jesus is in your room,

387
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,360
 and he's like, "I'm so sorry you're going through this horrible stuff," and maybe he puts his hand on your shoulder.

388
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,360
 And you're like, "Dude, I'm Nathan! What are you doing here?" And he's like, "But I love everybody."

389
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:24,760
 But then, if Jesus goes, "I'm trying not to be super offensive," but if then you go, "Jesus, thank you so much for coming here.

390
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,660
 You really put a lot of peace in my heart. You want to walk down a 7-11?" And he's like, "Sure.

391
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,860
 Would you imagine him walking next to you? Or would you imagine him floating, which would get a lot of attention, right?

392
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,460
 Or do you not imagine him at all?" But it's like, it's weird, because when you imagine a religious icon, think about Buddha.

393
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,960
 Would you imagine him like, you know, going for a jog, and you're like waving at him, you're like, "Hey, Buddha."

394
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,060
 "Jason, come on, you're already turning the Virgin Mary into a horror villain. Do you really need to involve the Buddhist in this as well?"

395
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,260
 My point is, is that I think we venerate these figures so much.

396
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:05,260
 I think even if you're not a Christian or a Buddhist or something like that, it would be weird to see Jesus walking down the street.

397
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,560
 I mean, obviously, I mean, that would obviously, it would be soul-shattering to anyone.

398
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,660
 You'd be like, "Oh my God, the stories are real." But you imagine him floating.

399
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,560
 I guess I've never ever thought of the Mary. I've never thought of Virgin Mary walking.

400
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,760
 Because it seems so mundane. But anyways, back to this story, like, "Jason, we don't care about that."

401
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:32,260
 These girls are being pursued by Jesus's mom. What are you going off on this tangent?

402
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,460
 These girls are indeed being pursued by Jesus's mom.

403
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,760
 They're running through the hills, and she's following them. She is right on their heels.

404
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,160
 And this is making the girls get even more scared.

405
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,360
 They're running, and they see a road. The girls see a road, and the first girl runs past the road.

406
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,460
 "Yo!" The second girl runs past the road. She doesn't make that weird noise Jason made.

407
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,760
 I don't know why she made that. The third girl runs past the road and Mary's right behind her.

408
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:07,160
 But as the third girl's crossing the road, there's one of those roadside crosses as a memorial for someone who died in an accident.

409
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:13,760
 And Mary stops and gets on her knees and begins praying in front of the cross.

410
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,560
 The girls look back and they're like, "Okay, good. We're going to be able to lose her now."

411
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,860
 They're like quick to the cemetery that's running around all the crosses.

412
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,460
 They actually are able to... Basically, throwing a four-leaf clover at the leprechaun.

413
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,460
 She had to stop. I'm going, "I'm sorry for all the subscribers that have already quit the show."

414
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,260
 Describing the Blessed Virgin Mary, comparing her to Warwick Davis' leprechaun.

415
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,660
 She stops, she prays at the cross. The three girls run home.

416
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,360
 When they look back, the Virgin Mary is no longer chasing them.

417
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,460
 But then this is so creepy. This is like a horror movie.

418
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,460
 And if you've not shut off the podcast, I will redeem myself in a second.

419
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,460
 The girls run home. They shut the door. They lock it. The parents are like, "What? Why are you guys all sweaty?"

420
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,260
 The girls look and they start looking out the window. They're trying to see if they can see this apparition.

421
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,160
 They look and they see standing outside of one of their uncle's houses.

422
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,960
 So they're looking the distance. They see this house.

423
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:25,260
 And there, the Virgin Mary is just standing in the darkness across the street, staring at them.

424
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,160
 I got this story from, think about it, docs.com.

425
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,160
 They got it from a book called Catholic Apparitions, I believe, or Apparitions of the Catholic Face.

426
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,460
 Something like that. I don't have it in my notes, unfortunately.

427
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,860
 But I got it from, think about it, docs.com. The link will be in the show notes.

428
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,660
 This is a fascinating story because I don't think that was the Blessed Virgin Mary.

429
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,360
 I don't think that was her. Now, it could have been, but I think if it was,

430
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,060
 I think she would be like, "Maybe I should stop chasing these girls. I'm obviously scaring them."

431
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,460
 So this is my hypothesis. Let's put on our conspiracy caps here.

432
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:07,760
 Let's say that this wasn't the Virgin Mary because that is not normal Virgin Mary apparition behavior.

433
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,160
 For most parts, she doesn't move. Most of these apparitions don't move.

434
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,660
 It's about bringing peace into your heart. It's about protecting you.

435
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,060
 People can gauge other people's reactions and this would seem out of character for the Blessed Virgin Mary

436
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,160
 to be chasing children through the darkness. Floating or on foot doesn't matter.

437
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,460
 And then standing there at a neighbor's house just staring at them.

438
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,760
 Those are all things we would put with a creature.

439
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,960
 So my question is this. Can a demonic force, which is how this story started off,

440
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,760
 noise in the wood that gets closer, it terrifies the girl, it's trying to bang down the door,

441
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,260
 it's outside the door, it's making this sound like metal is shaking,

442
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,860
 can a demonic force disguise itself as a holy figure?

443
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,460
 Because if that's possible, then all bets are off, right?

444
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:11,260
 The part of me, the believer of the Christian faith, would say,

445
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,960
 "Well, you know, it's an interesting question because obviously there's, I'm Southern Baptist,

446
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,060
 so there's a difference between the way the Protestants view icons and the way Catholicism views icons

447
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,760
 and then you have the way Islam views icons and things like that."

448
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,360
 So you have that difference there, but could a...

449
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,160
 And we can even broaden this out because what if this wasn't demonic? What if this was alien?

450
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,060
 Because you could easily say no, Jason. The fact that demonic is anti-Christ,

451
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,260
 it's against God's message. It's literally like fallen angels that are being punished by God.

452
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:50,060
 No, a demonic force could not disguise itself as Mary or Jesus or God or the Holy Spirit.

453
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:56,460
 But then on the other hand, could it disguise itself as Moses or Noah or Samson or King David

454
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,560
 or any of these other biblical figures? You'd be like, "Dude, who's that demon?"

455
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,960
 He's dressed up like Paul from the Apostles. You're like, "Who's that?"

456
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,260
 He's like, "Dude, go to Bible school. That's why I'm possessing you because you don't go to Bible school."

457
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,460
 "What would be off limits to a demon? Could it assume the figure of Jesus?"

458
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,760
 And when you're in your darkest moment, you have this vision of Jesus and he's like counseling you,

459
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,160
 but it's really ball-beareth. And he's like, "It's kind of where Jesus keeps telling you

460
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,760
 to sacrifice that kitten at midnight." You're like, "But it is Jesus!"

461
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,160
 Like at what point, if religious figures are impossible for demons to impersonate,

462
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,360
 what would be the cutoff? Could they become Delilah? Could they become like bad people in the Bible?

463
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,860
 Could they become Nebuchadnezzar? So we have that, but then let's broaden it out.

464
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,360
 What if it wasn't a demon? What if it was an alien?

465
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,660
 What if this was some sort of alien force that they was trying to get into these girls' house

466
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:56,660
 to do alien stuff, and it-- aliens in the lore have telepathic powers and they hear these prayers

467
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,760
 and they go, "Oh, they want this icon figure. We know what it looks like because we're reading their minds.

468
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,660
 I will appear as that figure." But then that makes the girls even-- See, the key is, is like we've--

469
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,960
 There's tons of stories about people seeing the apparition of the Virgin Mary,

470
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,560
 but this is the only one I've ever seen where the girls immediately freak out and try to outrun her.

471
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,260
 So it's like the girls knew that it wasn't her.

472
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,060
 The girls instinctively knew that this was not the Virgin Mary.

473
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,360
 Could an alien-- I-- We have two questions, so the first question would be,

474
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,760
 "Could anything impersonate?" 'Cause you could say, "No, Jason, those figures are so holy."

475
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,660
 But then we have actors portray them. So I don't think that would wash.

476
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:48,160
 Now, see, it's interesting 'cause in the Islamic tradition, you cannot have a portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.

477
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,160
 You can't do that. You can't have images of Allah. You can't have images of the Prophet Muhammad.

478
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,060
 So you can't-- They don't have actors portray them.

479
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,460
 They don't have actors portray them. They don't have pictures of them in their houses and that's part of their tradition.

480
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:08,360
 But because we-- And here's the other interesting thing. I know Jesus does not look like the paintings of Jesus.

481
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,860
 Like, I know that. But when I think of Jesus, that's who I think of.

482
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,860
 I told you guys about the nightmare I had a long time ago that really, really freaked me out.

483
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,960
 It was just a normal dream. But at the ending, there was an--

484
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:28,660
 On my door and I opened the door and Satan was wearing Jesus Christ's face.

485
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,160
 Like, he had cut his face off like leather face.

486
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,960
 And the eyeballs were gouged out and he had on this leather--

487
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,660
 Cut he had on this face that was like stapled to the devil's face with the beard and everything.

488
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,660
 And the devil did this little tap dance in front of me. He had these two giant, like, goon bodyguards.

489
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:52,060
 He's the enemy behind him and the devil did this little tap dance and I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs.

490
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,360
 I was screaming in the dream. I woke myself up screaming.

491
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,060
 But even that version of-- Even that skinned version of Jesus' face

492
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:09,160
 was the traditional painting of Jesus, which I believe was actually modeled after the artist's son or nephew.

493
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,760
 Like, there was a real guy who looked like him. It wasn't Jesus.

494
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
 But it's interesting because I don't care what he looks like.

495
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,260
 Like, Kanye West famously said, "I'm not here to argue about his facial features."

496
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,160
 Like, that's not the message of Jesus. But when you think of Jesus, that's what you think of.

497
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,660
 So if something was going to appear to me as Jesus,

498
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,260
 he would most likely take that form if it wasn't really Jesus.

499
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,860
 But if the real Jesus came down, would I recognize him?

500
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,760
 Isn't that a Joan Osborn song? What if God was one of us?

501
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,860
 My point is, is that-- What is the point?

502
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,960
 Okay, no, the point is, is this. There's a whole bunch of questions here.

503
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,960
 I guess it's really up to you. I'd love to hear what you guys say.

504
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,260
 Kanye-- And let's-- I think an alien could--

505
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,360
 Because an actor can portray a religious figure in the Christian faith.

506
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,760
 We've seen people portray the Virgin Mary. We've seen people portray Jesus.

507
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,960
 We've seen even people portray God. Actors.

508
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,660
 So I think an alien could as well.

509
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:15,260
 Could a demon? Could he-- Something that is the antithesis of the Holy Word?

510
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,360
 Like, it seeks out to destroy-- If could it disguise itself as a religious figure?

511
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,760
 And if it could, that's really, really bad.

512
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,560
 Because then, who do you know to trust?

513
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,260
 If you're praying-- I remember being told really early in my life as a Christian,

514
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,760
 because I grew up in the church, my dad was a minister--

515
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,360
 Satan hears your prayers too.

516
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,860
 That's really scary to tell a seven-year-old, right? But it's true.

517
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,260
 Satan hears your prayers too, and you may be praying for something that you don't need.

518
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,460
 It's going to be harmful for you. Well, he can hear him too.

519
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,960
 He can answer those prayers. But they're not going to be good for you.

520
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,660
 I guess the cautious answer is yes.

521
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,960
 Demons could disguise themselves as holy figures.

522
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,260
 And it is up to us to determine that on a case-by-case basis.

523
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,660
 I know we all see religious figures on a daily basis.

524
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,360
 We're like, "That's not Job. Who's he? Jonah? He's going to swallow by a whale?

525
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,160
 Ah, Jonah. Always having fun in the digestive juices of that giant creature."

526
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,460
 I mean, it's not something that we'll probably ever come across.

527
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,160
 How many of us get to see religious figures?

528
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,460
 But if you do ever find yourself face-to-face with what most would consider a miracle,

529
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,260
 trust your gut. These girls did.

530
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,660
 This story could have easily ended with three girls mysteriously vanishing.

531
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,660
 They went up to the cabin for a night and never came back.

532
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,060
 Something happened to them, and no one could ever figure out what it was.

533
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,960
 But these three girls, even though they were praying to the Virgin Mary,

534
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,360
 and the Virgin Mary appeared, they knew something wasn't right.

535
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,160
 They ran home.

536
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,060
 Although now that I'm thinking about it, why, if it was a demon,

537
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,160
 why would it have stopped and prayed at the cross?

538
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,960
 Like, you think it would have kicked it over?

539
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,460
 Was that really the apparition of the Virgin Mary?

540
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,060
 Was she really chasing these kids?

541
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,460
 Because that's almost creepier, right?

542
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,060
 Part of my-- This isn't how I expected it in the episode.

543
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,560
 You guys could probably tell I was wrapping up to a scary ending.

544
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,460
 Maybe she was running after them to protect them from something worse.

545
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,260
 I don't know. The story is so weird.

546
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,360
 The story is just weird, and it's not something that we normally--

547
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,760
 It's not something that I've ever seen before.

548
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,160
 I've seen-- We obviously come across stories of people being protected by religious figures,

549
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,260
 like the kids in Miami, kids in Miami fighting the demonic army.

550
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,360
 That was a really cool episode.

551
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,260
 Put it in the show notes, but...

552
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,760
 Was she chasing them to make sure something worse than to get them in the woods?

553
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,160
 Why was she staring at them from the darkness?

554
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,360
 It's a mystery, I guess.

555
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,760
 And what a better way to end season 14 than with a mystery.

556
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,560
 There's no spooky wrap-up.

557
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,860
 There's no wrap-up at all. It's just me saying there's a mystery.

558
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,160
 But sometimes that is the only way to end an episode.

559
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,460
 And a season.

560
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,160
 But I will be back on July 18th for an Alien Invasion special.

561
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,360
 Right now I'm gonna go play Just Cause 3.

562
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,860
 I just bought Far Cry 4.

563
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,160
 I'm gonna have a great vacation.

564
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
 You guys have a lot of fun as well.

565
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,560
