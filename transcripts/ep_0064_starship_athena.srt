1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Can you die from a lack of sleep?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 And is Earth protected by the greatest starship in the galaxy?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 I'm your host Jason Carvinder. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I got my pop filter in the mail.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 You know, I've had to ditch whole episodes because the P-sounds, the plosives were just way too insane.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And they annoy me just editing it.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And I've thought, "People aren't going to want to listen to this."

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I've ditched some of the times when episodes have ended up late.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I was just like, "I have to redo it."

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 But now I've got a pop filter, so I don't have to worry about that.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 However, this is actually also the second draft of an episode.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Because I realized something.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I recorded the whole episode probably about an hour ago.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And the stories were, like I said,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 "Can you die from lack of sleep?"

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 "And is there a starship protecting Earth?"

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And I had just started the editing process and realized that the first story can be answered in about two minutes.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Not ten, like I rambled on the first draft.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 So let's get down to brass tacks.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 "Can you die from lack of sleep?"

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 No.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 On to the next story.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I mean, it was that clear.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 There's some science saying that you can die from lack of sleep,

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 but no human's ever been recorded to die of lack of sleep.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 We find that mice can die from lack of sleep because sleep helps regulate temperature.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So if you aren't getting enough sleep, we know that mice die.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But they don't really know why.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 They think it's because they get too cold.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 But there have been people, there was a kid who did, for a science fair,

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 didn't sleep for ten days.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 He was fine.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 People have had head injuries and they've never slept.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 They're entire lives.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So that's kind of end of that story.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I'm going to include all the resources below because there are some interesting tidbits.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Like the RMEs come up with a way to beat Insomnia.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 We'll have that below.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And just about people who have never slept.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 There's some short little Wikipedia pages about them,

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 but not ten minutes worth.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Not ten minutes worth.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I was really pushing that.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And I was like, "Yeah."

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 "So can you die of lack of sleep?"

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 No.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 That's what science is saying at least now.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So you're going, "Well, Jason, are you going to spend the next twenty minutes talking about the Starship?"

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 No, I'm not.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I'm actually going to move on to another topic.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 This is one that's on the conspiracy iceberg list.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 It's one that people have personally requested because it's so odd

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 and it kind of goes against what we know of.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And this one actually will take a while to talk about.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And that is the extreme health benefits of nicotine.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Now let me say something right off the bat.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Nicotine and tobacco are two different things.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And we generally look at chewing tobacco and cigarette smoking as nicotine delivery vehicles.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But that's not what we're going to be talking about in this episode.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Really, when we talk about the health benefits of nicotine,

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 they're talking about nicotine patches, nicotine lozenges, and nicotine gum.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Now, if you've listened to the show early on, I talked about how I used to chew tobacco and then I stopped.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I actually started again about a month ago.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And it totally sucks.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I realized what my trigger is.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It's for whatever weird reason, doing plays during the summer.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Every summer, I'm constantly acting up here in Hood River doing theater.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And I've always not chewed like for the past couple of years.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'll quit in the fall, in the winter, in the spring,

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 and then I'll start chewing again in the middle of the summer during a show.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Again, I do shows all the time.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So I figured out what my trigger is.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 I've set my quit date.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 It's the 18th of September.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So just a couple of days off, about a week off,

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 and I've already bought my last can of chew and all that stuff.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Because for me, it's not a health thing.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's just a waste of money.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 For me, $7 a can is just way too much money.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So I've said, I'm going to quit chewing by the 18th.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Probably maybe a little bit before that, but I bought my last can.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I'm ready to go on that.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Now, when we talk about the health benefits of nicotine,

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 we should start off by saying that there are some obvious downsides to it.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And then we'll get into all of the benefits because there's a ton of them.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And again, this isn't an excuse to go out and buy cigarettes or to keep smoking

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 or to keep chewing or anything like that.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Obviously, the downfalls is that nicotine is addictive.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 It's very addictive, but like any drug, it can be kicked.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's just the withdrawal period is very long.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 The nicotine stays in your system for about three days,

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 and the initial withdrawal process is about seven days.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And then you'll kind of have this ebb and flow of withdrawals for about 15 to 30 days off from that.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I'm fairly lucky that when I quit nicotine, when I do it right,

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 because what I do is I generally like I've done this three times now,

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I'll taper off with that last can, and then I'll spend three days in blissful perfection.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Like my body's rewarding me with endorphins for stop taking the nicotine.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 My blood vessels are all working better and everything like that.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And you go, Jason, why don't you quit now?

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Because I have a process and the process works.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I've tried just saying that last can I chewed.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I'm never chewing again.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I have this process where I have to like taper off that last can.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I have to basically say goodbye to it.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It's an addiction.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So that's one downside to it.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 The other downside to it is that nicotine doesn't necessarily cause cancer,

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 but it causes existing cancer to grow more rapidly.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 So if you've had cancer in the past, they don't recommend nicotine therapy,

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 or really nicotine at all.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And if you have a tumor now, it'll just make it grow quicker.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 The nicotine itself doesn't cause cancer.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 The carcinogens in the tobacco, in the processing of the tobacco, definitely can,

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 but the nicotine itself doesn't.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So nicotine can make cancer grow quicker, so that's a bad side, and it's addictive.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 The good sides are numerous.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And you know, doctors, scientists have said,

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 "How can we...?"

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 They want to research more with nicotine, because the benefits are so good.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But the FDA is like, "Well, you know, we don't want your patient smoke and cigarettes."

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And so they have to make that divide in line.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 The FDA is really not going...

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Nicotine replacement therapy, like the losange and the gum and stuff like that,

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 is approved for getting you off of tobacco.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 The FDA has not really said it can be used for these other things,

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 so scientists really haven't been able to research it.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But it has been shown to reduce not only the symptoms of Parkinson's,

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 but actually getting Parkinson's, the way that it affects your brain,

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 can help people with Parkinson's, people who are prone to it, not even get it.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 It is a...it affects the brain, it releases dopamine and serotonin.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 It will...again, I don't want to try...

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 This is a lot of someone would say this.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I'm not talking about cigarettes or chewing tobacco or snus or snuff or anything like that.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 I'm talking about nicotine replacement therapy.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But in the right doses, it can affect...help with depression.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Depression is a leading factor in the development of Parkinson's.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It can affect inflammation.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It actually is an anti-inflammatory as well.

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 One thing I noticed that when I stopped chewing,

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I'll start to notice painful parts of my body, because I'm 41 years old,

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 and I've put out my body through a lot of trauma, begin to hurt and ache again.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And that's because I no longer have that anti-inflammatory in my system, 18 hours a day.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 It affects estrogen, so if you're worried about being a soy boy,

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 it can actually help with that.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It's also been...there's one study among women, not about the estrogen here,

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 one study among women says that if they're given morphine and nicotine,

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 their pain is at a lower level than if they're just given morphine and a placebo,

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 so they feel that it has some pain reduction issues.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It can actually decrease the susceptibility to Crohn's disease, ulcer... ulcer-terative colitis.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I don't know how to pronounce that, but I think you know what I mean.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Because it helps reduce inflammation.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It can help with Alzheimer's.

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It can help with ADHD.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It can help with things like fine motor skills, alerting the tension, short-term memory, long-term memory.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's listed almost as a new tropic at this point, a drug that can be used to enhance the brain beyond its normal limit.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 It increases...it says that it puts users into the alpha brain wave state,

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 creating effortless alertness, attention, creativity.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 You know, it's funny, I remember when I used to be a musician, I was standing outside waiting for...

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I was doing this open mic thing and I was standing outside waiting for my turn to go on,

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 and I thought, "This is why musicians smoke."

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Because so much of it is...there's so much downtime when you're waiting to go on.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 You got...you got your guys going up and doing their soundcheck stuff,

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 you're waiting for the club to open, whatever, and so you just start smoking.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I never had a problem with smoking.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I used to smoke cigars a lot back in the day, and I didn't have any trouble giving that up,

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 but nicotine on its own is less addictive than tobacco.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 That's something that they've pointed out.

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And I'm going to include all these links.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 You could be like, "Jayce, you're just spouting off stuff. You have no proof of it."

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And I'll post all these links and they source everything, but really, it works more than we think it does.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 They say that it helps people with depression, again, because of the serotonin boost.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 It can actually make you depressed if you stop taking it,

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and that kind of goes for any sort of drug that you're taking for depression.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 But they say the reason why it makes you depressed is simply the withdrawal process.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Once you're out of the withdrawal process, you're no more depressed than you were originally.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So we have a drug here that helps your physical body.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It helps your guts, helps reduce inflammation in your stomach when you have stuff like Crohn's.

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And like I said, it can even delay the onset of Crohn's.

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 If you have it, it can help with Crohn's.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It can delay the onset of Parkinson's.

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 If you have it, it can make the symptoms of Parkinson's less.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So it can help with the body. It can help with the brain.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It can make you more alert.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Helping making you more creative, that seems very subjective to me,

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 but they're saying that it basically works on those parts of the brain.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 It would be interesting to see if society does a switch and says, "Tobacco bad nicotine good."

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Because yes, nicotine is an addictive substance, but we take a lot of addictive substances

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 because we outweigh the addictiveness with the benefits.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Coffee is being a perfect one, or caffeine being a perfect one.

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 It is addictive, but it causes alertness in the morning and it has a pleasant flavor, so we take that trade off.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Nicotine, I guess, also should say is that one of the problems is that it does constrict your blood vessels.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It's a constrictor.

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So if you have heart problems, it's not the best thing to take.

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But again, that may go more with the dosage.

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 When they're talking about nicotine lossanges, they're talking like one a day or two a day.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 They're not talking about someone who's trying to quit smoking where they're taking them all the time.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 They would prescribe, if this goes forward, they could prescribe you a lossage like a normal pill.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 You take it when you wake up and you get all these benefits because the nicotine is in your system.

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I don't know if that will ever happen.

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 People have a real hard time with nicotine because it's tied to big tobacco.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 One of the weird things I've seen in my life is that when I was growing up, there was this huge push against secondhand smoke.

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 They're like, "Secondhand smoke kills. You're going to get cancer. Your kids are going to get emphysema.

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's bad for the environment. People have to breathe it in."

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 They were like, "When I grew up, you could go to a restaurant and they would have smoking, non-smoking."

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Then you could smoke at work or in bars.

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 They said, "No, you can't smoke at bars. You have to smoke outside."

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Then they said, "No, you've got to smoke 20 feet away and you can't smoke on a plane, you can't smoke in an airport, government building, all this stuff."

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Because secondhand smoke kills people.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 The numbers on that are a little rusty, honestly.

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 But they're saying secondhand smoke is a health hazard.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Even if you don't smoke, it's not fair for the other people to breathe that in.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 So they invented vaping.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 They go, "Okay, we will invent something that will completely get rid of secondhand smoke."

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 We have this new thing called vape. It is vaporized nicotine.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You breathe out water vapor.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 There is no health problem for anyone at all and it's just pure nicotine for the most part.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And it's going to give you the health benefits of nicotine and it won't affect anyone at all.

221
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And they said, "Nope, can't do that either. Can't vape in a restaurant, can't vape in a public building, can't vape on a plane."

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 So the issue would never was secondhand smoke.

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 The issue was we don't like nicotine.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 We'll legalize weed and we'll talk about legalizing all these other drugs.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 The only reason why these drugs are illegal is because of misplaced morality.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And if someone wants to do heroin, they totally can.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But don't you vape in Sizzler? That's wrong. It's super bizarre.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I'll meet people who are for the making all drugs legal, but they still don't want someone to vape next to them in a restaurant.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's completely harmless to everyone around them.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So society says, "We don't want this thing."

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Somebody proposed an alternative that fixes the initial problem of the original thing and society goes, "No, not good enough."

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So again, their problem never was secondhand smoke. Their problem was nicotine to begin with.

233
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 So I'd like to see this research go forward, but with that type of mentality, it probably won't.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 People just don't like big tobacco. People just don't like...

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I'm not saying big tobacco is as slimy as they come.

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 But when you offer an alternative product that fixes all of the problems of your original product and you're still saying, "No, no, no."

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Just be honest with us of why you don't like the product in the first place. Don't try to hide it under public health.

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It's a little conspiracy for you.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So health benefits of nicotine. Checked off of the conspiracy iceberg. It's true. There are a lot of benefits to nicotine.

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Just don't chew it or smoke it and take it in reasonable amounts and you may be on the right path to having a better brain, possibly.

241
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Our next story, I kind of stumbled across when I was doing research on the conformers.

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And a couple of people have hit me up and said, "Hey, why don't you use the Wayback machine to look for the information that's been deleted off of the websites talking about the conformers?"

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I've done that a little bit. I haven't had anything conclusive yet, but I'll keep looking around.

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 You know, I know that that one link from UFO Digest, I absolutely know that one link from UFO Digest.

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 The reason why I bookmarked it, because it had information about the conformers.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And when I went to pull it back up, it was gone.

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 So that's the one I'm kind of focusing on the Wayback machine, but I haven't found anything yet.

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So what we're going to talk about is another group of aliens. I had never heard of these guys.

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And it's a fascinating story. Whether or not it's true, it's a very interesting story.

250
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And what we're going to be talking about is the Starship Athena.

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Now, the Starship Athena is the reason why we don't have disclosure.

252
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And it's the reason why we haven't been invaded.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And I think it's an interesting little puzzle piece to the alien story, because it explains two things that people ask.

254
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 The aliens are out there. Why haven't we been invaded? If aliens are out there, why hasn't the government acknowledged it?

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 The Starship Athena is this Starship that's positioned between Saturn and Jupiter.

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And it is the greatest Starship in the galaxy. And that's half true. It is, but it's part of a fleet that is the greatest Starships in the galaxy.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 These aliens are known as the Arcturians. The Arcturians.

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 These are a race of aliens that value spirituality above all else.

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 They're not about material possessions. They're not about conquest. They're about lifting themselves up to a higher spiritual vibration.

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So they can move between the third, fourth, and fifth dimension. Whatever that means. I don't know.

261
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'm not swallowing this all, but I mean, so that's what makes them different than, say, the Grays and the Reptilians.

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And their purpose is what they do is they protect lower species and try to evolve them to the level that they're at.

263
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 They want people to kind of come to them. They're about free will. They're not about...

264
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 They're not... When they compare to the Grays who like abduct people and the Reptilians who supposedly eat people,

265
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 the Arcturians are more like, "We want you to come to us, and in the meantime, we'll protect you from all threats."

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 So the reason why the Grays and the Reptilians haven't done a full-scale invasion of Earth is because they have this massive ship.

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I mean, they're basically the security guards of the Earth's gated community, in a sense.

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 These guys, they're known for having their skins greenish, apparently.

269
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 They have big eyes, three fingers, and they're telepathic. That sounds a lot like a gray, but they're different.

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 They're a different race, apparently.

271
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And they just kind of sit there, and they will accept visitors from time to time.

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I mean, this is where the story gets a little ridiculous. So those initial things, I'm like, "Okay, I can definitely see that."

273
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And then when people are sleeping, they take them up to their spaceship, their souls up to their spaceship,

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 and they repair their souls and all that stuff. I don't know. I mean, once you start getting into kind of the weird mystical stuff, you kind of lose me.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 One thing I think is interesting is that, you know, I've talked before about how alien biology should be different than human biology,

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 because we've evolved on different planets.

277
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Now, when we talk about human spirituality versus alien spirituality, the Gulf would be far more vast than the biological Gulf.

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And here's why. Humans, the way that we're designed biologically is that we are constantly given choices.

279
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 We can indulge or withhold. We can eat eight cheeseburgers today, and then we'll pay for it later on.

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Or we can withhold eating the eight cheeseburgers, and we make that little sacrifice, and we gain something, you know, being overall health.

281
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So every decision we make is something that we're either, it's all about, you know, we either withhold something or we indulge something.

282
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Going back and forth. You can say, "I'm going to sit here and I'm going to play video games for two hours. I'm going to have a lot of fun."

283
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But after the two hours done, you're going to be like, "Oh, man, I kind of like, I should have done, been more productive.

284
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 We can withhold or we can indulge."

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And that's how our religions are set up for the most part.

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Our religions are about self-sacrifice.

287
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Almost every major religion is, "Don't do X now. You'll be rewarded in the afterlife."

288
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Don't indulge now. You'll be rewarded later.

289
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Indulge now, and you'll be punished.

290
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 So we take our, our religions are structured over our, how our biology is.

291
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Now, the Arcturians eat a, a formless goo and they just meditate all the time. They live to be 500 years old, according to these, according, I like how I'm talking about it.

292
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Like I'm reading that in encyclopedia, but I think you see what I mean.

293
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 So if they have a different structure, we have a limited lifespan on the planet Earth.

294
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 It's a constant struggle between, you know, withhold and doldge, withhold and doldge.

295
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 If we lived 500 years, that wouldn't be such an immediate thing.

296
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 But I know that if I overate every single day, I will pay for it within six months to a year.

297
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Maybe, maybe sooner.

298
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 If I live to be 500 years old, that's stretching.

299
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 So I, it's weird. Our religions are based on self-sacrifice.

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 There's a few religions that aren't, Satanism comes to mind.

301
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Satanism is kind of about indulging.

302
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But for the most part, all of our major religions are based on withholding from doing things than being rewarded later on.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 That's completely based on our biology.

304
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So I find it weird that any sort of alien spirituality would be compatible to us in any way.

305
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But apparently that's what these guys are all about.

306
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So what's interesting about the story, like I said, I kind of stumbled across the Starship Athena,

307
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 and I was like, this kind of fills in a couple gaps.

308
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Because again, why don't the aliens just invade us if their technology is so superior?

309
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And there's always been the answers like, the answer I've always given is why would they?

310
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I said on a previous episode, we could invade Mexico, but what would we have to gain from it?

311
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 We can invade the Philippines, but what would we have to gain from it?

312
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And that I kind of applied that to aliens.

313
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They're there, they're completely preventing an invasion.

314
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Any sort of invasion fleet would have to get past them, and because the ship is so advanced, it would just fail.

315
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 So that kind of answers that question.

316
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 If you believe in the existence of aliens coming from other planets or even from other dimensions,

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 and these guys kind of fit into both narratives, then it's there to stop that.

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 But the second question, which I think is more interesting is why, if aliens are real,

319
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 why doesn't the government just do a disclosure for it?

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And the answer to that has always been, well, the US government doesn't want to admit that there's aliens,

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 because then one, they'd have to admit that we had known aliens were here before,

322
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 and that it would cause a huge panic, and people would be like,

323
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 "Oh my God, we're not the superior species on the planet, blah blah blah, why should I worship God?

324
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Why should I go to work?"

325
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 That probably would happen to a segment of society, and I think people would be fearful for quite a while,

326
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 because all of a sudden we're not the superior species.

327
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 But you know, the Vatican has a now, the Vatican has said, "Yeah, there's probably aliens."

328
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 The Vatican actually has one of the best observatories on the planet.

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 So this idea that we're still super irrational, we're pretty irrational,

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 but that we're super irrational, mainstream religions have made a place for ETs in them,

331
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 because they're like, it's kind of going to, they figure mathematically there has to be something else out there.

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So that idea always doesn't wash, but so what the Starship Athena adds to that is the reason why

333
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 the US government can't admit that aliens exist is because not only have they known about them for a while,

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 but the Arcturians, according to the story, Arcturians have contacted the United States government

335
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 and said, "We can help, or any government really, we can help your people, we can help humanity,

336
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 by lifting them up and helping them rise, evolve spiritually."

337
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And so they could also move through the ether, and they could also journey into the fourth and the fifth dimension,

338
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and they could just be healed and loved, and they could just be evolved.

339
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And the Greys are like, "We can sell you weapons."

340
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And the US military is more interested in buying the weapons than making a deal with the Arcturians.

341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Not only would the US government have to say, "Yes, since 1947 we've been in contact with aliens,"

342
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 and they could say, "These are the Greys, and then there's these reptilians over here too,

343
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 and they're in contact with them, and that's all the aliens we know about."

344
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And then the Starship Athena shows up and says, "Hey, actually, the US government's known about us far longer than any of them.

345
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 We made them this offer, they refused it, all they wanted to do was buy weapons."

346
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 So you couldn't disclose. You couldn't disclose because then the Arcturians would get involved,

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 and they'd say, "Hey, hey, what about us? It's not just the Greys and the Reptilians.

348
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 We came here, we offered them spiritual enlightenment, and they wanted weapons."

349
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Now, because the Arcturians don't want to, like I was saying, they're not about foreseeing evolution,

350
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 until we admit that there's aliens, they won't show themselves.

351
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 But once we do, then they can say, "Yeah, you guys really messed up

352
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 and you could have been solving these problems 50, 60 years ago, and they wanted to wage war instead."

353
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Do I believe any of that? Not really. I think it's a fascinating story.

354
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 I think it's as believable as any UFO story I've heard.

355
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I mean, it is. It's not... you know, I've heard dumber UFO stuff.

356
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I think it fills in the gaps. I think it's an interesting story, and that's the thing, like,

357
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 sometimes it's not about... this is going to sound funny, but sometimes it's not about whether or not it's 100% true.

358
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Sometimes it's about adding to the mythology, sometimes it's about adding to the story,

359
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 adding to the overall mythos of the aliens, because it fills in some valuable points.

360
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And it adds a bit of color to it. It adds this kind of silent guardian, this...

361
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 I don't want to say dark knight, that's a little pretentious, but you know, this kind of this force

362
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 that's kind of watching over us, that's keeping us from being overtaken,

363
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 but not someone that we know on a day-to-day basis.

364
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 They're not hyped up in the movies, they're not hyped up on X-Files or anything like that.

365
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 So I think it's an interesting story.

366
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 If someone said, "Jason, would you bet money that these guys are real?"

367
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 No, of course not. I wouldn't bet money that any real UFO sighting was real.

368
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Even if I saw it myself, I probably wouldn't bet money on it.

369
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I'm more of a ghost guy than I am a UFO guy, but...

370
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 I bet money that ghosts are real, actually.

371
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 But that's besides the point. My point is, is that I think it's an interesting story,

372
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 it's an interesting part of the mythos, and again...

373
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Oh, and I do... I should say this, too.

374
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Apparently there's footage of the Starship Athena being caught in a solar flare,

375
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 because they show this solar flare going off, and there's like a black box, a kind of blocking part of it.

376
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It could be a fragment, it could be like a, you know, pixelation, GIF error, things like that.

377
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Again, I don't put so much stock in that.

378
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 But who knows? Who knows?

379
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 A lot of times I poo-poo this alien stuff, but you know who knows?

380
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Again, I think it's a fascinating story, and sometimes, you know, sometimes, like I said,

381
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 you want to hear a good ghost story, and sometimes you want to have proof of ghosts.

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I think this falls more into the line of, "This is an interesting story about aliens,"

383
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 than, "This is 100% proof of aliens," because the truth of the matter is,

384
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 we won't know until they make themselves known.

385
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Other than that, we can just have fun speculating.

386
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
