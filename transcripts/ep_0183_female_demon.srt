1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Is their footage of a guardian angel saving a man's life, or is it something more sinister?

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,820
 And then we take a trip around the world to meet a whole slew of female

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,680
 shapeshifting cryptids that kill you. And yes, this one's interactive today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:26,480
 [music]

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,680
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too, and I sincerely mean that.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,160
 I always hope that you guys are out there having great days.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,840
 Doing fun stuff, I hope today was better than yesterday, and tomorrow will be even better than today.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,880
 And I really mean it.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,440
 So we're gonna go ahead and just jump into the first story here.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,600
 Now the first story may seem a little simple at first, but you're gonna have to hold my hand.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,160
 We're gonna go on this journey.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,760
 There's some viral footage going around right now of what appears to be a guardian angel.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,440
 Now there's a couple details that we don't have, because this happened in Turkey.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,760
 So really, what generally, what is in English, the articles in English?

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,720
 We have security cam footage, which I'll describe to you, because this is a podcast and I can't really show it to you.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,360
 So I'm gonna describe it to you.

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,240
 And then there's an interview with the man involved, but it's in Turkish, and it's not being translated English that I've seen.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,320
 So for all I know, he's saying, "Oh yeah, no, no, it was totally natural. It was my buddy Jimmy."

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,640
 Like, there was nothing paranormal about this.

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,560
 But so I'm relying just on all the articles that have been written about the footage itself.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,160
 So this is what it is.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,120
 We're in Turkey.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,000
 This dude's name is Siddhar.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,680
 And this happened this year.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
 This happened about a month ago.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,320
 His name's Siddhar Beninci.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,960
 Something like that.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,880
 So anyways, Siddhar is closing up his shop. He's doing something at the corner of the camera screen.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,520
 Just fiddling around, right?

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,440
 So Siddhar is standing outside of his shop and it's like an open street.

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,680
 And he's just doing his normal thing.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,440
 And you see a gentleman start walking towards him, just walking down the street towards him.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,240
 And he taps Siddhar on the shoulder and just keeps on walking.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,920
 Seems to say something to him maybe, but doesn't stop.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,040
 At that point, Siddhar starts to turn and a white truck passes him.

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,680
 And then a massive metal gate is swinging right at him.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,200
 And he jumps out of the way.

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,840
 And the gate is this big, heavy gate that basically would have hit him like a baseball across the baseball field.

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,360
 It was coming fast. It was heavy and hard.

41
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,680
 He would have been doomed if that person had not tapped him on the shoulder.

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,160
 And then you see Siddhar kind of look around and try to figure it out.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,480
 Eventually you see the guy who was driving the truck jump out of the truck and move the gate back into the position it was supposed to be in.

44
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,600
 But we don't see the guy who warned him back in frame.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,000
 So again, he gave an interview about this and he could have easily said,

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,320
 "Oh no, no, no, we know that great gate was rusted. This guy's totally aware of that. He was just warning me.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,120
 Man, what a close call. That guy is my guardian angel."

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,000
 But the way it's being played up in the paranormal world is like, then this guy mysteriously disappeared.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,680
 Siddhar had never seen him before and hasn't seen him since.

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,920
 And really we don't know because the interview is in Turkish.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
 But let's go with the idea that this was a paranormal event.

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,920
 If it was a guardian angel who showed up and tapped him on the shoulder and warned him of what was happening,

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,040
 it begs the question of, "Why aren't there more guardian angels out there?"

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,320
 Because for every Siddhar who has a lucky break, who's warned of this gate about to smash him to pieces,

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,880
 there's millions of others who don't and they die in stupid ridiculous ways.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,920
 Falling off ladders, falling off bridges, getting run over by steamrollers,

57
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
 which I think is probably one of the worst, falling in a volcano, lots of falling in my world.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
 Gravity is a supervillain.

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,320
 But where are their guardian angels?

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,520
 Whether or not they show up on film is inconsequential, but where are theirs?

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,600
 And so I came up with the possible theory.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,480
 Now again, let's accept for a second that the way that the media is portraying this is that this was actually a

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
 guardian angel tapping him on the shoulder.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
 Then the question goes is, "Why was he warned and so many other people aren't?"

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,080
 And then I started thinking about it.

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,880
 Just miracles in general.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,880
 And I came up with this conspiracy theory.

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,680
 What if miracles aren't good?

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
 Hold my hand.

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,280
 Go with me on this journey.

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,880
 We're going to take this example exactly here.

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,680
 Siddhar is standing outside of his shop.

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
 And if that gate had hit him, this video would have simply been on LiveLeak.

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,280
 This video would have been on some gore website or it would have been turned into a web M of,

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,880
 "Look at this guy, he got horribly mangled by this giant metal gate."

76
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,280
 And in real life, after everyone gets done watching the video, what happens is Siddhar gets taken to the hospital,

77
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,880
 where he's treated for his injuries and there's a long road to recovery to bring him back to how he was before the accident.

78
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:11,480
 And while he's in this hospital, he makes some friends and he meets a young nurse, a young beautiful nurse.

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,780
 And over the course of months, these people become soulmates.

80
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,980
 They never would have met if it wasn't for this accident.

81
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,180
 They lived in two totally different worlds, but they met now.

82
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,180
 They fall in love.

83
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,880
 They have children.

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,380
 They build a life together.

85
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,780
 And that was the way fate was supposed to be for Siddhar and for the nurse.

86
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,580
 But something said, "No, let's interfere in this."

87
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,680
 And so they stopped the tragic event and Siddhar will go on with the rest of his life,

88
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,080
 having never met the person he was really, truly supposed to be with.

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,380
 What if miracles, what we perceive as miraculous events,

90
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:03,580
 are actually interference from either guardian angels quote unquote, or time travelers?

91
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,180
 What if miracles actually in the long run have a negative impact on the way the world was supposed to be?

92
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,080
 Some force is manipulating it.

93
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,180
 And while we may think in that moment where we barely avoid that horrible car accident

94
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,480
 or the plane safely lands even though the engines were on fire,

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,180
 the reason why we survived that was actually some bizarre punishment,

96
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,080
 something that was keeping us from the life we were truly supposed to have,

97
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,380
 that fate had planned out for us.

98
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,580
 The miracle actually was the bad ending.

99
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,280
 And speaking of bad endings, let's go ahead and move on to our second story.

100
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,980
 Now, our second story is an interactive adventure.

101
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,380
 You're going to pick a number between one and four.

102
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,080
 One and four will decide your fate.

103
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,580
 We're going to travel the world and we're going to look at some unique female sex monsters.

104
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,380
 Now, get your number, write it down, and then throw it away,

105
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,580
 because I'm sure you'll remember any number between one and four,

106
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,280
 but we are now going to travel around.

107
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,980
 We are going to meet these lovely maidens of madness.

108
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:21,880
 First off, we are going to Dominican Republic. So, sexy salsa music.

109
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,980
 That's actually a theme song for something.

110
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,980
 Anyway, sexy salsa music.

111
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,580
 So, we're in Dominican Republic.

112
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,280
 We got sexy salsa music.

113
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,580
 We got sweet, sweet, beautiful women.

114
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,480
 We're walking through the mountains of the Dominican Republic.

115
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,280
 You got your walking stick.

116
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,980
 You got your backpack.

117
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,780
 You got your map.

118
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,080
 You're not Dora, but you are walking through the Dominican Republic.

119
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,480
 And it's dark.

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,580
 The moon is crusted over the mountains.

121
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,180
 And in the faint, beautiful moonlight of the jungle,

122
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,680
 they have jungles down there, right?

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,480
 The jungles down there are just completely illuminated.

124
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,580
 And you see a beautiful woman standing in a,

125
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,080
 what's the thing, the big circle where there's no trees?

126
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,780
 You see her standing in a big circle where there's no, a clearing.

127
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,980
 You see her standing in a clearing.

128
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,780
 This woman is a little bit shorter than the average adult woman.

129
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,480
 That's not the thing.

130
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,080
 It catches your eye, though.

131
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,280
 Her skin is gold.

132
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,180
 So, a little short woman with golden skin standing underneath the moonlight.

133
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,680
 And you're like, "Damn, I hit the jackpot."

134
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,780
 And if you picked number two, you did hit the jackpot

135
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,180
 because we are talking about the Sigwapa.

136
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,180
 The Sigwapa is a forest mountain spirit cryptid.

137
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,380
 It's really weird how these all blend together.

138
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,880
 But it is a beautiful woman that you can meet in the mountainous regions.

139
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,680
 And you'd think, "Well, why wouldn't I want to meet a tiny little gold woman

140
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
 who's hanging around naked in a clearing?"

141
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,280
 Well, if you picked number two, you approach her,

142
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,780
 your hands glide over her shiny golden body.

143
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,880
 And then she turns to you and she looks you in the eyes.

144
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,980
 And you feel nothing but passion for this woman.

145
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,080
 You begin to make sweet, sweet love.

146
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,280
 The mountains themselves shake with your passionate love-making.

147
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,880
 And then her fingers dig into the flesh of your stomach.

148
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,480
 Rip all your intestines out.

149
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,880
 And before you can even come, before you can even finalize it,

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,380
 you're leaking more than that.

151
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,980
 You're leaking tons of body fluids all over the jungle.

152
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,180
 It's a huge mess.

153
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,080
 And she's laughing as she's bathing in your blood.

154
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,980
 And she goes, "If you picked number two, this is you."

155
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,780
 Your friends, you picked number two so you're toast,

156
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,680
 but you hope that your friends can get some vengeance for you.

157
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,280
 With the Sigwapa, and I know I'm probably pronouncing that wrong,

158
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,180
 but the Sigwapa has a trick.

159
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,780
 Her feet are on backwards.

160
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,080
 So it's hard to track her.

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
 Not impossible.

162
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,280
 You figure if you're looking for someone with backwards feet,

163
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,780
 just follow the trail backwards.

164
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,880
 But anyways, she runs off into the mountains.

165
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,980
 Another victim of her cold, cruel hands.

166
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,980
 You're dead if you pick number two.

167
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,780
 These are all supposedly real, by the way.

168
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,280
 I'm not just making these up, but these are local legends.

169
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,880
 And they're interesting because you'll start to see some very...

170
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,380
 You'll start to see some bizarre connections between them.

171
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,780
 Now we're going to Central America.

172
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,980
 So we're going a little bit farther south.

173
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,880
 We are in Central America.

174
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,980
 Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

175
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,480
 I don't know what type of music they have down there.

176
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
 I'm sure it's some variation of salsa with lots of horns.

177
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,680
 What?

178
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,480
 You know, I remember once I wondered,

179
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,480
 why does Mexican music have so many horns?

180
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,380
 Because the horns are not an indigenous instrument to Mexico?

181
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,280
 Like, what is up with horns in Mexican restaurants?

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,480
 It's overpowering.

183
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,280
 And it actually was like...

184
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,580
 It was the Germans.

185
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,280
 But it was basically like they were imported over and they're like,

186
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,380
 "Hey, it's so bizarre.

187
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,580
 There are more horns...

188
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,180
 I swear, there are more horns in Mexican music

189
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,580
 than there are in like big band, brass band stuff."

190
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,280
 It's outrageous how many horns.

191
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,180
 And I'm thinking,

192
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,180
 what were the actual indigenous instruments to Mexico?

193
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,380
 It wasn't brass horns.

194
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,180
 It wasn't the trumpet, but they're everywhere.

195
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,480
 But anyways, that's an aside.

196
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,680
 We're in Central America now.

197
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,280
 It's super, super loud horns blaring everywhere you walk.

198
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,080
 Now, you're walking down a road.

199
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,380
 And there's a river next to it.

200
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,780
 And you see a beautiful woman washing her hair.

201
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,480
 And you're like, "That's odd,

202
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,680
 but at the same time, she is damn sexy."

203
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,480
 And you see her from the back.

204
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,180
 She has the shapeliest body you've ever seen.

205
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,580
 You're just immediately attracted to this woman.

206
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,180
 And you don't know why.

207
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,280
 It's almost like a sirens call this woman has.

208
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,480
 She's sitting by the edge of the water.

209
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,980
 She's washing her hair.

210
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,580
 She kind of flips it back and plays with it.

211
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,180
 And the water just drips off her long black hair onto her.

212
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,880
 Now, you realize naked body.

213
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,080
 She turns to you and says,

214
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,080
 "Come with me.

215
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,680
 Come with me into the jungle."

216
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,180
 And you can't resist.

217
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,780
 You grab her hand.

218
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,880
 Like so many other people have in Central America before.

219
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,780
 Longstanding legend of this person or creature.

220
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,280
 You grab her hand and she leads you into the jungle.

221
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,380
 And right when you get to that place in the jungle,

222
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:41,880
 what's it called?

223
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,380
 Now, I'm just joking.

224
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,680
 Right when you get to a clearing in the jungle,

225
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,480
 you start making sweet, passionate love

226
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,480
 like you've never experienced before.

227
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,080
 And right at the height of excitement,

228
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 her face begins to shift and churn and deform

229
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,880
 into the face of a horse.

230
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,880
 And she goes, "If you picked number four,

231
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,180
 we're going all the way."

232
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,780
 And she just starts riding you.

233
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,480
 You should think you're riding the horse.

234
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,680
 No, she's riding you a big old horse face.

235
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,080
 And that's not the problem.

236
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,580
 You figure, you know, her body,

237
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,280
 the rest of her body's still like a hot woman.

238
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,980
 She has a horse face.

239
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,780
 No big deal.

240
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,480
 But the sight of her horse face actually drives men mad.

241
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,880
 The reports in the area are men being found by rivers

242
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,480
 and they're out of their mind.

243
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,680
 They're like super coked out.

244
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,580
 They can't think of anything.

245
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,280
 They're just totally crazy.

246
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,080
 And the idea is they are being taken by these creatures

247
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,980
 called the Sai Huanaba, beautiful women.

248
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,280
 They're always described as beautiful women

249
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,880
 who at the moment of climax either turned into a horse face

250
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,980
 or a skull face.

251
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,280
 And if it was my money,

252
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,980
 I would much rather being a chick with a horse face

253
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,580
 than a chick with a skull.

254
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,780
 That's a tough one actually.

255
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,280
 Oral's out of the question with either one of them.

256
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,080
 It's all teeth.

257
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,680
 But again, as long as the body's still like in eight, nine territory,

258
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,180
 it's good.

259
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,780
 Their face can be pretty jacked up

260
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
 as long as everything else is in work and order.

261
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,580
 But these guys don't have that option.

262
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,180
 They totally go mad.

263
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,780
 And if you picked number four,

264
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,480
 you're locked in an insane asylum for the rest of your life.

265
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
 And every time you fall asleep,

266
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,680
 you imagine a big, drooling horse face

267
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,280
 sitting over you as a straight-up riding you.

268
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,880
 Now, at least if you pick number four,

269
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,680
 you did get to get off and you're only insane.

270
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,280
 The first guy, if you pick number two guys, sorry,

271
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,580
 you died and you didn't even get to...

272
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,680
 You died of basically permanent blue balls.

273
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,980
 But we're going to go to a few more places here.

274
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,580
 Because these legends are everywhere.

275
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,880
 These legends are really everywhere.

276
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,080
 We're going, but now we're just going South America.

277
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,780
 So now we're just going to go a little bit farther south.

278
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,280
 We're in South America now.

279
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,980
 This one, we have to go to a little more exotic places.

280
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,780
 This creature exists...

281
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,480
 This creature's actually kind of a hippie chick

282
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,080
 because she lives in untouched landscapes.

283
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,280
 Virgin woods, beautiful jungles that haven't been cut down yet

284
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,680
 in South America.

285
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,680
 Mountainous regions that are unexplored.

286
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,580
 And she actually...

287
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,080
 The first two are just horny chicks that want to kill you or drive you crazy.

288
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,680
 But this one actually has a goal, a dream.

289
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,780
 She went to community college.

290
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,280
 She got her environmental studies degree.

291
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,080
 And she ran off into...

292
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,280
 That's not actually a real backstory.

293
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,580
 She actually has a real backstory.

294
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,480
 But this creature, this woman, has a mission.

295
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,680
 And so you're walking along the jungle.

296
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,380
 And this one, you are actually a hunter.

297
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,980
 You're a hunter and you're going out and you're just looking for some tapers to shoot.

298
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,080
 You want to get some pelts and you want to play with your big old funny looking noses.

299
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,180
 But you need to shoot them first because otherwise they'll squish you.

300
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,080
 So you're hunting around in the jungle.

301
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,880
 You see a beautiful woman.

302
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,980
 Now you don't know about your other two buddies.

303
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,680
 You don't know about number two and number four who are already dead and insane.

304
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,880
 You just know that you're looking at this beautiful woman.

305
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,280
 You're in the middle of nowhere.

306
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,780
 You're kind of high from eating all that tape here meat.

307
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,880
 It is quite psychedelic.

308
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,680
 And here's this woman naked in the middle of the jungle.

309
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,280
 And you just need a little human comfort.

310
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,080
 Now this one is known as the Patasola.

311
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,380
 Now the Patasola actually is one of the most versatile ones.

312
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,480
 She can shape shift.

313
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,580
 So she can't just shape shift from a beautiful woman to the form that you're going to end up banging in a second.

314
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,680
 But she can turn into stuff like a giant frog or a dog and stuff like that.

315
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,980
 Now if you're trying to seduce dudes, I don't think being a giant frog is probably the best option

316
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,680
 because frogs probably the least sexy creature of all.

317
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,580
 Even snakes are sexier than frogs.

318
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,980
 But she can take those shapes.

319
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:58,380
 But when she wants to really sink her teeth into a man, literally, she is the beautiful woman.

320
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,780
 And it's her job.

321
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:07,680
 Her victim set is lumberjacks, hunters, loggers, people who are intruding on nature.

322
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,380
 They're all men.

323
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,880
 She doesn't attack women at all.

324
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,580
 So like I said, community college, environmental studies major.

325
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,780
 She's very, very manhating.

326
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,380
 And right when you get her, right when you're like, oh yeah, she's so beautiful.

327
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,680
 And you're just right up in that.

328
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,080
 This beautiful chick that you're banging in the middle of the jungle, dead tapirs everywhere because you shot him.

329
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,780
 She begins to revert to her real form.

330
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:43,080
 She's described as having one leg, one breast, bulging eyes, cat-like things that she uses to drink your blood out.

331
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:51,280
 All of that stuff, as weird as it is, is far more believable than what I'm about to read you.

332
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,980
 She's described as having cookie-like hair.

333
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:04,480
 I have never, ever seen hair in my life that goes, hmm, it reminds me of cookies.

334
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,580
 I have no idea what the phrase cookie-like hair means.

335
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,780
 I have absolutely, I don't know if it's some sort of South American thing that's a common descriptor,

336
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,280
 but what in the world is cookie-like hair?

337
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,680
 Is it crumbly?

338
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,880
 Does it have chocolate chips in it?

339
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,780
 Is it round?

340
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,680
 Is it not sure?

341
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,580
 There are two things that are completely unrelated.

342
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,880
 Hair is long and skinny.

343
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,580
 Cookies are, at the very least, not any of those things.

344
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:40,380
 I could imagine if someone told me how the universe ends and outside the universe is nothing.

345
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,780
 There's no void, there's no darkness, it's simply nothing, nothing exists.

346
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,580
 I can understand that concept far more than I can understand the term cookie-like hair.

347
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,780
 It's blowing my mind.

348
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,580
 What does that even mean?

349
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,180
 I think if I saw a creature with cookie-like hair, I would lose my mind.

350
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,480
 Forget the horse face, forget the skull.

351
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,980
 I would be looking at like the butthole of Cthulhu.

352
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:11,480
 I would be looking at something that is so incomprehensible to me if my mind could perceive both cookies and hair at the same time.

353
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,880
 This one doesn't drive you mad though.

354
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,980
 She just sucks your blood out, which seems like a bit of a downer, but as she's, as her teeth, as her cat-like things,

355
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:30,980
 are shoving their way into her neck, you hear her whisper, "If you pick number one, this is you."

356
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,380
 And you're getting like cookie crumbs all over your face and your mind is just racing.

357
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,880
 You're like, "Where are these cookie crumbs coming from?"

358
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,080
 She has an origin story though.

359
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,180
 Apparently she was this total, like, cruel woman in town that everyone hated.

360
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,980
 So one day they conspired to trick her up to go up to the jungle and they chopped her leg off

361
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,180
 and left her there to die and then she became this creature.

362
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,380
 I don't know why that backstory exists.

363
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,880
 She thinks she would be some, like, environmentalist who went out looking for something and a gorilla ripped her legs off or something.

364
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,580
 I don't know, like, it doesn't make sense.

365
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,080
 If you were a cruel and your leg got chopped off, I'd cut.

366
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,980
 Don't think you're gonna go then to preserve, but I don't think you're gonna become Captain Planet.

367
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,480
 I don't remember that being part of that origin story.

368
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,080
 Captain Planet was a dick for a while and then they mutilated him and then he became a superhero.

369
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,180
 Quite an odd origin story for her actually, like, her motivations.

370
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,980
 But we got one, we got two, we got four, so you're thinking, "I picked number three, where are we going?"

371
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,480
 Now this is where we get interesting.

372
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,680
 So we went to Dominican Republic, we went to Central America, we went to South America.

373
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,180
 Now we're going to Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Korea, all that stuff.

374
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:43,580
 So, and of course there's stories all over the world about sirens and succubi and killer women.

375
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,980
 So this isn't restricted to any areas.

376
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,380
 But this one, this has a bizarre connection.

377
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,280
 This one is a little weird.

378
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,280
 So if you pick number three, you're walking through Southeast Asia.

379
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
 Do-do-do-do-do, bunch of trumpet music, really loud horns, salsa music,

380
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,180
 because you have your Walkman on and you're listening to a tape

381
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,580
 that your buddy sent you from Mexico before he mysteriously disappeared.

382
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
 But you're walking through Vietnam.

383
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,680
 You're just walking through the entire country of Vietnam.

384
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,380
 You're walking through a town.

385
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,680
 And you notice people are a little nervous and it's not just because you're an outsider,

386
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,980
 but because they recently had a funeral and a whole lot of bad luck.

387
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,380
 You see, in Southeast Asia there's this creature known as the churrell.

388
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,480
 And it is created when a woman dies of what's called grossly unsatisfied desires.

389
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,080
 Now when I first read that, I'm thinking, "She didn't get banged enough?"

390
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,680
 But that's just, I think that's the way my mind works.

391
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,980
 Basically, it means that the way that it's normally put is they had work left to do.

392
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,380
 And in this case, if a woman dies during childbirth or dies less than 12 days after childbirth,

393
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
 she becomes a churrell.

394
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,480
 Sometimes babies, baby girls can become churrells because they don't get to live their life

395
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,580
 and the mother obviously wasn't able to raise the baby so they become a churrell.

396
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,080
 They become a spirit of vengeance.

397
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,080
 But after totally mutilating all the people in their house,

398
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,180
 they then wander out into the wilderness and pray on strangers, pray on men.

399
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:23,380
 Same thing, beautiful young woman seducing you over, "Come here, number three. Come here."

400
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
 "It's okay, number three, come to me."

401
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,080
 And you can't resist, she has that bit of that sirens call thing that we also see all over the world.

402
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,880
 She grabs you, passionately pulls you into the jungle, bangs you.

403
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,780
 You do get to complete this.

404
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,480
 You get your rocks off multiple times, just over and over and over.

405
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,180
 Every position you can think of with this dead mom.

406
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,580
 You don't know she's dead though, but still, you're being a dead mom basically.

407
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,780
 And then, the next morning the sun comes up and you're like, "Oh man, that was good.

408
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,780
 My back really hurts. That must have been awesome."

409
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,080
 Wait a second, what?

410
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,380
 "Uhhh, I'm an old man."

411
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,480
 You basically, she bangs you until you become Benjamin Button.

412
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 She bangs you until she sucks all your life force out and you become an old man.

413
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,480
 You're having reports in these villages of these young men going out late at night in the jungle.

414
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,280
 And they're coming back and they're like 80 years old and they're like, "Oh, my back, everything.

415
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,480
 I don't understand what this is like."

416
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,680
 And the people are like, "Oh, you banged the churl, didn't you?"

417
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,180
 And he's like, "Yeah, I caught maybe a little bit.

418
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,480
 I thought I would only get like 30 years older, but I just kept going."

419
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,180
 So this one doesn't kill you, but it actually like rapidly ages you, which is kind of worse.

420
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,880
 Really, if you think about it.

421
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,780
 It's going to shorten your lifespan, but you go from being like 30 to 90 in a night.

422
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,980
 You're going to have a lot of catching up to do on episodes of Matlock.

423
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,880
 Like, you don't have much, and you don't have much longer to live anyways.

424
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,380
 So it's almost like a twofold.

425
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,580
 Like, she's just totally being the dick.

426
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,880
 And when you're banging her, she becomes old too.

427
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,480
 She gets saggy breasts, black tongue.

428
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,380
 Not saying all old people have black tongues, but...

429
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,080
 She has saggy breasts, a black tongue, rough lips.

430
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,780
 You imagine those little sandpaper lips rubbing all over yours.

431
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,580
 Big old pot belly.

432
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
 Claws.

433
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,880
 Not a lot of elderly people have claws either.

434
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,580
 And very specific on this point, she has long pubic hair.

435
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,380
 My question to you, person who came up with this myth,

436
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,080
 how long does pubic hair have to be before it's described as long?

437
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,380
 Because generally, I'll be like, "Ah, she didn't shave,

438
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,880
 but I'm not necessarily going to call that long pubic hair."

439
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,080
 When I think long pubic hair, I'm thinking down to the knees.

440
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,680
 How long is this corpse's pubic hair?

441
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,880
 I mean, can you like tie?

442
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,980
 Can you start braiding it?

443
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,580
 Is it like Chewbacca down there?

444
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,280
 Is it like ZZ Top hanging out down there?

445
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,580
 Like, how long is it?

446
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,080
 I need some specification, but not visual specification.

447
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,380
 Just let me know, mythologist of Southeast Asia.

448
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,480
 So this one has one other trait that we've...

449
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,080
 They all have the thing of their being out in the wilderness,

450
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,380
 seducing young men, leading them off to their death.

451
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
 And that really...

452
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,780
 And that, again, that's kind of a universal thing.

453
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,780
 And a lot of people think that these legends become a thing

454
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,180
 because their story is to get young men not to dig around in the woods.

455
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,980
 Like they're saying, "Don't go off in the woods too far.

456
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,680
 You might run in a tent of their picnic, and you might also bang a chick to death."

457
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,480
 And at first people are like, "Well, I like the first part of that sentence.

458
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,180
 You didn't have to say the last two words."

459
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,580
 But they think that these stories were old warnings,

460
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,480
 saying, "The woods are dangerous. I don't believe you.

461
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
 The woods are dangerous. I don't believe you."

462
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,580
 And then finally they created these myths and legends.

463
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,380
 And mythologists also think that these legends were created

464
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,180
 to keep men faithful to their wives.

465
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,380
 Because you know your wife doesn't have super long pubic hair and a potbelly.

466
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,880
 And you know your wife doesn't have a horse face, so bang her.

467
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,080
 Don't bang these mutant creatures.

468
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,080
 If you see a hot woman out of, you know, standing by the side of the street,

469
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,280
 it's probably a monster.

470
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,380
 So just go home and bring your wife.

471
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,680
 So they think that that's why these legends have come about.

472
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,180
 But what mythologists haven't been able to answer?

473
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,480
 What sociologists haven't been able to answer?

474
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
 This is bizarre.

475
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:20,780
 The churro in Southeast Asia has backwards feet, so you can't track it.

476
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,480
 Just like the first crypt did we talked about.

477
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,580
 The saguapa in Dominican Republic.

478
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,680
 There was no cross-contamination when these two stories had came up

479
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,880
 on different parts of the globe.

480
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,280
 They do not know how these stories have such a bizarre detail that's exactly the same.

481
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,980
 It could be chance.

482
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,580
 It could be totally random that both of these cryptids,

483
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,680
 or ghosts or however you want to classify them,

484
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,480
 have that same detail.

485
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,980
 Totally random.

486
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,880
 Or it could be that in some way they're based on something.

487
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,080
 It's a very, very small detail to be shared.

488
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,580
 And if someone tells a Bigfoot story in one part of the world,

489
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
 when we talk about Bigfoot in the U.S.

490
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,480
 and people talk about Bigfoot in the Himalayas,

491
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,080
 people go, "Oh, they share all these characteristics."

492
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,880
 It's probably real.

493
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,380
 It's probably this real sighting.

494
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,680
 But we do have that cross-contamination.

495
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
 These stories had no cross-contamination,

496
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,480
 and they have this detail that seems minor at first,

497
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,580
 but the fact that it's spread across oceans and time periods and civilizations,

498
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,580
 and they have a killer woman who has sex with you,

499
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,080
 who can shapeshift and has backwards feet.

500
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,780
 It makes you think, "Maybe there's something to this."

501
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,080
 Now, all these cryptids hunt in the wilderness.

502
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,980
 And I think at the time that these myths were being created,

503
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,480
 that's where they would hunt.

504
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,780
 But today, if these creatures are real,

505
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,080
 they're going to hunt to the clubs,

506
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,380
 they're going to hunt downtown,

507
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,180
 they're going to go anywhere where young men go

508
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,380
 who are horny and looking for some action.

509
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,480
 All the other tricks are the same.

510
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,780
 Seduce them,

511
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,380
 get them someplace where no one else can see them,

512
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,780
 and feed.

513
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,580
 Are there really killer female shapeshifting cryptids out there?

514
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,680
 Probably not.

515
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,980
 But the next time a girl way out of your league starts hitting on you,

516
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,580
 better check her feet.

517
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,280

 You don't have to listen to it every day,

 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,380
 Have a great one, guys.
