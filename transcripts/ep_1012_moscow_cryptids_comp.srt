1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
 When four young men learned the location of a fabulous pirate's treasure, the only thing

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,560
 standing between them and untold riches is the Glauchester Ghoul.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,400
 And then we travel to Moscow, Idaho to take a look at a true crime story that's taken

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,080
 America by storm.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,100
 Four college students were brutally murdered in one night.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,400
 In this otherwise sleepy college town.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,240
 But is it possible they were not killed by a human, but by a giant creature that emerged

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,760
 from the bowels of the earth?

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:53,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenterder, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,000
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world and have some cool plans

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,160
 for the week and I am feeling much, much better.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 95% I'm just so sleepy.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,040
 That's really what I've come, that's really what I've come away with after my COVID bowels.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
 Just sleepy.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,600
 I'd rather be sitting in a chair with a heating pad on my back napping.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
 I guess I was like that pre-COVID too.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,400
 I guess this is not a big difference from how I normally am.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,760
 But someone who's always ready to tuck me in and put a heating pad on my back is one

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,680
 of our Christmas livestream contributors.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,200
 Everyone give it up for IANA Paul.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
 Woohoo!

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
 Yeah, come on in!

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
 Woohoo!

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
 Yay!

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,240
 Come on in to Dead Rabbit Command, IANA.

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,880
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,880
 You guys can't support the show financially if you don't want to touch me while I'm trying

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
 to fall asleep.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
 That's fine too.

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,160
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,200
 That helps out so much.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
 And then look at this.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,120
 We got this submission for Fan Art Friday.

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,600
 This was made by Minimum Zucchini.

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,160
 Minimum Zucchini sent over this fairly apocalyptic and disgusting picture of a bloodied Dead Rabbit

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,160
 doing his best to still listen to the show even though all of humanity has fallen.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,400
 Minimum Zucchini, thank you for sending that over.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 That's totally awesome.

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 I love that little guy.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
 He's pretty gross looking.

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
 But I still love him.

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,680
 Let's give him a heating pad for his back.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,080
 Let him get a good rest after the apocalypse.

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,680
 IANA, let's go ahead and get this episode started off.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,200
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,480
 Why don't you drive us all the way out to Rhode Island.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
 Nice little leisurely journey in the Jason Jalopy across the United States with IANA

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
 at the wheel.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,560
 This story was actually recommended to me so I want to give a shout out.

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,240
 In a roundabout way by a longtime Dead Rabbit radio supporter and Patreon supporter Zachary

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,360
 McCree, he sent me a link to a book and he goes, "Hey, do you think this book would be

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 worth reading?

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,960
 Do you think this would be a cool book?"

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,160
 It was called The United States of Cryptids, a tour of American myths and monsters.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 I didn't read the book.

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
 He sent me the link.

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,360
 I didn't read the book, but it had a couple of different monsters listed that they were

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
 gonna talk about.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,680
 I was like, "Oh, I've never heard of this one, the Glauchester Ghoul."

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,160
 So I would probably recommend the book even though I've never read it and I've never

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,120
 liked it because we did get at least one cool story out of it.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,520
 And I want to give a shout out to strangenewengland.com.

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,760
 I didn't read the book, but I did go to this website and I got less of my information from

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,840
 that so I'm giving them a shout out as well.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
 You want to know what's really weird?

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,040
 I've lived in this place for about 10 years at this point.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,560
 There's never been an owl outside my window.

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,680
 I don't know if the mic's big enough to pick that up.

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,960
 I'm recording out in the living room.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
 I woke up to an owl.

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,720
 I wish it was in my bedroom.

75
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,440
 Bring me a little magical note.

76
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 But I didn't hear it.

77
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
 I just outside my window.

78
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
 Who, who, who?

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
 And it's weird.

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,720
 There's an owl outside my window and anyone who knows anything about the paranormal knows

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
 that the owls are not what they seem.

82
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,800
 So it's kind of interesting to me from getting up to my aliens at night.

83
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
 Who knows?

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
 Hopefully not.

85
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,480
 Hopefully not for them because I beat them up.

86
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,560
 We're hanging out now on Glauchester Road Island.

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,440
 That's so weird.

88
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,600
 He's still hoon out there.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,440
 It's summer 1893.

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,000
 So put on your pioneer clothes and your little straw-fatched hat and we're walking around

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 town.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,280
 They're like, "Dude, that's totally a different time period."

93
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,080
 We're close to the beginning of the 1900s.

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,480
 We're wearing pants that were sewn by people.

95
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,160
 We're not dressed up like a bunch of hucked fins.

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,200
 And we're walking, we're not listening to them.

97
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,520
 We're walking around as much hucked fins as we write in their history books.

98
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,320
 We're walking around Glauchester Road Island and we're about to meet this young man.

99
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,120
 His name is Albert Hicks.

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,400
 He's a 19-year-old kid who grew up on the East Coast and he had always heard stories

101
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,000
 about pirate treasure hidden everywhere.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,600
 He grew up with these stories and he always wanted to have his own pirate treasure.

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 But he's like, "You know what?

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,760
 I could, though I'm become a pirate, I could go out and murder a bunch of people and steal

105
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:24,720
 their money or," Albert thinks to himself, "What if I simply stole money from a pirate?"

106
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,840
 Which is an even worse idea, right?

107
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,520
 That's like being like, "Oh, I could be a drug dealer or I could just rob drug dealers.

108
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
 That seems easier.

109
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,760
 It's not, it's far more dangerous.

110
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,000
 What if I stole the treasure of a pirate who's already dead and I don't want to worry about

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 nothing, right?

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,720
 That's, that's using the old nog in Albert.

113
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,400
 Albert had heard stories about Captain Kid, world famous pirate Captain Kid, and apparently

114
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,440
 he had buried his treasure in Glauchester Road Island.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,560
 And Albert had also heard stories that at one point there is this farm in Glauchester

116
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,960
 where some old Spanish doubloons were once found.

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,160
 Some of them were out tilling the field in their huckfin hat.

118
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
 And then all of a sudden, "Mawr, what's that?

119
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,520
 Bessie, quit pulling this hoe.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,680
 Let me stop and jump out off of you, your back or however I did this."

121
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
 Farmer Joe gets down.

122
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,640
 "Well, tarnation, what's this?

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,000
 This ain't corn.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,480
 This looks like one of them doubloons."

125
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,080
 And then he finds a couple more and then he's less excited the next couple of times.

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,800
 Like, "Oh great, more Spanish gold.

127
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,960
 I just want to get corn."

128
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,400
 So Albert goes, "I think I know where the treasure's probably buried.

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,480
 It's probably buried near that farm where people keep finding gold coins."

130
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
 It's just a guess, guys.

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,680
 Albert Hicks gets a couple of his buddies together.

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,400
 They said, "Let's go out there at night and dig up this gold."

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,960
 So it's late at night, summer of 1893.

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,400
 They got their shovels, probably a couple pickaxes too, in case you find a rock.

135
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,120
 You want to smash it up real good.

136
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,880
 They're digging it up and every show, often, of course, one of them would kind of poke

137
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,800
 their head up and kind of look around, make sure no one sees them and they dig a little

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,200
 bit more and then someone else would kind of look around.

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,800
 And they just saw, you know, the night sky has enveloped the entire area.

140
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,440
 They see the farmhouse in the distance.

141
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,280
 They look to their left, they look to their right.

142
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,240
 There's forests all around this farm as well, but they just keep digging and then all of

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,640
 a sudden they hear a strange sound.

144
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,440
 They don't say exactly what the sound is.

145
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,000
 I'm sure any sound other than a shovel hitting dirt would put you on alert.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 They hear a strange sound and everyone kind of looks up in the direction of the sound

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
 and that's when they see it.

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,720
 The Glauchester ghoul.

149
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
 So what it's known as.

150
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,600
 This was the very first sighting of this creature.

151
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,920
 Albert Hicks described it as, this would be quite frightening, really.

152
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,040
 I mean, any monster coming out of the woods in the middle of the night would be scary.

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,440
 But this one's the size of a cow, which are huge.

154
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,960
 Like I don't think most people know how big cows are because they don't see them every

155
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,040
 day.

156
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,640
 This thing comes out of the woods.

157
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,640
 It's as big as a cow with these massive eyeballs.

158
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,760
 Let me finish.

159
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,680
 You're like, okay Jason, everything has an eyeball.

160
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
 That's not that spooky.

161
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
 But you didn't let me finish.

162
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,960
 I know it took a kind of a long pause there.

163
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:39,160
 It walks out of the woods and it has these massive eyeballs that look like flaming orbs

164
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,800
 stuck in its socket.

165
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
 See?

166
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
 You let me finish.

167
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,360
 You let me get to the flame.

168
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
 It's always scarier.

169
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,920
 And to be fair, any giant thing, even if it was just a cow in the middle of the night,

170
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
 that would be alarming enough.

171
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,920
 But this is this giant creature.

172
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,240
 As this creature is walking towards them, they notice that every breath it takes, flame

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:13,760
 shoots out of its mouth the nostrils.

174
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 So any illusion that this is ordinary at all, right?

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,520
 If you saw something with big flaming eyeballs, you might go, that's weird.

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,160
 But maybe it's just a trick of the like.

177
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,200
 Maybe it's this old timey LSD I've been taking.

178
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,520
 You could look at something that was spitting out flame and had flaming eyeballs and I

179
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,120
 mean it would be terrifying.

180
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,240
 But the fact that the flames are burning the bushes around this beast as it's walking

181
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,560
 out of the forest shows that this creature simply doesn't have the appearance of flame

182
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,920
 or it's some sort of bizarre optical illusion.

183
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
 No.

184
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,200
 It's fire shooting out of this creature and it's burning the brush around it.

185
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,800
 The bushes and the foilage are actually becoming singed as this creature is simply moving through

186
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,680
 the area.

187
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,720
 The creature is also described as having massive wings, these two big black leathery wings

188
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,600
 sticking out of its back.

189
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
 Giant spiral horns as thick as a stovepipe?

190
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,080
 I don't know how big a stovepipe this is either.

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,280
 I'm sure that's impressive.

192
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,840
 But anyways, I imagine like two Abraham Lincoln hats on this guy's head.

193
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
 That's the best I can imagine.

194
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,840
 Then that's just kind of funny.

195
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,760
 The Gloucester ghoul also had feet that were webbed like a duck.

196
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,880
 Okay, wait a second.

197
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,640
 These guys are standing in the middle of the night.

198
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,480
 They never say how far away this thing is.

199
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,240
 The detail in the description would make me think it's pretty close.

200
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,960
 I'm thinking within 20 yards.

201
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,800
 But if something was coming out of the darkness, it was big as a cow, it was breathing flame,

202
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 it had giant wings.

203
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,680
 I don't think I'd be like, "I wonder what its feet look like."

204
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,160
 It would be hard to notice is what I'm saying.

205
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,080
 It would be hard to see what type of feet it had.

206
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,200
 It almost sounds like a tall tail at this point.

207
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
 These kids are out there trying to dig up some gold and they see this big monster coming

208
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,000
 out with duck feet and everything else, two Abraham Lincoln hats.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,240
 But maybe, I mean this thing is putting off an awful lot of light.

210
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,840
 It keeps setting stuff on fire.

211
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,120
 So maybe they got a good look at its feet.

212
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,200
 It had webbed feet like a duck and it smelled, this is an old timey smell.

213
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,920
 This is something that no modern person would know what it smelled like.

214
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,120
 They just, it would have been close too for them to smell this.

215
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,120
 They said it smelled like burned wool.

216
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,320
 What was that word she just said?

217
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,200
 This is one of those words that people say I mispronounce and I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 it correctly.

219
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
 Wool.

220
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
 Wool.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,320
 Like, you know, you make a wool sweater out of sheep wool.

222
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,640
 You shave it off and then you sew it all together.

223
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
 You just sew it on me.

224
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,040
 I look like a giant sheep and run it on the street.

225
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
 Thanks mom.

226
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
 Wool.

227
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
 Wool.

228
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,720
 So it smelled like burned wool.

229
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,320
 And again, that's, I don't think anyone knows what that smells like.

230
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,800
 You're like, yeah, Jesus, nobody knows what wool is.

231
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,120
 It's not a Ypres answer.

232
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,000
 I'm pretty sure I got it right.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Burned wool.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,120
 It's a very, very detailed description of a cryptid, but the reason why I really love

235
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,120
 this particular monster is we get a detail that we don't often get with cryptids.

236
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,480
 It's one of those things.

237
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,560
 You don't think about the absence of this detail until it appears and you go, hmm, that's

238
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
 interesting.

239
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,640
 Like how come more cryptids don't have this?

240
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,480
 How come we don't know this about more cryptids?

241
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,760
 It's very, very interesting.

242
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
 The question is what sound does it make?

243
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,560
 And I'm not talking about its battle cry or, you know, it's like screaming at the edge

244
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,600
 of the river or the Bigfoot call from the woods.

245
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
 No.

246
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,840
 Because a lot of cryptids are, it should make some noise.

247
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,240
 They should make some noise just naturally moving about.

248
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:20,280
 Let's read this description that Albert told us, quote, "The body was covered with scales

249
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:28,880
 as big as clamshells, which made a rattling noise as the beast moved along.

250
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,720
 We very rarely get a sound of a chupacabra scuttling."

251
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,280
 Well, here's stories of like a Bigfoot marching through the woods and things like that, but

252
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,840
 a lot of times it's interacting with the trees and things like that.

253
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,600
 But for the amount of cryptids that are out there, very rarely do we get someone describe

254
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,680
 what the sound is like when they move.

255
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,200
 So it's very, very interesting detail.

256
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,180
 It's not absent from all cryptid stories, but it's absent from enough that it does make

257
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,120
 you think, are these things actually some sort of biological entity or is this from

258
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
 somewhere else?

259
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,800
 Anything on earth is going to make noise.

260
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,960
 I'm sure cows make a noise when they walk.

261
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,000
 They definitely would if they were covered in armor.

262
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,280
 They definitely would if they were covered in these shells.

263
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,200
 They're kind of clinking and clinking against each other.

264
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
 So just an interesting detail.

265
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,400
 I really like that.

266
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,520
 And let me go ahead and continue because there's another really cool detail with this.

267
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,600
 For a creature that's emitting this much flame.

268
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,220
 It's going to be, where's it coming from?

269
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
 Right?

270
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
 It's coming out of its mouth.

271
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,780
 It's coming out of its nose.

272
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,980
 Its eyeballs look like they're on fire, but let's look at this detail.

273
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,420
 "The body was covered with scales as big as clam shells, which made a rattling noise as

274
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,120
 the beast moved along.

275
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,500
 The scales flopped up and down.

276
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:55,920
 The thing had lights on its sides, like those shining through a tin lantern."

277
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,980
 So what Albert and his friends are seeing is the light, there's so much flame being generated

278
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
 in this thing.

279
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,840
 It's actually penetrating the skin, the actual glow is penetrating the skin.

280
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,560
 And they're seeing it in between the shells clinking and clinking against each other.

281
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,500
 It actually looks like there's a lantern in there.

282
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,480
 That's a really fascinating detail to this thing.

283
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,620
 That makes it feel more biological rather than just fire shooting out of the nose.

284
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,060
 That's kind of dragon, that's kind of mythological, right?

285
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,020
 You can go, "Well, I wonder where the fire came from and we can kind of make up stories

286
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,220
 about how a dragon could breathe fire."

287
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,660
 This one, whatever flame it's breathing out, is actually being generated within a biological

288
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,800
 form.

289
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,680
 And because there's so much heat and energy in there, you can see it through the skin

290
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,800
 and you catch glimpses of it in between the armor, in between those scales kind of flopping

291
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 up and down.

292
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,760
 You can kind of see inside this glow.

293
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,640
 Fascinating creature.

294
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,120
 And Albert and his buddies, they see this thing, it's relatively close to them, they don't

295
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,640
 give us an exact measurement, but it's close enough to smell.

296
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,580
 It's close enough to notice these details.

297
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:20,780
 And Albert said as this creature was getting closer, he felt like he was being suffocated.

298
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,060
 This creature doesn't even have to get them, doesn't have to set on fire, doesn't have

299
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,180
 to trample them, doesn't have to eat them.

300
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,300
 Just being in its presence is sucking the wind out of their lungs.

301
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,980
 Very, very powerful creature.

302
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,280
 Albert and his friends, they go, "You know what?

303
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,920
 We don't even know if the gold's here in the first place.

304
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
 Let's leave."

305
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,440
 And they actually took off running, disappeared in the night.

306
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,880
 Albert said, "We never saw where the creature went."

307
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,960
 He almost disappeared as quickly as he appeared, but I don't know where he went.

308
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,160
 I never went back there.

309
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,600
 I'm pretty sure there's some fiber gold in it on that farm, but I'm never going back

310
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 there.

311
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,320
 I believe, the reason why he put two and two together, he said, "I believe that this

312
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,140
 creature was there to guard Captain Kid's gold."

313
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,740
 We have a lot of stories of hidden gold, hidden by Native Americans, hidden by conquistadors,

314
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:26,300
 hidden by pirates, and there is some sort of creature there, guarding it.

315
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,220
 There's stories of long lost gold mines that are guarded by, I think we did an episode

316
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,780
 on it, there was like a glowing skeleton in the area that was to ward off people.

317
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,640
 That might have been a different glowing skeleton, but I know in the Southwest, the American

318
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,760
 Southwest, there are stories of lost mines.

319
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,360
 The Native Americans are like, "You guys can't come back here."

320
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,000
 And there's a guardian spirit that will kill prospectors trying to find that.

321
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,280
 And even this is unusual for a pirate treasure to be guarded by a ghost or some sort of beast.

322
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:05,640
 I'm sure that there are magics that one can learn and one can use to create a cursed location

323
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
 like this.

324
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,020
 The farmer could be out there all day long and never see this creature.

325
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,900
 He's trying to hook up a big hodowit.

326
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
 What are those?

327
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
 He's trying to hook up a big plowdowit.

328
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
 He's like, "Come on, Betsy, let's go.

329
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
 He's all burning himself as he's getting close to it."

330
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,740
 I was like, "Oh man, it smells like burned wool."

331
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,300
 But I'm sure there is some spell you could cast that could curse the area if you came

332
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,460
 looking for the gold.

333
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,700
 What's interesting is there is only two accounts of this Glauchester ghoul.

334
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,320
 It's only been seen twice.

335
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,880
 Both times in the 1800s, the last time, really the second and last time it was ever seen,

336
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,320
 was on January 13th, 1896, a fellow named Neil Hopkins.

337
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,200
 He said he was on his way home from work.

338
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
 And this is old time.

339
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,440
 So like he was working in another state and then walking back to Rhode Island.

340
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,000
 He was like coming from New Hampshire or something like that.

341
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,920
 He was passing through the area on his way home from work at night and he saw the Glauchester

342
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 ghoul.

343
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
 And then the other sighting of it.

344
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,820
 Now, that kind of sinks my own theory that you can only see if you're looking for the

345
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
 gold.

346
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,700
 But maybe as he was walking through the area, he's like, "Oh man, you know, I probably

347
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,980
 should work in the same state that I live in if only I had some gold."

348
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:25,060
 It's interesting, he describes the same beast down to the clanking of the armor.

349
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,700
 He describes it in the same way.

350
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,900
 You could hear it coming.

351
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:34,440
 He said when the shells, when the chain armor, you know, that kind of that description, it's

352
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,280
 a little like piece overlaying another piece, overlaying another piece.

353
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,400
 He goes, "When it was walking towards me, it sounded like steel striking steel."

354
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,320
 That's how heavy this armor was.

355
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,760
 And when he saw it, it was not the size of a cow.

356
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
 It was the size of an elephant.

357
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,080
 Big difference between the two, right?

358
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,060
 It was the size of an elephant and it didn't lazily walk through the area.

359
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
 This thing chased him.

360
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,420
 This thing started pursuing him through the area and he ran and eventually said, "I turned

361
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
 around and disappeared."

362
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,780
 He just wasn't there anymore.

363
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,300
 The only proof was my stained pantaloons that this experience ever happened.

364
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
 The Glauchester Ghoul.

365
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
 It's never been seen since.

366
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 It's fascinating creature though.

367
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,620
 I love it.

368
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,260
 But it's fascinating cryptid.

369
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,240
 I just love the amount of detail we get from it.

370
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
 Is it still out there?

371
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,800
 Is it more of a ward that is protecting this treasure?

372
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,360
 If it is, it's so detailed.

373
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,760
 Again, like making the set.

374
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,000
 The other one was just like a glowing skeleton going, "Oh, I can stay away."

375
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 He didn't even talk.

376
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 He didn't even talk.

377
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,720
 I mean, I guess if it's a glowing skeleton, you're not going to be like, "Well, you know,

378
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,520
 he is in the location of this hidden treasure.

379
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,560
 I wonder if he might be having to do something else."

380
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,940
 If only he could speak and tell us.

381
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,980
 A glowing skeleton would be bad enough.

382
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,900
 But you have this creature with all this detail.

383
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,260
 Absolutely fascinating.

384
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,180
 That's the story of the Glauchester Ghoul.

385
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,540
 As we're packing up all of our stuff, we stole the treasure.

386
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,820
 We found it with our grand penetrating radar.

387
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,380
 As we're packing up all our stuff to leave, we see Albert Hicks kind of wave into us in

388
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,260
 the distance, waving goodbye.

389
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,860
 We're like, "Hey, see you later, little Albie."

390
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,980
 Man, that guy sure was helpful.

391
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:23,120
 I wonder if he'll ever pop up in some terrifying true crime story in a future episode.

392
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
 He just kind of shrugs his shoulders and he walks away.

393
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
 We're like, "What?

394
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,040
 How did he hear that from that far away?

395
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 He's super far away."

396
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,240
 Well, bye, Albert.

397
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,160
 Hope you don't have a super tragic end anytime soon.

398
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,880
 Ionapole, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter we are leaving behind

399
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:52,500
 Rhode Island, fly us all the way out to Moscow, Idaho.

400
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,940
 Ionapole land this carbonicopter here in Moscow, Idaho.

401
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,660
 It's November 13th, 2022.

402
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,060
 I've been talking a lot about this story on my YouTube shorts and my TikToks.

403
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,580
 It's a very fascinating true crime story, but if you guys aren't up to speed on it,

404
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,960
 I'll give you guys a quick overview.

405
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,760
 On November 13th, 2022 in Moscow, Idaho, you have the University of Idaho and then you

406
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,420
 have off-campus housing.

407
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:28,840
 People are always hanging out, doing homework, partying, just growing up, right?

408
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,080
 Just living your best life.

409
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,620
 In this particular house, there were five people who were living in it.

410
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:42,960
 We had Madison Mogan, Kaylee Goncaves, and Zana Kernoodle.

411
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,080
 And then there were two other unnamed roommates that were living in this house.

412
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,000
 And it was a party house.

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,880
 People in the area go, "They're all party houses."

414
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,080
 But a lot of people were in and out of this house over the years, really, even before

415
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 they moved in.

416
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,440
 It was just off-campus housing for a college.

417
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,260
 On November 13th, we had another person staying the night there, Ethan Chappan.

418
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,900
 That was Zana's boyfriend.

419
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,220
 He was spending the night over at his girlfriend's house.

420
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:18,780
 What happens is when the sun rises, later that morning, four people are found murdered.

421
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,180
 Madison, Kaylee, Zana, and Ethan.

422
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
 They're all dead.

423
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,140
 They've all been stabbed to death in the house.

424
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,660
 I've heard reports that they were beheaded as well.

425
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,020
 I don't know how authentic those are, and we'll kind of get into that.

426
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,880
 We're getting a lot of little pieces of what could be coming out of this story.

427
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,600
 But I also want to focus more on the cryptid part for this.

428
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,920
 I'm just giving you a quick overview.

429
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,880
 It was super interesting because I remember when this happened, you're starting to get

430
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,840
 these little bits of information coming out saying four people were murdered in a house.

431
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 And you go, "The first inclination is drug deal gone wrong.

432
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
 These kids got into something.

433
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,560
 They were selling Xanax on the sly.

434
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,880
 And they thought that they could get away with robbing some drug dealer."

435
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
 They were all killed.

436
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,900
 The first thing that I thought of, because you don't think, "Oh, it's just scream six.

437
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,340
 It's just a horror movie.

438
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
 That's real."

439
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,140
 But as the days end, the police said the public is in no danger.

440
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,340
 They made that statement the first day, which normally means they know who did it, and the

441
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,100
 victims caused it in one way or the other.

442
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,980
 Not saying that they deserved it, but they pissed off the wrong person.

443
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,060
 So the average housewife doesn't have to worry about it.

444
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,020
 This was a situation which is something.

445
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,460
 They eventually changed that.

446
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,840
 They go, "Well, we can't promise that we can't.

447
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,840
 We as the police cannot promise no one's in danger."

448
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,480
 Because it turned out that they didn't know who did it, and they didn't have a motive.

449
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,200
 And for over a month, nobody knew what was going on.

450
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,800
 What we knew of was that, this is what we were told, four people were killed in a house,

451
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,000
 and two roommates slept through it.

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,320
 So you're starting to think, "How do you kill four people with a knife?

453
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,020
 Maybe they're not beheaded, but how do you kill four people with a knife?"

454
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,460
 Without waking up two people in other rooms.

455
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,660
 Now it was a multi-story house, but still, you can stab a couple people in your sleep.

456
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
 Don't get me wrong.

457
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,460
 But four, and if someone was able to successfully stab four people in their sleep, you would

458
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:24,140
 assume that this is an experienced killer, aka drug deal gone wrong.

459
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
 What's interesting?

460
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,960
 What we found out was the police eventually did have a suspect.

461
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,200
 His name is Brian Coburger.

462
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,680
 His 28-year-old man, he was arrested in Pennsylvania where his parents lived, but he did go to

463
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,960
 school in the area.

464
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,040
 He didn't know them.

465
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,120
 I know there are stories coming out now that he dated them and that he might have stalked

466
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
 one of them.

467
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,120
 We don't know, but what we do know is that he was a criminal justice major.

468
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,880
 He was really into the psychology of the macabre.

469
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,660
 What could cause a man to kill that type of stuff?

470
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:03,120
 Which there's nothing wrong with that, but it also can lead, we have seen cases in the

471
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,860
 past where those people go, "Well, I'm smarter than the cops.

472
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,980
 I'll pull off the perfect crime."

473
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,980
 Now he's arrested.

474
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
 He's been arrested.

475
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,980
 He did, I mean, allegedly, right?

476
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,660
 There's been no trial yet, but they basically have a knife sheath.

477
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:24,960
 There was a military-style knife sheath found at the location of the murders that has genealogical

478
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,680
 DNA on it that connects to him.

479
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:35,880
 They have not officially said that it's his DNA, but they use that DNA to go through genealogical,

480
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,040
 you know, the 23andMe type things and they found his dad.

481
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,440
 So that's kind of concrete, unless his dad was also in the area.

482
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
 They connected it to him.

483
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,620
 They also were able to ping his phone.

484
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,780
 We talked about this on a recent episode, the geocaching, or geofencing is what it's

485
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,700
 called, I'm sorry, where they can look at a particular area and see where their phones

486
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,260
 are and it appears that he was in that area quite often before and a little bit after the

487
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,180
 murders, but not on the day of.

488
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,860
 And we also have learned now that the police were holding information back from us.

489
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,540
 One of the roommates wasn't asleep.

490
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,180
 They didn't reveal this because they didn't want the guy coming back and killing her.

491
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:22,520
 She had woken up in the middle of the night and had heard one of the young women crying

492
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,040
 and she heard an unfamiliar male voice say, "It's okay.

493
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,720
 I'm going to help you."

494
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,420
 She also heard another one of her roommates in this same time period.

495
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,200
 One of her roommates, one of the murder victims was on their phone on TikTok.

496
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,160
 We believe that this was Zana because we see that she was on TikTok at 4.12 in the morning.

497
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:56,140
 But she hears what is presumably Zana on TikTok and Zana says, probably to someone on the

498
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,700
 phone, probably to someone on the TikTok app, "There's someone here."

499
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,660
 And the roommate is hearing this kind of going on.

500
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,860
 She's hearing a dog bark and she's hearing these weird comments.

501
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,100
 There is the sound, security cameras in the area at 4.17 picked up the sound of someone

502
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:19,920
 or something whimpering, a loud thud, and then the sound of a dog barking over and over and

503
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
 over again.

504
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,440
 At one point, the roommate opened up her bedroom door and she looked out into the darkened

505
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:32,320
 interior of the house and she saw a man wearing all black with a black face mask covering his

506
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,280
 nose and his mouth walking towards her.

507
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:43,780
 She froze and he just kind of walked by and then walked out a sliding glass door.

508
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,820
 So he may not have seen her.

509
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
 Maybe he did.

510
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
 We don't know.

511
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,940
 She said he was about 5'10.

512
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,060
 He had bushy eyebrows.

513
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
 That's all I knew.

514
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,420
 He was a white dude.

515
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,860
 That's all she could gather from that.

516
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,500
 What's super weird?

517
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 You can kill four people.

518
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,940
 We now know that one of the roommates was awake, did hear this stuff.

519
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:09,280
 The roommates did not report the murders until noon the next day.

520
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,600
 They actually called their friends over to the house.

521
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,800
 The story is weird.

522
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,040
 The story is so weird.

523
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,040
 They called their friends over to the house and all these kids are stomping all over the

524
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,920
 crime scene and then they called the police.

525
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,680
 So there may be more information.

526
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,520
 There may be other arrests coming out.

527
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,800
 We don't know.

528
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,360
 But that's a quick overview of the Moscow murders.

529
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,920
 But that's not why we're here today because I covered this stuff on my TikTok channel.

530
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,300
 We're here today because it's taking a turn for the weird.

531
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,540
 I want to dig into this conspiracy theory.

532
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
 This makes sense, right?

533
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,260
 We have this case that millions of people are interested in and we're getting this drip

534
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,100
 drop of details and even after we get affidavits some of the details still don't make sense.

535
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,060
 Why did they wait so long to call the police?

536
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,380
 Four people had been butchered.

537
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,380
 There's blood everywhere.

538
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,620
 The cops came in and they go, "There's blood on the walls!"

539
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,900
 It's not like they came in and be like, "Hey, we can't wait Kaylee up.

540
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
 Call her a friend.

541
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
 Maybe Kaylee's friend can help wake her up."

542
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
 They were bloodied.

543
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,520
 Anyways, you have a story that's this big.

544
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,080
 Of course you're going to get conspiracy theories about it.

545
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,560
 Did the roommates have anything to do with it?

546
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,000
 Is Brian the soul murderer?

547
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,560
 Is he even the guilty one?

548
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,400
 What could possibly be going on?

549
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,520
 Then we take a look at the crazy academic.

550
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:31,200
 This person posted a theory online recently that maybe they were killed by Bigfoot.

551
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,820
 Hold all your questions till the end and they will be numerous.

552
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,860
 I probably won't be able to answer most of them.

553
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,740
 But I find this so fascinating.

554
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,560
 Let's put on a conspiracy cap on early on this segment.

555
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,580
 I do want to say, yes, Bigfoot is not known to be walking around the roads.

556
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,140
 He's a forest creature, a rural creature.

557
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,460
 But I do want to say this.

558
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:02,600
 We focus so much on missing 411, these mysterious disappearances that take place in the woods

559
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,760
 every so often.

560
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
 They're quite rare.

561
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
 People go missing in the woods.

562
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,260
 They're never seen again.

563
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,960
 Is it some sort of unknown force?

564
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,080
 Is it some sort of cryptid?

565
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,240
 Is it some sort of portal?

566
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,200
 Way more people go missing in the suburbs in the inner city than ever go missing in the

567
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,720
 outdoors.

568
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,340
 So keep that in mind because I will say you might have missing 411, but this is missing

569
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,840
 911.

570
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,820
 These are mass disappearances in urban and suburban environments and murders and things

571
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
 like this.

572
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:43,180
 So while I don't think, I don't want to play my cards too early, but while I don't think

573
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:49,300
 Bigfoot actually murdered these four people, I think it is possible that there is a cryptid

574
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,620
 crime wave going on and we are not aware of it.

575
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,740
 Let's take a look at the crazy academic story.

576
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
 He says that it was Bigfoot.

577
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:04,780
 He said it was Bigfoot or the Nephilim, the half human half demon or technically half

578
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:11,920
 human half angel giants that once walked the earth.

579
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,960
 Now I don't know how tall the population is at University of Idaho.

580
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,340
 I don't know if there is any 13 or 18 feet tall monstrosities currently walking around

581
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
 the campus.

582
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:30,280
 You know it is interesting because his conspiracy theory while intriguing, gosh darn it if you

583
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,700
 don't believe that there are some holes in the theory that a cryptid might have killed

584
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:43,660
 these kids, but one, he said, I mean I guess I have heard this before, but I didn't know

585
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,660
 it was mainstream.

586
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:51,480
 He says that the Nephilim or the giants live in the hollow earth.

587
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
 What?

588
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,760
 I mean I have heard, I know we supposedly found graves of giant skeletons, stuff like that.

589
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,440
 We have done a dozen episodes on that phenomenon, but you have the giant skeletons.

590
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,680
 I guess I never heard so much that they lived in hollow earth.

591
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,200
 That would be the worst place for a giant to be that the ceilings are much lower.

592
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,080
 You are underground.

593
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
 Why would you be underground?

594
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,360
 If you were half human half demon, if you survived the great flood, you would just be

595
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,620
 like welcome back boys, you would just be kicking tanks over and throwing jets at the

596
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,620
 White House.

597
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,740
 Like why would you hide underground?

598
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,420
 I know the theory of hollow earth and I know the theory of advanced civilizations.

599
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,900
 I guess I am just, is that a new thing?

600
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,140
 Is that a new thing that people are saying that that is where the Nephilim went underground?

601
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
 They are living underground.

602
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,300
 But anyways, so that the Nephilim burst out of the earth, at least one of them, and made

603
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
 his way through this college town.

604
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,000
 He is all stuff and he is getting a couple of drinks and he is hanging out.

605
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,880
 He has all these Mardi Gras beads around his neck and then he is walking through town.

606
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,840
 He, a Nephilim burst out of the earth or Bigfoot burst out of the earth.

607
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
 You are like what?

608
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,240
 Okay, you are going to do a lot of head scratching here.

609
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,840
 Or Bigfoot also pops out of a hole in the earth.

610
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,880
 You are like what is this fascination with holes in the earth?

611
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
 I don't know.

612
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
 It is not my theory.

613
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,800
 Anyways, that Bigfoot burst out of a hole in the earth.

614
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,020
 I have never heard that theory that Bigfoot lives in the earth.

615
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,460
 I mean, I guess it would make sense.

616
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,300
 He would explain why he is so hard to find, but the ceiling is too low.

617
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,740
 He jumps out of a hole, which would be so awesome to see if I ever see Bigfoot.

618
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,700
 I hope he is not just walking through the forest.

619
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,300
 I hope I am just standing there admiring nature's beauty.

620
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,980
 Then all of a sudden I see Bigfoot jump out of a hole.

621
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,380
 He is Michael Jackson getting ready to start his show in Vegas.

622
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:42,240
 He has like this springboard contraption that throws him 20 feet into the air and then he

623
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,640
 lands in front of me and then grabs his crotch.

624
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,040
 Bigfoot jumping out of a hole, Nevilleen jumping out of a hole.

625
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,240
 This is his proof that these people weren't killed by a human.

626
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:07,580
 He says, "One, there is video footage of strange entities in the area."

627
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
 There is not.

628
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
 There is not.

629
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,780
 I watched the footage he was talking about originally, so there is footage that was taken

630
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:21,900
 of a street and there is like a police dashcam or something like that.

631
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:30,240
 This footage though from a street and you see four, not one giant, not one huge Bigfoot.

632
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,600
 Again, people would notice it.

633
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,320
 They see four little shadowy figures walking off in the distance.

634
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,480
 But I mean it looks blurry.

635
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,640
 Anyone who knows anything about cameras and a lot of people who don't know anything about

636
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,720
 cameras knows that stuff in the dark far away is not going to be picture perfect.

637
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,520
 But again, that blows his own thing.

638
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:58,540
 If he thinks it's Nevilleen, they were ordinary looking blobs walking out of the street.

639
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:06,100
 The fact that you found the knife sheath at the murder scene, which was a military styled

640
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:11,340
 knife, like probably like a K-bar or something like that.

641
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:17,940
 The academic, the crazy academic says that that is proof of a quote "sophisticated military

642
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,100
 operation."

643
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,400
 So it wasn't just that someone just went and bought a K-bar off Amazon.

644
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:33,400
 It's that they sent in special forces and they engaged this creature in the house and

645
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:41,000
 after the battle between man and Bigfoot was over, the guy left his sheath there.

646
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,240
 That's his takeaway from the fact that they found the sheath there.

647
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,320
 I was reading an article, the other in Fox News, they said, "Brian might have left it

648
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,180
 there on purpose.

649
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,660
 This might not have been his very first killings."

650
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,700
 It's really interesting to go from zero murders to four in one night.

651
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,220
 We do see mass shooters obviously do that, but it's still odd.

652
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,220
 The whole story is odd.

653
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,980
 But anyway, so it's not so odd that I think Bigfoot was there as interesting as that would

654
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,060
 be.

655
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,300
 The knife sheath being left there is a sign that there were military operatives there that

656
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,020
 were killing this creature or chasing it off.

657
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,360
 I mean, I guess you could even argue that these four people saw proof of the Nephilim

658
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,200
 coming out of the middle of the earth and then the military went and silenced them and

659
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,440
 left their sheath there.

660
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,720
 Remember of this worldwide conspiracy to stop all knowledge of cryptids and they're like,

661
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,520
 "Jeffrey, did you leave your sheath there?"

662
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,200
 And he's like, "Oh no, oh, oh, spaghetti!"

663
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,840
 Like he's capable of covering up hidden beasts from man's prying eyes, but he can't remember

664
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,120
 to pick up his sheath.

665
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:54,180
 But proof that there were military there in the theory of the crazy academic, there was

666
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:00,780
 one thing that he said, which I think this conspiracy theory, I find it very evocative.

667
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,900
 That's why I wanted to talk about it.

668
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,220
 I don't think it's true.

669
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:09,300
 I do think you could chalk up some missing people in suburban and urban environments

670
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,660
 and some people who are brutally killed in those environments as well.

671
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,960
 I think you could chalk up a very small portion of those two cryptids.

672
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,960
 A very, very small portion of them.

673
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,080
 If they exist, right, if we believe that these creatures exist, every so often you'll hear

674
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,960
 a new story about an orangutan just tearing butt through the middle of Charleston.

675
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,760
 Every so often you'll hear about like a crocodile loose in a daycare center, which actually

676
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,400
 sounds hilarious.

677
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,700
 But anyways, I don't know if I've actually ever read that news story, but that would

678
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,200
 be fun.

679
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
 So why not?

680
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,060
 If you can have a natural creature outside of its habitat, you could easily have a Big

681
00:38:53,060 --> 00:39:00,940
 Foot wander into a town or some other unknown cryptid wander into a town and snack.

682
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,500
 There's been a ton of sightings of the, I think, what is it?

683
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,980
 Off the top of my head, the Illinois.

684
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,860
 I think we see a lot of it in Chicago.

685
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,880
 We did an episode on it before, The Winged Beast.

686
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,320
 They call it the Mothman or the Batman, but I think a lot of people get it confused with

687
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:22,600
 the Mothman, the more famous Mothman, from Point Pleasant that predicts catastrophes.

688
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,360
 No, this is just some weird monstrosity that's been seen flying around the city of Chicago.

689
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,000
 So we do have urban cryptids.

690
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,760
 We've covered one or two on the show.

691
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,480
 See if I can find those episodes for the show notes.

692
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,360
 But yeah, I'm not against the idea in and of itself.

693
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,720
 I find it fascinating.

694
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,060
 It's in poor taste, but that's never stopped me before.

695
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,660
 We do, though, have this.

696
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
 This is something I didn't know about.

697
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,780
 And I want to end the episode like this because we are officially running long.

698
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,700
 He said that there's been, this is why he was so fixated on the inner earth and things

699
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
 blowing up.

700
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,700
 He said that there had been a series of explosions in Idaho recently.

701
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:03,700
 And what that might have been was the creature or creatures blowing a hole through the earth

702
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,380
 and jumping out.

703
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,680
 I mean, again, if you're going to be, I talked about a cryptid maybe living on the outskirts

704
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,600
 of Minneapolis and just grabbing homeless people to feast on before eventually it heads

705
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,120
 back to its natural environment deep inside a national forest.

706
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,840
 That's the, you know, they don't have spectacular entrances.

707
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,600
 They don't have the Michael Jackson-esque jumping out fireworks going up.

708
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,640
 But his do.

709
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,400
 So I mean, maybe that's just more exciting.

710
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,700
 But he's saying that it's possible that you have these explosions going off that are creatures

711
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
 coming to the earth.

712
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,700
 And I was like, what explosions?

713
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,860
 And I looked it up and this is weird.

714
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:53,140
 There have been explosions all over, not just Idaho, all over America.

715
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,940
 And one of the great things about Ring Doorbell Cams, as hard as it would have been to be

716
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,460
 a criminal back when I was, that legally wasn't a criminal.

717
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,080
 No, I was never a criminal.

718
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,560
 But as much as Ring Doorbell cameras, I'm like, man, poor criminals today.

719
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,880
 They just can't get away with anything.

720
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,800
 They're great for, they're great for seeing mysterious explosions in the distance.

721
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,360
 There's tons of footage of these Ring Doorbell cameras all over America, just filming a porch

722
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,760
 at three, four in the morning.

723
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,520
 Then all of a sudden there's a bright flash far on the horizon.

724
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,600
 And then there's probably about a minute of nothing.

725
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,760
 And then the shockwave hits and you hear it like this is a explosion.

726
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,180
 They're picking up these explosions, these loud booms.

727
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:39,100
 Now I want to shoot down, crazy academic, I really did enjoy this conspiracy theory.

728
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,100
 I know we've been joking about it, but I think it sounds really cool.

729
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,620
 I mean, I'm not saying again, I think it's sad that these people died.

730
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,420
 But I find it fascinating.

731
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:55,380
 Unfortunately the explosions in Idaho happened on December 3rd.

732
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,620
 So that was, the murders happened on November 13th.

733
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,420
 So not even close.

734
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,400
 And they were 85 miles away from the area.

735
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,600
 So I mean, I guess if you're a Nephilim walking 85 miles is nothing.

736
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,320
 But still they happened way after the murders.

737
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,560
 So it doesn't line up.

738
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,640
 But what I thought was super interesting was I started looking up these mysterious booms.

739
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,680
 They're happening everywhere.

740
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,040
 And nobody knows what they are.

741
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,400
 There have been some theories.

742
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:28,080
 Like there were some explosions in Florida and apparently the top secret Air Force fighter

743
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,620
 jet reconnaissance plane, whatever, returning to base is breaking the sound barrier.

744
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,940
 Not top secret anymore government.

745
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,580
 You have that.

746
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,140
 It's so interesting because I'm reading all these articles and I'm looking into this.

747
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:48,620
 And each article has a different theory that basically like, yeah, kind of answers it.

748
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,620
 But people go, I don't know.

749
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:57,020
 A lot of them say they are meteorites coming in being picked up on these ring doorbell cameras.

750
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,480
 You're seeing a meteorite explode.

751
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,720
 It's like an air burst meteorite.

752
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
 There was another thing I found.

753
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,000
 I didn't know this was an actual thing.

754
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,640
 I don't, I didn't write down the exact term that they use, but what it is basically an

755
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,180
 ice quake where you don't need, you don't, you don't need to be an Antarctica for it.

756
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:19,260
 What happens is when a place gets super cold, super fast, it can actually, yeah, probably

757
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,240
 should have probably should have taken notes on it.

758
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,880
 I was like, wow, that's fascinating.

759
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,280
 And then I didn't write anything down.

760
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,080
 But basically it's just, imagine when you put a freezing, imagine when you put a Coca

761
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,820
 Cola in your freezer and you forget about it and then it explodes.

762
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,860
 It's that, but it's happening to the earth.

763
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,860
 Not the earth is a whole.

764
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,860
 You're not chasing.

765
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,060
 I think I would have heard about that.

766
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,060
 The earth blew up.

767
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,620
 I'm pretty sure you're just making stuff up now.

768
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,260
 No, no, no, it's not the whole earth.

769
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,100
 But they said, and we did have this huge cold snap this winter.

770
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:55,280
 They said if the temperature drops too quickly, it can actually create a loud cracking sound

771
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,160
 coming out of the ground.

772
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,480
 So that could count for some of the booming sounds as well.

773
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
 All of them?

774
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,480
 No.

775
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,360
 But some of them, some of them might be military equipment.

776
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,680
 Some of them might be meteorites.

777
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,680
 Some of them might have been these ice quakes that you guys are researching.

778
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,200
 You're like Jason, I'm pretty sure you got something wrong.

779
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
 Maybe.

780
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,920
 But the point is, is that the phenomenon is real.

781
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,240
 These loud explosions are real.

782
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,220
 They're so real that the media asked or addressed them and they're happening everywhere and

783
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,380
 there's no one answer.

784
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:28,020
 And I thought that's so interesting because this could have been something that the government

785
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,220
 has been trying to cover up.

786
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,380
 I'm sure there's a lot of stuff.

787
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:36,620
 I talk about poor criminals out there getting caught by ring doorbell alarms.

788
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:41,780
 I'm sure there is stuff that the government has covered up for decades.

789
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,260
 And it used to be that they owned access to all the video cameras and now everyone has

790
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
 a video camera in their house.

791
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,400
 They still have access to it by the way.

792
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,840
 The police can log into your camera with no warning and get your footage.

793
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,200
 But now everyone has a camera.

794
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,280
 Everyone has proof of these things.

795
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,520
 Before people would wake up and be like, "Hey Johnny, did you hear that loud boom last night?

796
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
 It was like three in the morning.

797
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,240
 The guy was like, "Well I heard something but I think it was like two in the morning."

798
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,680
 And, "Well you just kind of go about your day."

799
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,340
 Stufffighter is flying in and it's super top secret and you heard a noise.

800
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,900
 And now there's video footage.

801
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,780
 There's actually time stamped footage of when the sound happened.

802
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:29,500
 And everyone in the area, you'd say even if 10% of them had these ring doorbell cameras.

803
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,620
 Government's like, "Okay fine, that was our stupid stufffighter.

804
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,300
 We're trying to keep it in for the rest of the world guys.

805
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,260
 Things love for exposing it.

806
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,980
 Can't we just land a supersonic plane in peace?"

807
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:46,000
 I'm wondering how much stuff like, I don't know what these noises are.

808
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,440
 And it's funny because nobody does.

809
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,760
 The one in Florida they've pretty much been pointed was that jet.

810
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,160
 But the ones in Idaho, the one everywhere, these are happening everywhere.

811
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,480
 Nobody knows what's causing them.

812
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,200
 Might be able to explain some of them but can you explain all of them?

813
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,320
 It's a fascinating story.

814
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,560
 Add it on to a crazy conspiracy.

815
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,880
 Is it possible that four college students were murdered by Bigfoot or some other legendary

816
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,340
 creature that erupted from the bowels of the earth?

817
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,700
 I can see where he got it.

818
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,900
 I can see where he put those pieces together to come up with that theory.

819
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,260
 I don't think it's true.

820
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,260
 It definitely sounds interesting.

821
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,260
 It sounds terrifying.

822
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,340
 Because it's bad enough that we gotta worry about some crazed weirdo breaking into our

823
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,180
 house in the middle of the night and plunging a knife through our throat.

824
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,640
 You wake up with a blade that's already pierced your voice box.

825
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,320
 You can't even scream for help.

826
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
 That's bad enough.

827
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
 Actually, that's so horrific.

828
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,400
 I was gonna go, "What if it's Bigfoot?"

829
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,640
 You're like, "Jayson, I'd much rather have Bigfoot breaking into my house."

830
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,720
 Maybe he strangles me.

831
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,200
 Maybe he rips me apart, limp from limb.

832
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,080
 That's way less terrifying sound than what you just said.

833
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,640
 What do you have to add in that part of the voice box?

834
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
 Do you lunatic?

835
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,140
 Yeah, I probably would rather wake up to have Bigfoot ripping me limb from limb.

836
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,140
 It was kind of...

837
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:15,060
 It means I didn't mean to paint such a horrible picture.

838
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,900
 That was a little grimmer that I thought it was gonna sound when I started saying it,

839
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,660
 but such is life.

840
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,260
