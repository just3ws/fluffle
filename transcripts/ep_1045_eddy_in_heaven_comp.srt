1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 What would you do if you were asleep in one night, catching some z's?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,280
 When all of a sudden you realized something was watching you.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,360
 And then we take a look at the story of the puppy named Eddie, a curious little guy who's

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,580
 found stranded on the side of the road.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,360
 But when a family adopts Eddie and brings him home they have no idea he's going to

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,600
 become a gateway to the world of the dead.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:44,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,920
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world doing whatever you're doing.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,640
 And don't forget it's coming up to the end of season 20 and we are about to take a break.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,480
 I don't think there's going to be any classic episodes this time.

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,680
 I know that I always say that we're going to do them.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,480
 There's so much more work.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,240
 I need to do them at the beginning of the season and I say that every time too.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,480
 But we will have more classic episodes for you at some point in the future of Dead Rabbit

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,680
 Radio because I do love doing them.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
 I'm just done.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,400
 You know by the end of the season I'm so overworked.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,360
 And also a quick reminder, March 24th, 6pm in Seaside, Oregon at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,440
 I will be giving a presentation.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,000
 Why are there no fat ghosts?

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,720
 And I would love to see you guys there.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,640
 It's $15, but that's not just for my speech.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,520
 $15 gives you three days at the Oregon Ghost Convention.

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
 Or Oregon Ghost Conference.

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,920
 I guess I should say the name right.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
 You're walking around.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,520
 Here's a big sign that says Oregon Ghost Conference.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,720
 You're like, "Oh, Jason said it was the Oregon Ghost Convention."

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,760
 So I'm not walking in there.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,400
 Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside, Oregon.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,480
 It's three days and lots of fun of people talking about the world of the paranormal.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
 So I can't wait.

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,600
 I'm going to be stopping by a lot of other speeches.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 I want to hear that.

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,360
 I might attend a workshop or two.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,080
 And I hope to see you guys there.

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,640
 That'll be really cool.

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,600
 Someone who's always cool whether or not he goes to the Ghost Conference or the Ghost

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,800
 Convention, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,960
 And give it up for Lazy A Farms.

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
 Woohoo!

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
 Yeah!

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
 Come on in.

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,520
 An entire plot of land, an entire farm is coming into Dead Rabbit Radio Command.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,280
 Lazy A Farms.

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,840
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,520
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,760
 I really do.

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,880
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,680
 That helps out so, so much.

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,560
 Lazy A Farms.

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,240
 Everyone let's walk around on his plot of land.

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,960
 And you're like, Jason, clearly that's a business.

57
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,480
 You understand that a farm itself is not supporting the Patreon.

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
 I don't know.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
 Weird things have happened.

60
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,720
 We're walking around with hoes and pickaxes and we're like tilling the soil.

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
 A bunch of cows are giving us orders, telling us what to do.

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,640
 It's a pretty cool place, Lazy A Farms.

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,520
 But while we're doing that, I'm going to go ahead and bury the keys for the Dead Rabbit

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,680
 Dune Buggy in the soil.

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,440
 Lazy A Farms uses those keys somehow.

66
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
 I don't know.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
 Grow some vines.

68
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,680
 Drive us all the way out of Dead Rabbit Command.

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,480
 We're headed out to a little boys house.

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,200
 Ding, ding, ding.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,320
 Ding, ding, ding.

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,360
 It's a nice little speedy drive across the world.

73
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,680
 We don't know where the story took place.

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,800
 We don't really even have a timeline.

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 But it took place in the past.

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,120
 It took place sometime between Earth cooling and evolving life on it.

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,360
 And today, this was written, posted online anonymously.

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,400
 We're going to go ahead and call the guy Fred.

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,200
 And Fred said this story happened when he was eight or nine.

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,080
 So we'll figure it minimum 10 years ago.

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,480
 I'd probably say it's in that time period, 10 to 15 years ago.

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,960
 Fred said that he was spending the weekend with his cousins and having a lot of fun.

83
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,480
 He actually didn't have that having a lot of fun part.

84
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
 But you know, I can do a little bit of editorializing.

85
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
 I'm sure it wasn't terrible.

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,320
 Well actually, not that I think about this story.

87
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
 He's kind of terrifying.

88
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,120
 He was spending the weekend with his cousins and he was sleeping on the couch.

89
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,800
 And this was the house of his aunt and uncle and their kids.

90
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,040
 And we'll go ahead and call him Uncle Jack.

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,000
 He's the other named character in the story.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,360
 He goes to the house, Uncle Jack's house.

93
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,680
 The way it was laid out was you had a front door.

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,640
 Obviously, he's like, no, he had a climb up sheet rope where you could only enter on

95
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
 the second floor.

96
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,140
 Had a front door.

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,200
 And the way that the front door was set up was there was a window at the top of the door

98
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 frame.

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 So you have the door.

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,800
 You have a nice big window to let the sun in.

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,640
 And that would not be notable in any house.

102
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,640
 Right, obviously he's pointing that out for a reason in this story.

103
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
 You're like, what?

104
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 That's weird.

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
 I've been in a dozen houses like that.

106
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,680
 No one's ever been, hey, when you visit, make sure to check out the window above the

107
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
 front door.

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
 He's like, what?

109
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,280
 Is that the best thing in the house?

110
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
 They're like, yeah.

111
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,720
 There's a window above the front door.

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,040
 So anyways, Fred is spending the weekend here.

113
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,440
 He's sleeping on the couch.

114
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
 His eyes are closed.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
 His little eight or nine year old eyelids are tightly shut.

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,040
 But he sees, well, it's like that weird thing.

117
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,440
 You know when your eyes are closed and someone's shining a light?

118
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
 Probably me.

119
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,760
 You're trying to get a nice sleep on top of you with a flashlight.

120
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,360
 I was like, wake up, wake up.

121
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,960
 You know how when you have your eyes closed, but someone turns on the light, even though

122
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,080
 your eyes are closed, you can kind of see the light through your eyelids?

123
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,560
 And like, before you even wake up, you're kind of annoyed that the light's on.

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 It's that.

125
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
 That's the sensation he's having.

126
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,280
 His eyes are shut, but he kind of wakes up in the middle of the night because he senses

127
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:47,920
 a light is on a very bright light, a very bright green light, which would be more alarming.

128
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,440
 There should be far more alarming.

129
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,120
 You may think, no, it's not.

130
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,320
 You may be a leprechaun and you're like, oh, my lights are green.

131
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,440
 Imagine if you woke up in the middle of the night and there was, you shut off all the

132
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,360
 lights and all of these scenarios are terrifying.

133
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,800
 I always make up the scariest.

134
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,960
 Imagine all the lights in your house are off.

135
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,360
 You wake up in the middle of the night and you can see underneath the crack of your bedroom

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,960
 door that your hall light's on.

137
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,400
 That'd be spooky.

138
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,520
 But imagine, if I chase the door, I don't care what color the light is.

139
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,560
 If I shut them all off, I woke up in the middle of the night and it was a strobe light.

140
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
 Well, see, that's the thing.

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,640
 It'd be scarier because then you'd think aliens are in my hallway.

142
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,120
 If it was a green light coming from underneath your doorway, you would go paranormal.

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,960
 If there's a red light, you'd go demons.

144
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,160
 You would associate different light with different phenomenon.

145
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,880
 All of them would be equally terrifying.

146
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,120
 But if you were over at your uncle's house, an unfamiliar house, and there was a green

147
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,040
 glowing light, you'd think, oh, maybe someone has a really bright alarm clock.

148
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,040
 Maybe someone's experimenting with radiated rods nearby.

149
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,600
 But whatever it is, whatever's going on, it's annoying.

150
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,080
 And Fred's trying to sleep and he opens his eyes up and he sees, of course, like he thought

151
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,560
 with his eyes closed.

152
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,840
 The entire living room is bathed in a green glow.

153
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,440
 And then he almost immediately realizes the source of the glow.

154
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,040
 It's not a alarm clock.

155
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
 It's not radiation.

156
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 Well, it might be radiation.

157
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,560
 I can't really think about it.

158
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:30,000
 But he realizes, like, he looks around and his eyes settle on that window above the front

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,360
 door.

160
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,400
 And what he sees is so impossible.

161
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,800
 He goes, I must just be dreaming.

162
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 That's not possible.

163
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,520
 I'm going to go back to sleep.

164
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,600
 So he closes his eyes.

165
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,360
 He holds them tight.

166
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
 And the green glow is continuing to permeate his eyelids.

167
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,800
 And then he begins to get this sensation that he is being watched.

168
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,960
 That tried and true sensation we've all been through where we feel like someone's watching

169
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,040
 him.

170
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,760
 And now he's like, OK, this isn't fake.

171
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,680
 It's impossible.

172
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,440
 But it's real.

173
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,000
 He kind of takes his eyes.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,120
 He's kind of squinting.

175
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,560
 He's kind of, like, barely looking.

176
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,160
 He doesn't want it to know he's awake.

177
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,600
 Fred does not want this thing to know that he is terrified.

178
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:45,040
 What Fred saw when he first opened his eyes was a massive green eyeball floating outside

179
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,640
 the front door window.

180
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,040
 So the front door itself is what?

181
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,680
 We're talking about six, seven feet tall.

182
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
 It's six feet tall.

183
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
 We bump our heads all the time.

184
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
 It's about seven, eight feet tall, right?

185
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,000
 So this giant eyeball is floating about nine or 10 feet off the ground.

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 It's giant.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,880
 If it was a normal sized eyeball floating 10 feet off the ground, you're like, ah, whatever.

188
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
 You're all trying to attack it with a place water.

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
 But it's giant.

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,360
 It's a giant green floating eyeball.

191
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
 It's taking up almost the entire window.

192
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,360
 So you imagine it's floating about nine feet off the ground.

193
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,000
 And you could say it's maybe four feet in diameter, maybe a little bit bigger than a

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 basketball.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,840
 You're like, what basketball do you play with?

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,040
 That's actually huge.

197
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,680
 Four feet in diameter would be a massive basketball.

198
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,520
 The globe trotters are like, ah, yeah, it's funny looking, but we'll hurt our backs if

199
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
 we try dribbling that thing.

200
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
 Big, big eyeball floating.

201
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,560
 And when he first saw, if you saw a giant eyeball, if you woke him in the middle of

202
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,680
 the night, there's a giant eyeball floating outside your house, you would go, I must be

203
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,880
 dreaming, that's impossible.

204
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,640
 If you saw what looked like an intruder, if he had just seen the green glow, he probably

205
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,600
 would have been more curious of what was out there.

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,120
 Giant eyeballs don't exist, but when he tried going back to sleep, when he shut his eyes,

207
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,300
 that's when he felt the eyeball was watching him intently.

208
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,760
 And so Fred is laying on this couch and he has his eyes closed like he's pretending to

209
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,120
 sleep, but he's kind of squinting through them because he wants to like double check.

210
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
 Is that what I saw?

211
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,260
 Is there really a giant eyeball out there?

212
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:22,960
 And he said when I was squinting and I'm looking at the eyeball, the eyeball twitched.

213
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,400
 It had a physical reaction as if it knew for a fact that Fred was looking at it.

214
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,800
 He said it made a physical movement and I felt now that it knew that not only was I

215
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,160
 awake, but I was steady in it.

216
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,920
 I was trying to figure out what it was.

217
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,280
 And Fred just begins screaming at the top of his lungs.

218
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,000
 He's being screaming at the top of his lungs.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,900
 That's the middle of the night.

220
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,660
 And his uncle comes storming down the stairs.

221
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,060
 Not like oh no, I gotta protect this blood of mine.

222
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,780
 I gotta protect this nephew.

223
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,780
 He's one of the pack.

224
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
 No.

225
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,540
 He hears a little boy screaming and he's pissed off, which is fair, right?

226
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,380
 You're not gonna assume oh, the burglar must have gotten into my house and is killing my

227
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
 nephew.

228
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,460
 You would be running down the stairs being like great, I have a little kid over here.

229
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,580
 He's in a new house and something scared him.

230
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,720
 The burglar, the burglar, yes, he can be scary kids, but as long as he just steals the stuff

231
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
 we don't use anymore, everything's okay.

232
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,960
 Uncle Jack comes downstairs and he's actually really upset because he just woke up.

233
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
 He was deep asleep.

234
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,000
 All of a sudden he heard this little kid scream and it's not even yours.

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,040
 And Uncle Jack enters the room and grumpily says what is it?

236
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,560
 And Jack just points at the window and goes look.

237
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,140
 And Uncle Jack follows the finger and looks at the front door and looks at the window

238
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,900
 and takes a step backwards.

239
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,940
 He's startled by what he sees.

240
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,700
 He has a physical reaction to it.

241
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,980
 This wasn't just the nightmare.

242
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,820
 This wasn't just the hallucination or the trick of the light.

243
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,700
 Uncle Jack sees it too and he steps back.

244
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,580
 And Uncle Jack's like what is that?

245
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,480
 And Fred goes it looks like an eye.

246
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,020
 And it's still just floating there.

247
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,180
 Now there's two witnesses who are watching this phenomenon.

248
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,660
 And Uncle Jack to his credit walks towards the eye.

249
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,900
 I don't know if I would have done that.

250
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,820
 I might have scooped the kid up and ran upstairs and fucked all the torus.

251
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,260
 I don't know.

252
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,220
 Maybe I would have walked towards the eye.

253
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,860
 Maybe I'm braver than I think.

254
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,280
 But Uncle Jack walks towards the eye and he puts his hand on the door handle and he opens

255
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,200
 the door up.

256
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,040
 And right when he does that the eyeball vanishes.

257
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,800
 Uncle Jack shuts the door and then we have probably the most realistic conversation that

258
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,600
 could happen in one of these situations.

259
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,120
 We run into it all the time.

260
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,020
 If you're an experienced of the paranormal this is something you run into all the time.

261
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,380
 If you're a fan of the paranormal I'm sure you've read accounts like this as well.

262
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,980
 Or wondered why did they do that?

263
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,420
 Giant green eye floating nine feet off the ground bathing the entire room in green light.

264
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,140
 Two witnesses and adult and a child in two different parts of the room.

265
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,980
 You know one's much taller, one's laying down.

266
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,980
 It's not a trick of the lights, not a hallucination, not a dream.

267
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,280
 Giant green eyeball door opens up and disappears.

268
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,760
 Fred goes what was that?

269
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,560
 And Uncle Jack's exact quote what Fred told us he said was quote I don't know it's gone

270
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
 now.

271
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,520
 It's gone now go to sleep.

272
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,960
 And then Uncle Jack just left.

273
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,080
 Uncle Jack just left the living room walked up the stairs and went back to his bedroom.

274
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,780
 And Fred was like dude I can't do that what are you talking about there's a giant green

275
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,580
 eyeball out there.

276
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,340
 And he goes I spent the rest of the night just looking at the window.

277
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,700
 I couldn't go back to sleep.

278
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,260
 He goes it never showed back up.

279
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,900
 And the next morning when we were sitting around the breakfast table I asked my uncle

280
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,580
 what was that?

281
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,100
 Like what was up with that giant eyeball that was floating in and Uncle Jack goes I must

282
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,380
 have just been a trick of the light.

283
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,420
 It must have been something 100% explainable.

284
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,640
 It's interesting because when you do look at accounts of the paranormal people will

285
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,080
 do things where they'll have these extraordinary events and they'll go back to sleep they'll

286
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,400
 have these extraordinary events and then they continue about their day.

287
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,040
 They'll go shopping and then they'll come home and then they will hit them.

288
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,640
 The terror the excitement whatever they actually went through.

289
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,040
 People act in interesting ways and most of the time it's avoidance.

290
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,860
 It's like that can't be true and that's what Fred did at first too remember he saw it.

291
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,100
 He was deep asleep saw the green light then saw the eyeball and goes I must be dreaming

292
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,280
 that's not real.

293
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,820
 And then the event intensified from there.

294
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,020
 It was the same thing with Uncle Jack he's like it was nothing like even though he clearly

295
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:16,640
 saw it and he had a physical reaction to it like he it scared him he stepped backwards

296
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,080
 he was scared and then he walked to it opened the door and it went away and his first thing

297
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,960
 was I don't know what that was but it's gone go back to sleep.

298
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,880
 It's super interesting isn't it it would have been one thing if Fred was the only witness

299
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,040
 Uncle Jack would be like just go sleep it was a nightmare and Fred could be like it

300
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,640
 but to this day I know it was a nightmare.

301
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,120
 No there were two witnesses and even though the adult saw it he goes whatever whatever

302
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,840
 there is probably some eyeball from another dimension just ignore it and then the next

303
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,640
 day he completely dismissed it he's definitely the the uncle's not posting online being like

304
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,480
 you won't believe what happened.

305
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 I was 30 years old and a giant eyeball no you just went on with his life maybe he thought

306
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,560
 about it later maybe he didn't.

307
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,400
 And what's interesting too is I found when I was looking more into this there were a

308
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,080
 couple different people who also described giant floating eyeballs you'd see other people

309
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,520
 comment on the story and one girl said she opened up her closet once and there was a

310
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,440
 giant floating eyeball in her closet another girl said that she would wake up this one

311
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
 was particularly creepy.

312
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,840
 I mean I don't have a giant eyeball in her closet is anything to sneeze at or outside

313
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,600
 your house but she goes this one seems more malicious she goes I would always sleep with

314
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,600
 my bedroom door kind of cracked open and one night I woke up and there was a giant eyeball

315
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,240
 floating in the hallway of the house that also gave off a green glow but she said this

316
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,400
 one floated in such a way that it looked like it was trying to peek over the top of the

317
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:02,720
 open bedroom door like it was making a attempt to spy on her like it was kind of like looking

318
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,320
 around like a pervert in a Walmart dressing room and the reason why I pointed out you

319
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,760
 could go well Jason the first eyeball was looking at a sleeping eight year old boy I

320
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,920
 mean that's pretty perverted too.

321
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,760
 When you have paranormal phenomenon sometimes it is like my experience with the shadow people

322
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,040
 the shadow men I'll put it up so the show notes they were completely aloof they didn't

323
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,560
 care my experiences with them was they did not care that you were there they didn't care

324
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,040
 that you observed them it was basically the same thing as a squirrel sitting on a rock

325
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,680
 watching the river the river doesn't care it's simply a phenomenon that it neither hates

326
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,960
 nor loves the squirrels it's simply happening in this place and time and it's being observed

327
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,040
 by this squirrel so an eyeball floating outside of a house could be a neutral phenomenon it

328
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,000
 didn't like being looked at for sure and it disappeared when the door opened but that's

329
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,880
 fairly neutral the eyeball kind of angling for a better view of a little girl sleeping

330
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,440
 in her bedroom that seems creepy to be fair they're both creepy but you know what I mean

331
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,800
 like one of them the one floating in the closet that seems fairly neutral a neutral phenomenon

332
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,160
 then you can have helpful paranormal phenomenon which I think happens so often we don't even

333
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,920
 recognize it sometimes it's super dramatic and we'll talk about guardian angels but I

334
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,880
 think sometimes it's just you see something you're walking down the road and you see something

335
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,280
 that makes you smile you see giant green eyeball being dribbled by the Harlem Globetrotters

336
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,120
 and you're like ah I think sometimes good paranormal events are so minor they just kind

337
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,760
 of like lighten our mood you get home and your favorite television show like you didn't

338
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,520
 miss a minute of it right when you got home Jason no one does that anymore you boomer

339
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,120
 we all watch stuff on streaming you know what I mean I'm sure there are a little paranormal

340
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,120
 things that happen quite often that we just account to luck or being like wow everything

341
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,560
 just kind of worked out I think you could qualify that stuff as good paranormal evil

342
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,960
 paranormal stuff obviously you know murders people getting chopped up by demons people

343
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,680
 falling it deeper and deeper into addictions or depression and completely destroying their

344
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,760
 lives and the lives of their family all that stuff that would be more of the negative even

345
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,080
 I think a spooky ghost floating around your house they don't he's like I'm sorry to make

346
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,320
 you a hero in attic I'm just a spooky ghost he has such high standards Jason I just wanted

347
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,000
 to float around and be spooky and now I gotta take you down to the casino make you sit in

348
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,160
 front of a slot machine for 10 hours dude you can have just spooky ghosts spooky noises

349
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,200
 things to scare you and then things that actually ruin your life yeah but I again like I think

350
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,000
 it's interesting because the glowing green eye how malicious is it and how widespread

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
 is it to it's really interesting when someone comes out and says hey here's the story I

352
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,080
 have and then you see other people talk about it some of them could be made up because they're

353
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,720
 kind of hanging on to the story but some of them a story like this like again we talk

354
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,640
 about this all the time to show where do you classify it it's not a ghost it's not a UFO

355
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,000
 it's not a cryptic there's dedicated organizations for those so if you see an alien kill your

356
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,280
 dog like we talked about on Friday and Monday's episode you contact Mufon if you see Bigfoot

357
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,880
 you contact the Bigfoot research group if you see you know a ghost you contact ghost

358
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,360
 researchers but who do you call for a giant green eyeball so who knows how common this

359
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,960
 is probably not super common but it may have happened more than just a few times it was

360
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,600
 posted here and Fred went online by the name Fitzy the artist that was the name they posted

361
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,080
 this on I wanted to give them credit for that but interesting story what is the phenomenon

362
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,840
 and is it going to be watching you tonight like I hope so you buy some new underwear you're

363
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,880

368
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,560
 road we're going to a specific road we're going to a specific road again another story

369
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,520
 we don't have a location for or a time and this story might pull on your heartstrings

370
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:35,160
 a little bit so if you're currently going through a bout of depression be warned also

371
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,400
 if you love talks like Jason what is it just got done with close encounters of a canine

372
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:50,160
 kind of week let's take a look at this story I find this story beautiful but let's take

373
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,980
 a look at it doesn't start off beautiful it starts off quite grim we're going to take

374
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,960
 a look at Joey's family all these names except for the dogs name the dogs name is real but

375
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,800
 all these names we've had to create are supposed to be honestly Joey tells this story he said

376
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:12,720
 one day my stepdad Philip was driving down the road and he sees a little lump on the

377
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,560
 side of the road little he's like oh that's my favorite that's my favorite furgy song

378
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,320
 he's all humming it as he's walking up to the lump he's like my home be home be homes

379
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,780
 my lumps my lovely lady and then he looks and the lump it's not a lovely lady lump although

380
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,620
 that would be disgusting too there's just a boob sitting on the side of the road he's

381
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:40,260
 like ah it's not what I expected either what he sees is a puppy but this puppy is not in

382
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:51,300
 good shape this puppy because you're my friend I'm not going to go into detail but apparently

383
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,120
 what it seemed like okay I'm not going to tell you that just admit the puppy is not

384
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,680
 in good shape and Philip goes Phil is all set in imagining in great detail what could

385
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,680
 have happened and he's like I'm not going to tell anyone that Philip takes the dog to

386
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,320
 the vet and he goes hey this isn't my dog I found him by the side of the road and the

387
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,680
 vets like dear God you know what happened to this dog and he starts talking about it

388
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,720
 and Philip's like I don't want to know just fix the dog just fix this dog please and the

389
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:30,540
 vet goes we will rebuild this dog and so they did they spent a lot of money but Eddie was

390
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:37,380
 ready to go they're like back to the road buddy's like and they named this puppy Eddie

391
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,740
 and Philip goes you know what we did a lot of money on this dog let's take him home

392
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,480
 let's consider him an investment alright I'm off from my taxes let's bring good old Eddie

393
00:23:48,480 --> 00:24:00,680
 home so they take Eddie home and at this time Joey is a little boy and Joey and Eddie kind

394
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,920
 of start growing up alongside each other going on little adventures he's like he's like you

395
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:11,900
 want to go for a walk down the road and he's like whatever in the liquid I know you can

396
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,900
 talk Joey and Eddie are growing up together but Eddie although he loves hanging out with

397
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:24,780
 everyone he is Philip's dog he loves Philip so much and and Joey goes we all had our

398
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,700
 time to sit and pet Eddie chase him around Eddie is constantly hanging out with Philip

399
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:37,240
 and wherever you found Philip you found Eddie right next to him it was like a true bond

400
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,920
 but he but everyone it wasn't like he growled at everybody else but you know Philip comes

401
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,000
 home from work and a little puppies walking next to him he was to have to pull my two

402
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,960
 yes a little hat a little hard hat on his face is all dirty and when Philip comes home

403
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
 from work Eddie runs up to him sits in his lap and they sit there and they watch the

404
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,940
 news together prices right whatever and that's just life that's life for Eddie he's found

405
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:09,340
 his home he's found his family he's found his dad Philip little Eddie loves this family

406
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:16,340
 and Joey eventually it's time for him to go to college and when Joey is at college he

407
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:26,680
 gets a phone call from his mom saying Eddie passed away last night and obviously Joey's

408
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,280
 heart broken right like he this was like a member of the family he grew up with Joey

409
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,040
 and in the back of his mind he's thinking oh my god what about my stepdad like it's

410
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:44,880
 hurts me it hurts my heart that Eddie is past but I can't imagine what my stepdad's

411
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,660
 gone through like it was like he rescued this puppy this puppy was going to die and my

412
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,140
 dad just happened to pull over and pick him up and not only save his life but then bring

413
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:04,060
 him home and make him part of our life and Joey says this happened so suddenly him dying

414
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,100
 and then being buried in the pet cemetery he goes I felt like I didn't have a chance

415
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,700
 to say goodbye I definitely didn't get a chance to be with him in his final moments and he

416
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:21,000
 doesn't say how Eddie died but you know probably natural causes I think he would have included

417
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,400
 if he involved the road but anyways he just says that Eddie passes away and it all happened

418
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,320
 so quickly he didn't get to say goodbye to Eddie either while he was getting sicker or

419
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,400
 even after you know like at the funeral ceremony for the dog and all that stuff so he felt that

420
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:44,140
 he had lost something when a piece of the grieving process he Joey felt like he wasn't

421
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:50,340
 he wasn't part of that you know he said a few months later though Joey's still in college

422
00:26:50,340 --> 00:27:00,820
 and he has a dream he has a dream that he's standing outside in a fairly unfamiliar place

423
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:10,580
 he just knows that it's this outside location and there's this trail and trotting down the

424
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:19,080
 trail is Eddie and he sees Eddie come towards him and he's so relieved he's like Eddie oh

425
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:28,000
 my god oh I've missed you so much and he looks down and Eddie is a little worse for where

426
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:38,500
 but he's happy his tail is wagging he's doing little puppy dance his hair is matted and

427
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:45,740
 dirty and as Joey is petting Eddie he realizes that Eddie's flesh is also a little rotten

428
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:55,740
 probably probably stop petting him at that point dream or no dream but he realizes like

429
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,720
 what he's looking at is Eddie is dead even in the dream but Eddie is so happy and so

430
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,240
 excited it doesn't matter Joey's gonna take this moment to be with Eddie just a little

431
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,560
 bit longer and they begin walking down this trail and the whole time Eddie is just wagging

432
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:23,840
 his little tail so happy he's back with his buddy Joey his brother Joey and Joey said

433
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,780
 the farther we got down the trail the more excited Eddie got started prancing a little

434
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:41,500
 bit more tail wagging even more so excited to be on this journey with Joey until eventually

435
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:49,380
 they come to this giant wall of mist and Joey said that it covered the entire horizon you

436
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,000
 could look both ways it would go on forever and when he looked up he saw it reached far

437
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:07,160
 past the sky the wall of mist was silent peaceful there was a beauty to this barrier

438
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:18,800
 but Joey knew that this was the end of the trip Eddie walks up to the wall of mist and

439
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,920
 then turns around and walks back to Joey Joey reaches down to pet Eddie again and Eddie

440
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:36,380
 just licks Joey's hand Joey picks up Eddie they do a couple little nose kisses and he

441
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:43,020
 sets Eddie back on the ground and Eddie begins to whine just a little bit just for a moment

442
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:58,080
 and he looks back up at Joey walks back towards the wall of mist and as he gets to the mist

443
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,720
 he begins doing his little happy dog dance again his little prance that Joey had seen

444
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,760
 so many times before in the moments when Eddie was the happiest he would do this little dance

445
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:17,420
 Eddie walks through the wall of mist to the point that now it's just a silhouette of a

446
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:28,260
 dog all detail has been lost to the fog this little dog is dancing around in the mist and

447
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:40,340
 begins jumping up and down as a humanoid silhouette shows up Joey sees Eddie jump up and down

448
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:52,280
 as this shadowy apparition appears next to him Joey takes a step forward himself he wants

449
00:30:52,280 --> 00:31:03,200
 to see what's beyond the mist what's on the other side of this unending wall he reaches

450
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:16,380
 down he puts his hand against the mist and his cell phone goes off he wakes up his cell

451
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:28,040
 phones ringing he reaches over looks at the number answers the call it's his mother she's

452
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:44,320
 sobbing Philip just died of a heart attack it's a fascinating on so many levels it has

453
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,760
 what we expect from a traditional ghost story it has all of these elements in it the idea

454
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,500
 of dreaming of a dead loved one coming back to visit you one last time very traditional

455
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,940
 ghost experience we've had a couple stories this week I didn't plan it this way definitely

456
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,120
 didn't plan all the dead dogs in the past two weeks but of people we covered yesterday

457
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,380
 about the boss at the work site who died and nobody knew he died but they saw his ghost

458
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,920
 the story has that type of element as well the implication is that the humanoid figure

459
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,520
 on the other side of the mist was Philip it's never explicitly said but I think that's the

460
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:31,420
 implication and that was this dream and Eddie was going and he was excited for multiple

461
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:38,860
 reasons to see Joey again but Eddie also was there to walk with Philip in the afterlife

462
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:47,640
 they were inseparable and now they would be together in paradise this is one of those

463
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,980
 stories I mean when you look at it when you look at this person's posting history they

464
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,400
 haven't posted in a long time but it's not a ton of spooky stories it's not a ton of

465
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,480
 actually it's zero this is the only one there otherwise they're just constantly kind of

466
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,980
 walking around reddit and every so often they're in a subreddit called retconned which is actually

467
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,720
 a new version of the Mandela effect it's kind of an itch I've been spending a lot of time

468
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,080
 on that subreddit there's some interesting stuff coming out of there but you know what

469
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,760
 I mean he's not like on the creepypasta subreddit he's not like in then the next day Eddie returned

470
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,140
 to the Indiana watch a magical watch that allowed him to control a UFO he's not constantly adding

471
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,140
 to the narrative story could be made up but it's also possibly true in the world of the

472
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,460
 paranormal nothing in the story is out of place for the most part it just seems like

473
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,780
 a traditional ghost story and it's one that I think depending on your point of view is

474
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:48,780
 either sweet or sad because I think you can hear the story and go well that's just so

475
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,480
 sad that you know like Eddie and Philip are dead or any story involving a dead dog is

476
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,200
 sad I don't know why you can't I don't know why you can't get into your head Jason listen

477
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,640
 I love dogs I don't eat dogs I think the story is sweet I think the story is sweet I think

478
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:12,400
 the story is a reminder that death is not the end I think that's the reason why the appeal

479
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,920
 of a lot of ghost stories I think even when they come back as monsters is like death is

480
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,780
 not the end that I'm gonna watch until your death and then I'm gonna keep on you because

481
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,020
 that's not the end I'm gonna bully you in the afterlife as well you're like ah you know

482
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:34,260
 what I mean like to know that there's something after this I think it's a sweet I think it's

483
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:41,580
 an endearing thought I think it's it's calming in a way and I know there's not everyone's

484
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,000
 like that some people go I think it's more intriguing to think that this is all that

485
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,960
 there is and when you die it's over I mean to each their own right but and they may hear

486
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,760
 this story they may go well it's really the story about a kid whose dog died and then

487
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,520
 his stepdad died and everything else was a hallucination everything else was just a

488
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,920
 dream Jason this whole thing took place in the dream like what's the paranormal aspect

489
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,980
 it's funny now that I say that the only paranormal aspect of the dream is the fact that he knew

490
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,500
 well actually okay this is super interesting because this is part of this this show has

491
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,220
 no script if you guys haven't guessed that thinking about it this way and I could go

492
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,940
 on forever so we're gonna have to wrap this up because I just thought of this there is

493
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:34,220
 no element in this story that is paranormal zero not saying that it has to be someone's

494
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,680
 like oh no my kid died as like well but did they get killed by a ghost they're like no

495
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,120
 I was like I don't tell me about it you I was reporting on it as a paranormal story and

496
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:51,480
 I made all of these the way I read it was it was the ghost of Eddie coming back to say

497
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:59,800
 goodbye to Joey one more time and then led Joey to the wall that separates the world

498
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,540
 of the living in the world of the dead and on the other side of that wall was now Eddie

499
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:12,100
 and then a humanoid figure appeared who Joey at no point I'm gonna double check because

500
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,060
 I don't even know if he specifically says I think that was my stepdad let me double

501
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:23,060
 check that here it says then he turns around again and starts to do that happy dog prance

502
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,820
 toward the wall until he finally passes through it I can sort of see his outline jumping up

503
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:33,200
 and down excitedly next to a human shaped figure I jog after Eddie and reach my hand

504
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,000
 out to touch the wall hoping I'll be able to pass through it too that's when my cell

505
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,640
 phone rings in real life waking me up when I answer it my mom is on the other end crying

506
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,800
 my stepdad has just died of a heart attack so he never even makes that claim and that

507
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,640
 interesting the way I read the story was that the dog had come back from the afterlife to

508
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:02,300
 greet say say goodbye to Joey and then Phillip showed up and was on the other side of this

509
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,060
 wall and that's why Eddie was doing such a little happy dance and then Joey wakes up

510
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,500
 and finds out that his stepdad is just out of a heart attack but there is zero it's so

511
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:19,300
 that this is interesting because as a paranormal guy right as a paranormal researcher I defaulted

512
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:29,840
 to that because it had so many hallmarks of a paranormal story but it wasn't a paranormal

513
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,880
 story was it just a dream was the human could you argue the humanoid figure wasn't him knowing

514
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,000
 in advance even just by a few seconds that his stepdad was going to die like I'm assuming

515
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,880
 the stepdad died the mom wasn't calling him as he was having the heart attack I'm assuming

516
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,560
 the stepdad had died and the ambulance just picked him up and all that stuff and then they

517
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,900
 get the phone call but who knows it's an interesting story now to think about it like there may

518
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,100
 it may be a paranormal story of ghosts and premonitions of death even if it's just by

519
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,940
 a couple seconds a couple minutes before that phone call right it's still a premonition

520
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,700
 it could be story that or could just be the story of a dream and the humanoid figure on

521
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,940
 the other side of the wall was not Phillip it was just another guardian spirit there

522
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,440
 with Eddie that's super interesting that's just an I think looking on that that's an

523
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,320
 insight into how I read things my psyche right it was posted someone asked the question what

524
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,640
 is the most paranormal or unexplainable event you have ever witnessed and people were responding

525
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,520
 to that question so it wasn't unexplainable you could say it was unexplained you could

526
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:41,700
 say it was paranormal my view on a life after death which I believe in if you asked me what

527
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,540
 exactly is that I got like I don't know I don't know how it works I don't know if it's

528
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,780
 reincarnation I don't know if it's heaven like a literal place called heaven if it's

529
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:59,420
 some sort of paradise world who knows I don't know but so this story I read it and I go

530
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,860
 oh these are the things that I already think about the after there's gonna be a lot of

531
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:09,120
 dancing dogs better there better be fascinating story the ghost story unexplained event or

532
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,480
 just simply a dream that I've read not only did I read too much into but I told it in

533
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,520
 such a way that led it to maybe you also going oh this is about ghosts I think I even said

534
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,920
 in the beginning this ghost brings home open support all to the other world or whatever

535
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,760
 it said in the beginning so that's interesting I almost feel like this is a medic commentary

536
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,980
 how did you experience that story was the whole time you think oh it's just a dream

537
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:40,180
 or oh Jason's making a joke about dogs on roads again Nick come on dude just tell the

538
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,380
 story but fascinating and shows kind of my view of the world and how I can lead like

539
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,560
 again if you weren't predisposed I don't want to get too meta but if you weren't going to

540
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,100
 be predisposed to hearing that story and thinking it the way I did did I tell it in such a way

541
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,640
 that you didn't have an option that's all real fascinating stuff but not as to me not

542
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,160
 as fascinating as the story I really love the story of Eddie and Philip and it's a story

543
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,640
 that love lives on even after death love does not die with death I truly do believe that

544
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:23,640
