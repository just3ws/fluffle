1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
 When a woman agrees to work with law enforcement, she has no idea she's about to tumble head

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,240
 first into a satanic conspiracy.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,260
 And then we travel up to British Columbia to meet two men fishing on a lake.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,680
 Everything was going according to plan until the aliens arrived.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,480
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:32,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,840
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,320
 Let's go ahead and introduce our pilot for this episode, Nathaniel Williams.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
 Wooo!

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,080
 Yeah everyone, give him a big round of applause.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,520
 This is somebody's first episode.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,640
 They're like what?

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,920
 Why are we clapping for people?

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,720
 We're clapping for people because Nathaniel's awesome.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,560
 Nathaniel sent me two books.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,960
 He was flying to Carpenter Cofter on Monday's episode for sending me a book by Robert Anton

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
 Wilson.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,720
 It's an encyclopedia of conspiracies called Everything is Under Control.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,280
 And then I wanted to give him another ride in the Carpenter Cofter.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
 He sent two books.

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
 He gets two rides.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,840
 Passport to Magonia is what he sent me.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,120
 This is a UFO classic book by Jacques Valet.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
 Huge.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
 This is huge.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,360
 I've never read it actually.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,600
 I'm familiar with his work.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 I've read articles from him.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,960
 I've seen interviews with him but I've never read this book.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,560
 Nathaniel, thank you so much for sending this to me.

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
 Fantastic.

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
 He's the guy.

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,720
 I really agree with a lot of the stuff that Jacques Valet says.

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,240
 That it's not necessarily extraterrestrial but ultra-terrestrial.

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,760
 That these veins that we call aliens are from other dimensions.

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,880
 And he connects it into fey folklore and all that stuff.

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,320
 Can't wait to read this book.

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,760
 Nathaniel, thank you so much for sending this stuff to me.

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,640
 If you guys can't afford to pay to run, if you guys can't buy me books, that's totally

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,880
 fine too.

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,720
 Just help spread the word about the show.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,840
 That really, really helps out a lot.

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,120
 And if you do want to buy me a book, Amazon, Wishlist and the show notes, but you don't

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
 have to, right?

48
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,480
 I appreciate these gifts but I just appreciate you taking time out to listen to this show.

49
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,400
 Nathaniel, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,920
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

51
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,440
 We're going to glide all the way out to Oklahoma.

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:25,040
 We cover a lot of gangstalking stuff on this show.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,240
 I mean over the course of 870 some odd episodes, it's not like we've had a gangstalking week.

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,320
 At least I don't think we have.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,680
 Every time I do a gangstalking episode, I get an email or a YouTube comment or someone

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,080
 mentioning something on my TikTok, whatever, saying, "Is there any real examples of gangstalking?"

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 I always get the same question.

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
 It's a good question, definitely.

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
 Because we look at these really outlandish gangstalking stories and the answer is always

60
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 the same.

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,440
 Yeah, there actually are real life examples of people being gangstalked.

62
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 Stalked by a gang.

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,600
 Literally, gangstalking is the legal definition of it is three or more people tracking your

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 movements.

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 There actually is a term for it.

66
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,560
 So if you owe money to the mob or if the police are looking for you, those are all considered

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
 gangstalking.

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,880
 It's not really like when the LAPD is trying to chase the suspects you don't hear on the

69
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,560
 news, they're gangstalking this man.

70
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
 He just robbed the bank.

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,600
 But it does fit into that.

72
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,280
 Basically, it's an organized observation of you.

73
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,600
 With the gangstalking community, they put a little added twist onto it, though.

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,520
 When they talk about gangstalking and the gangstalking subculture, it's a government

75
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,720
 or sometimes a corporate run.

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,960
 Sometimes it's even just local government, but the point is to drive you crazy.

77
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,640
 So instead of like black SUVs driving around your town because you've pissed off the Russian

78
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,040
 mob and when they catch you, they're going to beat you up, right?

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,480
 That's what would happen in a real gangstalking situation.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:02,240
 In the quote unquote gangstalking world, it's every 10th yellow car that passes you on a

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,480
 Wednesday, that's the gangstalker.

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,440
 And what happens is you notice it and when you tell people about it, people don't believe

83
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,480
 you and it makes you sound crazy.

84
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,400
 And they're slowly trying to drive you crazy.

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,880
 All these little weird things will happen and maybe you go to pick up your cereal one

86
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,240
 day and it seems like the bottom of the box is not glued together right and cereal pours

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
 all over the floor.

88
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
 Hilarious, right?

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
 That's hilarious.

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,040
 They would attribute that to a gangstalker broken in their house, removed the glue or

91
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,960
 even deployed some sort of glue eating microbe into their house to eat the glue on the bottom

92
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,760
 of all their boxes and it's simply to irritate you so much that you snap.

93
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,080
 So when we talk about gangstalking, when we talk about gangstalking generally in the

94
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,320
 world of conspiracy theories, we talk about that, we talk about the weird versions.

95
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,360
 People do get gangstalked all the time by law enforcement and by gangs.

96
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
 It happens quite often.

97
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,040
 I think you could argue that most of our jobs were gangstalked by middle management, right?

98
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,960
 There's three or more people observing what you're doing.

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,440
 So when we talk about and people always ask that question and it's a great question, is

100
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
 there any real examples of gangstalking?

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,840
 Yes, that.

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,320
 So this is an interesting story because I came across this a while ago and it fits right

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,720
 into the middle of those two things.

104
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
 Fits right into the middle of those two things.

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,760
 Now with gangs, it's interesting with gangstalking stories when I cover them, I didn't realize

106
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
 this until I was looking at this one.

107
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,080
 I assume that what they are telling me happened.

108
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,280
 I just don't think that there's a nefarious meaning behind it.

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,560
 So if someone says I went and got my Cheerios and the bottom of the box fell out, I laugh

110
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,400
 and then I go, oh, it must have just been, it wasn't glued right.

111
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,280
 I don't ever go, yeah, right, it didn't fall out.

112
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,000
 So when I do these gangstalking stories, I do believe that every Wednesday a yellow car

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,960
 happens to drive through his neighborhood.

114
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,000
 Cars drive through neighborhoods because they're going home.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,720
 So I don't really quibble with them on what the stalking actions are generally.

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,840
 I quibble with them on what's causing them.

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,880
 This is such an interesting story and it's the same thing.

118
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,800
 When I'm reading this, I go, I'm not denying that any of this stuff is happening, not even

119
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
 the beginning, which is why this fits right into the middle.

120
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 Let's get started here.

121
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,840
 This was posted online by someone going by the name Alice Isn't Mad.

122
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,200
 So we're going to call her Alice and the information we do get from her, she does give out some

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,560
 information for someone who claims they're being gangstalked.

124
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,200
 Probably not the best idea, but Alice is 41 years old and she lives in Oklahoma.

125
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,920
 And she says she has been gangstalked for the past three years and she can point to

126
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,680
 the time period when it started.

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,760
 She said what happened was she was going about her business and she was kidnapped.

128
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,040
 And then she escaped from her kidnappers and she lived in a state funded safe house for

129
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,840
 six months.

130
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,120
 I don't deny that that happened.

131
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,120
 I actually think that this might be the closest we get to a real gangstalking.

132
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
 People kidnapped her.

133
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,480
 Now I said she was just going about living her life.

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,400
 Generally don't do that if you're a kidnapped victim, but generally people, upstanding citizens

135
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,640
 just don't get kidnapped in the United States.

136
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,040
 That just doesn't happen.

137
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,240
 But you know if you run into trouble with the mafia, you run in trouble with your local

138
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,680
 meth dealer, there is a chance you will get kidnapped.

139
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,160
 If there is a chance that I will get kidnapped, there is a chance that you will get kidnapped,

140
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,120
 but the chances are much, much smaller.

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
 So I don't know what led up to the kidnapping.

142
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
 I'm not blaming the victim.

143
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 I'm not being like, "Tistist!"

144
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,320
 It was your fault you got kidnapped.

145
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,480
 But what I'm saying is we don't know what circles she ran into begin with, but I do believe.

146
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 I'm not denying the fact.

147
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,560
 I don't think she's making this up.

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,400
 I believe she was kidnapped by someone that she escaped from them and she lived in a state

149
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,560
 funded safe house.

150
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,840
 I totally actually find that believable because that type of stuff unfortunately happens.

151
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
 But she goes after the six months.

152
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,760
 So it's not like if you want to get that thing where it's like that Steve Martin movie where

153
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,600
 you get like a whole new identity and they move you out into the suburbs and you're hanging

154
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,240
 out with Rick Moranis, that's only available for like high level.

155
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,320
 You guys are all trying to remember the name of that movie.

156
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,480
 That's for like high level witnesses.

157
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,840
 If you witness a murder, like you're just going about your business and you see a gang

158
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,520
 shoot somebody and then you tell the police, they may put you in a safe house for a short

159
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
 period of time.

160
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,720
 They're not going to be like, "I hope you like Rick Moranis."

161
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,080
 And you're like, "No, no, he's so irritating."

162
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,600
 It's just temporary, right?

163
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 It's temporary.

164
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,880
 So that also tracks.

165
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,000
 There's people who get the full identity and the new job and all that stuff.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,840
 They're high level, high level witnesses for ongoing trials and things like that.

167
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
 So that doesn't make sense.

168
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,520
 She is kidnapped.

169
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,880
 She has to testify all this stuff and they put her in safe house for six months and she

170
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,400
 says, "After I've been released from the safe house, I've been gang stalked."

171
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,200
 Probably, right?

172
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,520
 Probably she's testifying against these people.

173
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,480
 They probably are looking for her, but we're going to go down this interesting descent into

174
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,720
 her mind, say, "First off," she says that, "Okay, so the gang is probably looking for

175
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 her, right?

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,680
 She's testifying against people who kidnapped her.

177
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,480
 They probably are looking for her."

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,960
 But then she goes into this normal gang stalking mentality.

179
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,200
 She says, "First off, someone's poisoning my water.

180
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,840
 Someone's making my water toxic and it's not just drinking water.

181
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
 That'd be bad enough, right?

182
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,360
 That's normally where you would put poison."

183
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,000
 She's actually poisoning all of the water in her house when she showers, when she cooks.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It's all bad.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,040
 It's all bad.

186
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,480
 So even if she's like, "Well, I'm just going to drink bottled water," she still has to

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 take a shower.

188
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,520
 She still has to cook.

189
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,720
 Her hair, she said, used to go down to her waist and now it is breaking off.

190
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,640
 It's falling out.

191
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,680
 She's slowly going bald.

192
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,160
 She also says when she gets water on her skin, it burns her skin.

193
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,840
 That rust will appear within days.

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,320
 The pipes will very quickly become rusty and it's not just that.

195
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,120
 I mean, that's bad enough for her to live in a place with poison water.

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
 One of the few things you need to have to live.

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
 She also has a hard time breathing in her house.

198
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,560
 She believes that they're pumping also poison into the air.

199
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,480
 She says that everywhere around her there's this orange-black speckled dust.

200
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
 Her idea is this.

201
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
 She's now no longer in the safe house.

202
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,840
 She's now in her own house trying to make it safe.

203
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,600
 There is someone on the outside, or a group of people on the outside, gang stalkers,

204
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,400
 trying to lure her out, trying to get her out of her house.

205
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,560
 So they're slowly poisoning the air and the water to get her to leave.

206
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,680
 I mean, again, they generally, I've seen a couple documentaries.

207
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,720
 I saw the take-in series of documentaries starring Liam Neeson.

208
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,400
 They come into your house.

209
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,800
 They're not generally gangzorn, super, super subtle, right?

210
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,720
 That's why they control the territory they do.

211
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,760
 I don't know how much access the bloods have to chemical agents that can poison the air

212
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,320
 and water, but they're doing that.

213
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,440
 They're poisoning the house slowly, which is a typical gangstalking mentality, right?

214
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
 This is over time versus just kicking in her door.

215
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,240
 I don't mean to be horrible about this, but just kicking in her door and dragging her

216
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
 out.

217
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
 She's generally what would happen.

218
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:48,440
 And this is where the story takes another really kind of dark turn, and we see this.

219
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,160
 We covered this again on the "Target the Target."

220
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,920
 We did the episode "Not Too Long ago."

221
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,720
 I'll put this episode on the show notes, the gangstalker comic book.

222
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
 This is affecting their pets.

223
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,720
 That seems to be a really common thing with gangstalkers, is their pets also get affected.

224
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,320
 She said, "Not only is my own hair falling out, my dog's fur is falling off."

225
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
 And he's getting really sick.

226
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,680
 He has these sores and these cuts.

227
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,720
 He struggles to walk around the house.

228
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,080
 And she's looking at her dog.

229
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
 She's looking at herself.

230
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:26,880
 She knows, unlike a lot of gangstalking people, she knows that she has made enemies.

231
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 100%.

232
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,080
 Because she can put a face and a name to these things, but all of this technology they're

233
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,120
 using just isn't normal gang tactics.

234
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,440
 She says that she's not just stuck in the house.

235
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,880
 She does have friends and family and stuff like that.

236
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,400
 She says that she can tell whether or not her friends are in on the gangstalking.

237
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,320
 Because if she talks to her friends and they seem shocked or scared when she talks about

238
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,480
 it, they're like, "Oh my God, that's awful.

239
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
 That's totally awful.

240
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,520
 Your water is poison as you're at her house.

241
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
 This is poison?"

242
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,360
 She's like, "Yeah, and what did you get it for me?

243
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,040
 What did you get it for me as your glass is disintegrating?"

244
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,280
 But if they tell her, "Hey, you know, Alice, what you're saying, I don't want to say it's

245
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,040
 crazy because you're my friend, but if you weren't my friend, I would tell you you were

246
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
 crazy."

247
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,640
 And I think that she should probably see a doctor.

248
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,840
 They're in on it.

249
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,600
 If they show any concern for her or try to talk to her about mental health, they're in

250
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,480
 on it.

251
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
 And she wrote this post.

252
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
 She wrote this post and she titled it.

253
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
 This was written back in 2019.

254
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,320
 She titled this post, "Please somebody help.

255
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:51,160
 I am being gangstalked, poisoned, gassed, fumigated, harassed, slandered, and I'm about to be murdered

256
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,640
 or silenced."

257
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,600
 That last part is probably true.

258
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 Right?

259
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,960
 That's what's terrifying about this story.

260
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,680
 This last part is probably true.

261
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,640
 Now, we don't know who kidnapped her.

262
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,720
 She never states that.

263
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
 But she does give us a bit of a hint.

264
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
 And this hint just takes us into the creepiest possible.

265
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,880
 I mean, think about who you would want to get kidnapped by.

266
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 Right?

267
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,080
 If you had to choose your kidnapper, right?

268
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,600
 If you had to choose, you can't choose like the marshmallow man or something like that.

269
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 You're eating your handcuffs.

270
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 "I'm not not not not."

271
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 And then you're eating him.

272
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 No, that doesn't count.

273
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,440
 I mentioned all the real kidnapping groups out there.

274
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,960
 Who would you want to be kidnapped by?

275
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
 This is what they wrote.

276
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,400
 They don't say exactly why they got kidnapped.

277
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,680
 But it seems to be that she thinks her gang stalkers, so these might have been the people

278
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,240
 who kidnapped her, have a foot in the world of black magic.

279
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,000
 Have a foot in the world of the dark arts.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,880
 She posted on a thread called "Anyone Else Dealing This is Also in the Gangstalking Subreddit."

281
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
 She didn't start this post.

282
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
 She didn't start this post.

283
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
 She added onto this.

284
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,400
 She commented on this.

285
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
 But here's the post title.

286
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,040
 "Anyone Else Dealing with Colts Black Magic Along with Their Gangstalking and All the

287
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,200
 Other BS We Targeted Individuals Deal With on a Daily Basis."

288
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,440
 And what Alice's comment on this is that, yeah, she does have some experience with that.

289
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,520
 She felt that she was being set up to be ritualistically sacrificed.

290
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,320
 That post was in 2019 she has never posted since.

291
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,040
 So this is a story that I do feel, I don't think that whoever was stalking her was poisoning

292
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,960
 her or changing the water supply or stuff like that.

293
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,840
 But I do think someone was probably after her.

294
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,720
 And that's what makes this one terrifying.

295
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
 I think someone probably was after her.

296
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,280
 And there's a lot of reasons people stop posting stuff online.

297
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,600
 You know, no internet access for getting your username and password.

298
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,760
 You know, that stuff can be remedied.

299
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,200
 You can go to McDonald's, you can do a password reset.

300
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:16,160
 Sometimes just moving on with their life, sometimes getting the mental health they need.

301
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,280
 Sometimes it could have been fake, a little joke someone was running and they got tired

302
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,760
 of the joke, they got tired of the trolling and moved on.

303
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,000
 Those are all really realistic ways people stop posting online.

304
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,440
 But there's two other ways that can stop you from posting online.

305
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,640
 Getting kidnapped and getting murdered.

306
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:46,800
 So is this a story that stands in between those two, the actual gang stalking that happens?

307
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 When the police or the government, because you're like a rival spy, the government's

308
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,600
 looking after you, the police suspect you in a crime, the mob, some gang thinks that you

309
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,840
 owe them money or you do owe them money, that's real life gang stalking.

310
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,880
 That happens every single day.

311
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,160
 And then we have the gang stalking where radiation is being pumped through your walls and every

312
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,280
 time you buy milk, it's the same expec- it's always one day before the expiration date.

313
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,560
 You can't figure out every time you grab milk.

314
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,760
 That's a mental illness type of gang stalking.

315
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,640
 Plus check the milk before you get home.

316
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
 I'd recommend that too.

317
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,320
 But that's where you start to take all these little things and weave this web.

318
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,000
 This story falls right in between the two.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,560
 She probably was being gang stalked.

320
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,080
 People probably wore her really after her.

321
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,760
 And the stress and the tension from that may have caused her to go insane and begin to

322
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,200
 tie all these unrelated events together and craft this story.

323
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,640
 And while she was seeking solace in the gang stalking community, the actual gang that was

324
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:58,760
 stalking her was waiting for the right time to make their move.

325
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,640
 Terrifying story from the world of gang stalking.

326
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,640
 Nathaniel, go ahead and pet that puppy.

327
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,360
 I hope that dog is doing okay.

328
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,920
 I hope Alice is doing okay.

329
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,560
 I hope maybe it was just a troll or she did get some mental help.

330
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,520
 Realize that Reddit is nothing but the biggest cesspool on the internet.

331
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,000
 Never posted there again.

332
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,760
 Nathaniel, go ahead and let's toss you the keys to the carbonar copter we are leaving

333
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,480
 behind.

334
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,520
 This house we are headed all the way out to.

335
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,840
 Cam Loops, British Columbia.

336
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,280
 It's May 2000.

337
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,760
 And we're at Jacko Lake.

338
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,000
 Jacko Lake is this body of water thing.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
 It's not what a lake is right.

340
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,480
 There's one of you going like, "Huh?

341
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,720
 What's a lake?"

342
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,360
 Jacko Lake is a body of water surrounded by all sides by land.

343
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
 It's smaller than an ocean.

344
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,960
 And Jacko Lake is near Cam Loops, British Columbia.

345
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,080
 Nathaniel's land of the carbonar copter we're getting at.

346
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,120
 We have on our little fishing vests, little shorts, little fishing shorts, little fishing

347
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
 shoes apparently.

348
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,000
 I'm sure they have special footwear for fighting fish.

349
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
 And we're there to join two buddies who are currently fishing.

350
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
 Their names are Phillip and Jerry.

351
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,000
 We're waving to them and they're waving back and Phillip is like, "Do you know who those

352
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,640
 weirdos are with those fish shoes?"

353
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,200
 And Jerry goes, "I have no idea."

354
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
 I thought you invited them.

355
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,640
 Phillip and Jerry, this is their after work activity.

356
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,320
 They go out to the lake.

357
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,720
 They throw metal barbs into the water and hope to catch fish.

358
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,720
 And then, Nathan, they take their boat down the boat launch, fire up the boat engine.

359
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,600
 And start driving over the lake.

360
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 And they're just sitting back, seeing eagle fly by.

361
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 "Kah!

362
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
 Kah!

363
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 Kah!"

364
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,240
 That kind of sounds like a crow.

365
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
 That's weird.

366
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,720
 And then a loon lands on the water.

367
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
 "Laloon!

368
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 Laloon!"

369
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,400
 Making that world famous loon sound.

370
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,720
 But for the most part, it's just crystal clear, still water.

371
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,400
 There's a couple other boats on Jackal Lake at this point, but they're starting to pull

372
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
 in.

373
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
 It's getting late.

374
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,720
 They've already, they're already super confused.

375
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,160
 They're like, "That eagle sounded like a crow.

376
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,680
 They really messed with my head."

377
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,400
 Their boats are starting to go back to the launch, but Phillip and Jerry, man, they're

378
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
 just getting started.

379
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,720
 They're out there fishing until they're the last dudes on the lake.

380
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,760
 But now it's definitely getting too dark.

381
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,720
 And hey, Phillip, let's go ahead and bring this boat back to the launch and walk on land.

382
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,160
 That's the official thing you're supposed to say whenever you're done fishing.

383
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
 You didn't know that?

384
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,720
 Learn something new every day.

385
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,120
 So as the boat is headed back to the launch, they're about 20 feet from the shore and they

386
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,200
 see a light.

387
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 The story sounds insane.

388
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,360
 The story sounds insane.

389
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,200
 They see a light appear in the sky.

390
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,080
 You're not really thinking anything of it, right?

391
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,280
 It's a tiny little light.

392
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,560
 At first they think it's a satellite, but as their boat is getting closer to the shore,

393
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,720
 they're kind of looking at each other.

394
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 It's unusual.

395
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,400
 They've got both of their eyes, all four of their eyes, I mean, they've got both of their

396
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,640
 eyeballs, all four.

397
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,920
 Anyways, the boat's coming closer to the launch and they see this light appear in the sky

398
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,520
 and they're just kind of thinking on themselves, "Oh, that just must be a satellite."

399
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,840
 That's kind of cool.

400
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,560
 They realize that it's too big to be a satellite.

401
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,960
 It's too low to be a satellite.

402
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:31,760
 And then they see another smaller light rise up above the tree line and then enter the

403
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,040
 first light.

404
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,800
 Phillips says, "Did you see that?"

405
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,720
 Both dudes are starting to freak out.

406
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,280
 They're not like totally jumping overboard yet, yet, but it's unusual.

407
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,440
 They didn't expect to see that.

408
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,800
 They definitely know it's not a satellite.

409
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
 They don't know what it was.

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,040
 It was so unusual and so bizarre that it does unnerve both of them.

411
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,120
 So Phillips, let's just get back to the truck, right?

412
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,920
 Well, Jerry starts kind of busting donuts in the water.

413
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,800
 And Phillips is like, "Dude, what are you doing?"

414
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:08,040
 And Jerry's just kind of like, he's like trying to get the boat perfectly angled to the launch.

415
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,680
 And Phillips is like, "Just go, dude.

416
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
 Just go.

417
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,400
 Please, I want to get off this lake."

418
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,320
 And Jerry then guns the engine and that motor is spinning underneath the water and that

419
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,800
 boat is just gliding towards the shore.

420
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,300
 And then Phillips like, "Finally.

421
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,840
 I can't wait to get to my truck."

422
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,440
 But then he feels the boat starts to slow down.

423
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,280
 He looks back and Jerry has throttled off the engine.

424
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
 Phillips turns back to Jerry.

425
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,120
 He's like, "Dude, what's going on?

426
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,040
 You got one job right now to get us to the boat launch."

427
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,160
 Phillips looks back to Jerry and Jerry has this just shocked look on his face.

428
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,800
 And Jerry goes, "Look at the birds.

429
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,880
 Look at the birds."

430
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,160
 You throughout the day, they had seen an eagle.

431
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,440
 They'd seen a loon, maybe a sparrow flying around somewhere.

432
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,840
 Jack-O-Lake is not a place known for its avian wildlife.

433
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,880
 But as Phillip is looking at his buddy and he's talking about, "Look at the birds.

434
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
 Look at the birds."

435
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,200
 Phillip looks out over Jack-O-Lake.

436
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,880
 The lake is covered in thousands of birds.

437
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,600
 Just perfectly sitting there in the water.

438
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,440
 Ducks, loons.

439
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,400
 Phillip couldn't tell what they were.

440
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,880
 He says it was thousands of birds just sitting in the water.

441
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,840
 So many that they could not pilot the boat through them.

442
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,440
 But they didn't move.

443
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,600
 They didn't make a sound.

444
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,040
 They just floated there in the water.

445
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,280
 You're in a boat surrounded by thousands of silent birds.

446
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,600
 Really the loudest birds around, right?

447
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 Ducks and loons and they're just floating there in the water.

448
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 You know something's bad.

449
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,080
 You know something really bad is going to happen at this point.

450
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,520
 At the very least it's going to be like an earthquake is coming in.

451
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,400
 That's why all the animals are acting weird.

452
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
 You want to get off that lake.

453
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,520
 But at the most you got bright lights in the sky and now you are seeing something that

454
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
 is impossible.

455
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,920
 There's not even this many birds in this area.

456
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,680
 Phillip tells Jerry, "Dude, you can understand.

457
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,600
 You don't want to run over 50 ducks to get to your boat launch."

458
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,440
 But he says, "Dude, just go, just gun it.

459
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
 They'll move.

460
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
 They're birds, right?

461
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,680
 They have various ways.

462
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
 They can go in the water.

463
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
 They can fly away.

464
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,180
 They can swim.

465
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,000
 Just get out of here.

466
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,480
 Just gun it and get us through these."

467
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,680
 The next thing Phillip remembers is he's being hit in the face with branches.

468
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,920
 The boat is right next to the boat launch.

469
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,560
 And he didn't hit his target.

470
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,280
 Despite all of his angling earlier, Phillip's face is getting hit with tree branches.

471
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,940
 He's like coming up to the boat launch but it's too close to the shore and the tree is

472
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,080
 like scratching up Phillip's face.

473
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,160
 Phillip, he doesn't know how he got there.

474
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,280
 He doesn't care.

475
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,160
 It's time to get out of here and they start bringing the boat up to the shore.

476
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,520
 And Phillip's like, "Dude, I'm just out of here.

477
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
 Let's just go.

478
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
 Let's just go."

479
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,680
 And Jerry's starting to unload gear from the boat and walk it over to the truck and put

480
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
 it in the truck and go back to the boat.

481
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
 And Phillip's like, "Dude, please stop.

482
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,960
 I don't know what's going on here.

483
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
 I have no idea what just happened to the last few seconds.

484
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
 Where are the birds?

485
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
 They're gone.

486
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,460
 Let's leave."

487
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,920
 And Jerry's like, "But we got to unpack all of our gear."

488
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,760
 Phillip's like, "Leave it here."

489
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,360
 And then Jerry is walking to the truck and he sees Phillip unpacking stuff from the boat

490
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,760
 and carrying it up to the truck.

491
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,000
 And Jerry's like, "Dude, what are you doing?"

492
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,720
 And Phillip's like, "We got to unload this gear, man.

493
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,080
 We cannot leave this boat here."

494
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,040
 And Jerry's like, "Dude, I don't know what just happened.

495
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,440
 I was piling in the boat.

496
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,800
 All the birds are gone.

497
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,240
 Let's get in the truck."

498
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,060
 And Phillip's like, "Dude, we have to unload this stuff."

499
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,500
 And then Phillip's getting in his car.

500
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,460
 He's so pissed off that Jerry's not doing what he's saying.

501
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460
 He turns around.

502
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,620
 Jerry is still unloading the boat.

503
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,820
 And Phillip is losing at this point.

504
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,740
 He's like, "Jerry, you got to snap out of it.

505
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,940
 Something really weird is going on.

506
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,340
 Leave it behind."

507
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:31,580
 Jerry and Phillip kept changing what they were doing.

508
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,920
 There wasn't an editing error on my part.

509
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
 Phillip was angry.

510
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
 Jerry wasn't moving fast enough.

511
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,600
 The Jerry was unloading stuff.

512
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,680
 And then it reversed.

513
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,440
 Jerry was mad that Phillip was taking his time unloading the stuff.

514
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,480
 They kept going back and forth.

515
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,000
 They kept switching positions, switching opinions.

516
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,360
 And while this is going on, while they keep going back and forth, trying to figure out

517
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,840
 who's the guy slowing them down, both of them really, there's some weird time warp or personality

518
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,740
 warp or who even knows how to describe that.

519
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:16,640
 While that is going on, all of a sudden Jerry just freezes and says, "Stay nearby.

520
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,320
 Don't let them take me."

521
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,180
 Phillip's just staring at Jerry and can see this terrified look on Jerry's face.

522
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,060
 And then Jerry says, this is an actual quote, "Don't."

523
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:37,840
 "Don't look up because they'll know what you're thinking."

524
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,960
 Phillip, just out of instinct, looks up.

525
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:51,800
 He looks up at the night sky but sees no stars.

526
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:57,240
 They are standing underneath, darkness.

527
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:06,460
 The only thing that Phillip can see when he gazes upwards is a light the size of a pencil

528
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:22,340
 eraser, a little yellow light flashing on and off.

529
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
 They leave.

530
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,660
 At this point, they're completely panicked.

531
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,460
 They hop in the truck.

532
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
 They're gone.

533
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,980
 It's a fascinating UFO story.

534
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,660
 I got it from a website that we just discovered.

535
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,700
 We've already covered quite a few stories from them.

536
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,620
 UFOBC.ca.

537
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,060
 They're all about British Columbia and Western Canada UFO stories.

538
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,100
 Very, very good stuff.

539
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,300
 And I got to give a shout out to Godzilla19821982 who brought this story to my attention.

540
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,180
 Thank you, Godzilla.

541
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,100
 Fascinating UFO story.

542
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:05,880
 And this is one of those prime stories where you would want the witnesses to undergo some

543
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,820
 sort of hypnotic regression.

544
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,660
 But if this was me, if I was an experiencer in this, I don't think I'd want to know.

545
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,420
 This is such an interesting UFO story because it's so overwhelming.

546
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,020
 And it is alien.

547
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,100
 We had a story earlier this week where the aliens were having to shoot out with the

548
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,580
 cops down in South America.

549
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,580
 Really cool story.

550
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,580
 I love that one.

551
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
 And we get a lot of UFO stories like that.

552
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,740
 I mean, I wish there was more where we were shooting at aliens and aliens were blowing

553
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,060
 up horses.

554
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,300
 That's not super usual.

555
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,060
 But a lot of times, aliens interact with humans on human levels.

556
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,060
 They talk about religion.

557
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,740
 They talk about world peace.

558
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,820
 We're brought aboard their UFOs and we see how they work.

559
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,180
 There's like steering wheels and pedals and monitors that look like old television sets.

560
00:29:52,180 --> 00:30:00,900
 And while all that stuff is well and good, stories like this remind us of the alien aspect

561
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:09,100
 of aliens and their level of power over mankind.

562
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:16,740
 The ability to cause hallucinations on this level is terrifying.

563
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,700
 Absolutely terrifying.

564
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,300
 To think that you would be, because this is what we all think, right?

565
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,580
 If you were in the woods or you were in your house and something creepy happened, you would

566
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,780
 say, "Well, I would just leave.

567
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
 I would run out.

568
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,340
 If a great alien appeared in my bedroom, I would take a swing at it with baseball bat.

569
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,940
 I keep by my bed stand.

570
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:40,380
 If I was in the woods and I saw something eerie, I would load up my gun and just fire blindly

571
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,880
 into the woods.

572
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,500
 We'd have these ideas, but that's not how it would work.

573
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
 We've covered a lot of stories.

574
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,580
 I don't even know if I'd be able to find them in the show notes, but where people have pulled

575
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,180
 guns on aliens and the trigger won't pull.

576
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,340
 Or people, this is even weirder, people will pull guns on aliens and they won't pull the

577
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,340
 trigger.

578
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,700
 They'll say, "I saw this unusual creature and I pulled my gun out and I could not pull

579
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
 the trigger.

580
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,260
 I could not make that simple little motion that I'd made thousands of times before practicing

581
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,820
 with my handgun on my rifle.

582
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,940
 I couldn't do it.

583
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,740
 Not because it looks so cute, not because it looks like gizmo.

584
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,860
 I physically couldn't do it."

585
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,820
 And this is that same type of thing, like whatever your idea was when you're in a dangerous

586
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,820
 situation.

587
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,740
 If I'm being pursued by a gang of humans, I would know what I would do.

588
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,620
 I would trip them all to come into a restaurant.

589
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,180
 I saw this on under siege.

590
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,980
 I would build a bomb in a microwave and then I'd make sure that they all sit in one room

591
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,820
 for five minutes until the microwave went ding, blow them all up and I'd walk away in slow

592
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,320
 motion.

593
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,160
 But with aliens, I mean like that's totally realistic, right?

594
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,020
 With aliens, you don't know what you're facing.

595
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,780
 They were ready to go and they saw, it was, they hallucinated.

596
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,020
 They saw thousands of ducks or thousands of loons or whatever.

597
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,300
 They couldn't even identify the bird, which again is alien, right?

598
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:10,960
 The alien would just create the image of a animal and the alien may not be familiar with

599
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
 Earth wildlife.

600
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,100
 So it's just like, here's what a bird would look like, but it's the alien interpretation

601
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
 of the bird.

602
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,380
 They did not know what these birds were, but they didn't move.

603
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
 They didn't make sound.

604
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,260
 It was an illusion.

605
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,660
 And that stopped them from getting away.

606
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,940
 That slowed them down.

607
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,260
 Enough, right?

608
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,260
 Now this story doesn't really make any mention of lost time, which is a big thing about alien

609
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,420
 abductions, but I think when you're again talking about aliens, lost time or no lost

610
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:46,140
 time, they can take you and I believe this, they can take you, abduct you and if they

611
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,860
 drop you off five hours later, I personally think that's a malfunction in the technology.

612
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,980
 Because we have story after story of people getting dropped off in the wrong location.

613
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,100
 We covered story the other day about a guy getting dropped off in his neighbor's apartment

614
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,460
 with no clothes on after the aliens abducted him.

615
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,980
 I think that they could abduct you, do five hours of experiments and then drop you back

616
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,940
 on Earth and you didn't even know you were gone.

617
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,020
 As far as you knew, you were gone for five minutes.

618
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,420
 I think the idea of time, loss of time is a malfunction.

619
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,220
 I think it's a bug, not a feature.

620
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:22,420
 I think they care so little about earthly time and earthly space that if we keep you,

621
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,900
 you're driving on the road and then you look at your clock and two hours have passed, you're

622
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,540
 like, whoa, what happened to the last two hours?

623
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
 I don't think it's because they kept you for two hours.

624
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,020
 I think it's because they kept you for six hours and they only put you back two hours.

625
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
 That's my personal theory.

626
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,260
 I think that their technology is that advanced.

627
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,260
 So the fact that there is no mention of lost time in this, they're in their boat.

628
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,540
 The next thing they know they're on the land or they're a short distance from the boat launch,

629
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,060
 terrifying.

630
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,260
 That level of power to make a mass hallucination that slows you down enough.

631
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,700
 Imagine if you were trying to outrun something in the woods and like you hear a baby cry,

632
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,380
 you're like, no, no, that's a hallucination.

633
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,380
 Maybe just crying in the woods.

634
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,820
 I'm going to keep running.

635
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,620
 And then you hear like a little fox going, you're like, oh, save you later, fox.

636
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,980
 That might be real because there were foxes in the woods.

637
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
 I might be real.

638
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,180
 And then you're running and then you come and there's a 800 foot drop in front of you

639
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
 and you slow down.

640
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,980
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

641
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,180
 And you may know mentally that there is no cliff in this area, but your animal instinct

642
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,580
 kicks over and you stop.

643
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,860
 And then the next thing you know, you're just standing in the woods.

644
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,340
 Like that's what this would be.

645
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,220
 It's just something that would stop you.

646
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,500
 It was a physical barrier.

647
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,980
 It wasn't just that they saw a bunch of birds behind them.

648
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,180
 That would just be kind of cool.

649
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,460
 The birds slowed them down enough.

650
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,020
 And then the whole idea of their personality switching back and forth.

651
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,660
 They had not necessarily their personalities, but their attitudes towards getting out of

652
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,380
 here, fascinating level of alien technology in this story.

653
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,780
 And again, it takes away.

654
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,140
 What's the one thing gamers hate in all video games when you lose control of your character?

655
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,220
 You bonked on the head with something and all of a sudden your controls are backwards.

656
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,460
 Gamers hate it so much they stop including it in video games.

657
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,780
 It was super irritating.

658
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,940
 That was the real life equivalent of this.

659
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,780
 They had no control over themselves and they would argue with someone and say, we have

660
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,620
 to go, we have to go and you're getting mad at them for doing something.

661
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,340
 And the next thing you know, actually you're not even aware of it.

662
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,020
 Then all of a sudden you're doing that thing and you think it's totally rational.

663
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,900
 And the dude's like, dude, what are you doing?

664
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
 Just leave the stuff here.

665
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,900
 Just leave the stuff there.

666
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:35,460
 And the fact that they were losing control of themselves in a rational way.

667
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,540
 It's not like they were playing the bongos or anything like that.

668
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,140
 They were trying to do what you would do in a normal situation, load up your truck.

669
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,340
 But it was almost like once the argument may have started to take effect.

670
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,780
 Once Jerry was like, yeah, you're right, maybe we should just go.

671
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
 It flip-flopped.

672
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,780
 Now, Philip was the one arguing, what was even going on with that absolutely fascinating

673
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,660
 UFO story?

674
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
 And very obscure.

675
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,300
 I had never heard of this story until probably about a month ago I came across it.

676
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,660
 It happened in May of 2000.

677
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,580
 It's called the incident at Jack O Lake.

678
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:18,260
 A terrifying reminder of the true power of the aliens that also inhabit our reality.

679
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,140
 You may think you can outrun them.

680
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,860
 You may think you can outgun them.

681
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
 But can you?

682
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,260
 And if the aliens have the ability to create such mass hallucinations, we talk so much

683
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,580
 about Project Bluebeam where humanity, the secret cabal, will make holograms of UFOs

684
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,540
 invading and that'll be a pretense to create a one-world government.

685
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,700
 And I did a whole episode on that.

686
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
 I'll put that in the show notes.

687
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,740
 We always talk about humans creating holograms of UFOs.

688
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,220
 Who's not to say as the aliens finally decide to do a full invasion, we don't even know

689
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,180
 what's going on.

690
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,380
 They are masters of reality.

691
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,180
 And they show that time and time again.

692
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:03,740
 And this is the perfect story that has all of the creepiest examples of that.

693
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,820
 They are masters of reality.

694
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:13,060
 And if this technology is any hint at what they are truly capable of, they will soon

695
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:21,940
 be humanity's masters as well.

696
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,500
