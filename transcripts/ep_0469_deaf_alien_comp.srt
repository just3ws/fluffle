1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 A family in Italy breaks out the Ouija board.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,200
 It's all fun and games until the cops kick down your door.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,240
 Then we travel to Russia to take a look at a bizarre story of a man who claims he was

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,320
 abducted by aliens and not taken aboard a spaceship, but taken to a swamp full of zombies

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,480
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,240
 I hope you guys had a great, great weekend.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,320
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're going to go ahead and get started here.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,720
 First off, I want to give a shout out to a supporter of the show behind the scenes.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,880
 This guy has helped me out a lot recently, really, really appreciate it.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,200
 He took care of a task that I myself couldn't have done.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,480
 I can't really say who he is or what he does.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
 I can't tell you what his job is.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
 It's very sensitive.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,320
 But there was a particular issue that I needed help with and this gentleman helped me out.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,080
 So Joe from Portland, Joe from Portland.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,240
 Let's salute him actually.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
 We're saluting this guy.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,800
 This guy is an American hero.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,120
 I'm not saying that facetiously.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,600
 He's a really good dude and I can't tell you guys fully what's going on behind the scenes,

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
 but he helped out a lot.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 So we're done.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
 Joe's all embarrassed.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,560
 He's like, "Guys, quit saluting me."

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,320
 We're still saluting him.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,480
 Wipe away a single tear.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,760
 Where's his parade?

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
 Damn it.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 Where's Joe's parade?

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,280
 No, he's really, really a good guy.

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
 Thank you for helping.

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,400
 Helped me out, helped the show out, so he helped you guys out as well.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,000
 Joe, let's hop aboard the Carpentercopter.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 We're going for a flight.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,240
 Now, this is a request from Fabio via email.

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,100
 So Fabio, really, really appreciate that.

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,680
 Let's bring that Carpentercopter nice and low.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,920
 We're coming over the Italian countryside.

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,680
 We're specifically headed to a place called Monza.

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,360
 Monza, Monza.

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
 Everyone's just eating the whole time.

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,320
 It's the town of Gluttons.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,760
 That's Monza, isn't it?

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
 Same thing.

48
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
 In two ways, I'm sure the words mean the exact same thing.

49
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,280
 They sound like we're flying over this town.

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
 It's July 8th, 2013.

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
 So Joe, let's land that Carpentercopter.

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,080
 We hop out of the Carpentercopter and we see a bunch of Italian police officers run

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
 past the Carpentercopter.

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,200
 And now we're in Italian police uniforms as well because we're going to blend in.

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,240
 We're walking with the cops and stuff like that.

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,120
 The cops walk up to this house and they're like, "Italian police, open up!"

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,280
 You just hear ruckus upstairs.

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,200
 Sounds like some people are just making weird noises.

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,440
 The Italian police are looking at each other and they're like, "You ready to go in?"

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,600
 And we're like, "Monza."

61
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,800
 And the cops are like, "Okay, he's hungry, but that's the only word he knows in Italian,

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
 so that's works too."

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 And we're getting ready to breach.

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,560
 See, I know law enforcement terms.

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,720
 Now we're going to rewind to get to why the police are here.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,120
 So you like a little cliffhanger that I gave away in the opening when I told you why the

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
 cops are here?

68
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
 It doesn't matter.

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,280
 The police are sitting in their office and the phone rings.

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,640
 Ring, ring, ring, ring.

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,080
 Italian 911, what's your emergency?

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
 And these people are like, "Dude, this totally sucks.

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
 There's this family.

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,400
 I'm living next to this family."

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 Right?

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
 Totally normal people.

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
 Father, he's a bank employee.

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
 He's 53 years old.

79
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,120
 He has a wife who's 43.

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,280
 He's his housewife.

81
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,880
 And they have a 13-year-old daughter.

82
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,080
 And these dudes are like throwing a big old ruckus up in their attic.

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
 And then 911 goes, "That's not how you pronounce it.

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
 It's attic."

85
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
 But it doesn't matter.

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
 It doesn't matter.

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,600
 The point is, don't correct my grammar.

88
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,400
 The point is, is that they're making a much noise and I'm afraid something's going on.

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,400
 So Italian police hang up the Italian phone and they go, "Let's go."

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,120
 Ring, ring, ring, ring.

91
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,560
 They drive out and now we're back to where we are.

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,120
 So we're standing with all these Italian police.

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,200
 We're getting ready to breach this building and kick the door in.

94
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,920
 And then we're running up the stairs because we know the noise is coming from the attic.

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,360
 We're standing outside the attic door at this point.

96
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,480
 And you hear people inside the attic.

97
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
 Damn it.

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
 We hear people inside the room in the roof.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,440
 And they're going, "I am the goddess of love, Hitler.

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,800
 I am the goddess of love, Hitler."

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,640
 That's not a sample from a weird Kendrick Lamar song.

102
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,120
 These are people saying this, people saying this weird stuff in this room.

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,720
 And the cops are all looking at each other and they're like, "Oh, do we really want

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
 to go in here?"

105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,440
 But it is the Italian police job.

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080
 So they open the door and what they see, the first thing they go on, it's super hot in

107
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
 there.

108
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,760
 It's basically my apartment right now while I'm recording this episode.

109
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,520
 It's super, super hot in there.

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,080
 All the windows have been taped shut.

111
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
 So it's like stifling hot.

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,320
 There's cans of solvent.

113
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,720
 Now Fabio is from Italy and he sent me this stuff and I basically was run through a translator.

114
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,640
 So when it said cans of solvent, what I think it was was like aerosol canister.

115
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,000
 They were basically huffing is what the police figured out.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Cans of solvent.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So I don't know if it's like WD-40.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,480
 I don't know if it was like model airplane glue.

119
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,920
 Whatever it was, it was everywhere.

120
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,320
 And the implication in the article that this family was sky high.

121
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,280
 I mean, they were blitzed out of their minds, allegedly.

122
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,960
 Anonymous family in Italy don't sue me.

123
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,760
 Anyways, the cops were looking around.

124
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,400
 This is the quote.

125
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,640
 They're making these references to Hitler.

126
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,000
 They just keep going, "Hitler, Hitler."

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,960
 And then every so often one of them would go, "I am the goddess of love."

128
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,840
 And they're just saying incomprehensible things, right?

129
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,560
 And they're all in their underwear too.

130
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
 Skip that detail.

131
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
 The whole family, father, wife, and daughter are in their underwear.

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
 In the middle of the room is a Ouija board.

133
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,440
 And in between saying Hitler and "I'm the goddess of love" and other ramblings that

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,640
 the police sent it right down, the family members turn, stop talking.

135
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:13,720
 They turn, look at the police officers and go, "We are the children of Odin!"

136
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
 And run.

137
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
 And they begin fighting in this hot, sticky attic.

138
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,760
 At tick, they're fighting a family in their underwear.

139
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,720
 The police are now straight-handed in combat.

140
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,960
 I mean, think about it, dude.

141
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,800
 You could probably take on the dad, but that little 13-year-old girl, she's like a spider

142
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
 monkey.

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,040
 She's jumping off rafters and stuff, grabbing on in your neck.

144
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
 "Joe, look out!"

145
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 She's in a headlock.

146
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
 Got Joe in a headlock.

147
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,960
 He's like, "Ugh, what did I have to be the pilot for this story?"

148
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
 I'm punching.

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
 I'm just punching the dad.

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 I'm like, "I'll save you soon.

151
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,240
 First, let me take care of this guy."

152
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,920
 The cops are going toe-to-toe in this super hot attic.

153
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,880
 The family's biting them, scratching them, saying, "We will exterminate you."

154
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,520
 Probably saying Hitler a few more times just for good measure.

155
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,560
 Finally, the police get it under control.

156
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
 Drag the family downstairs.

157
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,160
 They get out of that hot, hot attic.

158
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,680
 Police win the melee.

159
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,840
 The daughter gets taken away to like child services, Italian child protective services.

160
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,480
 The father and the mother were forced to go to like a psychological evaluation.

161
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,640
 They were charged with police assault, but they were acquitted.

162
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,560
 They weren't found guilty for any of that stuff.

163
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,840
 They ended up being hospitalized, but there's no record.

164
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,920
 This story took place back in 2013, and there's no follow-up.

165
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,960
 So we don't even know these people's names.

166
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,440
 Most likely, they just were in the hospital for a bit.

167
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
 Here's the...

168
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,800
 This story's creepy for a couple different reasons.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,600
 One, I had to come to grips with the fact that I can't pronounce the word "attic."

170
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,920
 So that was "always leave a lasting scar on me."

171
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,360
 Two, I have a thing with the paranormal.

172
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,080
 Treat the paranormal like a gun.

173
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,960
 Assume it's always loaded.

174
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,040
 Oh, a Ouija is just a board game.

175
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
 It's nothing.

176
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,280
 Always treat every ghost investigation, every Charlie Charlie game, white noise generator,

177
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,160
 Ouija board like it's a loaded gun, that it is extremely dangerous and can go off at any

178
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,680
 time and hurt yourself or anyone around you.

179
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,600
 It's not something to be goofing off with.

180
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 That's the second thing.

181
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,920
 One, I can't pronounce the roof above the house.

182
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
 I can't pronounce that.

183
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,080
 Two, treat the paranormal like a loaded gun.

184
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,080
 If you're going to a haunted location, assume someone's going to get possessed.

185
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
 Just assume that.

186
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,320
 So you can be prepared to throw holy water on everybody.

187
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,440
 Always treat it like you're going into a dangerous situation.

188
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,120
 Three, this family dodged a bullet.

189
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,280
 I think we can all agree it's a creepy story.

190
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
 Thank you for the recommendation, Father Go.

191
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
 It's a creepy story.

192
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,360
 Because this family dodged a bullet because not only were they messing with the Ouija board,

193
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,480
 they were getting high while doing it.

194
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,200
 Getting high and playing with the Ouija board, you could have had demonic possession.

195
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,320
 You could have had one of them murder.

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,800
 The other, you could have had some sort of gross family thing, which I think you guys

197
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
 get the implication with that.

198
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,440
 You could have had all sorts of horrible things happen.

199
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
 Treat the paranormal.

200
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,560
 First off, and this is rule four, I think we're on, do not mix substance abuse with

201
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,920
 paranormal stuff.

202
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
 That's another thing.

203
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,200
 A lot of people, "Hey dude, let's drink some brews and go to the haunted house."

204
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,520
 Friends from the 1980s?

205
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,400
 Don't, don't mess.

206
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,880
 If you're frat from Revenge of the Nerds, who were they?

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
 Not the lamb the lamb the lamb does the other guy.

208
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 Tri-Pi, it doesn't matter.

209
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,880
 If your frat buddies want to get drunk and go to the graveyard, smoke a doobie, say,

210
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,880
 "Nah, ah, ah, I only hunt for ghosts when I'm stone sober."

211
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,240
 So yes, we've learned a lot of lessons from this.

212
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
 This family really dodged the bullet.

213
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,160
 It could have gotten really bad, and hopefully they learned their lesson, but since we don't

214
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,800
 know who these people are, but who knows what happened to this family?

215
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,920
 They're probably still out there.

216
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,160
 They're probably looking for another attic to hang out in.

217
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,320
 Tonight when you're reading a book, late at night you hear Italian footsteps above

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
 your head.

219
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
 Huh?

220
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,520
 Do you hear them like footsteps from around here?

221
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,240
 Those totally sound, those aren't, those aren't, they sound like Italian leather shoes

222
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,160
 on my, in my attic.

223
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,520
 Don't go up and check.

224
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,640
 Call the police.

225
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,960
 Because I know how this story ends.

226
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,320
 Ends with people in their underwear biting me.

227
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
 Call the Italian police.

228
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
 Let's go ahead, Joe.

229
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,200
 Let's hop back in that carbonercopter.

230
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,440
 It's so hot in here right now.

231
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
 I'm in my underwear.

232
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,320
 That's not a meme.

233
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,200
 I have not joined this cult.

234
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,560
 It's so hot and sticky in here.

235
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,480
 So Joe's like, Joe's like sitting in the helicopter.

236
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,640
 I'm getting in my underwear.

237
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
 I got my undershirt on.

238
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
 He's like, oh, come on.

239
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,120
 Seriously, this is the episode.

240
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,280
 You have us getting bit by a family in their underwear.

241
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,640
 Now you're wearing underwear.

242
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
 Take us up, Joe.

243
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
 Up, up and away.

244
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,920
 We're leaving behind Italy.

245
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,360
 We're headed out to Russia.

246
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,160
 We're leaving behind the country that looks like a boot and we're headed to the country

247
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,680
 that looks like a big old slab of steak.

248
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,680
 The good old Soviet Union.

249
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,920
 I found this story on ThinkAboutItDocs.com, which is one of my favorite...

250
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,520
 Competiums, Competiums, collections of UFO stories.

251
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,600
 I found this on here.

252
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,280
 Let's take a look at it.

253
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 It's really interesting.

254
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,920
 I was recently looking through the entire year of 1990.

255
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,320
 We saw a massive amount of alien encounters in Russia in the year 1990.

256
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,320
 Now we had seen them in previous years, 88, 89, but in 1990 was when we had a ton of cases

257
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,840
 of aliens making contact with humans.

258
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,560
 And a lot of times they would say, would you like to come on our ship?

259
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,240
 And the person would come on the ship and they'd kind of look around and they'd tell

260
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,280
 the story and the aliens would be like, stop using nukes or clean the environment, aka

261
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,400
 boring stuff.

262
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,160
 I would be so disappointed if I met an alien and they sit down and they start talking about

263
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
 the environment.

264
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
 I'd be like, lame.

265
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
 Can you at least...

266
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,840
 Rather you try to shoot me with a laser beam than bore me to death.

267
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,680
 And then they're like, okay, here's our boring machine.

268
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,720
 No, that's not what I meant.

269
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,000
 That terrible joke aside, we're headed to Russia to take a look at a very interesting story

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,960
 that I think we can use as a springboard for an interesting discussion.

271
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,440
 So there was a man...

272
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,680
 We're flying to the year 1990.

273
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,760
 We're in the served-loss region in the Urals of Russia.

274
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,040
 There's a night watchman named Sanon.

275
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,360
 He's 60 years old.

276
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,320
 And in the day, he's a carpenter.

277
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
 He's one of mine.

278
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
 He's one of my brief.

279
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
 But at night, he was a night watchman.

280
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,920
 Now I'm going to give you a detail about him and you may think that would probably make

281
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,320
 him a bad night watchman.

282
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,960
 But in the end, it might have made him the best night watchman ever.

283
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
 He's deaf.

284
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,600
 He can't hear nothing.

285
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,480
 So you would figure, you know, at night, your senses are already compromised.

286
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 You have to use a light.

287
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
 You've got a flashlight.

288
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,640
 You know, you guys understand how darkness works.

289
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,080
 You can't see in the dark.

290
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,920
 You think losing another sense would actually make it more difficult to do the jump.

291
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,880
 People are sneaking up behind you and stuff.

292
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,240
 Throwing burlap sacks over your head.

293
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,280
 Gophers are running away with your carrots.

294
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
 All sorts of stuff.

295
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
 But he was the night watchman.

296
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
 So he was taking care of that.

297
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,600
 It was like a farm collective.

298
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,920
 It was his job to keep everything secure.

299
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,520
 Well, one night, he's sitting there.

300
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
 He's just doing his job.

301
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,640
 He's keeping an eye on those gophers.

302
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,200
 And a bright light comes down from the sky.

303
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
 And he's like, "This sucks."

304
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,280
 Like he immediately knows that this is out of the ordinary.

305
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,840
 He's not curious about UFOs, none of this stuff.

306
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,680
 He immediately knows it's about to get real.

307
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,080
 And what steps out of this glow is three aliens.

308
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,040
 You know, a couple of grays.

309
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
 You could take a meat.

310
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,840
 Joe could probably take two of them.

311
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
 He holds them.

312
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,000
 I punch him in the stomach.

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,240
 But the third one shoots both of us with a laser beam.

314
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,440
 Oh man, I forgot to stop that one, Joe.

315
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,440
 But these aliens are eight and a half to nine feet tall.

316
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,800
 Yeah, you're not going to tangle with these things.

317
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
 These aliens start coming out.

318
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,440
 And the Tsanen's like, "Dude, listen, I'm just a night watchman.

319
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,480
 Like I watched stuff at night."

320
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,400
 They never said anything in the job description about actually stopping anything, let alone

321
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,960
 giants.

322
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,320
 So he hides.

323
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,600
 But then he's like hiding in a big piece of machinery in the door.

324
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,720
 Swings open and he feels this unknown, compelling force pulling him towards the light.

325
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
 "No, I'm not going.

326
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
 I'm not going."

327
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
 He's holding onto the steering wheel.

328
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,880
 His grip starts to loosen.

329
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,800
 He's getting pulled across the ground.

330
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,760
 He's like, "No, no, I'm not going to do it."

331
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,280
 Finally, though, against all odds, he crawls away.

332
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,480
 The aliens look at each other.

333
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
 He's crawling.

334
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,520
 He gets away from this beam.

335
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
 He runs into the nearby forest.

336
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,200
 Oh my God, that was close.

337
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
 He's laying against the tree.

338
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,680
 Oh my God, super nervous, dude.

339
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
 That was close.

340
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,000
 Okay, I'm safe.

341
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,840
 There's only one way to cure my nervousness now.

342
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,600
 I gotta have a cigarette.

343
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,840
 So he puts a cigarette in his mouth in the darkness of night, being pursued by aliens.

344
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,200
 He's like, "There's only one way to cure these blues."

345
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,920
 A little bit of that flame, flame, click, click, lights is lighter.

346
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,760
 The aliens immediately realize where he's at.

347
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,000
 He goes unconscious.

348
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,360
 Not the smartest decision, Sanon, but when you got a smoke, you got a smoke.

349
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
 Actually, that's not true.

350
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,240
 If you have to smoke and you're being pursued by the supernatural, don't smoke, then.

351
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
 What happens next?

352
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,080
 He's missing for five days.

353
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,600
 The people in the collective, they wake up the next morning and they find his food there.

354
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,560
 They find his equipment, but he's gone.

355
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,000
 They're like, "That's out of character for him.

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,160
 He's normally eating food and owning things.

357
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
 This is weird."

358
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,720
 So they begin a search party for him.

359
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,160
 Five days later, though, in another part of Russia, this truck's driving through the forest

360
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,160
 and this dude comes running out of the woods all sweating and stuff.

361
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,160
 He's like, "Stop, stop, stop."

362
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
 Truck stops, he gets in.

363
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,640
 "Dudes, do you have a cigarette?"

364
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
 "I'm super nervous."

365
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,480
 And I have a story to tell you.

366
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,520
 Now, he goes back to town and he tells this insane story of what happened.

367
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,720
 Now, a lot of times people get abducted by aliens.

368
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,160
 They're sitting on a spaceship.

369
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
 Maybe they remember it.

370
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
 Maybe they don't.

371
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,040
 But sometimes they're given the whole environmental spiel.

372
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
 Sometimes they're medically experimented on.

373
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,400
 This guy had a close encounter of the "interned" kind.

374
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 You like that?

375
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,960
 Does that make up for the boring joke?

376
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
 It does, doesn't it?

377
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
 So what happened?

378
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
 You're like, "No, it doesn't.

379
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
 I don't know the context."

380
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,880
 Okay, I'm going to tell you the context and then you'll laugh.

381
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,240
 He was taken to a slave labor camp in the middle of Russia.

382
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,960
 So what happened was the aliens pulled him into the beam of light and the next thing

383
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,240
 he knows is it's daytime and he's sitting in a swamp.

384
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,280
 And it's super gross everywhere, right?

385
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,800
 And the first thing he's like, "Oh man, this is super stinks."

386
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,880
 He said there was a film covering the whole area, right?

387
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
 And he's all grody.

388
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,440
 I mean, also he's a captive of aliens.

389
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,360
 I think he was more worried about, "Oh no, my freedom."

390
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
 Not like, "Pewwee!

391
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,800
 I thought you were going to take me to a nice smelling prison."

392
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
 He's on earth.

393
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,960
 He's in a swamp.

394
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,120
 And he sees it full of humans.

395
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
 There's actually a ton of humans.

396
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,880
 There's still some giant aliens walking around, but it's full of humans and they're walking

397
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
 around like zombies.

398
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,240
 Now their arms stuck out, but like robots.

399
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,320
 And what he's singing, he sees these humans walking in the woods, gathering berries, twigs,

400
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,920
 and stuff like that, putting them in sacks and dropping them off in front of the aliens

401
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
 and then walking away.

402
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,760
 And he's like, "Dude, dude, what's going on, man?

403
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,200
 Like, what's going on?"

404
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 And the people are ignoring him.

405
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,120
 They're just like zombies.

406
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,160
 So it doesn't take him long to deduce that they're under the aliens' control.

407
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,760
 And he starts over the quote, he's there for five days and he comes up with some interesting

408
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
 analyses.

409
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
 One, everyone's a slave.

410
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,560
 I mean, that's the most interesting part, right?

411
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,360
 These aliens are controlling a bunch of people.

412
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,640
 One, you have a bunch of slaves walking around too.

413
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,720
 You had men and women slaves, but the women had their faces covered with handkerchiefs.

414
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,360
 So you couldn't see their faces.

415
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,760
 And more importantly, they couldn't see anything either, but they're still able to expertly

416
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,240
 navigate the bog.

417
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,400
 So you have this bog and then around it is a burned out forest.

418
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,440
 I don't know how many, I don't know how berries grow in burned out forests.

419
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,080
 Maybe the berries are planted after the fire?

420
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,120
 I don't know, I don't know nothing about nature.

421
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,640
 But apparently that's what happened.

422
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,480
 I guess that's actually a quibbling detail.

423
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,280
 There are alien slave labor camps.

424
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,240
 I'm worried about where berries come from.

425
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,800
 The women had handkerchiefs wrapped tightly around their faces.

426
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,240
 You couldn't see their face.

427
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,080
 They shouldn't be able to see how, but they could expertly navigate the bog.

428
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,720
 Now, they would be just walking across the swampy ground, not slipping, not falling,

429
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,640
 anything like that, as if someone is controlling them like a puppet.

430
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,080
 Now there were metal planks, there were like metal plating laid across the ground as well

431
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,880
 that kind of made a gangplank, but they weren't always walking on that.

432
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,320
 Sometimes you would just be carrying bags of berries, dropping them off at these alien's

433
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
 feet.

434
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,760
 There was also another subset of aliens.

435
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
 They were shorter.

436
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,920
 They were wearing these cows and like little hoods, like they're little superheroes.

437
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,160
 And they seem to be controlling some sort of silvery net thing, which makes me, it isn't

438
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,720
 going a lot of detail of that, but I'm almost wondering if that is some sort of, I mean,

439
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,800
 I can make up anything at this point.

440
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,440
 We don't know, but you said there was some silvery net they operated.

441
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,440
 I wonder if that was only us like, you know, when military is doing stuff in areas, they'll

442
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
 throw up that camouflage netting.

443
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,120
 So if planes are just going overhead, it looks like a bunch of bushes are down there.

444
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,240
 I'm wondering if there was some sort of cloaking, because it was a big area.

445
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,120
 It's not like they were sending up helicopters looking for this dude.

446
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,800
 He was just like a missing dude from the area.

447
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,000
 He said that the smaller aliens were operating some sort of silvery net thing.

448
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,880
 He said that you had these people that were acting like slaves.

449
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,960
 They were completely under control of something else.

450
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,120
 And then he noticed two piles.

451
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,920
 Now generally piles of anything are not good unless you're Scrooge McDuck and you're going

452
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,240
 to your own house.

453
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,880
 When everything's are described as piles, they're normally not good.

454
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,120
 They're either referring to the piles in your stomach because you can't defecate or piles

455
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,880
 of horrible, that's horrible too, but or piles of stuff you don't want.

456
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,040
 He sees these two piles.

457
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:00,960
 One of the piles is freshly dead humans right off the assembly line dead.

458
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,600
 And it was dead men.

459
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 There were no dead women.

460
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
 It was dead men.

461
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,160
 And then oddly enough, red-headed children.

462
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
 What?

463
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,000
 That's a weird detail.

464
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,600
 And it's details like that that either makes me think that this guy is completely insane

465
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 or telling the truth.

466
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,720
 That would be a weird detail to lie about.

467
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,680
 He sees a pile of dead men, adult men, and in that same pile, much of dead red-head kids.

468
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
 No women.

469
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,640
 He doesn't see any dead women in this pile.

470
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,000
 And I have a theory about that, a very grim theory, but we'll get into that in a second.

471
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,040
 You're like, Jason, I have no idea what you could, the madness that you can pull out of

472
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
 this pile.

473
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,280
 I have no idea what's coming.

474
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,440
 The second pile was people that he thought had been dug up from graves, people much more

475
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,680
 decomposed in a separate pile.

476
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,360
 So it's not like this was the Monday dead and then they just slowly got rotten.

477
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,600
 He said that he saw a pile of bodies that was a combination of men, women, and children.

478
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,120
 I'm so sorry to present Joe's like shaking his head.

479
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,080
 He's like, really, this is the episode I'm on.

480
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,440
 Sorry, sir.

481
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,520
 He sees another pile.

482
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,680
 It's dead men, women, and children.

483
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,320
 And he says they looked like they'd been dug up from the grave.

484
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,200
 So maybe they're wearing like old Victorian clothing or something like that.

485
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,680
 He could tell they were super old.

486
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,760
 He goes in that pile, the aliens seem to be experimenting on the bodies.

487
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
 So I have a theory here.

488
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200
 I have an interesting theory here.

489
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,000
 What if you have the human men walking around and then you have the women walking around

490
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,400
 with the handkerchiefs on their face.

491
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,880
 My original theory was that we always have stories about aliens banging human women.

492
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,760
 They go far back to the Bible times.

493
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,520
 You get stories of the Nephilim coming down.

494
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,600
 And when I was reading the story originally, I thought maybe the women had to cover their

495
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,680
 face because they're so hot that if they didn't have their faces covered, the dudes would want

496
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
 to keep banging them.

497
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,840
 So instead of that happening, the overseer is like, dude, you can't, you got to stop

498
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
 banging these women.

499
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,240
 Look at all these illegitimate, superpowered babies that are running around.

500
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,640
 You got to stop doing that.

501
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,240
 They had to cover up the women's faces so the dudes weren't getting all like spacehorning

502
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
 and stuff like that.

503
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,520
 But then I thought, that's ridiculous.

504
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
 That's ridiculous.

505
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,360
 Then I thought, what if the reason why there's no dead, freshly dead women, sorry, this is

506
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,200
 a super disturbing.

507
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:19,800
 The reason why there's no freshly dead women is because the aliens were taking the corpses

508
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,240
 of women and turning them into robots.

509
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,200
 And the reason why they wear handkerchiefs isn't because they're super hot.

510
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,840
 It's because they're super gross and there's like worms and stuff coming out of their face.

511
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,160
 Now I have no evidence to back that up.

512
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,840
 I don't want evidence to back that up.

513
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,440
 I just think it's interesting that we don't have any women in the freshly dead pile.

514
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,800
 I can't believe I'm saying these phrases out loud.

515
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,120
 And that their faces are covered up.

516
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,520
 I'm wondering if the aliens were digging up the, because they weren't experimenting on

517
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,760
 the freshly dead corpses.

518
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,200
 They were experimenting on the gravedug corpses.

519
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,680
 What are they bringing women, like old dead women and stuff and then, oh my God, turning

520
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,840
 them into robot zombies.

521
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:06,280
 Okay, what if the aliens were digging up Queen Elizabeth, old, like old ancient person,

522
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,960
 like 1500s Queen Elizabeth.

523
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,520
 And then turned her into a robot.

524
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,800
 Catherine the Great's walking around picking berries.

525
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,880
 Anyways, to be fair, Sannin doesn't say any of that stuff.

526
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,720
 He would turn around and be like, what nonsense are you talking?

527
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,280
 He's just saying he's seeing these humans walk around acting like robots.

528
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,640
 Now this is the interesting thing about this story, other than the pile of bodies, the slave

529
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,080
 labor camp and the aliens.

530
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,560
 The aliens begin to command him to go pick berries.

531
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,840
 And he will go off into the forest and he starts harvesting berries.

532
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,400
 And then he's walking back and he starts slipping in the swamp.

533
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
 Whoa, whoa, whoa!

534
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
 Falls on his butt.

535
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,360
 Berries go everywhere and aliens are like, what?

536
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,640
 He knows the aliens are giving him commands, but they're not working.

537
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,160
 He really quickly realizes he doesn't have to go into the forest.

538
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,600
 He starts going, no, I'm not going to do that.

539
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 He's over attending.

540
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,840
 He's alighting in the pile of bodies.

541
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,520
 They're like, Sannin, we know.

542
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,880
 Come on, dude, we can see you breathing.

543
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 You're reading a magazine.

544
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 We know you're not dead.

545
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
 And he's like, I'm not working for you guys, dude.

546
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 And the aliens start getting-- these aliens have perfect mental control over this whole

547
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,160
 group of people, but not him.

548
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,680
 To the point that he can't navigate the swamp.

549
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,360
 He can't do things the way that these people, they can be blindfolded while perfectly through,

550
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,960
 because whoever controlling them can see where they're going.

551
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,280
 The aliens start threatening him and they're like, dude, just pick up Barry.

552
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,040
 Just one Barry, bro.

553
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,560
 One Barry and don't slip on your way back.

554
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,360
 And he's like, no, you pick your own berries.

555
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,720
 The aliens eventually just stop even paying attention to him.

556
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,640
 He basically is such a pain in the butt that interstellar travelers are just like whatever.

557
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,040
 After five days, a massive rainstorm hits the area and he thinks, I think it's my chance

558
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,440
 to get out of here and he runs away.

559
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,920
 He gets back and then he's seen on the road.

560
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,120
 To be honest, I don't think the aliens look too hard for him.

561
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,400
 They're like, no, stop, please.

562
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,440
 Come back where your cab-- okay, he's gone.

563
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
 Thank God that guy was annoying.

564
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,560
 We want to do what we said.

565
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,520
 It's an interesting thing because it's possible in this article I was reading, it's possible

566
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,000
 that the fact he was deaf made it so the aliens' commands didn't work on him.

567
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,600
 The fact that he couldn't hear them.

568
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,160
 Even though the voice-- we have so many times where the voices are in the head.

569
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,400
 You hear it in your head.

570
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,080
 Even though he was getting telepathed to commands, the fact that he was deaf is possibly why

571
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
 the commands didn't work on him.

572
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,160
 What's interesting is we saw in 1990, in summer and fall, in Russia, there's four other stories

573
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,400
 of people being abducted of acting like robots of meeting small aliens with little cows on

574
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
 their head.

575
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,360
 A group of girls was being kidnapped from a campsite.

576
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,720
 They were walking like robots through the river until the boys woke them up.

577
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,400
 There was a mother and her three young daughters who got teleported away and ended up in a

578
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,760
 field with a bunch of other people.

579
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,160
 They were acting like robots.

580
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,040
 She said that she knew she was in trouble.

581
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,360
 She couldn't control her body as she's walking across this field and she saw her young daughter

582
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,960
 and another group of people being led away with this other group and she's panicking

583
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,160
 but her body was moving.

584
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,280
 She couldn't control her body, which is more terrifying, obviously.

585
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,880
 Being a slave is awful.

586
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,400
 Being possessed, having someone else control your body is awful.

587
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,400
 And then having your own soul being like, "I don't want to do this.

588
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
 Why am I doing this?

589
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
 Please no, daughter.

590
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
 Come back.

591
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
 Come back."

592
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
 And not even be able to shed a tear because your body is being manipulated by somebody

593
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,720
 else like a marionette puppet.

594
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,680
 That's all terrifying stuff.

595
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,160
 So we saw, I saw four other cases in Russia in the same time period that had similar incidents.

596
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,040
 But only Sanin.

597
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,640
 All of these people, all the other people got away but Sanin was actually able to resist

598
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
 them for five days.

599
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
 It's interesting.

600
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,960
 And I'm wondering if the fact that he got away from them in the first place, that pulling

601
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
 force that was pulling him towards the light.

602
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,320
 We've talked before, I did an episode a long time ago, if our gray aliens actually evolved

603
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
 dolphins.

604
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,840
 And it was the fact that when aliens paralyze you, they're using a sonic attack.

605
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,960
 Like a dolphin can stun its prey with a sonic attack.

606
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,760
 These aliens can give you this sonic attack.

607
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,760
 If you can't hear, that probably won't work.

608
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,520
 Even though the voice is in your head, if there's still a biological sonic component

609
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,000
 to them having power over you, he's just like, "No, I'm not going to do it.

610
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,160
 This is lame.

611
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
 I want to go home."

612
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,360
 And he just waits till it starts raining and the aliens probably would have let him go

613
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,600
 home earlier if he had just wandered off.

614
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,200
 It's an interesting idea because I've come across several stories where people get abducted

615
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,880
 by aliens, the aliens run a couple tests and go, "Now, we can't do nothing with you and

616
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,720
 they'll drop them back off at Earth."

617
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,840
 The aliens may, for their technology to work, they may need to have somebody be "healthy"

618
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,480
 of typical health.

619
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 Which I mean, fine.

620
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 They're abducted by aliens and it turns out that you have some disease and they drop you

621
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
 off.

622
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
 That's one thing.

623
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,120
 You might feel a little disappointed.

624
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,280
 But this guy broke out of a slave labor camp because of his hearing issue.

625
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,200
 I mean, there's a whole other host of issues going on here.

626
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,880
 One, alien slave labor camps operating on the planet.

627
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,680
 He said that the aliens were actually living underground and they would come up and they

628
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,240
 would take all the supplies back underground.

629
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,840
 And the woman who was kidnapped with her daughters said she was going up and down a ladder.

630
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
 There was a civil...

631
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,320
 And they all take a place in Russia, all over Russia.

632
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,680
 But again, if they're getting teleported around, then it doesn't matter if you get kidnapped

633
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,280
 in Moscow or get kidnapped in the Urals.

634
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
 It doesn't matter.

635
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,200
 But because they're just going to where the aliens were.

636
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
 But even she described there was an...

637
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,560
 These are all coming from different sources.

638
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,280
 I found them all on ThinkAbout@Docs.com, but they got them from different books, different

639
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,760
 articles.

640
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,680
 So even the articles of the time weren't putting these stories together.

641
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,520
 It's an interesting question because it makes you think, are the aliens that easy to beat?

642
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,840
 I mean, it may not be as simple as throwing in some earplugs, but it might be.

643
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
 You know, I'm not saying if I'm at your alien's corner you pull out an ice pick and start

644
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,080
 going at your eardrums.

645
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 Don't.

646
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 Don't.

647
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
 Don't do that.

648
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,800
 But all of this advanced technology, the ability to teleport people away, to bring starcraft

649
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,720
 across the cosmos to get into your head.

650
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:40,160
 If all of that can be beaten with a pair of $2 earplugs from Rite Aid, bring it on aliens.

651
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,240
 It's an interesting story because despite the fact that him being deaf might have made

652
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:50,240
 him a bad night watchman, it might have given humanity a hint on how to defeat aliens if

653
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,040
 the time ever comes.

654
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
 I'll tell you this.

655
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,480
 I want to keep a pair of earplugs on me because if I ever get abducted by aliens and they

656
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:06,400
 pull out that PowerPoint presentation on peak oil, the greenhouse effect, while they're

657
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,000
 backsturned, I'm going to put my little earplugs in.

658
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
 The whole time I'm just going to be nodding.

659
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
 Oh yeah.

660
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,080
 Yeah, that's a tragedy, man.

661
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,680
 Sure glad you came across the cosmos.

662
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,160
 Tell me about recycling, bro.

663
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,120
 Good job, aliens, and I'll just be nodding.

664
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,960
