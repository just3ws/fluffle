1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
 When police are investigating a horrifying crime, they instead uncover a sickening conspiracy?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,200
 Then we travel to Arizona to meet a pair of rock collectors who travel out into the wilderness

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,760
 looking for the shiniest of rocks.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:26,200
 Instead they come face to face with a mind-bending experiment that will end their lives today

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,520
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:39,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,880
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,400
 We are having a short week this week, only three episodes because I just got back from

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,360
 the McMinnemins UFO Fest in McMinville, Oregon.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,080
 I'm telling you guys, it was a blast.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,040
 We're gonna do it again next year.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,960
 We brought out our haunted museum.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,680
 We stood out there, we were handing out stickers designed by Adam Carter.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,080
 We just had a blast.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,720
 It really was so fun.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,760
 So we're going to get next year and some of you guys came out to visit me.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,160
 That was really awesome.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,640
 You know, I was hoping.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,040
 I was hoping.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,400
 And you did not let me down.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,280
 So you guys are going to be the pilots this week.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,840
 First off, everyone give a round of applause for today's captain, today's pilot.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
 We're going to give it up for Joel from Arizona.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,360
 Woohoo, Joel's walking in.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,920
 Yeah, giving him high fives and stuff while we're clapping.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,000
 We have quantum hands.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,720
 We can do everything at once.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,880
 And I got to say this, Joel, I forgot to, he had his girlfriend there, maybe his wife.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,760
 I forgot to write her name down, but she's there too.

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
 She's equally important.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,000
 But Joel, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,200
 If you guys can't meet me in real life, that's fine too.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,720
 Just helps rid the word about this show.

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,560
 That really, really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,160
 Now Joel, we're going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're leaving

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,480
 behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,880
 We are headed all the way out to Mill Plain, Washington.

39
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,600
 It's October 30th, 2021.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,240
 The day before the spookiest day of the year.

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
 Halloween.

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,960
 In case you're bad at math or don't have a calendar.

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,200
 It's the day before Halloween and kids are already picking out their costumes.

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
 I'm going to Spabiota, says one kid.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,000
 Well, I'm going as Snuflufagus, says another kid who's apparently as big as a mammoth.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
 But while they're deciding whether or not to be Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees or

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,720
 Paw Patrol, Pet Man, whatever those dogs are called.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 While everyone's trying to pick their costumes, nobody realizes there's a real monster in

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120
 town.

50
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
 He has a costume.

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
 This monster has a costume.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,240
 It's an Arby's uniform.

53
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,160
 This man works at Arby's restaurants.

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,240
 Long time listeners of the podcast know Arby's are the grossest fast food restaurant out

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 there.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
 They really are.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,400
 Like just even, I feel like I'm some sort of like having these PTSD flashbacks when

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
 I mention Arby's.

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,080
 I can taste that sauce.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
 I can taste it.

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,760
 I can still taste that tangy sauce rolling down the back of my throat.

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,640
 I haven't had Arby's in 20 years.

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,760
 But if you gave me a taste test of sauces, I'll totally do that taste test by the way.

64
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,800
 If you'd like to meet me and have different sauces for me to taste, yummy.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,540
 But when I go to the Arby's one, I dig my blindfold off and go "You sir are no friend

66
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
 of mine.

67
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,080
 I'm taking the rest of these sauces and leaving."

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,520
 Arby's is disgusting.

69
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 Arby's is a disgusting fast food restaurant.

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,960
 And I hate to say things like I told you so, but this story proves that this story that

71
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,560
 happened to this one Arby's proves that they're all disgusting.

72
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,680
 From October 30th, 2021, there's a manager at a Arby's in Mill Plain, Washington named

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,440
 Stephen S. Sharp.

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 He's a 29 year old dude.

75
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,280
 And while he's watching all these people getting ready for Halloween, he walks through Walmart

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,760
 and the costumes are quickly disappearing from the shelves and he's like, "You know what?

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,280
 All of these trick or treaters are constantly saying they want trick or treat.

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,080
 Well what if I gave them a trick in their treat?"

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
 He's all talking.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,640
 He's talking out loud at the Walmart.

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,600
 People are like, "Stay away from that guy.

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 He's obviously a lunatic and gonna do something grotesque."

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
 Stephen Sharp's plan is this.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,840
 I don't know if he actually came up with this idea the night before Halloween.

85
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,800
 Oh the trickiest treat ever!

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,440
 Back at the Arby's restaurant, he was the only one there, there was a bag of milkshake

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
 mix.

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 I guess it's like some sort of powder that they put in there.

89
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,200
 It's this milkshake mix and he opened this bag up and he urinated in it.

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,480
 I don't know what he even urines like.

91
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,360
 He urinates in this bag of milkshake mix.

92
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,920
 This is actually, you'll see a lot of headlines for this.

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,240
 Some of you guys may have read this, but this is just the tip of the story.

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
 That is just the tip.

95
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,280
 This is out and about in the news cycle.

96
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,540
 You'll see headlines like "Fired Arby's Manager Admitted to Urinating" at least twice in

97
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,120
 a milkshake mix.

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,680
 It would have gone into the machine and the police looked at the receipts between October

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,200
 30th and October 31st.

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:23,400
 There was one root beer float sold and 30 to 40 milkshakes.

101
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,480
 Now that's the headline.

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 That's the headline you'll see, but when you read the articles, it's far more disturbing.

103
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
 So you see the headline.

104
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,600
 You see these headlines and the big question you have is how did they figure this out?

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,760
 Did he get ratted out by someone?

106
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,480
 Did someone go, "Oh, I've had an Arby's milkshake a day since the end of World War II."

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
 I know what they taste like.

108
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
 This one tasted like human urine.

109
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
 No.

110
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,000
 The way that they uncovered this is incredibly disturbing.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 This is insane.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,280
 What happened was the local police got a tip that someone in Mill Plain was trading and

113
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,440
 collecting child pornography, child sexual abuse images.

114
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,160
 And they figured out who it was.

115
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
 It was this guy named Steven Sharp.

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,120
 Yeah, the local Arby's.

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,280
 So when they arrest him, they get his phone and they start going through it and of course

118
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,320
 they find what they're looking for, a bunch of child porn.

119
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,040
 And then they came across a video of him urinating in a bag.

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,480
 And these are vitriol police officers taking all sorts of horrible stuff, right?

121
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,120
 But this one, they're like, "What in the world is this?

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
 Like, what?

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
 This is so weird.

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,400
 It's surrounded by all of this disgusting child porn.

125
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,480
 Here's a video of a guy peeing in a bag."

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,240
 So they asked him, "Hey, what's this video of you peeing in the bag?"

127
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,040
 So that's how they found this guy.

128
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,680
 He was being charged with child pornography.

129
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
 And I didn't know this.

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
 I didn't know this.

131
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,360
 So he was being charged with possession child pornography, which right there.

132
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,560
 He's looking at like 20 years per image or whatever it is, 5 years per image and he has

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
 a bunch of it.

134
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 Whatever.

135
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
 Doesn't matter.

136
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,700
 He deserves the jail time.

137
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,160
 When peeing in the bag is food tampering, that's against the law, luckily.

138
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,720
 Otherwise people would be peeing in food all the time.

139
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
 But I didn't know this.

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,640
 During the interview when the police were like, "Why did you pee in the bag?"

141
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,680
 He says, "Oh, because it got me off."

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,040
 Like I got sexual enjoyment from peeing into this powder.

143
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,680
 So now he's not just charged with food tampering.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,880
 It's another sex crime charge.

145
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,520
 If you do something sexy, and it's not saying, I'm saying that this is sexy, but if you do

146
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,920
 something for sexual reasons, that's different.

147
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,780
 So if you were robbing a bank, everyone get down.

148
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
 Give me all your money.

149
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,940
 And you have like a big old boner that's too charged.

150
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,260
 You're going to get charged with robbing the bank and you're going to get charged with

151
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,260
 having sexual gratification during it or something like that, which would be super awkward.

152
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,420
 Like if you robbed a bank and there's like a really hot bank teller there and you're like,

153
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
 "Oh, don't look at her.

154
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
 Don't look at her.

155
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,420
 Don't ma'am.

156
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,900
 Go into the back room and don't hit the silent alarm.

157
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
 I can't look at you.

158
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,420
 I don't want to get a second charge."

159
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,640
 As the security guard is choking on his own blood and I want to get charged with a sex

160
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
 crime.

161
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
 Yeah, that's it.

162
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
 He got a new charge.

163
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,080
 Now here's the thing.

164
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,620
 I guarantee this was not his first rodeo.

165
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
 Guarantee it.

166
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,840
 I mean, he got caught with the videos of him peeing in the bag.

167
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
 But remember, this guy was a manager here.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
 He worked his way up.

169
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
 I'm sure he did this a ton of times and never videotaped it.

170
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,860
 I don't know much about, by the way, perverts think, but I don't know.

171
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,860
 It would have pervert just go, "Hmm, I'm bored.

172
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,820
 I'm going to pee in a bag of wine."

173
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,300
 Obviously this guy did, right?

174
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,620
 But what I'm saying is he probably did it a bunch of times and then he goes, "You know

175
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,620
 what?

176
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,540
 I have such fond memories of peeing in that milkshake mix.

177
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,700
 I'm going to videotape it this time so I can enjoy it at home.

178
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,900
 Like I bet you he's done this a lot."

179
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,420
 And now that he knows he'll get a separate sex crime charge for every time he did something,

180
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,160
 then he's just not going to say anything.

181
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 There could be hundreds.

182
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,780
 There could be thousands of milkshakes out there.

183
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,760
 One day he takes a trip to corporate office.

184
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,600
 They're like, "Steven, really like the cut of your jib.

185
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,920
 Why don't you come down to corporate office and see what it's all about?"

186
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,680
 And he's like walking through the milkshake mix room where they're making the powder.

187
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,600
 He's like, "Ha ha ha."

188
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,520
 So it could be like the end of cabin fever where that water truck was driving down the

189
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,040
 road and the water was full of fleshy new bacteria.

190
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,060
 That could be, there could be semi-trucks of Arby's milkshake powder mix driving through

191
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,100
 your city right now.

192
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
 Insane, right?

193
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
 It's one of those stories.

194
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,060
 You see the headlines and it sounds gross and then you dig into the story and it's even

195
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
 worse.

196
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,060
 A child pornographer peed in people's milkshakes.

197
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,580
 There's a lot of people I wouldn't want to pee in my milkshakes.

198
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,380
 I don't want to pee in any of my milkshakes.

199
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,140
 I had to pick between milkshakes and like this one, a serial killer peed in this one,

200
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,640
 a bank robber peed in this one, and a child pornographer peed in this one.

201
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,240
 I know which one I'm not choosing.

202
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
 Gross.

203
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,960
 Like that's even worse and the fact that he got off on it.

204
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,720
 Imagine him just being at work that day and seeing people come up and they're like, "One

205
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
 milkshake.

206
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
 You know what?

207
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
 It's Halloween.

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
 I'll have three milkshakes."

209
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
 And he's like, "Oh yeah.

210
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
 I don't want to pee in the counter.

211
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 Okay, I'm done.

212
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
 I'm done with that segment.

213
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
 I'm done.

214
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,920
 Joel from Arizona, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbindercopter.

215
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,060
 You and your lovely lady friend can take us up and out of this Arby's.

216
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,020
 We're leaving it behind, although Steven Sharp may be a recurring character.

217
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,580
 Let's leave behind Washington.

218
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:39,540
 We're headed all the way out to the Arizona desert.

219
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,100
 The year is 1938.

220
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,580
 We're in this unnamed Arizona town.

221
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,580
 It's near a train station.

222
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:57,440
 There's this train headed towards town and on this train is a young man named Steve Brody.

223
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,240
 Now, Steve Brody's coming out to the area because he loves collecting rocks.

224
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
 It's a passion of his.

225
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
 He just walks around and goes, "Whoa.

226
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,880
 I've never seen a rock like that before."

227
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,520
 And he picks it up, looks at it, and puts it in his pocket.

228
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,040
 Maybe a backpack doesn't say exactly what he used to collect them, but somehow he collected

229
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,200
 these rocks and he had a buddy of his.

230
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
 He doesn't give a name for his buddy.

231
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,240
 There's some interesting details to the story we'll get to in the end, but he doesn't give

232
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
 a name to his buddy.

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,560
 We'll call him Jake.

234
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,300
 So Steven and Jake are on this train, headed to this unnamed Arizona town.

235
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,940
 And when they get out, they begin to quickly figure out their plans.

236
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,660
 Where they're going to go collect these rocks, where they're going to stay, stuff like that.

237
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,480
 They probably should have figured out before they got there.

238
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,960
 They find out there's no hotels or no rocks.

239
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
 It's underwater.

240
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,840
 So they get out there and they start talking, "Oh, you know what?

241
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,160
 I saw a really cool place as we were coming into town on that train.

242
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,840
 There's that bluff over yonder," Steven says.

243
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,520
 I think we should go over there and Jake agrees.

244
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,320
 Jake goes, "Yeah, let's go out to that bluff.

245
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,120
 I'm sure there's tons of rocks down there.

246
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
 I mean, what is a bluff already?

247
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,200
 But a giant rock."

248
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
 The townspeople get word of these two strangers in their territory.

249
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,680
 And they don't care, right?

250
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
 It's a normal town.

251
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
 They're a bunch of wrong-term mutants.

252
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,920
 But they do warn the young men, "Hey, yeah, we overheard you guys wanted to go to the

253
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
 bluff.

254
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,240
 Don't go to the bluff."

255
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,680
 A lot of people have gone missing out.

256
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 They're even locals.

257
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,720
 Even people who know the area, they've gone out to the bluff.

258
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,160
 They've never come back.

259
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,200
 But Steve and Jake kind of just figure there are local superstitions, right?

260
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,480
 There's what could possibly go wrong out in the middle.

261
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,080
 What could possibly go wrong in the middle of the Arizona desert?

262
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,640
 So they go out there against the wishes of the townspeople.

263
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,960
 They go out there and they're out at the base of the bluff.

264
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,600
 And they're not there for that long.

265
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 Really.

266
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 They're just got there.

267
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,920
 They're kind of looking around.

268
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:00,960
 When out of the shadows surrounding the base of the bluff, a man steps out wearing a solid

269
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,080
 black cloak and a black hood.

270
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,680
 This man stepped out of the shadows totally cloaked.

271
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,880
 Stephen could not describe what this guy's face looked like.

272
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,440
 But it's not really what he was worried about.

273
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
 The face just cared if he was handsome or not.

274
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 The dude stepped out of nowhere.

275
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,560
 He stepped out of some sort of void.

276
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,640
 And then another cloaked figure stepped out of another nearby shadow.

277
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,760
 And at this point, Steve and Jake are like, "Dude, we gotta get out of here."

278
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,120
 So they start to run and they get maybe a couple feet when all of a sudden one of the

279
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,440
 men in the cloaks seem to be holding some sort of weapon and a beam.

280
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,600
 The beam about as wide as a pencil shot out of this and struck Jake in the back.

281
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 Eugh.

282
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,960
 And when that beam struck Jake, Stephen said that his friend fell over and laid on the

283
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,640
 ground completely motionless.

284
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,080
 The air was thick with the smell of scorched skin.

285
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,760
 Stephen sees his friend laying motionless on the ground and he stops.

286
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,720
 Either he stopped because he didn't want to leave his buddy behind or he knew there was

287
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,880
 no way he could outrun these guys over this vast expanse of desert.

288
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,400
 He comes to a stop and these two cloaked figures walk up to him and they put something

289
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 on his head.

290
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,200
 He said it was basically just like this device that had these two metal discs that fitted

291
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,320
 over his temples.

292
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,760
 And once that device is securely around his head, he passes out.

293
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,680
 The next thing he knows he's regaining consciousness and he's somewhere in the dark.

294
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,400
 He passes out again and when he comes to he's still in that same dark place but he realizes

295
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,720
 he must be underground somewhere.

296
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
 Blacks out again.

297
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,480
 He comes to, he realizes he's not just in a hole underground, he's in a cell.

298
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,240
 He can actually see bars.

299
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,520
 Passes out again.

300
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,080
 What happens is he's constantly coming to for brief periods of time and each time he's

301
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,400
 able to take in a little bit more information.

302
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,240
 He realizes after multiple times of regaining consciousness and passing back out, he's somewhere

303
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,840
 underground either in a dungeon, like a literal medieval dungeon or a cave system.

304
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,680
 There's bars separating him from a chamber area, a place that he could leave this cell.

305
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,680
 He's not alone.

306
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,440
 There's other humans in this cell and they are all in this catatonic state.

307
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,440
 They seem completely brainwashed and he starts to think, "Is that what I'm like when I'm

308
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,640
 unconscious?"

309
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,840
 Because he keeps getting knocked out and what he realizes is that every time he regains

310
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:56,640
 consciousness one of these cloaked figures walks up and jolts him with some sort of device

311
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,360
 and he passes back out.

312
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,200
 So whenever he's able to start to become aware, it's cut short.

313
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,920
 He keeps waking up though and he sees these humans just standing there.

314
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
 He's put back under.

315
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,520
 He can't even formulate a rescue plan.

316
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
 He has no idea what's going on.

317
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,400
 Eventually he is awake at the same time someone else is awake.

318
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
 A young girl.

319
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,360
 And she tells him we're being held captive.

320
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,480
 These men in the cloaks they're known as the Dero.

321
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,360
 That's all the information she has as well.

322
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,360
 And she also was able to piece that together from multiple awakenings and then getting

323
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,720
 knocked out and awakenings and getting knocked out.

324
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,360
 Until one day he regains consciousness and he's standing in the outdoors.

325
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,720
 "Tingle, tingle, tingle, tingle, tingle.

326
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,600
 Get your French fries here.

327
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
 French fries."

328
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,120
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm so hungry."

329
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
 And someone says, "French fries?"

330
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
 He wakes up.

331
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,520
 He's actually standing in New York City.

332
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,680
 He's standing in Times Square watching these old cars drive by, you know the world famous

333
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,560
 New York French ride vendors.

334
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
 Best French fries in the world.

335
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,920
 He's standing in New York City.

336
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,520
 He has no idea how he got here.

337
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,880
 The last thing he really knew was he was outside of that bluff in Arizona.

338
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,480
 And he begins walking through the street kind of unsteady.

339
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,520
 He doesn't know where to go or what to do and he catches a reflection of himself.

340
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,640
 He has a beard, which he never had before, and long hair.

341
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,920
 So he knows there's been a passage of time, definite passage of time he has no memory

342
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
 of.

343
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,960
 He goes to a newspaper stand and he looks at the date on the newspaper.

344
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,960
 Two years have passed since he was standing in that Arizona desert.

345
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,760
 Steve made his way back to Arizona.

346
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
 Apparently that's where he lived.

347
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,560
 This is really interesting because we have a lot of information and not a lot of information

348
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
 at the same time.

349
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,160
 Apparently he didn't live in that region of Arizona where he went rock hunting, but he

350
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,720
 did live in Arizona.

351
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,520
 He makes his way back to the town he was originally from.

352
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,400
 He never saw his friend again.

353
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,920
 He never saw his friend in the cell.

354
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,160
 He never mentions his friend again.

355
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,080
 After this he goes back to the town that he came from and he kept his mouth shut.

356
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,520
 Apparently he didn't have any family.

357
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,400
 No one was really looking for him.

358
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,680
 He didn't tell anyone the story until somebody, a friend of his, was visiting him a couple

359
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,960
 years later.

360
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,680
 Was visiting him and this friend had a copy of the Amazing Stories magazine with him.

361
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,400
 Like sticking out of his back pocket, which was a fictional science fiction magazine.

362
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,120
 And on this issue they talked about inner earth.

363
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,800
 And they talked about this idea that there's an advance civilization underneath the surface

364
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,240
 of the planet.

365
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,920
 And when Steven saw that issue he started going "Dero, Dero!"

366
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
 And he freaked out.

367
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,560
 His friend was like "Dude, whoa, what is going on?"

368
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,720
 He was able to calm Steven down and Steven was like "I've never told anyone this, but

369
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,680
 I'm going to tell you this story right now.

370
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
 I've told the story that I just told you."

371
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,800
 And this story apparently was first recounted in a book in 1967 that was published in 1967

372
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
 called The Shaver Mystery in Inner Earth.

373
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,920
 It was specifically talking about a researcher named Richard Shaver, who I believe we've

374
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,120
 talked about on this show before, Richard Shaver, who believed in the inner earth philosophy.

375
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,960
 So he didn't come out and voluntarily tell this story.

376
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,920
 He saw a magazine cover and freaked him out and he told his friend this story.

377
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,880
 And as proof that he could show, because he wouldn't have a lot of right, he wouldn't

378
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
 be like "Look at my beard!

379
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,600
 They're not giving me a proper beard at any time."

380
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,720
 Apparently this friend had this conversation with him back in the 40s and it was in 1967

381
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,080
 when it was published.

382
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,480
 So he couldn't be like "Look at my beard!

383
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
 Look at my long hair!

384
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
 Anyone can grow out in the time."

385
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,320
 He did have two silver dollar sized scars behind his ears.

386
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,120
 And he says "This is where they attached the device to me."

387
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,080
 Because the first one was attached to his temples.

388
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,120
 This one was behind his ears.

389
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,120
 This must have been a device they attached to him during his imprisonment.

390
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,760
 But he had that.

391
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,680
 He had those scars.

392
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,160
 He had those burn marks.

393
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,360
 But he never told his friend what town it took place in.

394
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,200
 He never told his new friend the name of his old friend.

395
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,680
 He goes "I just don't want to even talk about it, but I'm telling you the story right now."

396
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,440
 And he said "Don't ever tell anyone this story.

397
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
 I'm telling you.

398
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
 I'm never recording it on a podcast."

399
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,320
 He told his friend "Please don't tell anyone this story.

400
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,960
 Everyone will think I'm a lunatic."

401
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
 But it happened.

402
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,320
 It totally happened.

403
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,160
 The reason why the friend felt comfortable telling this story was because eventually Steve

404
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,880
 went missing himself.

405
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,880
 Steven was last seen riding on a train in Arizona.

406
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,760
 And another man who knew Steve saw him and was like "Hey Steve, what's up?"

407
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 And Steve didn't respond.

408
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,440
 He was just staring out the train window.

409
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
 The train was chugging down the tracks.

410
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,360
 This guy knew Steve and he thought that seemed out of character.

411
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
 He seemed drunk.

412
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,240
 He seemed like he'd be in some sort of stupor.

413
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,480
 He was just staring out the window and I even put my hand on his shoulder and was like "Hey

414
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
 Steve, are you okay?"

415
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,200
 He still wouldn't respond.

416
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,160
 Still was staring out the window.

417
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,320
 This man said the train came to a stop and I got off to use the restroom and when I came

418
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,040
 back Steve was gone.

419
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,280
 And I figured he must have got on off on that stop.

420
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,800
 But I was a little worried for him, right?

421
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,160
 You know I'd never seen him like that before.

422
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,120
 But I just never saw him again after that.

423
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,440
 I didn't get back on the train and I did and the train took off.

424
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,200
 I imagine he went somewhere.

425
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,200
 But the hypothesis that you'll see pop up in a lot of these stories is he was under their

426
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,120
 mind control again.

427
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,400
 He got free and he said he goes "I don't know if I escaped or what.

428
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
 I don't know how I got out."

429
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,440
 I was just in New York City all of a sudden.

430
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,880
 Did they call him back home?

431
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,520
 Did they finally reconnect the mental control over him and he was in that stupor like he

432
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,080
 had seen all those other people just standing there like mindless zombies?

433
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:19,120
 They finally get him again and control him to get on the train, to head out there and

434
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,800
 to walk out into the Arizona wasteland to rejoin them underground.

435
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,160
 It's an interesting story but I want to wrap the episode up like this.

436
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,240
 What I thought was really interesting about being kidnapped and being taken prisoner

437
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,720
 by inner earth creatures with laser guns is the fact that they dropped him off in New

438
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:46,080
 York City and as I was reading this I thought what if that's why there's a bunch of crazy

439
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,200
 homeless people in major cities?

440
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:57,600
 If you had to drop off somebody who is going to weave a tail no one will believe you would

441
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,160
 drop him off in a major city.

442
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,800
 If you had a town of a thousand people and some dude just showed up in the middle of

443
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,840
 town and he's like "they took me, they took me, they took me away, they got all these

444
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,160
 other prisoners, help me, what day is it, what day is it, Tuesday, what year?"

445
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,080
 They're like 1940s sir.

446
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,880
 That would make the news right.

447
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,400
 Lunatic bearded lunatic shakes may or asks date.

448
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,600
 That would make the news right and people with local police would come out and they

449
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,360
 throw him in the drunk tank and he's like "I'm not drunk, I'm telling you, they're underneath

450
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,000
 our feet, they're under the ground."

451
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,640
 And then you know what I mean?

452
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
 It would be more noticeable.

453
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,120
 I'm not saying they would believe him, I'm not saying they would believe him, I'm not

454
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,400
 saying they're like "he's our new mayor, we're my crazy bearded guy, the new leader of our

455
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
 town."

456
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,280
 I'm not saying they would believe him but it would stand out more.

457
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,760
 If you took him back to that Arizona town and that guy came wandering and he's like

458
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,120
 "you're right, don't go out to the bluff, my buddy got totally blown up, I think, I never

459
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,640
 saw him again and they got all these people trapped underground."

460
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,280
 Then obviously instead of the town people just going "maybe you might not want to go

461
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,080
 out there" they'd be telling people "definitely don't go out there, there's people trapped

462
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,680
 underground, maybe they'd go and try to rescue them."

463
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,120
 I think that's aliens biggest fear is humans finding out about them.

464
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
 100%.

465
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,160
 I think they're terrified of that.

466
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,320
 I think they're absolutely terrified of that.

467
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,600
 We would beat them into a pulp.

468
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,160
 So that would be their worst fear.

469
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,000
 But if you took a guy, a blathering idiot or not, and dropped him off in a small town,

470
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,920
 people are more likely at least going to hear him.

471
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,360
 Maybe not believe him but they'll hear him.

472
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,760
 But if you dropped him off in the middle of New York City, no one would believe him.

473
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,240
 You'd be like "they're underground, they're underground and they're kidnapping people."

474
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,720
 And right next to you there's a guy screaming "they're in my skin, they're kidnapping my

475
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
 white blood cells."

476
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,040
 There's so many crazy bearded homeless people in these big cities that it would just get

477
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
 lost in the mess.

478
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,400
 It would get lost in the chaos.

479
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,760
 So it actually makes sense that they would drop him off here.

480
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,760
 I wonder how many of those screaming homeless people you see as you're driving down the

481
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,280
 road are telling the truth.

482
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,520
 Not that their car broke down and they just need some gas money to get to the next city.

483
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
 Not that.

484
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,040
 I'm talking about the crazy people screaming at the top of their lungs.

485
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,840
 Maybe they were just dropped off there by aliens.

486
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,840
 They were dropped off there by aliens.

487
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,640
 After the aliens use you for two years they're like "here you go sir, we're going to teleport

488
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,480
 you in front of a Chevron gas station with this cardboard sign that says help I need

489
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
 gas."

490
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,560
 Who knows, right?

491
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:45,800
 The story is already bizarre enough without adding on our homeless people actually ailing

492
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
 abduction victims.

493
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,400
 Which will probably be the name of this episode.

494
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,600
 But you would have to think that some of them might be.

495
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,200
 Some of them might be.

496
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:05,080
 So the next time you see a guy screaming in the top of his lungs outside of a 7-Eleven

497
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,240
 you should stop and listen to him.

498
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,280
 You should go "hmmm" you should sit there and listen to him prattle on.

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,360
 Because it's possible, it's possible that he's telling the truth.

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,280
 It's possible that as he's talking about lizard men underground and young people being taken

501
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,360
 against their wills maybe he is privy to the dark secrets of the Dero.

502
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,760
 It would be the perfect place to hide your mind control victims.

503
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,960
 Hide them among the drug users and the mentally disabled.

504
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,880
 Hide them among those who are already invisible and ignored by society.

505
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,800
 Because when these people come forward the truth tellers come forward and they're screaming

506
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,080
 at the top of their lungs till their voice goes hoarse spittle flying out of their mouth,

507
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,560
 hair, crazy, long scruffy beard as they're screaming the truth.

508
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:28,160
 You'll never hear it because it is drowned out by the lies of a million madmen.

509
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:57,960
 You'll never hear it because it is drowned out by the lies of a million madmen.
