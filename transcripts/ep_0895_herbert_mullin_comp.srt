1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 A young father discovers that Santa Claus isn't the only visitor who shows up during

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,280
 Christmas time.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:17,440
 Then we take a look at a truly terrifying true crime story, the saga of the man known as

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,900
 Herbert Mullen, a man who believed the only way to save the world was to spill the blood

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,640
 of the innocent today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:39,340
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,560
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,880
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,900
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, we're going to give a shout out to one of

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,680
 our legacy Patreon supporters, a longtime supporter of the show.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,560
 Give it up for James McGrom.

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
 Woohoo!

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
 Yeah!

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
 He brought that rum with us.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
 I don't drink rum.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
 He brought it all the way from home.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 He's like, "Oh, you're not going to drink a thing.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
 I'm not a rum guy."

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,200
 But, James, despite the fact that you brought the alcohol that's like your name, and I'm

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,480
 not going to drink it, but you guys can imbibe.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,080
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode, pilot responsibly.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,480
 If you can't support the Patreon of the show, though, that's fine too.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,680
 Just help spread the word about the show.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,200
 That really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,440
 Now James, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,560
 It's all pile in the back, except you have to drive the car.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
 You have all the duties.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,640
 We're just going to be relaxing, spreading our legs out, chilling.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,080
 James, be our chauffeur.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,200
 You're taking us all the way out to Orland Park, Illinois.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,720
 Specifically we're headed to Ford City Mall.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,360
 I don't know if this place still exists anymore.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,120
 The fact that the word "malls" in it makes me assume it's been either completely demolished

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,440
 or taken over by roving packs of bums.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,160
 But back in the year 1974, the story takes place in December 1974.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,040
 Ford City Mall was the place to be.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,440
 You had all of the shops.

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,920
 Oh man, remember malls?

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
 Malls are so dope.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,080
 Something zoomers will never understand.

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,200
 You had all these stores and you could walk from store to store and like you could buy

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,240
 greeting cards and then you could walk over store and buy a book.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,600
 And now it's just cold Amazon there.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,560
 You can just buy all that stuff off Amazon.

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,040
 You walk around, you get some ice cream, you go see a movie, you go to Hot Topic.

48
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,640
 But malls were dope.

49
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,280
 Well in 1974, America realized how cool malls were and people still hung out in them.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,840
 And that's where this story takes place.

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
 Ford City Mall.

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,880
 It's a Christmas show.

53
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,880
 There's actually a school group there performing Christmas songs.

54
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,320
 Sounds like utter hell to me.

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,240
 I hate watching kids do stuff that they're not really good at.

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,440
 I hate it.

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,160
 But you know, this dad's here and he's there with his two year old daughter.

58
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
 And little kids don't know what's good yet.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 They're like, "Yay, songs!"

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,680
 So the dad's like getting ready to pull his hair out.

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,360
 He's like, "Oh man, what I have to sit here and listen to these elementary school singers

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,760
 do this choir stuff."

63
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,200
 Sounds like hell.

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
 And he's also there with his ex-wife.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
 So one of them is having much fun either.

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,880
 It's him, his ex-wife and his two year old daughter hearing a bunch of kids from the

67
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,680
 local elementary school badly mangle Christmas carols.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
 But he's doing his best.

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,840
 He's doing his dad duty.

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,560
 He's there for his daughter.

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,640
 But he notices something during the show.

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,160
 His daughter's not paying attention to the show.

73
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
 She's staring off.

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,760
 And I'm like staring off thinking, "Oh my God, do they have any cyanide here that I can

75
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,560
 take anything into the show?"

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,840
 No, she's actually instead of looking ahead of the stage, she was staring down.

77
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,440
 She was like, her head turned to the left, staring down the aisle of chairs.

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,600
 And she's transfixed.

79
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,960
 He sees her looking at something.

80
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,680
 She's not paying attention to the kids.

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,840
 And now we're going to sing, now we're going to sing Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer for the

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
 13th time tonight.

83
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,000
 That's the only song I was able to teach these kids before the show.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 You're like, "Ugh."

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
 She's not paying attention to that.

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,320
 Her head is turned and she's looking down the row of chairs.

87
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,040
 So the dad, he is looking at his daughter and he's like, "What in the world is my daughter

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
 so interested?"

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,200
 And so he looks and follows her eye line, seeing what she's looking at.

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,760
 And he said, "I'm sitting there and then my daughter's sitting next to me and then there's

91
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,480
 about five empty chairs next to her.

92
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,320
 And then after those empty chairs, there is a man and a little girl."

93
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,400
 Probably that dude's daughter, right?

94
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,800
 A man and a little girl and then you have five empty chairs and then you have this little

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,840
 girl and this dude, this dad.

96
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,600
 And he goes, "I'm watching this and my daughter's eyes are locked with this other little girl's

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 eyes.

98
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
 They're staring at each other."

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
 Oh, okay, you know, whatever.

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
 Kids are weird.

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
 Kids do weird stuff.

102
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,080
 But now he's kind of looking at the girl.

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,800
 This girl sitting five chairs away and he realizes something.

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,280
 Something wrong with her eyes.

105
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,800
 Her pupils aren't round.

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 He said they were oval, like a cat's eye.

107
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,400
 And he's looking at this little girl.

108
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,920
 His brain can't really process her, right?

109
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,360
 That's not what a human eye is supposed to look like.

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,880
 Maybe it's just this weird distance between us.

111
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,280
 Maybe it's some sort of birth defect, maybe?

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,280
 Although I don't think there's any birth defects that can give you a different species' eyes.

113
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,440
 She has cat eyes.

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,560
 And he says as he's looking at this girl and he's trying to process what could possibly

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,480
 be going on, he's clearly seen that this girl has these cat eyes, right?

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,400
 That girl's father looks over at him.

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,760
 He's looking down at this little girl and he sees that she has cat eyes, inhuman eyes.

118
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,920
 And when he sees the father's head turn, he looks up at the father and his eyes were

119
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,800
 also cat eyes.

120
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,480
 You could argue again the first girl might have been some sort of trick of the light,

121
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,520
 but if you see two, if you see one shadow man at the end of your bed, it could just

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,800
 be your imagination, it could just be a trick of the light.

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,320
 When there's two and there's a third one walking into the room, what am I, oh I'm so sorry

124
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,360
 I'm late for the possession, it's probably something going on, especially since that

125
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,800
 man's talking about possessing you, there's probably something going on.

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,640
 First one might have been a trick of the light, now that he's seeing that her father, or what

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,080
 he presumes as her father, also has cat eyes, he realizes this isn't the trick of the light,

128
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,660
 and he's completely overcome by fear.

129
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,200
 He's looking at something inhuman and it terrifies him to section degree that he turns his head,

130
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,160
 he doesn't even want to look at these guys.

131
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 And in an instant he realized that wasn't the smart move, like he turned, he looked away,

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
 he was so terrified, he looked away and he goes wait a second, I can't do that, these

133
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,040
 guys actually might pose some sort of threat to me and my daughter, they're inhuman.

134
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,280
 I need to look at them in case I have to do something, so his head swivels to one side,

135
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,880
 he realizes it's not a good idea, he turns back, they're gone.

136
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,160
 And he said I started to look for them, I needed to find them.

137
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,880
 You would right, you would have to know for sure, you had to know, so he started scanning

138
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,840
 the crowd, he gets up, he's kinda looking around, he's on stage, he grabs the mic, he's

139
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,920
 like okay, Rudolph's taking a break, did anyone see those cat-eyed freaks around here?

140
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,400
 He said he couldn't find them, he couldn't spot them in the crowd, he goes I had my head

141
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,200
 turned, I turned back a moment later, they were gone, gone.

142
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,760
 He goes you know, they look like normal people, if you're just walking by them they look like

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,100
 normal people, they were just like normal people, but they weren't, there was something

144
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,160
 wrong with them, there was something wrong with their eyes.

145
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,920
 I got that story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com, they got it from, they said it was from a

146
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,280
 place called Weird Science, that's a pretty generic name, I don't know if that's a website

147
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,800
 or a newsletter, I definitely know it was a movie and a pretty good television series,

148
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,480
 but I don't know, but ThinkAboutItDocs.com, they've been so good over the years, it's

149
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,180
 one of my favorite websites looking stuff up, a great repository of truly bizarre events.

150
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,180
 You have to wonder, what was this, was it alien?

151
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,100
 Was it cryptid?

152
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,020
 Right, it's an interesting story because you have people, obviously aliens disguising themselves

153
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,780
 as humans, that's nothing new, there's a ton of stories like that, there's even supposedly

154
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,840
 a race of aliens called the lyrans, which are cat people, now normally they're not

155
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,320
 normal people with cat eyes, they're giant cat people, they look, if someone walked up

156
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,440
 to you and said cat people, it's what you would expect that phrase to look like, also

157
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,440
 probably get better friends or move to a better neighborhood if people are normally walking

158
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,920
 up to you and just going cat people.

159
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,720
 But you know they're all furry, giant walking alien cats, these people are just normal humans

160
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,800
 with cat eyes, so you have to wonder aliens, that's my first guess, but then cryptid would

161
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,860
 be an interesting one as well.

162
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,780
 If aliens disguise themselves as humans, I've talked about this before on the show, I'm

163
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,140
 sure there are cryptids that disguise themselves as humans outside of skinwalkers, which is

164
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,340
 a fairly recent phenomenon, I'm always a little iffy on the skinwalker phenomenon, because

165
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,180
 no one really, the term skinwalker has been around for hundreds of years, but the modern

166
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,180
 version of the skinwalker, no one really talked about it until people started talking about

167
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,220
 it on the export maybe 10 years ago.

168
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,600
 So I'm always a, I think something like that might exist, but the idea of the skinwalker

169
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
 as the paranormal community knows it.

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,180
 The stories are so recent and they popped up pretty much in the same places where a creepy

171
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,600
 pasta popped up, but it could be something like that.

172
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,120
 Really the moral of this story for me is to be observant, right?

173
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,960
 Because I listen, I would have been there, I'm sitting there with my two year old daughter,

174
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,320
 my ex-wife, and I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to mentally shut down is these kids

175
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,420
 are going, "Silent night, Paul."

176
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,920
 I'm like, oh my God.

177
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,300
 Oh my God, I was like, oh baby Jesus, why did you have to be born?

178
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,900
 Why did I have to be given eternal redemption?

179
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,220
 I would have traded that if I didn't have to listen to these horrible Christmas songs,

180
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,600
 sung by these third graders.

181
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 I would have not been paying attention.

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,340
 My two year old daughter would have been up to all sorts of antics.

183
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
 I would have been like, "Ugh."

184
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,340
 And with my head in my hands, right?

185
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,780
 I hate talent shows or pageants or whatever they are.

186
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,660
 So I probably wouldn't have been that observant.

187
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,440
 And my little girl would have looked at these freaks, stared at them for a while.

188
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,260
 She wasn't able to process what was going on.

189
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
 She's two.

190
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,860
 She's only been on the planet for two years.

191
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,300
 She doesn't know what anyone's eyes are supposed to look like.

192
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,960
 She knew something was off, but for all she knew, this is how some people on the planet

193
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
 have cat eyes.

194
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,400
 She didn't know.

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,160
 So it's about being observant, but then you also have the, some, they call it the curse

196
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,600
 of knowledge, right?

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,440
 This guy who didn't give his name, anonymous story, but this guy knew for a fact, and this

198
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,040
 is one of the things that people often do.

199
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,000
 They go, "Well, maybe I didn't see it.

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
 Maybe it's trick of the light.

201
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
 Maybe I was just tired."

202
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
 Da-da-da-da-da-da.

203
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,480
 But in the back of the head, he always knew what he saw.

204
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,760
 He saw two people who weren't people.

205
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,540
 He then had to spend the rest of his life knowing that there were other, either races of humans

206
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,380
 out there that are undiscovered or there are aliens visiting Earth in disguise of humans,

207
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,380
 and it would make you a little more paranoid.

208
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,780
 See, I've never seen anything like this.

209
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:06,260
 I've seen ghosts, and I've seen shadow people, and I've seen people possessed by demons, but

210
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,500
 I believed in ghosts before I saw ghosts, and I believed in demons before I saw someone

211
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 possessed by demons.

212
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,920
 I didn't know what a shadow person was when I was first seeing them.

213
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,160
 Back in the- it was in the late 90s.

214
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
 I had no idea what it was.

215
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,800
 I just figured it was a ghost.

216
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,640
 So I've always seen things, and I- ghosts kind of do live in that realm between like demons

217
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,800
 and shadow people.

218
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,560
 Everything I've seen fits my view of the world.

219
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,200
 I've never seen a space alien, even though I know that I believe they exist.

220
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 Never seen a UFO.

221
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,320
 I've seen stuff that I can't identify.

222
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,640
 I've never seen anything like an obvious flying saucer, but even then, I believe those exist.

223
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,020
 If I was talking to someone and I saw them shapeshift in front of me, that's outside

224
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
 of what I just talked about.

225
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,580
 I feel about shapeshifters, not shapeshifters, but skinwalkers.

226
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,180
 Let's say that, that's a perfect example.

227
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,620
 If I experienced a true-to-life skinwalker story where something was like imitating my

228
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,980
 buddy's voice but was kind of broken and crooked-

229
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,540
 Jason, come- come here.

230
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,340
 Jason, come here.

231
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,840
 Jason, come here.

232
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,480
 Jason, come here.

233
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,320
 Like if I experienced that out in the middle of the woods, that would- I would never go

234
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 into the woods again.

235
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 Like that would completely change my paradigm of how I view man versus the world.

236
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,800
 And I wouldn't- I might try to rationalize that, but I'd be like, "Clearly, I heard what

237
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,960
 I heard and I smelled the iron oxide, I'd smelled the wet pennies in the air, those

238
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,420
 are smells associated with the skinwalker.

239
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,820
 I showed it with six friends and then when we got to the cabin, there were seven of us

240
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,860
 and no one could figure out who the seventh person was.

241
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,140
 We were all swore of a noun that seven people came with us."

242
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,540
 Stuff like that.

243
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,940
 Those are- those are typical to the skinwalker stories.

244
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,060
 Which I believe might be possible.

245
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,060
 Some of them might be real.

246
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,220
 I think a lot of the elements are probably exaggerated.

247
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,440
 But if I experienced that, I'd have no choice but to believe these things were real.

248
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,680
 So that's what this man is facing.

249
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
 A paradigm shift.

250
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,720
 And all because he paid attention to his environment.

251
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,280
 Which I'm notoriously bad at.

252
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
 I've talked about it on the show.

253
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,320
 That's why I would never think I was being gangstalked.

254
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,640
 Because I'm not aware of really anything going on around me.

255
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,200
 It's weird I'm both over-observing and under-observing.

256
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,120
 It's a weird, weird, weird quality of mine.

257
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,920
 But yeah, I wouldn't have been able to pick up on this and I think most people wouldn't.

258
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,420
 I think most people just kind of bust through life and aren't paying attention to the small

259
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
 details.

260
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
 I.e.

261
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,420
 Somebody's cat eyes.

262
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,900
 I totally wouldn't even notice this, right?

263
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,580
 Maybe if I stared at it long enough?

264
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,140
 But probably not.

265
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,220
 So creepy story.

266
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
 These things could be far more common.

267
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,220
 They may not be relegated to the deep woods.

268
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,420
 There may be weirdness all around us in the urban and suburban neighborhoods.

269
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,020
 We just have to be a little more observant.

270
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
 James Magrum.

271
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,560
 Let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the Carbentercopter.

272
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,020
 We are leaving behind Illinois.

273
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,400
 We're headed all the way out to California.

274
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,440
 [imitates car engine]

275
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,400
 This episode's probably going to run long.

276
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,160
 That last segment was a little bit longer than I thought it was going to be.

277
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
 But I really, really enjoyed it.

278
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,440
 And this one's definitely probably going to be a little long.

279
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,920
 And I want to give you guys a bit of warning.

280
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,360
 This one's pretty gruesome.

281
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,520
 This is a pretty gruesome true crime tale.

282
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,900
 This is the true crime tale that you only see stuff like this in movies.

283
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,300
 This is a real case about a man known as Herbert Mullen.

284
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,500
 Herbert Mullen was born in April 18th, 1947.

285
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,980
 Which was a very important day to him.

286
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,020
 Even when he was a little child, he believed that he was born on April 18th for a divine

287
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
 reason.

288
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:03,660
 Because April 18th was the anniversary of the Great Quake of 1906.

289
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,380
 That was that massive earthquake that struck the Bay Area and pretty much destroyed the

290
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,380
 city.

291
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,380
 It wasn't destroyed in the earthquake.

292
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,740
 It caught on fire in the aftermath.

293
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,220
 So to a young man growing up in the Bay Area, who probably even at an early age was suffering

294
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,760
 from some undiagnosed mental illnesses.

295
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,020
 He thought himself to be special.

296
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
 Which is good.

297
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
 Everyone should think they're special in some way.

298
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,060
 And even his classmates thought he was special.

299
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,820
 He went to San Lorenzo Valley High School.

300
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,860
 He was voted most likely to succeed by his classmates.

301
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,500
 Which is true if you add a little asterisk to that.

302
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,420
 Succeed at being one of the most brutal yet unknown serial killers out here.

303
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,380
 I'm actually surprised they haven't made a movie about this guy.

304
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,680
 And you truly would succeed.

305
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,400
 He would be famous.

306
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,480
 Instead he's just insane.

307
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,680
 Because after high school what happens is the age.

308
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,040
 This is the age when it starts to really show.

309
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,760
 He really starts to struggle with paranoid schizophrenia.

310
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,200
 18th to 25th is the time period when that really, if you have schizophrenia, that's when it gets

311
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,640
 really really bad.

312
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,640
 And of course it's not just because Herbert is suffering from mental illness.

313
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,400
 He loses one of his friends.

314
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,680
 One of his really really close friends named Dean Richardson.

315
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,340
 And he can't deal with it.

316
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,720
 He cannot deal with it.

317
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,620
 In the middle of this descent into mental agony he loses someone very very close to him.

318
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,300
 He begins to build shrines to his friend.

319
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,160
 And begins to become obsessed with the idea of reincarnation.

320
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,660
 And his family's having a hard time keeping him safe.

321
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,160
 Right.

322
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,720
 He would definitely worry about this young man.

323
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,360
 You know that he has this mental illness.

324
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,800
 If you didn't know it before you can definitely see it now.

325
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,400
 He's grieving and he's taking his grief to a mentally dangerous level.

326
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
 He's obsessed.

327
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,340
 Not just with the death of his friend but death in general.

328
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,640
 So he begins to float in and out of mental hospitals for a couple years.

329
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
 Gets committed.

330
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
 They try treating him.

331
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,160
 Medicating him.

332
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,360
 He gets better.

333
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
 He leaves the mental hospital.

334
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,560
 And then this is very very common.

335
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,440
 Again the self-medication begins.

336
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,280
 His drugs of choice were marijuana and LSD.

337
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
 Not good combination.

338
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,360
 I would say it's not good combination for anybody.

339
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,680
 If you've just gotten out of a mental hospital and you're like you see a lot of talk things

340
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
 were all the hard work on my brain.

341
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,440
 And you're like hmm you know what I need.

342
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,280
 I need a joint and I need a trip.

343
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,160
 Probably not a good idea but he starts doing acid.

344
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
 He starts doing marijuana.

345
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,040
 A friend introduced him to these drugs.

346
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,040
 Hey Herbert you want to get groovy with me?

347
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:07,120
 And so in this soup of a brain between hospital pharmaceuticals street pharmaceuticals and

348
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,960
 his own mental illnesses he begins to create this mythos in his head.

349
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,160
 He sees a massive earthquake in humanity's future.

350
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,160
 One so devastating it will kill millions.

351
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,720
 Maybe billions.

352
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,560
 Maybe it will crack the earth in half.

353
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,520
 This massive earthquake will change life forever.

354
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,000
 The ancients knew how to stop such disasters.

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,040
 Even sacrifice.

356
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,240
 The year is 1972 he moves with his parents to Felton California up in the Santa Cruz

357
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
 Mountains.

358
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,840
 It's a picturesque place.

359
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,880
 This place would be Herbert Mullen's playground for quite a while.

360
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,440
 But most of this time he's just doing drugs and hanging out.

361
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,120
 And then occasionally getting shipped off to a mental asylum and coming back and repeating

362
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,680
 the cycle.

363
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,800
 And he's allowed to do this because although he knows how the world is going to end and

364
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:25,600
 that even though he knows how to stop it, human sacrifices, there are humans being sacrificed

365
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,640
 every single day in the jungles of Southeast Asia.

366
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,080
 Since Herbert Mullen was watching the news about the Vietnam War that was still raging,

367
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,560
 he figured the blood is spilling into the earth.

368
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,120
 It is being satiated and human gore.

369
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,880
 Thank you.

370
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,640
 Thank you soldiers for laying down your lives and saving the rest of us.

371
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,080
 Your deaths stave off the earthquake.

372
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,400
 But as any history buff will tell you, eventually the Vietnam War ended.

373
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,080
 Then Herbert Mullen's watching these reports and he realizes uh oh.

374
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,320
 The Vietnam War ends.

375
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,680
 Then how will we prevent the earth from cracking open?

376
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,000
 Blood must be spilled.

377
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,200
 It has to.

378
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,480
 Herbert Mullen hears a voice in his head.

379
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,360
 It's your turn Herbert.

380
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,080
 You need to sacrifice lives.

381
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,480
 He's looking around.

382
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,200
 There's no one else in the room with him.

383
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,760
 Who's talking to him?

384
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,040
 The voice he's hearing in his head is his father's voice.

385
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,160
 His father begins to telepathically communicate to Herbert.

386
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,000
 You need to do your part Herbert.

387
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,720
 You need to start spilling blood.

388
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,360
 Through your sacrifices you will save millions of lives.

389
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
 Do it Herbert.

390
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,520
 Do it.

391
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,760
 October 13th 1972.

392
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,520
 Herbert Mullen is having car trouble.

393
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,360
 He's on the side of the road up in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

394
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,320
 And an old vagrant walks up.

395
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,440
 Lawrence White.

396
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,200
 Also known as Whitey.

397
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,640
 Whitey walks up and says hey young man.

398
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,200
 You need help with your car?

399
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
 I'll fix your car if you give me a ride.

400
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,480
 How about that?

401
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
 Herbert Mullen.

402
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
 Yeah perfect.

403
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,280
 I totally need help with my car.

404
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
 So Whitey is fixing the car.

405
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
 They get it going.

406
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,480
 Whitey hops in the passenger seat.

407
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,960
 Herbert is driving down the road.

408
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,720
 Herbert said that he looked over and he realized that Whitey looked a lot like Jonah.

409
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,000
 You know the story of Jonah and the whale and the Bible, the man who was thrown overboard.

410
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,240
 So the fish would eat him and the rest of the people in the boat could get to safety.

411
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,400
 And when he's looking at Whitey and he realizes this.

412
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,720
 Whitey turns to Herbert and telepathically sends him a message.

413
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
 Hey man.

414
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,560
 Pick me up and throw me over the boat.

415
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:24,400
 Kill me so that others are saved.

416
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,120
 Herbert viciously beats Whitey to death with a baseball bat.

417
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:37,320
 Caving is heading and drags his body off into the woods.

418
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,160
 Herbert Mullen knows that the big thing he needs to stop is that earthquake.

419
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,040
 But he also begins to become an environmentalist.

420
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 That's pretty good right?

421
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
 You want to be an environmentalist?

422
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,360
 He starts to believe that the local woods are being poisoned.

423
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,560
 People are coming in and they're toxifying this beautiful landscape.

424
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
 And he's like, what am I going to do about that?

425
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:05,640
 Like sure, I can sacrifice people to stop the earthquake, but what about the poisoning?

426
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,560
 Luckily his father's there to talk to Herbert.

427
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,560
 Telepathically of course.

428
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,160
 More blood must be spilled Herbert.

429
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:23,640
 You can stop the poisoning of the forest you love so much.

430
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,520
 Wash away the poison with blood.

431
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,840
 Thanks dad.

432
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,360
 Great advice.

433
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,200
 October 1972 shortly after the death of Whitey.

434
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,440
 Mary Margaret Guilfoyle, 24 years old.

435
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,320
 A young woman hitchhiking through the Santa Cruz Mountains.

436
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:58,760
 She has her thumb out, hoping for a ride and Herbert pulls up.

437
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,840
 While driving down the road while he's still driving the car, he pulls out a knife and

438
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:12,520
 begins stabbing Mary to death as she sits there defenseless in the passenger seat.

439
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,640
 He drags her body out of the car and realizes that he needs to test her.

440
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,040
 He needs to test her body for pollutants.

441
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,040
 So he splits her down the middle, eviscerates her.

442
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:35,000
 And in the California sunlight, he's cutting out her organs and holding them up to the

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,400
 sun, checking them for poison.

444
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,480
 And then he would set it on a rock or hang them from a tree branch, then return to her

445
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,080
 body to pull out more of her organs.

446
00:25:51,080 --> 00:26:00,160
 Her body wasn't found for another four months and by then it was just bones.

447
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,120
 November 2nd, 1972.

448
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,200
 Herbert's like you know what, I like my dad and all but he's being totally honest with

449
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
 me.

450
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,000
 He's telepathically telling me that I can stop this earthquake by killing these people

451
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,440
 or that I can stop pollution by killing these people but maybe I shouldn't listen to the

452
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,640
 disembodied voices in my head.

453
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,960
 I love you dad but maybe something might be wrong spiritually.

454
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,840
 So he visits St. Mary's Catholic Church in Los Gatos, California.

455
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,920
 And there is Father Henry Tomei, who's actually a member of the French underground who fought

456
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,680
 against the Nazi regime of France.

457
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,360
 This guy had seen some stuff in his life and he's probably heard some stuff just by being

458
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,920
 a priest but definitely this guy experienced warfare under the Nazis as a guerrilla fighter.

459
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,160
 I mean that's something you're definitely going to put on your resume, right?

460
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,280
 Herbert Mullen goes into the confessional booth to speak to Father Tomei and he's sitting

461
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,920
 there he's like "Father forgive me for I have sinned."

462
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,880
 My dad is telling me things and I don't know if they're good things.

463
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,920
 I mean I think they're good things because they help things but...

464
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,520
 And then he hears Father Tomei talk to him.

465
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,080
 Now he doesn't know for sure if he spoke to him, because you can't see his lips move,

466
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
 right?

467
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,040
 He's in the other booth of the confessional or it was a telepathic message.

468
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,920
 But I clearly heard Father Tomei say "It's my time boy.

469
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,960
 I am willing to be the next sacrifice.

470
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,680
 Come over here my son.

471
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,000
 Spill my blood to save the earth."

472
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,320
 Man of the cloth you gotta do what he says, right?

473
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,960
 Herbert gets up out of the confessional booth, walks over to where the priest is sitting,

474
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:11,880
 opens the door and kicks this priest to death in church in the middle of the day.

475
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,240
 He beats this dude to death.

476
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,520
 There's a witness in the church who sees the whole thing.

477
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
 What are you gonna do?

478
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,560
 Imagine who's either a nun or an old lady there praying for her kids.

479
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,960
 But what are you gonna do?

480
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,920
 I mean you're not gonna get involved in the middle of that.

481
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,120
 I would hope that if you felt you were strong enough to do it, but this dude Herbert Mullen

482
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,200
 kicks this priest to death and then leaves.

483
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,160
 Two months later, still not caught.

484
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,840
 Two months later, January 1973, Herbert Mullen goes "You know what?

485
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 It's been pretty good.

486
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,520
 It's been pretty good year.

487
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,800
 There's been a earthquake.

488
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 There's been a earthquake.

489
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,160
 Obviously this stuff is working.

490
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
 There's been a earthquake.

491
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,920
 Well technically I'm not doing anything wrong.

492
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:06,640
 However I do think it's probably not good for me to do drugs.

493
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,400
 I believe that I would be in a better place mentally if I never did drugs, which is probably

494
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
 true.

495
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
 I don't think anyone would disagree with that, right?

496
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
 But it's not just that.

497
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,720
 He goes "You know what?

498
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,240
 Not only should I stop doing drugs, that's good.

499
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,360
 We agree through Herbert.

500
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,880
 Not only do I believe that I should have never done drugs, we agree with that as well.

501
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,240
 I'm gonna go kill the guy who introduced me to drugs in the first place.

502
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,280
 That's where we're gonna agree to disagree on that one."

503
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,840
 He ends up getting a pistol and driving up to a remote area that's dotted with cabins

504
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,480
 to find an old acquaintance of his, the guy who gave him his first joint.

505
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,680
 The man who introduced him to drugs in the first place because that is interfering with

506
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,600
 his mission.

507
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:56,000
 So he goes to the cabin where he knows this guy used to live.

508
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,320
 The door opens up and it's not the guy he expects.

509
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,320
 It's Kathy Francis, a young mother.

510
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,360
 She's there with her two sons, David, who's nine, and Damon, who's four.

511
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,160
 He goes "Hey, is so-and-so here?

512
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,600
 Is so-and-so here?"

513
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
 She goes "Oh, him?

514
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
 Oh no, no, no.

515
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,160
 He lives in that cabin down there.

516
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,240
 He lives down the lane.

517
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,040
 That's where you'll find him."

518
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,480
 And Herbert goes "Thanks.

519
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,720
 Thank you."

520
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:34,800
 And then she goes "Oh, but while you're here, I think that earthquake that's coming is

521
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,040
 so scary.

522
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,040
 We're really worried about that earthquake that's coming.

523
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,440
 Would you mind coming in and killing me and my two children?

524
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:56,400
 We would love to be sacrificed to stop the earthquake."

525
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:04,200
 Herbert shot all three of them, killed them all, and left their bodies in the cabin.

526
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 Herbert goes down the road.

527
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,920
 He did get directions to where his old friend was.

528
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,000
 He goes down the road and knocks on the door.

529
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,640
 "Hey, yeah, remember me?

530
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,160
 It's me, Herbert, back from the old neighbor.

531
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,280
 Oh yeah, Herbert, how's it going?

532
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,600
 They're talking to me."

533
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,680
 He also gets to the point.

534
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,120
 He says "Hey man, when you gave me pot, why'd you do that?

535
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
 Why'd you give me pot that ruined my life?

536
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,240
 I can't totally just destroy everything about me."

537
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,760
 And the friend's like "He doesn't know how to take this, right?"

538
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,600
 He's like "Well, I mean, it's just weed, man.

539
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 It's just weed.

540
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,400
 I'm sorry that your life got all messed up, but it's just...

541
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,240
 I didn't mean I wasn't doing it to be evil or anything like that."

542
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,840
 Herbert shoots him.

543
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,600
 Herbert just opens fire on him and this friend is wounded and begins crawling through the

544
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 cabin.

545
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
 "Hey, here's the thing.

546
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,920
 At a certain point, he knows he's going to die, right?"

547
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,760
 This guy who you probably knew was crazy in high school is now showing up at your house

548
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,320
 out of the blue.

549
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,000
 I'm sure his friend also probably heard three gunshots earlier, maybe 20 minutes ago, right?

550
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Didn't think anything of it.

551
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 He's up in the woods.

552
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,840
 You heard three gunshots and then all of a sudden there's a knock on your door.

553
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,480
 This guy you haven't seen for a long time.

554
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
 He's a lunatic.

555
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
 He's a little crazy.

556
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
 He starts going off on you about weed.

557
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,400
 Now he shoots you and you figure you're not going to get out of this situation in life.

558
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:28,160
 The problem is his wife is in the cabin as well and he begins crawling through the cabin,

559
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:37,160
 bleeding out, yelling to his wife, "Hide, hide, lock the door, lock the door."

560
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:44,440
 His wife is in the bathroom and she locks the door and she hears her husband dying in

561
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,560
 the living room.

562
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:54,360
 And she hears footsteps stomping through the cabin and then the bathroom doors kick down

563
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,160
 and Herbert kills her as she's cowering in her bathroom.

564
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,040
 February 10th, 1973.

565
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,200
 Herbert is hitchhiking through a state park in Santa Cruz.

566
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,120
 He comes across four teenage boys camping there illegally.

567
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
 Now he's a hitchhiker.

568
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
 He's totally insane.

569
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,720
 I can't imagine this guy.

570
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,080
 He probably looked like he was an insane hitchhiker.

571
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,000
 But he says, "I'm a park ranger.

572
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,160
 I'm a park ranger, guys.

573
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,200
 You guys got to get lost.

574
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,920
 You're polluting the forest.

575
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
 Look at all this stuff.

576
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
 You're polluting the forest."

577
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,120
 These four teenagers, they look at this guy.

578
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,240
 He's obviously not a park ranger.

579
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,280
 They tell him to get lost.

580
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
 Get out of here.

581
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,920
 And what's he going to do against four teenage boys?

582
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,440
 Herbert Mullen leaves.

583
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
 They continue camping through the night having a good time.

584
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
 They probably were polluting.

585
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,760
 They were probably drinking beer cans and throwing them into the woods and just being

586
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,520
 general jerks to nature.

587
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,720
 But that doesn't mean when Herbert Mullen came back the next day and shot all four of them

588
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,360
 in the head that that was an adequate punishment.

589
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,200
 I mean a ticket at best.

590
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,640
 But Herbert Mullen knew he had to protect the forest.

591
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:13,400
 So he went home, got his pistol, came back and executed four teenagers.

592
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,960
 And while there stole one of their rifles, so now he has a .22 rifle if you thought this

593
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,840
 guy couldn't get any more dangerous, one week later, so February 17, 1973, Herbert Mullen

594
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:32,120
 is driving through a neighborhood and he sees a 72-year-old man working in his garden.

595
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,360
 It's a beautiful February morning.

596
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,400
 The man working in the garden probably didn't even realize this car driving on the road

597
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,520
 busted an illegal U-turn right in front of his house.

598
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,600
 But whether or not he saw what was coming, he wanted to stop Herbert Mullen from taking

599
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:59,320
 this .22 rifle and just shooting him, shooting the 72-year-old man in his garden and then

600
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,640
 driving away.

601
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,480
 Now this time people got his license plate number as opposed to being in a church when

602
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,800
 they're like what did the suspect look like and you're like well look like some insane

603
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,880
 homeless man walking around.

604
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,440
 There's a bunch of those right?

605
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,800
 But a license plate is going to lead you right to somebody, assuming the car is not stolen.

606
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,200
 This is broad daylight in a suburban neighborhood.

607
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,880
 A guy busted a U-turn, jumped out, put the rifle across the hood of the car, aimed it

608
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,840
 and fired it and killed this guy.

609
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:40,280
 The cops arrested him that day and eventually they found out that he was connected to all

610
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,360
 of these other murders.

611
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,520
 They were so random you could never think they were connected.

612
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,960
 You would assume the two cabin murders were connected but what they thought was it was

613
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,920
 a drug deal gone bad because they knew that the friend was into drugs when he executed

614
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,120
 the friend and his wife and they figured well maybe this also this woman or three kids were

615
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
 living up in the woods.

616
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,920
 I think even they didn't know those were connected at first, although that's just bad police

617
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,440
 work but all these other murders the hitchhiker and Whitey, the vagrant and all this stuff

618
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,520
 the priest getting kicked to death.

619
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,400
 There was no connection between these except for Herbert and no one was looking at Herbert.

620
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,720
 No one was looking at the mentally ill man in the area who had been in and out of mental

621
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,320
 asylums during his life.

622
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,440
 No one was looking at that guy.

623
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
 He's still alive.

624
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,800
 Herbert Mullen is still alive.

625
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
 He's currently in prison.

626
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,480
 He's serving life.

627
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,120
 You can actually go to his website.

628
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,040
 He has his own website.

629
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,440
 The writings of Mr. Herbert William Mullen is the website.

630
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,640
 Actually I don't know if it's still online.

631
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,240
 It is on archive.org.

632
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,920
 You can visit it.

633
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
 He's still alive.

634
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
 Herbert Mullen is still alive.

635
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,920
 He's 75 years old.

636
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,000
 It's a terrifying story.

637
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,720
 It's not very well known.

638
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,120
 I know some other true crime podcasts have covered it over the years.

639
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,040
 They've mentioned it on my criminal minds.

640
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,920
 They're like that guy's a lot like Herbert Mullen.

641
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,520
 But it's terrifying because this is...

642
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,280
 It's a horror movie, right?

643
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,440
 The idea that you could be interacting with a lunatic and be saying stay away from me

644
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,720
 bro back up dude why are you coming over here but what he's hearing is come take my life

645
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,520
 spread my guts across the soil.

646
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,880
 I give my body to you.

647
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
 That's terrifying.

648
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,840
 That is so horrifying.

649
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,800
 Because we as humans we use our words and we use body language to push away threats.

650
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,120
 Whether it be a dog and we raise our voice or we puff up our chest or you're at a bar

651
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,720
 or you're walking down the street and some kid wants to test you.

652
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,800
 You're at the local safeway or just driving in your car.

653
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,680
 Someone's trying to see what you're made of.

654
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,800
 You can threaten them back, right?

655
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,480
 You can use your bravado before you have to use your strength.

656
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:07,560
 But if the words don't work and not even the body language works no matter what you say

657
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,720
 they actually think you're asking them to murder you.

658
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,760
 How do you get out of that?

659
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,040
 A terrifying story of how just random crime can be.

660
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,720
 But you asked for it.

661
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
 You begged him to kill you.

662
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,520
 What was he supposed to do?

663
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,920
 Herbert Mullen may be locked up.

664
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,800
 But is he the only one?

665
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,480
 With every new apocalyptic scenario out there.

666
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,200
 Every year, every month someone is predicting the world ends today.

667
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,700
 Get ready.

668
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
 Get ready.

669
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,600
 The world's going in guys.

670
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,720
 This time, this time the numbers are right.

671
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,160
 The prophecies are true this time.

672
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,160
 He built his own mythology of the end of the world.

673
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,600
 Nowadays the media does it for us.

674
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,880
 Whether it be something as big as 2012 or just these end of the world events we see

675
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,200
 on the export every single month.

676
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
 June 6th.

677
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
 June 6th.

678
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,700
 The world's going to end.

679
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,920
 I'm assuming you're listening to this podcast a couple of days after June 6th.

680
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,440
 The Antichrist was supposed to show up or something like that.

681
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,680
 People had been predicting it for about two weeks.

682
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,680
 And mentally unbalanced people read those threads too.

683
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,920
 Some of them created them.

684
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,880
 Some of these threads are created by mentally unbalanced people.

685
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,400
 I think a lot of them are made by pranksters or misguided people.

686
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,160
 But when you're doing this stuff mentally ill people engage in this stuff too.

687
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,920
 And they take it far more seriously than you may have ever intended.

688
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,920
 Maybe today has more end of the world events in a year than most civilizations had their

689
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,240
 entire lifetime.

690
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,800
 We have more.

691
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,640
 The world will end on X-Day.

692
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
 Nowadays.

693
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,440
 Than ever before.

694
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,760
 So I don't think Herbert Molen was a one off killer.

695
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,400
 If anything he might just been ahead of the curve.

696
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:20,280
 We may see more of these mentally ill people taking lives to prevent a calamity.

697
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,240
 And in their mind it works.

698
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,040
 Because the world hasn't ended yet.

699
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,080
 They saved us.

700
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:37,120
 Nowadays, there is no end to end of the world prophecies.

701
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,920
 And there is a limitless amount of victims.

702
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,680
 How many more hitchhikers bones are bleaching in the sun?

703
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,720
 How many more bodies remain hidden from view?

704
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,040
 Not victims of a sex crazed pervert.

705
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,640
 Not victims of a professional killer.

706
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,480
 Or of a drug deal gone wrong.

707
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,000
 They're not even victims of a serial killer.

708
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,120
 The victims of a savior.

709
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:32,880
 the world.

710
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:45,080
 the world.

711
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,660
 (upbeat music)
