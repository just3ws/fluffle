1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 The real reason why the Sunspot Solar Observatory was shut down?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 United States has issues with Confederate statues, but that's nothing with what happened in England a hundred years ago.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And finally, we tackle an issue that has been highly requested, Solar Plexus Clown Gliders.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And, I think I might have seen one today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. We're going to dispense with a bunch of pleasantries.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 This episode's going to be coming out early because we have breaking news and I want to get to the forefront of it.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 The Washington Post reported just a few hours ago that the reason why the Sunspot Solar Observatory was shut down

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 was due to someone using the servers to not only download but distribute child pornography.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 The FBI has said that that is why they've gone into the area. The reason why the places were evacuated

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 is because the suspect was the janitor. I haven't released his name yet because he hasn't been formally charged,

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 but the suspect was the janitor working there. And for the past year, he's been moving a laptop from room to room

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 that he knows aren't really used during certain times of the year to download and upload child pornography.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 When a worker, like a scientist at the Sunspot Observatory, thought it was weird, saw the laptop in a room,

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 no one should be in, and it was running, and he had seen, the scientists had seen the laptop kind of move from room to room

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 every once in a while. He looked at it and then he alerted the authorities and took the laptop.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 When the janitor came back looking, so then what happened was later on, the scientists saw the janitor come out of the room

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 where the laptop was previously and started acting a little odd saying, "Hey, was anyone in that office

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 were missing some cleaning supplies?" And the scientist was like, "I don't know."

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And then the janitor began acting very frantically in their words and started talking about,

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 "There might be a serial killer in the area and he was afraid that terrorists might hit the observatory

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and that someone may end up getting executed." So at that point, and like I had, like they had stated previously,

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 the ARA group, the people who ran the Sunspots Solar Observatory, made the decision to pull the people out

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 because of the way he was behaving. So that's why they cleared out the observatory and that's why they cleared out the post office.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 The FBI came in and were doing their investigation. There are still some unanswered questions,

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 but I hope I have a couple answers for them. A lot of people are going, "Why was there a Black Hawk there for child pornography investigation?"

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Fair enough. Personally, I don't know how FBI rides into and out of locations.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 If they felt that it is a federal facility and if they felt that the danger was high enough,

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 they may not have wanted to take vehicles and that was the best way of them to get up there.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I mean, a Black Hawk helicopter is not really going to help against aliens either, but there could be a logical reason for that.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 There's been a lot of YouTube comments on my channel and a lot of just comments everywhere saying,

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 "But this wasn't the only observatory shut down." Now, it was. I stated in the original episode that it was the only observatory shut down

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 and then I got pushed back on that. Fair enough. I went and I did more research. I'll provide the links below.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 The other observatories that were being stated as being shut down have been down for quite a while.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I think one was down for maintenance and the other ones were websites that had been offline for like a year, a couple months.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 These weren't new things. So those other observatories have been down for a while.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 There were reports saying all these observatories, their cameras were shut off.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 They'd been shut off for a while. I think one just recently went down for maintenance.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You have to remember there's hundreds of these observatories around the world.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So the fact that only six went offline, other people could do this work as well.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Plus the big one in DC, which gets the information from the SOHO that has the golf instrument on it

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 that we've talked about a couple times on the show. They were fully operational.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So apparently that is why. The FBI was investigating child pornography.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Child pornography can be used to cover up stories.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 There was the weapons inspector in Iraq who went against the official narrative and said that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Then they found child porn on his computer and he fought it and he's like, "I'm not... they put that on there."

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 The FBI put that on there to retaliate against... you know, it's an easy thing to take out a political or really any opponent.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 You flood their computer with child porn, they lose a bunch of allies.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 That could be the case here. It's the perfect cover up.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 But I think that is the most logical explanation. I talked about that on my episode with Solar Observatory.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I thought it may be some sort of criminal activity.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I was thinking more towards drugs, but using someone else's server to upload and download pornography, child pornography in particular, is definitely, you know, one of the crimes worse than cooking drugs out in the middle of nowhere.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 So this may be the end of it. Like I said also in that episode, this conspiracy will go on forever.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 People will keep saying, "No, no, no, it was aliens. It was this. It was that."

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 But at a certain point you have to look at the preponderance of evidence.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Why aren't all of the observatories shut down? Why just that one?

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Because we know for sure it's just that one now.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So a lot of those myths have been debunked about the other observatories being shut down and so on and so forth.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So there we go. We can still keep looking into this.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 If any new information pops up, we'll cover it.

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But I wanted to go ahead and get that out. That is the official reason of why the Sunspot Solar Observatory in New Mexico is shut down.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Crazy stuff. Crazy stuff. Wanting to guess it, but there we go.

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 We're going to go ahead and move on to our next story.

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Now, it's funny because I'm in America. We have listeners all over the world, and I don't know how much of the news got out from America to the rest of the world,

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 but we've had a big controversy the past couple of years of tearing down statues of Confederate leaders and Confederate generals.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I guess that's the same thing as a leader, but they're tearing down these statues because they say it's a monument to hate.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It's a reminder of racism. It's a really interesting topic politically and socially because it's a part of history.

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I see both sides. It's a part of history and you don't want to forget history, and it really smacks of 1984 and the Taliban blowing up the statues of the Buddhists,

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 blowing up the statues of Buddha in Afghanistan. It's this real thing about destroying the past, renaming streets and schools and things like that.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 It's really odd. On the other hand, I get the idea that in certain parts of the country, we have these schools and streets and statues named after people who, one,

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 not only tried to break America apart, but also were trying to uphold the institution of slavery.

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So I get both sides, and it's not a particular issue that is divided strictly among race either.

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 There are a lot of black people who are like, "Oh, no, I'm cool with that statue, I don't have a problem with it."

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 "You know, I've lived in this area my entire life. My grandpa lived here. It's whatever. It's a statue."

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And then you have white people going, "No, no, you have to destroy it." So it's kind of a weird, very interesting issue.

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 For the most part, they do get taken down. Once people start complaining, they're just like, "Ah, take it down."

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 That is nothing. That is nothing compared to the Brown Dog Affair.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So we're going to travel to England, Jolly Old England, as I like to refer to it in my show notes.

80
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And what we're going to look at is this horrific story. It's pretty sad.

81
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So back in 1902, at the University College London, there was a laboratory, and they were doing a lot of vivisection.

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So that's where you basically, you cut the dog open.

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I think vivisection is where you cut the dog open while it's still alive, and dissection is where you cut something open after it's dead.

84
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And there's medical reasons to do both, obviously, but they had this little brown puppy, this little brown terrier.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Skip ahead. Skip ahead, guys, if you're sensitive to dog stuff. I'm not going to get into too much detail, but I don't know how long this is going to run, maybe 10 minutes.

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Once you start hearing me talk about demonic clowns and all that stuff, you know you're in the right place.

87
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 So they had this little brown terrier, and they said, "Okay, you know, this is for medical reasons. We're going to do this."

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They did a vivisection, they took out its pancreas, and then sewed it back up.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And they were like testing, doing testing, things like that.

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And it was still alive. Like they took the pancreas out, and then they kept it alive.

91
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Then what they did later on was they go, "Okay, you know, now it's time for the next part of the test. We are going...

92
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Now it's 1903, so it's a year later." They have a lecture hall with all these medical students standing there.

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And again, I'm not going to get into the details here, but they did another, they opened the animal backup, did some more stuff in there.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 It gets real graphic, but I'm not going to talk about that.

95
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Closed it back up, gave it to another researcher, and that researcher performed another procedure in the same room, you know, like,

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 "Oh, here, I'm done with it, here you go." And the other guy did another thing.

97
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And then they go, "Okay, well, they gave it to a third doctor, and he stabbed it in the neck and killed it."

98
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Now in that audience was two women who were actually undercover.

99
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 They were anti-vivisectionists. So there was a group of people, like we have PETA now, these people,

100
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 because it was a big issue back then, a lot of vivisections were going on, and there were special laws.

101
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 One of the laws was that you could not perform more than two procedures on the same animal, which is interesting.

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And the other one was the dog had to be properly anesthetized.

103
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 You need to be given enough anesthesia. And so they reported it.

104
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 They left the lecture hall, totally grossed out, and basically reported it and wrote a book on it and contacted law enforcement and got a lawyer and all that stuff.

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And they said, you know, the doctor was like, "No, it was properly anesthetized. You know, you don't have to worry about that."

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 But they did break the law on doing the two procedures, and it was this big brouhaha back in England,

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 because it really gave the anti-vivisectionists something to hold onto. It gave them this item.

108
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 They're able to hold this dog up and say, "This is the horrible things that are going on."

109
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 So now we're going to move ahead to 1906.

110
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And near the school, they erect, the anti-vivisectionists, erect a huge statue of a brown dog,

111
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 a big metalwork statue, and it says on the plaque, "In memory of the brown terrier dog done to death

112
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 in the laboratories of University College in February 1903,

113
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 after having endured vivisection extending over more than two months

114
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 and having been handed over from one vivisector to another till death came to his release.

115
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Also in memory of the 232 dogs vivisected at the same place during the year 1902,

116
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 men and women of England, how long shall these things be?"

117
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So this statue stood there as this monument of what happened.

118
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And the scientists were like, "You guys are so superstitious. This creature doesn't have any soul.

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 It's just a thing. You guys are totally trying to put all of this old world thinking.

120
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 We're creating health. We're doing this so we can help people."

121
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And the anti-vivisectionists were like, "It's cruel. It's cruel. It's cruel."

122
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And the scientists were like, "It's not cruel. It's just an animal. What are you going to do?"

123
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 So this debate raged back and forth. But what happened was you have these young medical students

124
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 and, you know, they're college students, so they're going to get a little rowdy.

125
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 They started to try to break the statue down with crowbars.

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 They tried to, like, destroy the statue to the point where they had to start stationing

127
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 24 hours a day seven police officers at the statue to prevent people from trying to destroy it.

128
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Because of that, because the scientists can no longer, like, try to destroy the statue,

129
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 1,000 scientists, 1,000 students, medical students descended upon the statue one day.

130
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And at that point, they were met by anti-vivisectionists, by suffragettes, by trade unionists,

131
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 socialists, and other progressive factions. Riot breaks out.

132
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 They're battling over this multiple arrest. I think it took, I think I saw,

133
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 it was like 240 police officers had to get involved in the melee. They just, it was this huge fight.

134
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And it went on for a couple days from what I could see. There's an interesting quote here.

135
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It says, "The mainstream press was apparently largely supportive of the medical students,

136
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 offering up mind-blowing headlines like, 'Medical students gallant fight with women.'"

137
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So you had the media going that women are just being hysterical, you know,

138
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 because there was a lot of women, you had the suffragettes and the anti-vivisectionists and things like that.

139
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And the scientists just wanted to get rid of the statue. And this went on for so long.

140
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 So all of that started in 1906, the statue went up. In 1907, the brown dog riots is what they were called, started.

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And then in 1910, the council, Battersea Council, which oversaw the park, said,

142
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 "You know what? We're done with this stupid statue."

143
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 In the middle of the night, they sent four workers and 120 police officers to protect them.

144
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 They took the statue down, gave it to someone, and it disappeared. They think it was melted.

145
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 As of today, there is a new statue. In 1982, a new statue went up in the area.

146
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 So 80 years later, 70 years later, they put up a new statue with pretty much the same plaque.

147
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And it's a picture of a little dog. It's a much smaller statue.

148
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Where the old statue used to be, all that's left is like an indentation in the ground.

149
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And there's a sign on the fence nearby that says, "No dogs."

150
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And it's funny to think, like, I imagine a bunch of medical students, I know they weren't wearing like white coats and stethoscopes,

151
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 but just like these college students fighting with suffragettes.

152
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And the police like, "Oi, oi, oi, break it up, break it up. Don't make me wallop you."

153
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And, you know, all, just all like this craziness over a dog statue.

154
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And you know what's funny too is now whenever I see a story about a Confederate statue being taken down,

155
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I'm just going to think of a bunch of scientists in white coats riding over a metal dog.

156
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And, you know, a bunch of like terriers on the other side, like biting them on the ankles.

157
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 It's like, you know what they need to do? They need to make, okay, let me pitch this to you real quick.

158
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I don't want this episode to go long, but let me pitch this to you real quick.

159
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 AirBudMD. And M.D. stands for Medical Dog.

160
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And AirBud, after done, he's done playing sports.

161
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He got a scholarship to play football in college.

162
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 He ends up going to medical school and he finds out that the other AirBuds are in laboratories

163
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 and they're going to be vivisected and he has to save them.

164
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And it's perfect because all the kids who grew up with AirBud, they're adults now.

165
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 So it's a little edgiest, little like dark retelling of the AirBud store, you know?

166
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Like, they love doing that. They love taking a normal franchise and giving it a grim, dark feel.

167
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 AirBudMD. And it could be at the end, it'll be like,

168
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 "Everything you saw in this movie is based on historical events.

169
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 If you'd like to know more, please visit your library."

170
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And it would be, if we'd just be like peeing on scientists and like putting poop down

171
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 and they'd be like slipping on it and stuff.

172
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And then like, he's rescuing the AirBuds.

173
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 That would be awesome.

174
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Oh, and you can have a scene where AirBud actually like ties down a scientist

175
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 and he picks up a scalpel and AirBud goes, "Hate to cut and run, but fssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

176
00:16:38,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and he picks up a scalpel and AirBud goes, "Hate to cut and run, but fssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

177
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 What this is, is this is something called a solar plexus clown glider.

178
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 The most likely explanation, people watch my videos and people mostly my videos and they go,

179
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 "What? You're an idiot that's totally made up."

180
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Listen, I get that. I get that a lot of these phrases are totally made up.

181
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I investigate them nonetheless.

182
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You know, the most obvious answer is Solar Plexus Clown Gliders is a joke.

183
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 It was posted on the Iceberg list as a dead end.

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It's a random collection of words. I get that.

185
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 That doesn't make for an exciting episode or an entertaining episode because then right there I go,

186
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 "That's it. Dead Red Radio, Gmail."

187
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So we do extrapolate from that, but I fully understand that phrases like golf rumors,

188
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 the ocean at night, things like that.

189
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Ailish travel was able to be tracked down, but there are certain phrases that could just be made up.

190
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And I'll always address that as that.

191
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 We will take that as a possibility and really the most likely possibility.

192
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Solar Plexus Clown Gliders, first-left explanation is it's just a word stew.

193
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Means nothing.

194
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I've heard that it is a creepypasta from the Usenet days.

195
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So it's basically like an old lost scary story.

196
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 This episode I've done probably about two or three weeks of research on,

197
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 and I've used all my internet tricks of isolating time periods and doing all sorts of different definitions

198
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 for the words and having to break the phrase up.

199
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Solar Plexus Clown Glider, Jester Glider.

200
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I've done everything I could and I was setting parameters for when I could search.

201
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And I couldn't find anything from showing a creepypasta written pre-2017,

202
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 which is where the earliest phrase, the earliest use of this phrase, Solar Plexus Clown Gliders,

203
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 is August 19th, 2017.

204
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So it's very, very recent.

205
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 It's the earliest I could find of this.

206
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 There's a theory that it's an old hacking term.

207
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Again, couldn't find anything of it related to that prior to 2017.

208
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Now, the two theories that were the most intriguing was one,

209
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 that it is a phrase that if you speak aloud or meditate on or think about for prolonged periods of time,

210
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 it causes a mental breakdown.

211
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 It is basically a tool that can be used to break down a human's mind.

212
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I was going that angle.

213
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The thing is, like I said, I spent three weeks prepping this story,

214
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 and I have not had a mental breakdown or really any ill effects.

215
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And I've been focusing on this story exclusively on my free time,

216
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 looking up, looking this up hours and hours and hours into this.

217
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And like I said, trying every variation.

218
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 People have said you have to think about it while you're listening to a certain frequency,

219
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 but that theory just came out yesterday, this morning, as I was on the paranormal board on X.

220
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Never heard the thing about the frequency, so I mean, that could be an out.

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But like I said, I've heavily researched this, and the only things I found about it being a phrase to reprogram your mind was on the 4chan board.

222
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 So that leaves us with our last and most compelling explanation.

223
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 A solar plexus clown glider is another term for, and you're going to have,

224
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 so here's where we get onto the crazy train, guys.

225
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Solar plexus clown glider is another name for an interdimensional demon that latches onto your solar plexus like an infection.

226
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 So after a ton of research on this, and I saw those five theories, and I looked for other ones,

227
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 and really out of those, the one that I was able to find the most supporting "evidence for" is the interdimensional demon.

228
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And they're specifically known as archons.

229
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Archons? We'll go with archons.

230
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 The only way that I've ever found a connection between the creatures known as the archons,

231
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 and the term solar plexus clown gliders, is they attach to your solar plexus.

232
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And again, guys, we start stretching after that first one.

233
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 The clown and the jester are loosely tied, very loosely tied.

234
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 I'm even saying this here, loosely tied to like demons, trickster spirits, things like that.

235
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Gliders couldn't find anything.

236
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I tried everything to figure out how these things supposedly move, what type of technology they use.

237
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 I... so I tried valiantly to connect all four words to this idea of these demons.

238
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And I could only really... I could connect two of them, and then the clown was kind of loose in the glider,

239
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I wasn't able to find anything.

240
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Unless you count the way that they do move as gliding, because they slide across the floor.

241
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So apparently what these are, is these are interdimensional demons that invade your solar plexus.

242
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 The solar plexus is where supposedly your chakra is that determines things like will.

243
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Your will to do things, your personal power.

244
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And these demons supposedly, again, they travel through these dimensions,

245
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 they have cut themselves off from the divine light, so they can't create.

246
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 They have no imagination, they are basically in the darkness.

247
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And so they attach themselves to living beings to experience light, to experience creation.

248
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And when they're attached to your solar plexus specifically, they can get you anywhere,

249
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 but when they're attached to your solar plexus specifically, it causes you to like overly worry and depression and doubt

250
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 and all these things, and it feeds off that fear.

251
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 It brings you into their darkness while it's experiencing our light.

252
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 I'm like, okay, that's an interesting hypothesis that there are these demons out there that exist,

253
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 and they're kind of like cut off from what's pure and beautiful in this world.

254
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 They have to infect part of that beauty to experience it and in the end bring you down to their level.

255
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 I'm reading all this stuff about archons and then it says they've already infected the greys and their reptilians.

256
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And I'm like, ah, we're back to those guys, but you know, they're saying that's why aliens tend to be quite cruel.

257
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Like the experiences that people have of greys, they're just kind of cold with their medical experiments

258
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 and they're kind of just like emotionless.

259
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 It's because they've been, their entire race has been infected by these archons.

260
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 The theory is that these things are so pervasive they move from reality to reality

261
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 and plant it to plant it until they've completely infiltrated an entire species.

262
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And it's just these tendrils coming out.

263
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 They're generally viewed as slugs or snake-like slugs.

264
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And once they latch onto you, they're difficult to get off.

265
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Faith healers and mediums say that sometimes they can see them

266
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 and sometimes they've got infected with them themselves,

267
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 and it's a really big problem and it's a cause of a lot of people's un...

268
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Like there are people who have depression for known reasons

269
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 and then there are people who have depression and they just can't figure out why.

270
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And they're saying that the archons are kind of responsible more for the second type of depression,

271
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 just kind of that overwhelming depression.

272
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And you know, just problems in your life is general.

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So are those solar plexus clown gliders?

274
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Is that why that's on that list?

275
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Because it is this alien species that basically has destroyed other alien species.

276
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Is it this creature, this demonic entity, this interdimensional creature

277
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 that is just moving slowly through the universe?

278
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And that's why it's so low down on the conspiracy iceberg list.

279
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Because to know of it and to be aware of it is, in a sense, depression enough

280
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 that these things exist and they're just overwhelming

281
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 and they've already conquered most of our universe, let alone other universes.

282
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I think I've seen one.

283
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I don't talk a lot about my own experiences on this show.

284
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I actually was talking to my two friends Lana and Mitchum and I said,

285
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 "Lana, I've told Lana a lot of stories that have happened to me."

286
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And I said, "Do you think I should talk about my personal experiences on this show?"

287
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And she goes, "No, you'll sound like a crazy person."

288
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And that's true.

289
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Because some of my experiences are kind of crazy.

290
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 This one in particular.

291
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 This episode may run a little bit long,

292
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 but I think it's kind of important because it heavily relates to this idea

293
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 of these solar plexus clown gliders, these demons from another dimension.

294
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 So when I was in college, I had an assignment.

295
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I had to sit in a courthouse.

296
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I think it was a...

297
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 It wasn't criminal justice.

298
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 It might have been journalism class.

299
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I had to sit in a courthouse and watch a trial and take notes.

300
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 And I'm sitting in the back because I'm too cool to sit in the front.

301
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 I'm sitting in the very back and they have those orange hard plastic chairs

302
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 because who wants to be comfortable while watching your loved one be tried for murder?

303
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I'm sitting in one of those orange plastic chairs.

304
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And I remember just kind of had my arm up.

305
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 It was, I don't know, just a weekday morning.

306
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Had my arm up on the chair.

307
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I'm just kind of leaning back like Jason does.

308
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 I can't sit like a human.

309
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Again, too cool.

310
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I saw something out of the corner of my eye, my right eye.

311
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And I'm alone in the back row.

312
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It's just me and I'm sitting right at the aisle because I always like to be on the aisle in case I got to go to the bathroom.

313
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And I'm sitting there and so I catch something out of the corner of my right eye.

314
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And I remember turning to look and in the chair, maybe two or three chairs down from me was a three foot long cobra.

315
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And it was like coiled at the base and it was, you know, probably about as high as me.

316
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 So it was wrapped up.

317
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 It actually must have been more than, well, no, probably about three feet.

318
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 That doesn't matter, Jason.

319
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 It was coiled to the bottom and then like its head was about the height of me.

320
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And it made this super weird movement, almost like this hyper animated movement that I don't think a snake could move in real life.

321
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Now, obviously there was real no cobra sitting there and I knew there's no cobra sitting there.

322
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 I wasn't like, I just looked over and saw it and it was such a weird thing.

323
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And at the time I was just like, I must just be tired.

324
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I must just be dreaming.

325
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And to be fair, that's the most likely explanation.

326
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I was super tired as early in the morning.

327
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 I was bored.

328
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I always stay up late.

329
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I turn and I look.

330
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I see something out of the corner of my eye and then my brain is trying to construct something really quick for me to actually see.

331
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Because I'm basically in a dream state.

332
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I see a cobra and moves in a weird way and I don't react to it.

333
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I just kind of look at it for a second and here's, you know, another weird part.

334
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 It disappeared.

335
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Now, when it didn't disappear like it blinked or it faded or it turned to dust.

336
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 It simply wasn't there.

337
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 It didn't just go, it's hard to explain, but it didn't like, it didn't disappear.

338
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 It simply ceased to be there because there's a difference.

339
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 It was really weird at the time.

340
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 And I remember I just kind of turned back to watch the trial.

341
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I was like, you know, but yeah, it just simply stopped being there.

342
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 I got a sore back.

343
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I woke up the next morning with a sore back.

344
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I was just being a little uncomfortable in that orange chair and I was like, man, these chairs are really uncomfortable.

345
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 I woke up the next morning.

346
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 My back really hurt.

347
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 I was like, oh, that orange chair really, really hurt, really hurt the small of my back.

348
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Now, at that point I had been like in seven car accidents.

349
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 So I didn't have the best back to begin with.

350
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 I was like, that chair just wasn't working for me.

351
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 So I just had a sore back.

352
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I go to my doctor and I say, hey, you know, I have a sore back and he's looking at him.

353
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Like, yeah, I had a hard time sleep.

354
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 I think I waited a couple of days, but it was just sore.

355
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And I go, you know, I'm having this pain in my back.

356
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 I don't know what to do.

357
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And he's like, well, okay, here you go.

358
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 He prescribed me 120 Vicodin a month for what is now I know was minor back pain.

359
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And because the back pain didn't cease, it got worse.

360
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Maybe after about five or six months, he upped it to 250 Vicodin a month.

361
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 So this, you know, this was back in like 2004, 2005, where the doctors were prescribing,

362
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 over prescribing pain killers because they didn't think there's anything wrong with them.

363
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 That time period, when I look back at that time period between 2000,

364
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 it probably would have been around 2004, 2009, it was about five years,

365
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 was some of the darkest times of my life.

366
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And trust me, that's a high fucking hurdle.

367
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I remember taking those pills and no matter how many pills I took, I was still in pain.

368
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 I would just get loopy.

369
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And I remember, because that's back when I was doing my music,

370
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 I came to the point where I could not operate, could not do anything functional

371
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 unless I was taking that medication.

372
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And since it wasn't helping me physically, it was just making me loopier and loopier and loopier.

373
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And I was just like, I mean, I had a hard time working on my next album.

374
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I had a hard time hanging out with people.

375
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 I had to plan everything around my pain.

376
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And no matter how much medicine I took, the pain got worse and worse.

377
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I was having huge emotional breakdowns.

378
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I was having huge problems with being, I think you guys can tell I'm fairly optimistic.

379
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I was having a huge hard time being even optimistic enough to wake up in the morning to go to work.

380
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I was completely just dead.

381
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I was walking dead.

382
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Now, what happened with the medication was I ended up changing doctors.

383
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 My new doctor was like, why are you taking 250 pills a month?

384
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Your MRI shows that you should have minor pain if anything.

385
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Your pain tolerance is totally screwed up.

386
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I'm going to wean you off the pills.

387
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 You're going to hate me for a year and then you're going to feel better.

388
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And that's what happened.

389
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And I feel a hundred times better.

390
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I still get a sore back from time to time, but not how that was.

391
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I remember when I was really, really depressed about my situation, like really depressed on the brink, depressed.

392
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And I remember that snake.

393
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 I don't know why it popped in my mind.

394
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 But I kind of in my mind started putting it together.

395
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I was like, all of this pain started that morning in that chair.

396
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Like, I remember that chair being uncomfortable and it like just feeling painful.

397
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 And I remember thinking, and this is again, weird, a weird thought, but I was like, what if somebody left that snake there?

398
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 What if somebody else?

399
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 That was, it was so bizarre.

400
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 It was, I was thinking, what if it was like a curse?

401
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 What if somebody else had previously been sitting in that row and they had dropped it off or something and had left whatever that was had left them and came for me and caused me all of that pain for all of that time?

402
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Because I had not only the physical pain, but then I had the mental anguish of not being able to do what I wanted to do because I was so cloudy.

403
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 My thoughts were just, I couldn't really think in that fog.

404
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 I felt like a different person on that stuff.

405
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 But yeah, you know, it, I'm better.

406
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I'm far, far better.

407
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I'm back to how I was.

408
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And I don't know why it would have left me or what I did if it really was something like that.

409
00:32:42,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 But what if that was one of these solar plexus clown gliders, this Archons, this parasitic entity that saw me, someone else, it left someone else and saw me sitting there and attached itself to me and said, I'm going to cause some chaos and I'm going to feed off this man's fear for a while.

410
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I don't know.

411
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Most likely explanation is I had a pinched nerve and I went to a doctor and he overprescribed medication and threw off my pain tolerance and throws you down that spiral and all of that stuff.

412
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 But I still, every once in a while, think of that snake and wonder if it's somewhere else out there.

413
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
