00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 What lengths would you go to to eat a hot dog? We take a look at a bizarre

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,440
 phenomenon that seems to happen to people with severe dementia right before

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,040
 they die and then one day a young man was walking through the forest when he saw

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:26,560
 a deer hiding behind a tree. Or was it? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:35,640
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,880
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,240
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing. Hopefully not

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,760
 eating hot dogs. First off let's give a shout out to one of our legacy

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
 Patreons coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. Let's give it up for

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,360
 Mikhail Malone. Everyone give a round of applause to Mikhail walking into Dead

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,600
 Rabbit Command. Really really appreciate your continued support with Dead Rabbit

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,280
 Radio. You guys can't support the Patreon that's fine too. Just help spread the word

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,520
 about the show. Really really helps out a lot. Yesterday's Patreon supporter Greg,

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,200
 I was looking over an email he sent me earlier back when he first joined the

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,760
 Patreon. He found out about this show because of a flyer I put up in Sacramento.

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,920
 I put up a flyer at a local grocery store when I was visiting a couple years ago

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,640
 and he found it. So that is a great way to attract new listeners. I have flyers

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,880
 you can print out in the show notes. Just tell people about the show. Talk about

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
 it online. If you're embarrassed, if you don't want to talk about it in person,

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
 talk about it on wherever. Just help get the word out about the show. You have no

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,120
 idea how much that helps the show out. Mikhail I'm gonna go ahead and toss you a

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,080
 shovel and some coal. Let's hop aboard the Carboner Caboose. We are leaving behind

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 Dead Rabbit Command. We are traveling all the way out to India.

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,080
 It will make it sound like you are pooping in a cathedral.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 They poop in this hole and then the hole has a trough.

55
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 This is a real invention. They have this trough

56
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,080
 attached to it. So they poop in this hole and then your poop

57
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,080
 goes into it and then goes down the trough and then there is pigs there and they

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,080
 eat your poop. It's a win-win really.

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,080
 The pigs get a delicious meal.

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,080
 You are like, "Dang it Jason." I didn't eat hot dogs

61
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 because you said not to. So I made a delicious bowl of stew.

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 You are like, "I can't eat stew or hot dogs."

63
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,080
 These pigs are eating the poop. It's a win-win because the pigs get to eat all sorts of

64
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,080
 spices and delightful tastes and the humans don't have to worry about

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,080
 their feces. So it works out for both things. But remember this state

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,080
 of India, mostly Hindus, they are vegetarians so they are not worried about it.

67
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
 What has happened is that people

68
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,080
 have started moving into this area who aren't vegetarians.

69
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,080
 And so for decades these pig toilets were totally

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,080
 fine. But then you'd be sitting there

71
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,080
 and people would be like using the toilet and then they'd be like, "That's weird. It's backed up.

72
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 Why is my old natural toilet backed up?" And they go out there. There's less pigs.

73
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,080
 They're like, "What? There used to be like five pigs in here and now there's only

74
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,080
 like three. So the poop's not getting eaten as quickly."

75
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,080
 And then the other person would be like, "Oh yeah, I'm

76
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,080
 Johnson. I'm Harry Johnson. We just moved in like a couple days ago."

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,080
 I saw this though. This is true. There wasn't a getting

78
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 Harry Johnson. This example isn't true. But what was happening to us

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 people? That's a horrible name. Harry Johnson.

80
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,080
 People were coming in from around the country who weren't vegetarians

81
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,080
 who saw all these pigs that no one was slaughtering and they began

82
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,080
 killing them and eating them. And these pigs' primary diet

83
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,080
 was human poop. And the people who lived there

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 were like, "Don't do that. Please don't do that. First off, that's our

85
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 toilet. You're eating our toilet. We need these. This is our sewage

86
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,080
 system." People didn't care. It was delicious free

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 pork. You have all the hot dogs and pork loins

88
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,080
 and everything that you wanted. These big plump pigs.

89
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,080
 But they were fed off of human poop. Now people were saying this is super

90
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,080
 unsanitary. Quit eating the poop pigs. And

91
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,080
 it was unsanitary. It's just disgusting. It's just gross too.

92
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,080
 It's not just unsanitary. Nowadays underground plumbing is far more common

93
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,080
 in the state of Goa. It's not such a big issue. But there are still

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,080
 pig toilets there. So if you ever find yourself in the state of Goa and you see some big old

95
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 fat pig walking down the street and it's just begging to be eaten,

96
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,080
 don't eat it. Because that pig is probably full of human feces.

97
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,080
 Also, it's probably not a good idea to just eat pigs

98
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 that are wandering through town. I'm sure it belongs to someone. Whether or not it's fed off of

99
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,080
 poop, I don't think you should just walk around town

100
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,080
 with a fork, a knife, and a bib just chasing after pigs. It will

101
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 end badly for you, no matter what part of the world you're in.

102
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,080
 Mikhail, let's go ahead and leave behind India. Let's call in the

103
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,080
 hair hang glider. Let's hop onto Mikhail's back. And he's going to jump off the tallest cliff

104
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 in India. I'm sure it's some giant mountain. And we are going to glide

105
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,080
 all the way from India to a hospital in the middle

106
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,080
 of America.

107
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 Now technically we didn't have to go all the way back to America.

108
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 This happens in hospitals all over the world, but you know home sweet home.

109
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,080
 We go into the hospital, we're walking around, and hospitals are generally very depressing

110
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 places. Sure, babies are being born and broken

111
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,080
 legs are being fixed, but that's not good stuff it does have in hospitals

112
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,080
 too, but for the most part they're pretty depressing.

113
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,080
 We're walking around the hospital and we see a guy laying in bed and he's like,

114
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,080
 "Betty? Betty? Oh, Betty. Remember when we

115
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,080
 used to play hopscotch together? That was such fun times. Back

116
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,080
 in Herbert Hoover was still president and we're like, "Oh man, this poor

117
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,080
 guy has Alzheimer's and he's like doing the jitterbug and his loved ones are like,

118
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,080
 "Dad, Betty's been dead for three years and Herbert Hoover was

119
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,080
 a terrible president. He was awful. I'm pretty sure the jitterbug wasn't invented

120
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,080
 back then, but it doesn't matter. He's still doing the jitterbug." He's like,

121
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,080
 "And Marty McFly came back and saved the day."

122
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,080
 Before you shut it off. This segment is not me making fun of people with Alzheimer's.

123
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,080
 Okay, before you shut it off. The point of this story, it's actually

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,080
 really uplifting. It's funny because the hospital analogy, you would think

125
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 a story about Alzheimer's and dementia would be depressing, but not this one.

126
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,080
 There is this thing called

127
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,080
 terminal lucidity. It's not a conspiracy

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,080
 theory, it's something that has been observed for over 100 years.

129
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,080
 Terminal lucidity. What it is is you take people

130
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,080
 who have dementia, who have Alzheimer's, who have like super advanced Parkinson's

131
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,080
 where they can't feed themselves, they don't know where they're at.

132
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,080
 They just, sometimes they're completely in a vegetative state, sometimes they're

133
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,080
 just so discombobulated, they don't know where they're at or who you are or anything like that, and that's

134
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,080
 tragic, but one day you walk into the room and they're like,

135
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,080
 "Billy, hey, what's up, dude? Oh man, you're my bro.

136
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,080
 Hey, oh dude, this has been so crazy, I'm sitting in this bed. And did you know

137
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,080
 poor Betty, she died like 20 years ago and

138
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,080
 Herbert Hoover was a terrible president." And you're like, you're back.

139
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 He's like, "I am, I am, I feel great.

140
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,080
 I know I'm in this hospital and I know it's the year 2021, but

141
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,080
 you look good too. Like, yeah, just everything's going so

142
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,080
 well." What terminal lucidity is, is your

143
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,080
 brain basically fixing itself.

144
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,080
 This has been observed over and over and over again. You'll walk in and someone who the day before

145
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,080
 couldn't feed themselves. They're eating, they're laughing, they're joking.

146
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 They remember everything. They're back to who they were.

147
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 The person you remember, the person that you've watched slowly fall apart

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,080
 for the past couple months or a couple years is back to normal.

149
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,080
 But, as beautiful as this moment is,

150
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,080
 the name "terminal lucidity" says it all.

151
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,080
 This happens shortly before they die.

152
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,080
 But, it seems like a gift, doesn't it? You have that

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,080
 person back in your life the way they were, the way they should be.

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,080
 Had the illness not interfered, this is the person you would be

155
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,080
 talking to. They'd be back to normal. And that seems like a gift. That seems

156
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,080
 like those final memories are good ones.

157
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,080
 It's the person you loved who's back sitting with you

158
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,080
 in their bed having this conversation.

159
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,080
 We don't know why it happens though. The idea, because it's linked to death,

160
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,080
 the idea is as the brain is dying,

161
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,080
 as the brain is basically shutting off, it goes into a fever mode.

162
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,080
 And it actually begins to

163
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,080
 excite dead end parts of the brain.

164
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,080
 It's just to bring those things back to life. Some people say that

165
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,080
 it could be caused by fever, drying up little pockets of water in the brain,

166
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,080
 where they're a little whole. They don't know. But they've seen it so many times,

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 they know it is an actual thing. The problem is, we don't see it a lot

168
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,080
 nowadays. So you could easily attribute it to

169
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,080
 some old timing medicine thing, to medical documents written by excited

170
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,080
 doctors and stuff like that. No. The reason why

171
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,080
 this is going back to the sad part, the reason why we don't see it as much today,

172
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,080
 we could start seeing it tomorrow. The reason why we don't see it as much

173
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,080
 today is because our relationship with death has changed,

174
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,080
 and our pharmaceutical answers to death have changed.

175
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 Nowadays when you get to that level, and I'm not judging anyone

176
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,080
 who have had loved ones and they've authorized the doctors to do this, or doctors who have

177
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,080
 done this, but now when people get to that state when they're so close to the end of their

178
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,080
 life, and they're so mentally confused,

179
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,080
 we drug them a lot. And the drugs interfere

180
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,080
 with this process. Because if you're drugged up,

181
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,080
 your brain's not gonna, you're not gonna wake up anyways. You're not gonna pop up the last

182
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,080
 day you're alive and go, "Johnny!" Apparently

183
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,080
 it's super creepy. It's not gonna happen, you're too drugged

184
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 up. So that's why they think we don't see it today. Our pharmaceutical answer is actually

185
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,080
 preventing this. But again, it's not 100% like it's not saying that if your loved

186
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,080
 one wasn't drugged up, they would have popped up and returned to normal.

187
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,080
 A depressing story, but with the silver lining.

188
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,080
 There's no silver lining, and that, they still die in the end. So yes, a depressing

189
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,080
 event, but a beautiful story, I think. Even though it does end

190
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,080
 with the person dying, they get to spend some final hours

191
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 back the way they were. So I think that's

192
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,080
 really, really interesting story. Mikhail, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the

193
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,080
 carbonar copter. We are leaving behind that hospital

194
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,080
 in the United States. We are headed on out to Charlottesville, Virginia.

195
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:49,080
 The year was 2008. We're actually walking down an old country trail

196
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,080
 with a college student named Tyler. Now Tyler is a pseudonym that I've given this person.

197
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 We don't actually know this person's real name. They've chosen to rename

198
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,080
 Anonymous, but we're walking along this little country area. It's mostly

199
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,080
 Woods. We're headed to a nearby liquor store

200
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,080
 to pick up some cigarettes, but we're taking a little shortcut through the neighborhood.

201
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 It's basically, I've never been to Charlottesville, but the way the story

202
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 makes it sound is that there's civilization dense, wooded

203
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,080
 areas where you don't see another human for miles, and then a liquor store.

204
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 So I don't know how this place is laid out. It's by old Lynchburg Road.

205
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,080
 If you guys are familiar with the area, old Lynchburg Road area

206
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,080
 supposedly is pretty tree-y.

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,080
 Jason, I think the word you're looking for is forest.

208
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,080
 The sun is going down. We're still walking along this trail

209
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,080
 with Tyler. It's a normal walk. We get to where we always get.

210
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,080
 There's a little split in the trail. And Tyler's walked this trail before,

211
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,080
 but this is the point where something's a little bit different today.

212
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,080
 All of a sudden Tyler feels really uneasy.

213
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,080
 He starts to hear sounds of movement in the area, huh? What?

214
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 What? He's looking around from side to side. He's looking

215
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,080
 from left to right. And he sees it. He sees the source of

216
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,080
 the noise. Standing behind a tree, almost hiding behind a tree.

217
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,080
 He sees a deer. The deer's just

218
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 kind of staring at Tyler. He's off the trail. He's standing

219
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,080
 underneath the tree, but still a little too close for comfort. Now, normally

220
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 you might be excited to see a deer in the woods. A little, little

221
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,080
 nature's little gerbils. You know, they're not going to do nothing to you. They just kind of walk around.

222
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,080
 You can pet them. You're like, Jason, I really hope you're not

223
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,080
 wild. I really hope you're not trying to pet wild deer. You know what I mean?

224
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,080
 Like, okay, they do have like the big antlers, but for the most

225
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 part they're not going to hurt you. Tyler's staring there and he's looking at this thing and

226
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 he goes, "Something's not right."

227
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,080
 This deer did have antlers. It had a mighty

228
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,080
 rack of antlers. But he said they looked

229
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 wrong. They were thick

230
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,080
 burly antlers. He's staring there and

231
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,080
 he's looking at this deer and he realizes, "Those are moose antlers."

232
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 And as he stood in that forest and the sun slowly

233
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,080
 setting, it's getting darker every moment, he starts to

234
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,080
 realize, "Not only is it impossible for a deer to have moose antlers,

235
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,080
 those aren't even moose antlers. It's

236
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,080
 like a close approximation of what a moose

237
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 antler would look like." And he's looking to have this

238
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 freak, this freak of nature obviously, because a deer can't have antlers like this.

239
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 Maybe it has some sort of disease. Maybe something's going on with it.

240
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 So he starts to continue his way down the trail and the deer begins to walk

241
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,080
 as he's walking. Keeping pace with him but still in the forest.

242
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,080
 Just watching him and following him.

243
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,080
 He starts walking a little bit faster and this deer begins to move faster

244
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,080
 as well. Tyler, at this point he's trying to figure out

245
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 is he being pursued? Is this thing curious? Is it just following him?

246
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,080
 What's going on? But he begins to walk even faster and at this point

247
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,080
 the deer is walking faster. It's keeping pace with him. So he has a

248
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 unique reaction to this. I think if I was there, or if most people were there

249
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 they would continue to run. They'd break out and run because whatever this thing

250
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,080
 was does seem to be pursuing him and it doesn't seem

251
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,080
 normal. You're in the middle of the woods, you're in Charlottesville, Virginia

252
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,080
 and this thing is moving when you move.

253
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,080
 He begins to walk even faster. The deer

254
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,080
 keeps pace with him and then he stops.

255
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,080
 He comes to a dead stop. The deer

256
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,080
 reacts to him completely stopping by running at

257
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,080
 him in a full sprint.

258
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,080
 As this deer is running through the forest, Tyler picks up on some cues

259
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,080
 that maybe he's not just looking at a normal deer with a weird antler

260
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,080
 deformity.

261
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,080
 First up, I guess this is more than just a cue. This is an

262
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,080
 obvious thing. You're facing down something that shouldn't exist. He says

263
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,080
 as it's running towards the forest it was making this very, very bizarre

264
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,080
 motion. He said it was moving towards me at full

265
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,080
 speed but all of its knees were

266
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,080
 bent in the wrong way. And he said the way that it moved

267
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,080
 was like a rocking horse.

268
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,080
 It would rock back and forth on these weird

269
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,080
 deformed knees and it would

270
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,080
 just move closer and closer and closer to him through the forest.

271
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,080
 He's watching this deer move in a way that you shouldn't be able to have any

272
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,080
 locomotion whatsoever. Tyler's like, "Taylor's like, forget that."

273
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,080
 I felt bad for it when I saw the funky horns but I don't have no idea

274
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,080
 I don't feel bad for this now. It's doing something that is, you can't move like that.

275
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,080
 It's breaking laws of physics. He begins running down the trail and this thing

276
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,080
 is fully pursuing him down the trail at this point.

277
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,080
 And he makes a turn. There's a bend in the trail. He's running.

278
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,080
 He turns. He's now out of sight of the deer

279
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,080
 and when he looks down the long stretch of trail in front of him, there is the deer

280
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,080
 standing in the middle of the trail.

281
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,080
 It has somehow cut him off.

282
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,080
 He begins to step backwards and he actually trips over his own feet

283
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 falling to the forest floor. While he's getting himself up off the

284
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,080
 ground, he realizes whatever this is,

285
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
 this is not a deer. He said that

286
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,080
 its eyes were facing forward.

287
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,080
 In the sense that generally predators have their

288
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,080
 eyes on the front of their heads and not predators

289
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,080
 or herbivorous things like that have the eyes on the side of their head so they can see

290
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,080
 predators without having to move their head a lot. He said this deer had its eyes

291
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 firmly in the front of its head. When he saw that

292
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,080
 it clicked in his mind. This, whatever this is, it is a predator.

293
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 It was designed to hunt. He said its face

294
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,080
 was more round than a deer and it had jowls

295
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,080
 that just hung there as this creature is staring directly at him

296
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,080
 standing in the middle of the trail. He realizes that

297
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,080
 every single thing about this is wrong. It's not a deer. It's something

298
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,080
 trying to be a deer, but still not being

299
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,080
 able to hide its full lethal predatory nature.

300
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 As he's getting to his feet

301
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,080
 he sees this creature stand up on its hind legs

302
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,080
 and begin to walk towards him.

303
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,080
 He said the very idea of it standing on its hind legs to him

304
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,080
 seemed like some sort of challenge.

305
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,080
 That was the initial reaction. This thing is trying to challenge me. It's trying to show me how powerful

306
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 it is. And he said from hoof to horn

307
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,080
 it was 8 feet tall and towered over him.

308
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,080
 And as he's turning to race back down the trail to get back to

309
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,080
 safety he starts to hear this thing

310
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,080
 chase him again this time chasing him on just

311
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,080
 two legs. He felt that if he turned around

312
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,080
 to look at this thing he was dead. He just

313
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,080
 ran as fast as he could. He got to that split in the trail

314
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,080
 and then almost immediately

315
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,080
 he no longer heard the sounds of being pursued.

316
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,080
 That's an interesting story. The author went on to say that maybe it was some sort of nature spirit

317
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,080
 in the area that his friend who lived in the area believed that

318
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,080
 there were a lot of things in the woods. Old stories he had heard that his

319
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,080
 family had passed on. About stuff that people just couldn't

320
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,080
 explain. That's an interesting story. It could be

321
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 a nature spirit. You would think it would pop up more often

322
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
 because this didn't seem like the most remote trail. They didn't really give a lot of good

323
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,080
 description about the area itself. But if it's a trail that's even traveled

324
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,080
 say once a day or once every other day what's this forest spirit

325
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,080
 doing the rest of the time? I'm just reading, just reading, not deer monthly.

326
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,080
 So it's curious if it's a forest spirit what would

327
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,080
 have provoked it when Tyler was in the woods. But let's go ahead and put our

328
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,080
 conspiracy caps on and finish the episode up like this. You know, urban sprawl.

329
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,080
 This story took place in 2008. Who knows if these woods are

330
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,080
 still even there. We have urban sprawl. Anyone

331
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,080
 who's lived any amount of time they can go back to the area they grew up in

332
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 and go "Well I can't believe they put all these houses up here. Look at..." And what happens

333
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 when we pave over this stuff where these

334
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,080
 spirits or these creatures reside?

335
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,080
 Yeah you could say maybe as we're going to start putting down

336
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,080
 parking lots for Walmart's and build tract houses. Maybe

337
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,080
 it'll be like a furry vengeance thing where the animals will unite under the

338
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,080
 guidance of a warlord's spirit and they'll fight the

339
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,080
 vibrant and frazier and push them into a bunch of cement and have a skunk

340
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,080
 fart in his face. That could happen. But think about this.

341
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,080
 What if we do pave over all this stuff? Build up these

342
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,080
 McDonald's and these Arby's and these Taco Bells. We create a burger punk

343
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,080
 society where it's fast food instead of nature.

344
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,080
 Everything is paved over. It's glistening aluminum

345
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,080
 and stucco. Where do these creatures go now?

346
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,080
 If it's in the forest and assumes the form of a forest creature

347
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,080
 if it's in an urban environment it would assume the form

348
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,080
 of the urban environment. You're walking to catch the

349
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 bus one day. Steam is rising out of the manhole cover.

350
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 You're just enjoying your favorite music

351
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,080
 playing through your iPod as you're standing at the bus stop.

352
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,080
 You don't notice the man behind you. You don't

353
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,080
 notice that he walks with an odd gate.

354
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,080
 You don't notice him because he seems to blend in with everything.

355
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,080
 Almost some sort of bizarre camouflage.

356
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,080
 He stands behind you at that bus stop. It's just you too.

357
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,080
 But anyone who drives past only sees one person.

358
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,080
 He's the perfect predator. Five minutes later when the bus

359
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,080
 pulls up there's no one at the bus stop. Thus driver

360
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,080
 doesn't think anything of it. Continues along his route.

361
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,080
 The perfect predator will blend into any

362
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,080
 environment wherever it's at. It will find its prey.

363
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,080
 Whether you're walking through nature, taking a shortcut

364
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,080
 through the woods, or walking up a flight of stairs

365
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,080
 late at night in an apartment complex.

366
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,080
 These creatures for millennia

367
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,080
 have hunted and consumed human flesh.

368
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,080
 It will hide. It will hunt.

369
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,080
 It will kill. It will

370
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 never be caught. And no one could even consider

371
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,080
 it may be a beast from beyond explanation. A creature

372
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,080
 from stories of old that is still hunting humans

373
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,080
 to this very day.
