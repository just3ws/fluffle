1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
 What happens on Christmas Eve at 3 p.m. in Sweden?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:11,920
 If you said something normal, you're wrong. You're totally wrong. And then we travel to the Czech Republic

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,840
 where we find a fortress built in the middle of nowhere. As we get closer to it, we notice an odd detail.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,280
 The fortifications are aimed inwards because the people who built it

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,760
 built it over the portal to hell today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:42,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carvin, or I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. That phrase always puts such a smile on my face.

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,920
 And I hope it puts a smile on your face too. Not a creepy smile though.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,360
 Don't just be driving on the road with a grin, with a rick-disk grin. I think that's what it's called, right?

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:25,360
 You're like, "heeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee

11
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,720
 520 episodes? I don't know. Might have done this before. Let's taxi it in.

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,680
 Let's get in the Jason Jet. Have we ever done this before?

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,120
 Cole is checking those buttons and stuff like that. He's like, "I don't know how to fly a jet." We are taking off.

14
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,480
 We are headed out to Sweden.

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:50,680
 Flying, flying out there. We land at a Swedish airport and we notice all the planes

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,040
 are just perfectly still. Not flying around. They're not falling out of the sky. They're just landed.

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,080
 We don't see anyone getting on the planes. That's weird. We get out. The airport is empty.

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,160
 Look around. Hmm. This is very suspicious.

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,760
 To say the least, right? The only time you see an empty airport is during a zombie movie.

20
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,800
 Let's go ahead and hail a cab and maybe we can get into the city. Zombie movies are always better in the middle of cities, right?

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,560
 Let's go ahead. We try to hail a cab. No one's picking us up. What?

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,880
 Danielle, let's put you in the Jason Jalopy. You're like, "Tang it. I'd rather have the jet." Well, you know, what are you gonna do?

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,400
 Danielle's gonna drive us around in the Jason Jalopy. We begin driving through the countryside of Sweden.

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,000
 Every city is shut down.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,880
 Every family is inside their house right now because on December 24th at 3 p.m.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:54,560
 In Sweden, you have to watch television. This is a really weird story. It's a really weird cultural artifact.

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,240
 In 1958, there was a Walt Disney special called Walt Disney Presents from All of Us to All of You.

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,840
 And it was a collection of cartoons from the 30s to the 60s and a couple clips of movies. Walt Disney came out and said,

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,560
 "Hey guys, here's much stuff we made years ago and we're just gonna show it to you." Right?

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,680
 Because we've already made it and it's just extra money. Enjoy. A capitalist till the end.

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:31,480
 In 19-- That came out in 1958. What happened was in 1959 in Sweden was the first year that televisions became something that was in everyone's house.

32
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:39,280
 There was only one channel on the air. So in 1959, they said, "Hey, let's show this Christmas special on Christmas Eve."

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,040
 Because that's when Sweden celebrates Christmas this Christmas Eve. So they showed this special and people went bonkers, dude.

34
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,520
 They had never seen Disney animation before. They hadn't seen Western animation at all.

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,000
 But they were like, "Hey, Mary, Mary, wake up. Did you know in America ducks talk?" And they're like, "What?

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,800
 What are you talking about? Come on, come on, watch this, watch this." And they're like, "Watching this Walt Disney special?"

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:10,920
 And they loved it in Sweden. They loved it. So the next years coming up, people are like, "Hey, you know, you think they're gonna show that really cool show again?"

38
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,640
 They didn't have VCRs and they didn't have DVR, none of that stuff. The next year, they showed it again at 3 p.m.

39
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,720
 They showed Walt Disney Presents from all of us to all of you. And people were going ape.

40
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,240
 There was no animated apes, but they were going insane because they got to look forward to this Christmas special.

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,880
 Now, that was in 1959. They're still showing it to this day.

42
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,240
 Over in Sweden, it has a different name. It's called Donald Duck and his friends wish you a Merry Christmas.

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,880
 And they still have a lot of the segments that were originally aired back in 1959.

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:55,120
 They've done some editing, though, because if you know anything about Disney animation from the 30s to the 60s, some of it was a little racist.

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,800
 So they've edited pieces out of cartoons. But for the longest time, you couldn't change it at all.

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
 There's been talks of canceling it. People go, "Oh, it's kind of a cultural relic. Maybe we'll get rid of it."

47
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,440
 People start writing letters to the editors. I don't know what the Swedish word is for riot.

48
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,400
 They were doing that. They were, "Don't change it, man. That's like Christmas without Santa Claus."

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,480
 Except we don't know who Santa Claus is because we're in Sweden. We got some other weird name for it.

50
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:31,600
 But you can't change it. It was a cultural institution. There were rules, or there are rules, to watching Donald Duck and his friends wish you a Merry Christmas.

51
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,120
 You cannot record it. Because, I mean, nowadays, we do have DVRs and stuff like that.

52
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,800
 You can't record it. You have to watch it live. That's rule number one.

53
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,400
 Rule number two, it has to be made live. And you're like, "What, people? Going back in time and animating stuff and then showing it."

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,120
 There's just one guy holding up cells super fast to make stuff move.

55
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,040
 The intro was originally Walt Disney being like, "Hey, guys. Here's a bunch of old stuff. Enjoy."

56
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,160
 Now, every year they have a celebrity come on and he plays the part of Walt Disney. Hi.

57
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,440
 My name's Jason Carpenter. Welcome to this Christmas special. And it's like this moment with this man.

58
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,800
 It has to be shot live. All that stuff has to be shot live. One guy did it. His name was Aaron Weiss.

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,880
 He did it for like decades. So every Christmas Eve he'd show up and be like, "You guys ready?

60
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,120
 You guys ready? Okay, hold on. Let me get ready." And he would do morphine. He hated it.

61
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,920
 Well, I'm sure he enjoyed it the first couple years. But in the end, he's like, "Hey, guys. Listen, man.

62
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,240
 I've gone through three marriages. I can't spend Christmas Eve with my family."

63
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,200
 I have to say this. Your marriage is already on the rocks. If you miss Christmas Eve and your wife

64
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,800
 leaves you right, you've got some other issues. It might be all the morphine you're doing, but

65
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,440
 he'd be like, "Listen, guys. This is really affecting my family life. It's affecting how much

66
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,920
 morphine I can take on Christmas Eve. Can we pre-record my parts? I'll still do it. But I'll

67
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,520
 come into the studio. I'll be like, "Hey, everyone. It's me, that dude who's on morphine all the time

68
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,880
 and has trouble with marriages. You know me. You've seen me in the tablet. Let me do this pre-recorded."

69
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,480
 And the studio goes, "Yeah, that might work." Well, word got out that he wasn't going to be doing it live.

70
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,480
 Swedish Riot broke out. Letters to the editor. He was forced to come into the studio. That's a

71
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,960
 joyous Christmas Eve, right? He's sitting there. He's like, "I hate all of you. Here's Donald."

72
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,240
 His last segment, his last episode that he did of this, he admits he was high on morphine pills.

73
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
 I don't know if he was doing morphine all the time. He may have gotten a motorcycle accident,

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,640
 a crazy duck was trying to sabotage this motorcycle. He might have gotten a motorcycle accident.

75
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,320
 You might just really enjoy morphine. Who knows? But you have to shoot that part live as well.

76
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,280
 Now, it used to be that everyone watched it because there was one channel, all the televisions.

77
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,360
 Nowadays, they say only 50% of the population of Sweden makes it part of their tradition. You

78
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,080
 sit down and you watch this car. You can't eat while you're doing it. You have to sit there and watch

79
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,440
 it. They say 50% of the population doesn't watch it, but you can't do anything because the other

80
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,040
 50% of the population watches it so you can't go to the store when you have half the population

81
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,080
 at a given time in their house, not doing anything. Everything else kind of comes to a standstill.

82
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,440
 Now, the main segment of it is called Donald Duck Clown of the Jungle. It was a cartoon that

83
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,400
 came out in 1947. Classic Donald Duck. I watched it in preparation for this segment. Donald Duck,

84
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,120
 it's him getting in some wacky adventures. He's trying to take a photo of this cuckoo bird,

85
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,360
 like this dude is flipping out. He's doing a bunch of morphine. He's coming out of the screen

86
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,640
 like Samara. Takes a morphine arm. And in this cartoon, Donald Duck keeps getting interrupted

87
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,600
 by this bird and because he won't take a photo of the bird, the bird threatens to kill himself

88
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,400
 multiple times. At one point, he grabs a noose and tries hanging himself while putting a revolver

89
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,280
 to his head. Not like making a gun symbol with his feathers. No, he pulls out an actual revolver,

90
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,440
 sticks it up to his brain. Donald Duck also breaks out a Gatlin gun at one point. You know,

91
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,280
 classic American cinema. Stuff that they don't make anymore. The way I found out about this was

92
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,280
 there was a journalist named Jeremy Stahl. He wrote this article for Slate called Nordic Quack.

93
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,840
 His fiance was Swedish. He went back to meet the family and celebrate the holidays with them.

94
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,400
 Everyone's like shh, it's on. They turn on the television and they see Arne Weiss with a rubber

95
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,560
 tube wrapped around his arm. He's like, Hey, everybody, here's some here's some cartoons that

96
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,360
 you've seen a hundred times. My family doesn't love me anymore. Enjoy. He's watching this and

97
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,960
 he says I'm sitting there with my girlfriend and her dad is there and he would be watching this

98
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,480
 totally silent as they're watching the show and the dad would begin repeating lines from the show.

99
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,640
 They've seen it all this time. But you remember you only get to see it once a year too. You can't

100
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,040
 watch it any other time during the year. The dad would sit there and he'd be like quoting it.

101
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,840
 Jeremy was like, What in the world is going on? There was no buildup to this. He's just over at

102
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,520
 his fiance's house and they're like, Oh, by the way, here's a 50 year long tradition. Shut your

103
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,800
 mouth and watch. He goes there laughing at jokes. He goes, I know they've heard at least 50 times.

104
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
 And this actually makes sense. It was interesting because in the article in Slate,

105
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
 we have this quote from the guy who does the voice of Jiminy Cricket. I don't know what he was addicted

106
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
 to. He wasn't having to do the voice alive, right? He wasn't watching the animation. He's like, Oh,

107
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,800
 this is the part where I say, wish upon a star, right? He prerecorded his stuff years ago. But

108
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,520
 he said he had this interesting quote. He's talking about society is always about changing

109
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,520
 things. Society is always about moving forward. And here's his quote. And then like in a fairy tale

110
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,600
 from when we were kids, there's something familiar. It offers security in a confusing world.

111
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:08,400
 So you know, no matter what, you're going to get that Christmas special. It's this very, very

112
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,200
 regular comforting thing. So that kind of makes sense. You have it built up because that was the

113
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
 first big Christmas special. The first time they saw Disney animation. And it's something they've

114
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,840
 passed on. They've tried canceling it. People have thought it was archaic. They have been able to edit

115
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,520
 out some of the more racist elements. Now yesterday's Patreon supporter, Stefan

116
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,760
 Walnerström, I had actually, when he supported the show, I always messaged you guys being like,

117
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,480
 Hey, what's your address for the supporter sticker? A lot of times we'll talk. I was researching this.

118
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
 And he said he lived in Sweden. Sorry to dox you. I mean, I think we could guess from the name. But

119
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,640
 I go, Stefan, have you ever heard of this Christmas special? And he's like,

120
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,800
 I've never heard of anyone outside of Sweden ever mention this. And I sent him the article that I

121
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,000
 was working on. But he also added this story in. He said in school, there was a girl who videotaped it.

122
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,320
 And used to watch it all the time. Remember, one of the rules is you had to watch it live.

123
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:17,120
 Here's his message. Quote, that was the most insane thing I could think of as a kid. And I've never

124
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,120
 heard of somebody else who did that. Everybody knows it's only supposed to be watched at 3pm.

125
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,320
 And never any other time. But if you ever do find yourself at Sweden at 3pm

126
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,320
 on Christmas Eve and the entire country is deserted, that's why. So not because of a zombie

127
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,000
 apocalypse. And then I honestly during COVID, with any lockdown for COVID, not a thing about it.

128
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,840
 They're like, what? No way. We're totally going to just going to walk around. We don't need masks

129
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:52,160
 and stuff like that. But on Christmas Eve, don't be making any noise. Because everyone's enjoying

130
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,840
 Donald Duck and his friends wish you a merry Christmas. Very interesting story. Very interesting

131
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,600
 story. The most insane thing I ever heard when I was a kid was I heard a lot of insane stuff when

132
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:11,200
 I was a kid. But I remember when I was like in fifth grade, I heard a story that blew my mind.

133
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:21,280
 It was called naked baseball. So apparently, there was a group of teenagers. This is so funny,

134
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,120
 because it's so dumb. But I remember as being in like fifth grade being like, whoa, dude, really?

135
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,160
 There was a group of teenagers that played naked baseball. And I remember I could visualize it.

136
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,240
 I didn't know what really any of the terms meant. You can kind of see where it's going. But I don't

137
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,760
 remember who told me this, but there was somewhere in town, I lived in the Bay Area at the time,

138
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,840
 there was a baseball diamond. Those are all over the place. That's not just only sometimes on a

139
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,640
 full moon in the Bay Area. You'll come across the baseball diamond everywhere. There was a baseball

140
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,840
 diamond where the teenagers would play naked. And it was coed. Because that's interesting if

141
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,920
 there's just all bunch of dudes who cares, unless you're into that. But I wasn't, right? It was

142
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,000
 bunch of guys and girls. And they would play baseball. And when they got to the base, they'd

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,720
 have sex, which as a fifth grader, you're like, whoa, I don't, I didn't understand. I knew that

144
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,120
 sex was a thing, but I didn't understand any of like the mechanisms behind it, right?

145
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,040
 Because that's how I talked about sex. I'm a great lover. What mechanism do you want tonight,

146
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,560
 my lady? I remember thinking, whoa, dude, like you get to see a bunch of hot chicks like playing

147
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,440
 baseball, right? That's, that's the good thing one. And you're in fifth grade, you're fifth grade boy.

148
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
 And then when like, they get to first base, they have sex with the first baseman. And then the girl

149
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,920
 like hits a, it would suck if they just kept hitting triples. And the guys of the first two

150
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,720
 bases are like, oh, come on, how good are these girls? They're just Sammy Sosa and knocking out of

151
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,000
 the park. As a kid, I thought it was amazing. Like maybe someday I will be able to, I remember

152
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,520
 thinking I want to watch that. There was no porn when I was a kid, right? I don't think I even saw

153
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,200
 a naked person until I was a teenager. The idea of seeing a bunch of naked women playing baseball,

154
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,840
 and of course there's dudes there too, but I wasn't interested in them again. And then having said,

155
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,960
 you know how long that baseball game would tell me? Like as a kid, I was like, I don't understand it.

156
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:29,040
 But dude, games would go on forever if you had to have sex at every single base. And, and if you are,

157
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,200
 like it would be worse actually if you were hitting singles the whole time. The first baseman would

158
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,920
 be like, uh, can I get some water? They have to have like a Gatorade drip, just straight up fluids

159
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,960
 constantly being pumped into them. He sees that ball go by, he's like, oh, please someone catch it.

160
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:52,800
 Please someone get her out. Oh, no, not another one. Baseball games would last 100 hours. But again,

161
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,160
 those childhood legends, I guess naked baseball versus which was fake, I'm assuming, because again,

162
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,280
 men would be dropping dead versus this girl recording this thing. You can figure out which

163
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,880
 one's crazier, but I wonder, I'm sure some people have played some variation of naked baseball out

164
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,440
 there, but nowadays, nowadays it's more exhausting, the thought's more exhausting than anything.

165
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,840
 Cole and Danielle, why don't you guys call in that carpenter copter? I got a little couple

166
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,360
 seat built so you guys can both fly it at the same time. A perfect union to fly this perfect

167
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,040
 piece of machinery. We are leaving behind Sweden. We're saying goodbye to the players of naked

168
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,040
 baseball. The girls are waving goodbye. The men are all exhausted. They're like, uh, we're leaving

169
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:47,200
 behind all of that. We're headed out to the Czech Republic. We're flying over a bunch of

170
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,200
 forests and stuff like that. We're flying specifically to an area that's 47 kilometers

171
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:01,680
 outside of Prague. Now this place is really in the middle of nowhere. There's like a forest part,

172
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,000
 and then there's a big old swamp next to it. A lot of weird biomes going on. It's not a strategic

173
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,080
 location at all, but there's a castle in the middle of it. Let's land that carpenter copter,

174
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:21,760
 guys. We're going to hop on out. We're going to check out Huska Castle. It was built in the mid-13th

175
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,680
 century, and the government set it up as an administration center. So it's like, hey, man,

176
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,360
 I've got to do all this paperwork. Let me drive through the swamp. Let me get in my hydrofoil.

177
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,240
 It hasn't been invented yet. Let me take a couple horses and attach them to a hydrofoil. So you go

178
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,040
 there to do all your paperwork, and you're like, there we go. That is signed. Now let me go 47

179
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,600
 kilometers back to Prague and turn it in. Over the years, it passed through several different

180
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,920
 hands. Originally it was a government building, and then you had private people buy it, and it's this

181
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,680
 very interesting structure in the middle of nowhere. At least that's where the people at

182
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,320
 Wikipedia want you to believe, because Huska Castle is mostly known for the lore surrounding it.

183
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,080
 We walk up to Huska Castle, and it's oddly built. Now everything we're going to look at now is

184
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,240
 kind of folklore related. The people in the area believe that it wasn't an administrative building,

185
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,840
 because the way it's constructed, they say it's designed. It's a castle, but it says that the

186
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,600
 fortifications are built facing inwards. So I don't know if that means like the outer walls just

187
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,840
 kind of made of plywood and stuff like that, and then as we get in they use brick and mortar,

188
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,920
 but it's definitely an odd design. And people go, well, there's a reason. There's a reason why

189
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,240
 all the fortifications are built facing inwards. Let me show you. Now there's a tour guide, he just

190
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,680
 kind of showed up. Come on in, folks. So we walk in to Huska Castle, and we're walking through,

191
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,960
 and then all of our tummies start to rumble. And we turn to the tour guide, and we go, hey,

192
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,920
 we're all hungry. It's the exact same time. We didn't have anything to eat. They wouldn't feed us

193
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,320
 during their Christmas special. The guy goes, oh yeah, those Swedes kind of nuts, the Donald Duck

194
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,760
 thing, right? But I hate to tell you this, but there's no kitchen here. There's nothing, there's

195
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,680
 no kitchen here. And we're like, that's weird. It was an administrative building, and I'm sure

196
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,280
 people spend the night here. He's like, ah, there's no kitchen. Is there a vending machine? No,

197
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,000
 there's not a vending machine. Then we go, okay, so we can't eat anything, because I'm looking at you

198
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,840
 and you look like a giant chicken wing. I'm like, maybe later. But can we wash our hands? We were

199
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,920
 just in Sweden. They didn't do anything for the COVID thing. So can we wash our hands? And the tour

200
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,920
 guide goes, no running water. There's no kitchen. There's no running water. There's no external

201
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:52,160
 defenses. It's in the middle of nowhere. And that's not Martinsson walking into the room.

202
00:19:52,160 --> 00:20:00,800
 He opens up the doors of the chapel, and he goes, this is why you're here. You also would like to

203
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,520
 make a sandwich and wash your hands, but you can't do that. This chapel is the reason why

204
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:14,640
 Huskakassa was built, because this chapel was built over the portal to hell. Now, supposedly,

205
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:22,720
 this is really kind of a bizarre story. Supposedly, there was a bottomless pit here at one point.

206
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,880
 It was interesting because I went to several articles. I found one photo of a dark pitch black

207
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,440
 hole, but I don't know if it's the actual hole. There was photos of the chapel, photos of the

208
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,720
 exterior of Huskakassel, but supposedly, there was a bottomless pit here. And the people in the

209
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:49,120
 area were seeing things crawl out of the pit. Horrible things. They saw winged creatures

210
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,680
 fly out of the pit. There was a half human half bullfrog that was sited in the area.

211
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:05,360
 Half man half bullfrog, winged creatures, all sorts of mutants and monsters in this area.

212
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,480
 One of the legends is that there was a bunch of criminals, and these particular criminals were

213
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,400
 sentenced to death. And the government says, listen, we really want to know what's at the bottom of

214
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,040
 that hole. If you want to pardon, we'll tie this rope around your waist and we'll lower you into

215
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,880
 the hole. And then you tell us what's down there and we pull you up. And if you do this, you're

216
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,520
 pardoned. That's not a bad deal, right? Like if you're facing life in prison versus being lowered

217
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,960
 10 feet into a hole, you take the hole. So this one guy's like, I'll do it. They tie rope around

218
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,520
 his waist, lower him down there. They hear him screaming. They pull him up. His hair's completely

219
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:51,520
 white. His face is all wrinkled. They said he aged 30 years in a few seconds. So there's that,

220
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,800
 right? That should tell you what's in the hole. Nothing good. Experiment done. So then after they

221
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,720
 pulled the old man up, they're like, okay, we should probably build something over this. Obviously,

222
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,600
 something's not good to have. They did took that. The winged creatures and the bullfrog man, they're

223
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,160
 like, yeah, you know, it's the Czech Republic. What are you going to do? But a man aging 30 years

224
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,200
 in a matter of seconds. Now that is a bridge too far. So they built this chapel over the

225
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,960
 bottomless pit and then Huska Castle basically, in case the chapel fell, in case the first line

226
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,360
 of defense fell, whatever was in there could be kept in. Fast forward to the 1930s. The Nazis

227
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,680
 find out about this place. They go, portal of hell, sign me up. I mean, sign that guy up. I'm not going.

228
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,600
 But sign up all those other guys. They can go down there and they could try to figure stuff out.

229
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,880
 I'm going to sit here and just fill up and fill out paperwork in the safety of Berlin. Nothing

230
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,400
 bad will ever happen here. So apparently they send a bunch of Nazi dudes out there to try to figure

231
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,040
 it out. Do you use it for experiments and to like cast spells and stuff like that? I got to say

232
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,880
 this. It would be awful to be a German general during World War II, because you know they were

233
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,400
 calling for reinforcements all the time. Like, hey, can we use some more troops in Africa? And

234
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
 people are like, no, we got them all tied up. They're looking for the lost spear of destiny.

235
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,440
 Yeah, we'd love to send some subs your way, but they're in Antarctica looking for UFOs. So maybe

236
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,080
 we'll come back with them to UFOs, Rommel. Maybe we will save the Africa campaign when

237
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,040
 she UFOs will fly in. If you were a general, if you were, even if you were just a soldier

238
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,920
 during that time period and you're on Normandy Beach, you're like, you start to see all of these

239
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,800
 boats show up and you're like, I hope they find that spear real quick. Because we kind of need it.

240
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,320
 We could have another 10,000 soldiers here, but they're out looking for the Ark of the Covenant.

241
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,800
 We need reinforcements, dude, but they're always off on these weird magical missions.

242
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,520
 These dudes all got wiped out because according to multiple reports, they were doing renovations

243
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,200
 on Huska Castle years later and they found what's this, multiple times this was used,

244
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,440
 they found Nazi skeletons, which I don't know how that's possible. I'm not saying

245
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,160
 I'm not saying Nazis don't die. I'm saying if you walked into a room and there's two skeletons,

246
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,080
 right, there's just two skeletons laying there. Unless one was wearing a uniform, which if if

247
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,800
 you're a skeleton in the middle of a haunted castle on the portal of hell, I don't think that's

248
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,680
 really good for your linens. Pretty sure your clothes are going to get devoured by the flames

249
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,360
 of the bottomless pit. If you walked into a room and you saw two skeletons, could you

250
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,120
 define the political ideation of those? You're like, hmm, this one, this one's bones seem quite

251
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,840
 strong. Must be a libertarian. Must have lifted a lot of weight. Like how would you know? Hmm,

252
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,800
 look at this one voted for the Green Party. These bones are soaked with psychedelics. Like how would

253
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,520
 you know? This is still a tourist attraction. Like this is no one in the area. People can go

254
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,720
 here, they can visit it. It's no one as having this chapel built over the portal of hell. So you're

255
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,120
 presumably safe. Unless unless you're a Nazi skeleton, I think you'll be fine. Here is a quote

256
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,840
 from the Prague visitor. This is a tourist site. In terms of ghost, Huska has them all.

257
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,080
 Ranging from a bullfrog human creature, we talked about him, a headless horse. Not a headless horse,

258
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,280
 man. Oh no no no, Czech Republic doesn't do that. They actually have a horse with no head, which

259
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,120
 actually is infinitely more terrifying. Because that's just gross to look at. Not saying a headless

260
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,280
 horseman is going to win some beauty pageants, well he might as I'm ahead. Those jack-o-lanterns can

261
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:39,120
 look pretty stylish, but a headless horse is just spooky. So we have here's this quote,

262
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,640
 ranging from a bullfrog human creature, a headless horse, and an old woman. What? You're supposed

263
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,120
 to build up. Who cares about the old, there's old women ghosts everywhere. There's old women

264
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,320
 everywhere. I've never seen a headless horse alive or dead. I'd be so bummed if I went there and all

265
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,960
 I saw was just an old woman, just an old woman ghost floating around. I'd be like, bring out the

266
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,480
 horse, bring out the headless horse. The old woman's just kind of floating around. Boring. We also

267
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,440
 have this, here's the rest of this quote. It is also believed that the site contains non-human

268
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:19,360
 remains of demonic beasts who escape the pit. And then the review ends like this. This isolated

269
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:28,960
 castle is a perfect day trip outside of Prague. How bad is Prague? How bad is this area that you're

270
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,120
 like, well we could go up here and have a picnic or we could go to the portal of hell. We could go

271
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,040
 to this forest and just sit and enjoy nature or we could see a bunch of decaying demonic creatures.

272
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:47,520
 Maybe a headless horse, but most likely just some old chick floating around. And speaking of

273
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,680
 how just, I guess, horrible Prague is, there's a rotting, this is no joke, this is real, there is a

274
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:02,720
 rotting 400 year old arm stuck on a meat hook in the town. Because that's, if that's not crazy enough,

275
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,880
 apparently 400 years ago there was a statue of the Virgin Mary that had a bunch of jewelry on it.

276
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:17,120
 I mean, she wasn't known for her bling, right? The Virgin Mary wasn't known for trying to flex

277
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,920
 on the disciples, but apparently this one had a bunch of jewelry on it. A thief tried to steal

278
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:29,120
 the jewelry off of the statue of Mary and her statue arm grabbed the thief's arm and held on to it.

279
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,760
 So tight, want to let go, they had to amputate his arm. How they got the amputated arm out of the

280
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,600
 Virgin Mary's grasp, we don't know, but there is really a 400 year old arm hanging off of a meat hook.

281
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,480
 So maybe it is the best place in Prague, maybe this place, with Nazi skeletons and a headless

282
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,400
 horse is the best place in the area. Now, what's interesting about this is I think I figured it out.

283
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,360
 I think I figured out what caused this. This is something we've talked about on the show.

284
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,320
 So I bet you that Huska Castle is in between fact and fiction, where you have, it wasn't

285
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,920
 probably an administrative building, they probably did serve a purpose, but it was also built there

286
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,880
 over this area to protect the people, or at least to give them some comfort, because what happened

287
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,320
 was they had all of these monster sightings before the chapel was built. Nowadays they go,

288
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,880
 you know, skeletons and old women flown around, stuff like that. I found this on a website called

289
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,000
 Check Trails. It's a bicycling website for Czechoslovakians. Only them, only them I had to fake

290
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,480
 one to go there. I had to put on a big wool hat and not be afraid of headless horses. Check Trails

291
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,160
 was a cycling website. Listen to this, quote, "According to legend, this chapel is the gateway

292
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,880
 to hell, and the Chronicles say the earth broke open there at the end of the ninth century. An odor

293
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:02,320
 of sulfur spread out of a hole that was so deep it couldn't be filled." So we've talked about that

294
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,600
 before. A lot of times when you see Bigfoot you smell something terrible. Demons have the smell of

295
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,720
 sulfur, supernatural possibly, but hydrogen sulfide smells like sulfur, and if you're around enough

296
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,120
 of it, if you get a big enough dose, causes delirium and psychological disorders and death.

297
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,840
 So if a massive sinkhole appeared in the ninth century and people went out to that area and got

298
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,640
 a big whiff of it, you're going to see monsters. You're going to go crazy. And if you don't get

299
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,160
 out of there soon enough, you're going to die. So either people are coming back into town and being

300
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,120
 like, "Hey guys, you won't believe what I just saw. I saw an old lady. I saw an old lady in the middle

301
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,960
 of the woods." People are like, "What?" "Oh yeah, and there was a bullfrog man." They're like, "Oh."

302
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,920
 People who wouldn't come back, they would die. And the legend would go,

303
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,200
 "That's a portal to hell. It smells like hell. It's killing people. There's creatures flying

304
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,520
 around." So on and so forth. This story probably has a rational explanation. There probably was a

305
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,720
 natural leak of hydrogen sulfide, and these people were breathing it in and they were hallucinating.

306
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,560
 And because of that, the government had to go in and fix it. They didn't, they're not think,

307
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,800
 because they were saying the hole was too big to be filled in. They weren't thinking, "Oh, we need to

308
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,680
 stop this natural gas." They also go, "Uh, there might be something supernatural here. We've been

309
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:34,720
 hearing stories for all these years. Let's build a church over it." And because they've apparently

310
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,520
 sealed it, because again, I saw one photo of the hole, but if they sealed the gas smell, then the

311
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,320
 hallucinations would drop. Now you have people saying, "Oh, you go there today. You see a headless

312
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,720
 horse, but we're not like getting any photographs. This place is so haunted. We're not getting any

313
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,680
 photographs or anything like that." It's very possible that either they covered up the leak,

314
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:02,160
 or from the 9th century to, say, the 13th century, everything, I don't know how geology works, right?

315
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,400
 The earth got tired of belching out stuff. It could be that it was covered up so the gas

316
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,720
 isn't being released anymore. It could be that the gas just naturally went away over time,

317
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,000
 so it wasn't have the same effect. So the stuff people are reporting today isn't necessarily real.

318
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,400
 The stuff that was reported back in the day was. But who knows? Who knows? That's a rational,

319
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,800
 skeptical answer. Is it likely that there is a portal to hell somewhere on earth? Well,

320
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,800
 if you believe in hell, then yeah, I would assume there would be multiple ones. But they always

321
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,800
 say the greatest trick that the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. I think

322
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,600
 the same thing would go for his portals, because you could have a giant hole in the middle of

323
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,760
 Czechoslovakia. You look down at it, it seemingly goes on forever. Legends build up about it,

324
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,080
 then eventually build a church on top of it. That's not really the devil's style. He wants to trick you.

325
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:07,760
 The real portal to hell isn't a literal hole, but it's between two trees in the middle of a forest.

326
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,240
 It's that doorway in the abandoned apartment complex just on the edge of town.

327
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,640
 It's that flickering streetlight. It's in the closet of a child's room. There may be portals

328
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:32,480
 to hell on earth. But you won't know it's there until something slinks out of it. Or even worse,

329
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,040
 if you accidentally stumble inside of it. You become just another missing person,

330
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:46,640
 but instead you become something truly rare. A living person trapped in the damnation of the dead.

331
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,520
 Don't worry though, you won't be alive for long. But your soul is everlasting. And you'll have the

332
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,280
 rest of eternity to think, "I shouldn't have opened that door."
