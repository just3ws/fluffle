1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
 You and 99 other people are in a plane flying over an unknown island.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,680
 Next stop?

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,200
 Battle Royale levels.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,200
 Battle Royale games.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,560
 And the conspiracies around them.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,160
 I'm not just talking about them for 20 minutes.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,760
 And then, do you believe in second chances?

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,000
 Some people do, and some people don't.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,560
 But what happens when someone's second chance affects us all?

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:48,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
 You know, I made that joke in the intro about not talking about battle royale games for

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,600
 20 minutes because I did.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,160
 I actually did and it was actually 22 minutes and I'm looking at the recording and I was

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:10,560
 like nope, I would rather re-record this entire episode than have to try to edit that up.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,960
 So let's go.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,920
 Let's talk about battle royale games.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,640
 It's briefly as possible.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,600
 So this was a recommendation from Jean-Luc via Gmail.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,480
 Now what's funny, and some of you guys may have caught on to this, I speed read.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,360
 And a lot of times I will respond to stuff that you didn't say in the comments.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,720
 You will send me an email and I'll be like, "That's a great idea."

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,380
 I never thought that skeletons could actually float above water.

27
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,080
 And people tend to be quite kind and don't point out that they actually never made that

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
 reference.

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,480
 They were talking about Chevy's and for some reason I thought about that.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,280
 And then I'll go back and I've done this a couple of times.

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,960
 I'll go back and reread the email and prepping a story and then I'll email them back and

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,760
 say, "Oh, sorry, I misunderstood your original email."

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
 I speed read it.

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
 That's what happened here.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,360
 Jean-Luc sent an email about battle royale games and I was like, "Oh yeah, yes, all

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,000
 the conspiracies involving battle royale games, these are going to be awesome."

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,400
 And then I reread his email a day or two later and it was like, "If video games are built

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,120
 to be addictive, I wonder how they affect kids developing brains."

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
 And I was like, "I did not even think of that."

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,960
 I was looking into all sorts of weirdness.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,160
 So let's go ahead and jump into this real quick or jump out of an airplane into this.

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,360
 I don't really think battle royale games really need an explanation, but you're one

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
 of a hundred players.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,680
 You're dropped into an island with nothing.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 This is kind of an overview.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,200
 You're dropped into an island with nothing and your goal is to be the last person left.

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,960
 They're based on the movie Battle Royale, which is a great Japanese film, probably like

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,840
 2002, 2003 and in a sense the Hunger Games as well.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
 And it's that same idea.

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,040
 You're dropped into an area with absolutely nothing and through skill and luck, through

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,240
 scavenging and outwitting your opponent, you can come out on top.

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,600
 It's a great genre and I think the reason why it catches on so well is it's almost a

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,920
 microcosm for life.

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,840
 Everyone starts off with nothing.

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,160
 And you could say, "Well, some people are born rich and dead."

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 But you know what I mean.

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,240
 In general, everyone starts off at the exact same place.

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:25,760
 And through scavenging, through exploring, through luck, you find the tools that you

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,840
 think you will need to come out on top.

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,680
 And another interesting thing about it is permadeath.

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,640
 So no matter how good or bad you do in a particular game, the next game everyone is completely

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,320
 the same again.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,880
 Everybody has a better weapon each time.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:49,520
 You can luck across the better weapon or through skill you can know how to use a not so stellar

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 weapon better than a guy with a better weapon but no skill.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,640
 So it's just like life.

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,760
 It really is a lot like life.

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,800
 It's a good way to look at life and how we wish life would be.

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,280
 Everyone starts off the same and through luck and skill you can achieve your goals.

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,800
 You can come out on top with a chicken dinner.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,040
 Now video games are built to be addictive but I think the reason why battle royale

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,280
 games have taken off so much, because they're relatively recent.

73
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,920
 First battle royale game really was like a Minecraft mod, a Hunger Games Minecraft

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
 mod.

75
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,960
 And then they popped up very, very quickly after that.

76
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
 And so the reason why I think they're so popular is because they do have that, you

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,640
 have that intrinsic feeling of fairness built into it.

78
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,800
 There's been other talks that a battle royale game actually meets like Maslow's Iarchy

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,080
 of Needs, which we'll do another episode on that because that's not video games in Maslow's

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,600
 but Maslow's Iarchy of Needs is fascinating in and of itself.

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,440
 Basically every human starts off with just trying to get survival and then they try to

82
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,840
 find shelter and then they have to have a social network and then they have creativity and

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,120
 then self-actualization and all this stuff.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,280
 I don't really think that fits.

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,600
 I think that's a little too smarty pants for a video game like this because there is

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,560
 no social networking in battle royale games.

87
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,400
 Just kill or be killed.

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,720
 Even with your squad, it's your squad versus everyone else's squad.

89
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,080
 So I don't really know if it fits the Maslow Iarchy of Needs.

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,920
 But let's go to Jean-Luc's question here real quick because video games are built to

91
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,200
 be addictive.

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,080
 They are based on, especially games where you pay for and they call them a game, what

93
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,800
 is it, play a service games or game as service?

94
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,080
 Anyways, where you have to keep paying to play the game.

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,680
 Most mobile games are like that.

96
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,880
 Candy Crush, things like that.

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,440
 It sounds like I'm talking real fast because I don't want to talk about this for 20 minutes

98
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
 like I did last time.

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,040
 Sucks I'm spending 20 minutes recording an episode and being like I got a certain order.

100
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,200
 So game as service is what it's called.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,920
 So I'll try to slow down.

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,080
 Game as service is what it's called.

103
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,840
 So here's the thing.

104
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,680
 You have to make it addictive because you want people to keep coming back.

105
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,560
 Candy Crush and all those mobile games are like it.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,560
 That walking dead game, I don't play it anymore but I would check it to see if there were

107
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
 zombies in my area.

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
 It would limit how much I could play so that way I would put the phone away and then check

109
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,760
 it to see if my memory was back, my energy whatever it was.

110
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
 Shoot some more zombies, put the phone away.

111
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,800
 It wants to keep you coming back to the game.

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,080
 So leveling up is an addictive thing where it's very easy to level up in the beginning

113
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,800
 and then the longer you play it, the longer it takes to level up.

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 That's addictive thing.

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,320
 It doesn't make sense in real life.

116
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,200
 I mean, if you read a book, you gain knowledge.

117
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,160
 It doesn't matter how long the book is, you can gain knowledge from reading any length

118
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,440
 of book to get from a... like basically your sophomore year of college is not 10 times

119
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,800
 longer than your freshman year of college.

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,240
 So but anyways, college isn't addictive.

121
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,920
 The video games are built to be addictive and this was Jean-Luc's question.

122
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,440
 What happens when you take an addictive... this was his actual question and not the rant

123
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,640
 that I went off on or I'm going to go into.

124
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,720
 What happens when you take an addictive substance like a video game that is engineered to be

125
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,320
 addictive and give it to a child?

126
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,240
 They've actually done studies on this and the studies say that it messes with their

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,600
 reward center the same way it messes with everyone else's reward center.

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,920
 But we don't know what the long-term effects are of it.

129
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,560
 Now it does... basically the problem with video games is that I can walk 100 kilometers

130
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,120
 in a video game and a little achievement will come up and say you walked 100 kilometers

131
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,000
 and you're like, whoa, that's an achievement I made.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 But a real life achievement would be literally walking 100 kilometers.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,800
 You'd be like, whoa, I walked this huge distance.

134
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,920
 And it tricks your brain into basically giving it an award.

135
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,780
 When no award was to be had, you just simply pressed forward on a joystick for however

136
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,160
 long it took your character to walk 100 kilometers.

137
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,640
 That's why those achievements pop up very quickly in the... while you first start playing

138
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,080
 the game, the longer you play the game, the harder the achievements get.

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,360
 So it's... again, you're like, whoa, only 10% of the people who ever played Killing Floor

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,440
 2 have this IT bag 10 skrakes in one game achievement.

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,040
 I have it.

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,920
 That's why they give you... usually you can check the status of your achievement.

143
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,640
 And don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for all that stuff too.

144
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,760
 When I'm playing games, I get suckered into the achievements and all that as well.

145
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,920
 But I'm an adult and that's my choice to do that.

146
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,000
 When a kid is getting suckered into achievements, it's messing with their reward center in a

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
 way that we don't know the long-term consequences.

148
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,160
 I'm going to make a couple of predictions real quick right now.

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,480
 One, I'm going to predict that loot boxes and that's the sense that if I want a particular

150
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:40,120
 skin or suit for my character, I can spin a currency on a box and I may or may not get

151
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
 that skin.

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,960
 Those are going to be gone in two years.

153
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,080
 I think that's going to be completely... it's too much like gambling.

154
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,200
 People are going to say it's... and there's already been countries that have tried banning

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
 loot boxes.

156
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
 I think that's on its way out.

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,220
 They'll just sell... and the way I look at it too, I would... I would spend $20 buying

158
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,560
 skins for guns in a game.

159
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,000
 But I'm not going to spend a dollar on the chance that I might get this ultra rare skin.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,200
 I'd rather spend money on the skins that I want.

161
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
 I also... I'm going to make this... and this is kind of a side note, it has nothing to do

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
 with what I'm talking about.

163
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,640
 Within the next two years, YouTube will be completely demonetized.

164
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,300
 There will be no videos.

165
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,320
 You won't be able to get any revenue from YouTube at all.

166
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
 It's just way too much trouble for them.

167
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
 When YouTube started off, there was no monetization.

168
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,920
 Viral videos started popping up.

169
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,760
 They started saying, "We'll share the revenue with you."

170
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,840
 I think in the next two years that'll be gone.

171
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,480
 Their thing will be like, "We'll provide you a free place to place your videos and if you

172
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,400
 want money, get a sponsor."

173
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,000
 They can still place ads wherever they want and if you want to make money off of it, get

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 a sponsor.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 That's what I predict.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 That's another Jason prediction.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,640
 I see that happening in the next two years.

178
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,360
 But anyways, we'll see if both of those predictions are correct.

179
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
 I'm going to tell you a prediction that's not correct because I didn't come up with

180
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
 it.

181
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 This is back to our Battle Royale game.

182
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,560
 There's a website called Rain of Mary.

183
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,840
 Rain of Mary, from what I can... and I had to spend an hour on it to make sure this was

184
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:12,760
 not a parody website because the stuff they talk about is straight out of hardcore fundamentalist

185
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
 Christianity.

186
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:22,040
 I'm going to read you a quote from an article they did on Battle Royale games.

187
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:29,440
 "We are in the transition period from the naive, smiley, sexual revolution of the 60s

188
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,920
 to its natural conclusion, an openly satanic society that shuns civilization in order of

189
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 nihilism and of man emulating animals and Indians as the model ideal."

190
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,800
 Battle Royale games, this article is about, got to remind you.

191
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,560
 Their suggestion is that not only do Battle Royale games like PUBG and Fortnite tell

192
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,000
 people that it's okay to go around killing each other and killing each other is the highest

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,360
 form of conquering, which kind of is.

194
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,800
 But not only that, but the characters are dressed really really poorly.

195
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,920
 The website goes on for quite a while talking about how the guys in PUBG start off in their

196
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,800
 underwear and how that's just so inhumane and like the Indians.

197
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 They hate the Indians.

198
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,560
 Also, not a huge fan of the Jews.

199
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
 They talk a lot about them in this.

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,040
 The Jews and the Freemasons apparently are conspiring to kill all the Catholics.

201
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,240
 If they had their way, the Catholics would be dead.

202
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,840
 Fortnite, Jews, Freemasons, Indians, Sexual Revolution, it's all combined.

203
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,240
 And the main purpose of Fortnite, the main purpose of PUBG, not Apex Legends because

204
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
 that game is dope.

205
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,960
 The main purpose of those other two lame Battle Royales, Fortnite, is to get people

206
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,360
 ready for the mass martyrdom of the Catholics.

207
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,680
 Yes, the Catholics.

208
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,760
 The most hated religious group on the planet.

209
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,320
 There's only like maybe like 500,000 left, the last I heard.

210
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,200
 Catholics have no political power.

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,840
 You barely hear about them nowadays.

212
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,320
 They've really just kind of disappeared.

213
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,960
 The Pope's in hiding if they still even have a Pope.

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,000
 I haven't met a Catholic myself in probably 20, 30 years.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,840
 It's been quite rough on the Catholics this past two millennia.

216
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,600
 So yes, the Catholics are being rounded up worldwide.

217
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,840
 It's a tragedy.

218
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,720
 They're dropping them a hundred of them a time on an island.

219
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
 The Catholics, man, they've all been rounded up.

220
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,000
 There's not many of them left.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,040
 All the political power and they have no wealth and they're just completely decimated.

222
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
 That is what Reign of Mary is talking about.

223
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,560
 That is what the Battle Royale games are about.

224
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,800
 It's about getting us prepared for the mass martyrdom of Catholics.

225
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,520
 Predictive programming, you ask?

226
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,880
 Why good sir.

227
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,240
 I think Jason's quite the expert on that.

228
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,400
 Let me say this right now.

229
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,720
 The only thing Battle Royale games have prepared me to do is to scavenge and murder.

230
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,960
 Like yes, I have fun at them, but now I know to go places where certain loot is.

231
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,440
 And if I see a house in the middle of nowhere, I'm going to assume there's a man hiding

232
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,560
 in that house on the top of a door waiting to shoot me in the head.

233
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,680
 That's what Battle Royale games have prepared me for.

234
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,240
 So if they're preparing Catholics to get slaughtered in mass, they're doing a terrible job because

235
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,960
 guess who plays Battle Royale games?

236
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
 Everybody including Catholics.

237
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,960
 So if you're building a game to prepare everyone for the slaughter of Catholics, don't let

238
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,680
 Catholics play that game so they don't know what to prepare for.

239
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,840
 I know that if I see a ramp magically appearing in front of me made out of wood to shoot the

240
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,280
 bottom of the ramp.

241
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,360
 And if I am building a ramp myself to build it three ramps wide so it's harder for them

242
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,000
 to shoot it out from underneath me.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,500
 And I'm not even Catholic and I can figure that stuff out.

244
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,160
 So you've learned some stuff today.

245
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,880
 You've learned that Catholics aren't allowed to play Fortnite and PUBG, otherwise they'll

246
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,480
 know of the secret plans.

247
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,840
 And you've learned that I speed read emails.

248
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,340
 So in the future, here's a predictive programming for you.

249
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,880
 If you send me an email and I respond with a nonsensical answer, because I didn't get

250
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,840
 it wrong to what you're actually saying.

251
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,160
 I read it, and I just didn't comprehend it.

252
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,320
 Let's move on to our next story.

253
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,360
 Now our next story, it's a goodie, but it's a shortie.

254
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
 It's a tiny little one.

255
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,440
 And I thought it was a good way to actually end this episode because it's about second

256
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
 chances.

257
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,040
 I read the story of "This isn't what it's about.

258
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,760
 I'm just going off on another tangent.

259
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,120
 I was on Wikipedia the other day.

260
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,080
 I wanted to know about Earl Simmons, aka DMX, DarkmanX."

261
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,760
 I found out two things.

262
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,200
 DarkmanX, DMX, he's the guy, rough, rough, ran with the rough riders, always hung out

263
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
 with like dogs on the cover of his album.

264
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,160
 "You're on with my dogs.

265
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
 You put us in a cage.

266
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
 We're going to bite you up."

267
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,080
 Love him.

268
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
 That wasn't me mocking him.

269
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,640
 He just, rough, rough, rough.

270
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,800
 Basically that's every song.

271
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,360
 If you've never heard of DMX, you've basically heard every song in three seconds.

272
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 I love the guy though.

273
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
 I found out a couple things.

274
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,640
 I found out one.

275
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,880
 One time he went to jail and he said, "You know what?

276
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,240
 I don't know why I'm here."

277
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,520
 He was actually there for a cocaine charge.

278
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,280
 But he goes, "I don't know why I'm here, but I feel like Jesus put me here to meet

279
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,400
 someone and I haven't met him yet, but when I do meet him, then I'll know why I'm here."

280
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:21,400
 And it's kind of a very spiritual way to look at the obstacles that come about in your life.

281
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,360
 Which I was like, that's kind of cool.

282
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
 A second chance.

283
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,040
 Then I found this out about DMX.

284
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,120
 DMX, leader of the rough riders, all about dogs, all about, always had his pit bulls

285
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,200
 and his music videos.

286
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,920
 The good guys in his songs were dogs.

287
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,120
 You know, I was talking about cats.

288
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,760
 Like I got a dog chase a cat up a tree.

289
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,600
 He's really into dogs and cats.

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,040
 I just figured, you know, he's really into dogs and cats.

291
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,840
 He's really into dogs and doesn't like cats.

292
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,960
 I was reading his Wikipedia page.

293
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,720
 He got abused a lot.

294
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,120
 I guess like his dad bounced early on.

295
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,840
 And he grew up and his mom abused him, physically abused him.

296
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,080
 And then he had a stepfather who came into the picture who physically abused him as well.

297
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,640
 And at one point when he was probably like 12, DMX would run away from home and he would

298
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,760
 just wander the city all by himself.

299
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,680
 He would not want to go home because he knew the abuse that was going to be waiting for

300
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,400
 him at home.

301
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:28,000
 And his only friends on those dark city nights were stray dogs.

302
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,400
 I was like, oh my God, that totally puts all of that in perspective.

303
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,840
 Like dogs were his friends, his crew.

304
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,160
 That was the only people he could trust because he was getting abused by the people who were

305
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,280
 supposed to love him.

306
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,560
 He went out into the cold city streets and like befriended all of these dogs and was

307
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,600
 just hanging out with them.

308
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,120
 And then his mom basically found out like why he wasn't coming home and just kicked the

309
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,880
 shit out of him even more and sent him to a reform school so he didn't get to hang out

310
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,360
 with his dogs anymore.

311
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,960
 I don't know if that's true, but it's on his Wikipedia page.

312
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,240
 And if it's true, they have to make an animated movie about that.

313
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,520
 DMX and his dogs.

314
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,000
 Where it turns out like all the dogs he hung out with his little boy like ended up like

315
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 helping his record career.

316
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I don't know.

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Anyways, let's get on to the episode.

318
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,280
 I thought it was so heartbreaking, but really the main point of that was second chances.

319
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
 The first part of the story, not DMX and his dogs.

320
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,320
 Isn't that sad?

321
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
 That's so sad.

322
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,080
 This little boy walking around playing with dogs and then later on he just refers to

323
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,960
 all of his friends as his dogs.

324
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,600
 Those were his first true friends.

325
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 I don't know man, this is choking me up dude.

326
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
 Choking me up.

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,920
 Okay, so anyways, let's go ahead and get on to our second part of this episode.

328
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,240
 So second chances.

329
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,000
 So there was this guy.

330
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
 First off, I'd have to ask you and you can't actually answer me.

331
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
 You can answer me.

332
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
 I won't be able to hear you unfortunately.

333
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,880
 You can leave a comment.

334
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,720
 Check my email later, but do you believe in second chances?

335
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,760
 Do you believe that sometimes things happen to you?

336
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,360
 You may have done something awful, but you deserve a second chance.

337
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:20,420
 Or something happens to you and like the DMX example, it allows you to go through a tribulation

338
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,040
 so then you earn your second chance.

339
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,480
 It's a difficult issue and I think it really depends on what we're talking about.

340
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,880
 We're going to Mansfield, Ohio.

341
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,640
 The year is 1965.

342
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,560
 It's November.

343
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,640
 And there's two teenage girls, Mary Ellen DeNier, who's 14, and Brenda Sue, who's 12.

344
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,880
 And they're doing laundry in the city of Mansfield.

345
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,400
 And at one point Mary Sue goes, "I don't have enough quarters.

346
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,680
 I have to go get some quarters."

347
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,520
 And Brenda's like, "Okay, you know, I'll just hang out here doing laundry stuff."

348
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,200
 Big old machines, you know, throwing the laundry around.

349
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,840
 They're listening to doo-wop music.

350
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,360
 I don't know why I call them Mary Sue.

351
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,040
 Mary Ellen, it's Mary Ellen and Brenda Sue.

352
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,280
 So Mary Ellen, very disrespectful to get the names of these people mixed up, Mary Ellen

353
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
 leaves the laundromat to go get some coins.

354
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,480
 And while she's coming back from getting the coins, she meets Lester Eubanks.

355
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,280
 Now Lester Eubanks is 22 years old, 22-year-old man, and he's the worst person she could've

356
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
 met.

357
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,880
 A string of sex-related crimes had landed him in jail before this chance meeting with

358
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,200
 her, who was no angel, no innocent person.

359
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,800
 He meets this girl, tries to rape her, shoots her twice, and then beats her to death through

360
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,080
 the brick and bounces.

361
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,200
 Now this is like in an alleyway, not super late at night, because these girls are doing

362
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
 laundry.

363
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,440
 So it's like in an alleyway, he does it, there's a witness, he gets caught.

364
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,960
 He claims insanity, but then eventually confesses to the murder.

365
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,680
 He says, "Yes, I did it.

366
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
 I shouldn't have done it.

367
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
 I was a little crazy.

368
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,180
 I shouldn't have done it."

369
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,180
 They put him on death row.

370
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:12,760
 Now in 1972, the US Supreme Court rules that death penalty is unconstitutional.

371
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,320
 They've changed that since, but in 1972 they said death penalty is unconstitutional.

372
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,560
 You can't do that, you just can't execute people.

373
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,680
 So you have this young man named Lester Eubanks, and he's sitting in prison.

374
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,400
 The warden and everyone starts to go, "You know what, Lester is an amazing person."

375
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,080
 He's actually a model prisoner.

376
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,960
 People started to see that he was polite, he was knowledgeable, he was well respected

377
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,200
 among both the prisoners and the guards.

378
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,160
 But not only that, he was a gifted artist.

379
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,640
 He became known, like multiple newspapers and magazines profiled this man, profiled his

380
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,040
 work, saying, "Look at this young man in prison.

381
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,960
 Look at these paintings he can draw."

382
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,000
 And everyone's like, "Oh, these paintings are beautiful."

383
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,160
 It was Mona Lisa with an afro, was one of his paintings.

384
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,400
 And people were like, "Oh, this is revolutionary, revolutionary.

385
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,760
 Brilliant artist."

386
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
 So this is Ohio State Penitentiary.

387
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,780
 The warden says, "You know what, Lester, you are not only a gifted artist, not only

388
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,640
 does everybody love you, but I love you.

389
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,240
 I love you, Lester."

390
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,620
 Yes, you did murder and try to rape that girl 10-some odd years ago, but something tells

391
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,000
 me you deserve a second chance.

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,680
 Lester's like, "Thank you.

393
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 Thank you, warden.

394
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,400
 I also feel I got to deserve a second chance."

395
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 The warden's like, "Yep.

396
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
 Now I have a special pr- This is totally real.

397
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,320
 This 100% happened.

398
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,160
 I have a special pr- Lester goes, "Why'd you say that?"

399
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,720
 And the warden's like, "Oh, I don't know.

400
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,600
 Just building, letting the people know that this is real."

401
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 Lester's like, "What people?"

402
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,260
 The warden's like, "Never mind."

403
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
 The warden goes, "I have a special program.

404
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,780
 It will allow you, Lester U-Banks, murderer of a 14-year-old girl, go Christmas shopping

405
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
 at a local mall."

406
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,140
 And Lester goes, "Really?"

407
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,820
 The warden goes, "That's not all, Lester.

408
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,180
 This incredibly real program that actually existed at one point at the State of Ohio?"

409
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
 "Yes."

410
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,980
 "Not only can you go Christmas shopping at a mall.

411
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,460
 Not only can you go Christmas shopping at a mall, Lester.

412
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,320
 You can go alone as long as you- Huh?

413
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
 Hold on.

414
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,520
 Don't get jumped from your seat yet.

415
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,640
 As long as you promise to meet the guards that are going to be standing outside of the

416
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
 mall."

417
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,740
 And Lester goes, "Dude, you've seen my paintings, man.

418
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
 You've seen my paintings."

419
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,160
 The warden's like, "I've seen your paintings."

420
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,480
 And he's like, "You've seen my paintings.

421
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,000
 Then you know you can trust me.

422
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,200
 You know you can trust me right now.

423
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 Go see those guards."

424
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,640
 And the warden's like, "Why are you hiding your other hand behind your back?

425
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,040
 You don't have your fingers crossed to you."

426
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
 And he's like, "No, no.

427
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 Look at both hands.

428
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
 It's just scratching.

429
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
 You can trust me."

430
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,500
 So on December 7th, Lester Eubanks, murderer of a 14-year-old girl, attempted to rape

431
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,740
 her, multiple sex crimes entered his belt before that happened.

432
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,500
 December 7th, a day that will live on an infamy, the guards took him to- the guards take him

433
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,780
 to a mall full of Christmas shoppers.

434
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,260
 Nobody knows- it's not like he's wearing a prison jumpsuit or anything, and he has

435
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
 like chains.

436
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,060
 People are chain-gain walking through Macy's going, "Go on a- going to shovel me some snow"

437
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,760
 or whatever they sing, I don't know.

438
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,720
 There was no- it was just a dude walking through Macy's.

439
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
 Guards are like, "You know what?

440
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
 This is a pretty good program, isn't it?"

441
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 And the guy's like, "Yeah.

442
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,220
 It's a great program.

443
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,920
 Isn't it nice we trust these people?

444
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,420
 Hey, what time is it?"

445
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,440
 Uh, yeah, he was supposed to check in like eight hours ago.

446
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,640
 Lester Eubanks bounced.

447
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
 Gone.

448
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,640
 Never seen again.

449
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,500
 To this day.

450
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,300
 Never ever seen again.

451
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,980
 And what's super bizarre about- there's multiple things that are bizarre about this story.

452
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:00,660
 One, for about- they searched for him for about five or six years.

453
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,220
 And then it totally went cold.

454
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,540
 He disappeared from the map.

455
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,060
 And the cops- I was reading one of the articles and they said the cop goes, "The cop who's

456
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,540
 investigating him now wasn't even born when this happened."

457
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,680
 And this other cop was like, "Oh yeah, I was in elementary school when this happened."

458
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,160
 Like the people who are investigating him- he's 75 now.

459
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,240
 But they're like, "We know that he must have had help on the outside."

460
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,900
 And the one cop was saying, "Listen, this program that they had, which was incredibly

461
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,960
 stupid and two people did the exact same thing 10 days before Lester did, they just walked

462
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,220
 away.

463
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,560
 Two other inmates just walked away.

464
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,840
 This story is so old.

465
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,900
 I don't know if those two guys got away, like stayed away for a long time, but within

466
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,540
 10 days they lost three people, one of them including Lester."

467
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,020
 They said, "Not only did he probably have help on the outside, but the one cop was saying,

468
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:02,860
 'Listen, Lester is such a conniving individual that his goal was to get into that program.

469
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,420
 They go, 'We can guarantee that he manipulated every single person until he got on the list

470
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,780
 to get in that program.

471
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,380
 All he wanted to do was get outside of that prison.'"

472
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,560
 He wasn't going to dig his way out, but he realized that he was in this hippy-dippy era

473
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,600
 where they're like, "Oh criminals, you guys deserve second chances.

474
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,000
 Let's let you out in the second- this is what the cop said at least.

475
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,520
 The second he found out that that program existed, he formulated an entire plan to get

476
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,280
 outside of the prison via that program.

477
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,920
 Because there was no hesitation.

478
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,120
 He walked.

479
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
 Never found again.

480
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,320
 They've chased him multiple states.

481
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,740
 They said they didn't unsolve mysteries on him in 1994, but it really went cold for

482
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
 like 20 years.

483
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,860
 And then other people came across it and they're like, "This guy's loose."

484
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,540
 And the police are like, "Yeah, we never found him."

485
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,940
 They're like, "But you're looking for him, right?"

486
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,220
 And the cops are like, "Well, maybe, kinda."

487
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,420
 So now like new cops are taking it on, trying to find him, but they have a couple A-listies

488
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
 for him.

489
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,140
 They say he could be in this state, he could be in that state, but at 75 years old, he

490
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,020
 could easily still be alive.

491
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,960
 And they were saying that he's been smart.

492
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,360
 He's never taken a job or gone to anywhere where he had to be fingerprinted.

493
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,160
 Like he must be living completely under the radar.

494
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,480
 It's funny because the cops aren't saying, "Oh, he's probably dead by now."

495
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,720
 Like the cops are actually saying that he probably slid into a group that knowingly or

496
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,400
 unknowingly, like they may not have known his past, but they go, "If he's conniving

497
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,120
 enough, he can manipulate it his way into a group."

498
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,120
 It could have been a church group, it could have been anything that would actually help

499
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,020
 shield and protect him, and they may know of his past, or they may not.

500
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,020
 Absolutely bizarre.

501
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,700
 There is an idea of giving second chances to people, but then there's just outright

502
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,780
 being stupid.

503
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,860
 You can give people second chances, but you have to be careful about how you do it.

504
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,100
 Your girlfriend cheats on you, you can give her a second chance, but if you do, you have

505
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,620
 to lay down some strict rules.

506
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,500
 And my thing has been, the rules that I can lay down, it's not worth enforcing them.

507
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,380
 Like you can come back and I can have all these rules, but I'm gonna spend more time

508
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,500
 enforcing them than I'm gonna have fun hanging out with you.

509
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,660
 So no, you don't get a second chance.

510
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:15,040
 So you have to be very, very careful when you dole out these second chances.

511
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,500
 But don't dole them out to attempted rapists and murderers of teenage girls and let them

512
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 go.

513
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,320
 It was sucked because they kept interviewing the mom of the girl in the article and she's

514
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,200
 like, "I don't even know how to comprehend this."

515
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,660
 Like, "He's loose?"

516
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,100
 And no one was looking for him.

517
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,860
 My little girl died.

518
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,420
 And this guy just walked out of prison.

519
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,900
 And you know she had to read all those articles about what a great artist he was and all this

520
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,780
 stuff and gross.

521
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,940
 You can have second chances and as people who have the ability to give second chances, we

522
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
 can do that too.

523
00:27:52,940 --> 00:28:01,640
 But they should be used with caution because when they're not, murderers are let loose

524
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,760
 into society and then just disappear.

525
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,720
 And someone, and this wasn't a manslaughter charge, this was someone with a history of

526
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,360
 sexual crimes and eventually a murder.

527
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:22,760
 What did Lester Eubanks do that Christmas or any other Christmas afterwards to celebrate

528
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,060
 his escape?

529
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:31,300
 The idea of him having earned his second chance by going down a straight and narrow path is

530
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,140
 almost laughable.

531
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:41,980
 But what isn't laughable are the victims that came after Mary Ellen that we don't know of

532
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
 yet.

533
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,980
