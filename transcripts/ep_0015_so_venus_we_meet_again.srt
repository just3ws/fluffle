1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 Move over Pluto, there's a new punk planet in the solar system. And we've all

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,800
 heard about people going missing, but what about people just appearing today on

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,400
 Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:35,160
 Hey everyone, my name is Jason Carpenter. Thanks for coming back to Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,560
 The fastest growing podcast in Hood River County. Last time we were the fastest

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,080
 growing podcast in this town of Hood, city of Hood River. Now we're the fastest

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,880
 growing podcast in the county. We're growing exponentially. I don't really know

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,760
 what that word means, but it means like... Anyways, anyways. So thanks for coming

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,200
 back to the show. We got a lot of cool stuff to talk about. Venus is back on the

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,840
 podcast. Venus made a previous appearance when I said that up until the age of 14

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,280
 or 15. I thought Venus was covered in lush jungles and prehistoric creatures

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,840
 and couldn't figure out why everyone was so hyped up to go to Mars. I'm like, "Why

13
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,840
 don't we just go to Venus? We know there's trees there. We know there's..." And no one

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,960
 ever corrected me. That was an earlier episode, but that and that was also an

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,920
 earlier episode of my childhood. But they are back in the news and then we're

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,080
 gonna talk a little bit about appearing people. I've always thought that was

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,800
 interesting. But first off, I want to talk about... Yesterday we talked about day

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,160
 dreams. Today I want to talk about day dreams. Bigger brother, dreams. You know, as

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,960
 much as I find daydreaming fascinating, and I've realized listening back to

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
 podcasts, I say the word "fascinating" all the time. I have to come up with a

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,240
 better word, but that was me taking off my glasses. Okay, so as much as I... like the

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,360
 idea of daydreams, like you can instantly go into your head and picture a

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,960
 perfect world down to the smallest detail and you can direct the action. You

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,480
 can do whatever. You know, yesterday I talked about daydreaming and about

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,800
 winning the talent show. Honestly, the most common daydream is the diehard

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,240
 daydream, which is funny because do those daydreams really exist before that

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,520
 movie? You're like, "Oh, I'm trapped in this single location. I'm trapped at

28
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,600
 Sunrise Mall. I'm trapped at a school. I'm trapped, you know, downtown and it's

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,120
 been cordoned off and it's me against terrorists." That's a very common daydream.

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,760
 I thought it was funny once a girl was telling me that one day she was

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,240
 sitting at a coffee shop and she daydreamed. Someone was talking

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,560
 loudly on their phone or something like that and she daydreamed that she put

33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,840
 his head through the gated, like the spokes of a gate, a metal gate. Like she

34
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,720
 kicked the crap out of him and then slammed him in between that. And it's

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,120
 funny because if I remember the story correctly, no one was actually talking

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,840
 on their phone. She was just sitting there and she was daydreaming. If someone

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,640
 was talking on their phone very loudly, I would beat them up and throw them

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,200
 through a gate. And I think that was the first time I'd ever heard a girl talk

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,560
 like that, but I definitely had daydreamed like that. I think that kind of

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,760
 titters the line between daydream and fantasy. But yeah, to sit there and be

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,440
 like, "What would I do if the bank got robbed right now and you daydream out the

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,480
 whole scenario?" And of course, obviously, it's completely ridiculous. I was like, "Oh

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,560
 yeah, I'm in." Like I would stab the terrace in the neck and then take his

44
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,840
 gun and I'd lead people through the building. And at the time, I mean, I was

45
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,560
 350 pounds. I don't think I could run up a flight of stairs, let alone do a role

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,000
 and then pop up into a firing position and fire an AK-47, which I've only

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,720
 fired a few times in my life as is. So yeah, but the daydream, obviously, I'm

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,960
 like, "Yes, I will jump up and climb up to the top of the elevator and I couldn't

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,760
 do that at my healthiest." I couldn't do that at my healthiest. So, but in the daydream

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,840
 world, you can do whatever you want. The interesting thing, though, is going back

51
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,000
 to dreams is the idea that... And I don't know if it's just me. Again, I think anything

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
 that we think is just us, millions of other people do it. I've learned that, but

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,720
 when I dream, I don't... I'm in it, but it's not... It's not me physically, it's how I

54
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,200
 see myself. I think that's fairly typical. Going back to the being over weight

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,160
 thing, sometimes I would have dream... Very rarely would I have dreams where I was

56
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,080
 my actual weight. Like I said, I used to be 350. I'm down to 275 now. When I was

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,680
 350, I wouldn't have... My dreams, I would be in the body of someone who was like 240,

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,360
 220, you know, like thinner, considerably thinner. And every so often, I'd have a

59
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,360
 dream where I was fat in that dream. And it was because of that dream had to do

60
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,400
 with people like making fun of me for being fat or me having some health issue

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,480
 from being fat. But any dreamer, I was like running around writing dinosaurs,

62
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:22,400
 punching, you know, Denzel Washington in the mouth, whatever. That... I was skinny.

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,960
 You know, it's interesting too, the Denzel Washington... I have this theory.

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,920
 It's called the Denzel Washington. That just popped in my head. The theory didn't.

65
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,520
 The theory didn't, but it's related to dreams too. So I used to hang out with

66
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,200
 this girl, the time name Monique, back in Sacramento. She's a really good friend of

67
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,480
 mine. We worked at Best Buy Together. And she was black. She was a black girl. And I'm

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,960
 white if you haven't figured that already. And so we're sitting there one day and

69
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,360
 I remember we were out eating dinner or something like that. And I said, I looked

70
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,600
 at her and I go, I, in my dreams, I never dream about black people. And she starts

71
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,920
 to laugh and then she kind of freezes and she goes, I never dream about white

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,560
 people. And what I mean by that, that yes, I remember specifically back then that

73
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,440
 I had had dreams where I had interacted with famous black people like Denzel

74
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,880
 Washington or Will Smith. You would, you know, people that you had seen on

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,520
 television, you would, you would, they would be in the dream. But as far as, like,

76
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,120
 in a dream I went to a coffee shop or I'm walking down the street, everyone was

77
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,720
 white. And in Monique's dreams, everyone was black unless she was having a

78
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,920
 dream and Tom Cruise was in the dream or Katie Holmes or whatever. And what's

79
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,760
 interesting about that is this was, we lived, we both lived in Sacramento,

80
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,560
 California, which was very diverse city. You interacted with people of all

81
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 different ethnic groups constantly, constantly. The workplace is full of

82
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,280
 different ethnic groups. Everyone, I mean, just, there were no, like, white areas and

83
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,080
 black areas and stuff like that. Everyone was constantly intermingling. So what

84
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,120
 was, and of course we were friends and we interacted with each other, what is the

85
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,400
 mechanism that makes it so the background characters in the dreams were all of the

86
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,360
 same ethnic group that we were from? If it was a specialized person in that dream,

87
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,800
 if it was a famous person in that dream, that person was their, their race that

88
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,200
 they are. But if I got on a bus in my dream, it's full of white people. As I've

89
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,040
 gotten older, maybe that there's been a couple instances where that hasn't been

90
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,560
 the case. And I remember waking up and going, "Oh, that was weird." But for the most

91
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,920
 part, everyone in my dreams, I'd say 99.9% of the time, unless it's a famous

92
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,560
 person, everyone in my dreams is the same race as I am. And that was the same

93
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,520
 thing for Monique. And I've talked to other people in the interim and they've

94
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,800
 said, "Oh yeah, no, that, like at first your first thing is you laugh and then you

95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,360
 kind of get uncomfortable. But then when you think about it, go, "You're right. I don't

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,320
 really have dreams about people of other ethnicities. It's, it's really weird." And

97
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,040
 again, I'm talking about like the background characters that make up the

98
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,280
 world. Where was I going? Oh, oh, this was my point. The Den, the, not the Denzel

99
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,800
 thing. Denzel thing is just because I, he was, I dreamt about him or something like

100
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,560
 that. I didn't punch him in the mouth. Anyways, I'm getting off the point. People,

101
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,240
 this was the kind of what I wanted to get to and it's taking me like eight

102
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,520
 minutes to do this. When, so when I've dreamt and I'm overweight in real life,

103
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,400
 but then I'm skinny in my dreams or I'm more fit in my dreams, here's my question.

104
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,240
 Do people who wear glasses, I very rarely wear glasses, but people who have to

105
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,320
 wake up and put their glasses on and wear them all day long, when they dream,

106
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,400
 are they wearing, are they wearing glasses? In their dreams, do they not have

107
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,480
 glasses on and their vision is perfect? Or do they wear glasses in their dreams

108
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,520
 because they're so used to wearing glasses simply to see my weight has no

109
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,080
 impact on how I take in the world, take in the world at all, but vision is super

110
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,080
 important. Would a, because I know blind people's dream and colors or something,

111
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,040
 that's again off the point again. Do people who wear glasses all the time

112
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:25,160
 dream, are they wearing glasses in their dreams? I think if I was like, I don't

113
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,400
 know, like if I had, if I dreamt that my vision was perfect and then I woke up and

114
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,680
 I'm like, everything's blurry, there would kind of be disheartening all the time and

115
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,040
 then you got to put your glasses on. I'm curious about it. Or is the same, or is it

116
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,360
 the same thing? Do they only think of dreams? Do they only wear glasses in

117
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,720
 dreams that require glasses? I don't know, that took way too long for me to get to

118
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,800
 the point, but you know, sometimes it's the journey and not the destination. Is

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,760
 that the same? I don't know. So let's talk about the biggest punk of the solar

120
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,680
 system now, and it's Venus, and this is why. So Pluto got, the whole thing about

121
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,600
 Pluto not being a planet is the dumbest thing ever. If you look at the stories

122
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
 about it, it was like, there was a scientific convention and a bunch of

123
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,480
 scientists went to lunch and the nerds who stayed after, because they didn't

124
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,400
 want to go with the jock scientists, they held a vote and they said Pluto's not a

125
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,920
 planet anymore. Any astronomer worth their salt thinks that's the stupidest

126
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,400
 thing, but the pop culture gets hold of it and they go Pluto's not a planet,

127
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,960
 Pluto's not a planet. It is a planet, but anyways, even if it wasn't a planet, Venus

128
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,520
 is still a total little punk right now. So I found this out. So Venus has a weird

129
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,960
 rotation, the planet itself, the spin, spinning around, and scientists are always

130
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,600
 like, why does that, like the length of a day on Venus they can't really agree on,

131
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,920
 because it varies. They couldn't figure it out. And here's why. So there's a bunch

132
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,600
 of big old mountains on Venus, mountains and volcanoes and stuff, and that's crazy

133
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,000
 to think like that planet is belching up fire. But anyways, it's like, first off, a

134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,800
 single revolution takes 243 Earth days, which that is lame. Like, it should, that's

135
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 way too long to spin around. That's, they need to get to react together, Venus. But

136
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,200
 anyways, so the planet, the reason why it spins weird, it sometimes will spin

137
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,440
 faster, sometimes it'll spin slower, because there's these giant mountains, and

138
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,960
 the wind hits the mountains, and it like pushes the, the planet in one direction,

139
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,000
 and then sometimes the wind comes from the other direction and pushes it in the

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,680
 other direction. How big of a, how big of a lame, I'm just gonna say it, how big of a

141
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,760
 planet do you have to be to have the wind move you, to have the wind actually

142
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:49,960
 affect your rotation? That's ridiculous. I, if I was a planet, wind barely doesn't

143
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,840
 even move me. Like, if I'm walking on the street and like a 60 mile an hour wind

144
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,480
 hits me, I'm like, uh, okay, maybe not 60, but 50, 30, whatever. I'm walking on the

145
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,800
 street and I'm like, uh, but I'm not like flying backwards. We're talking about a

146
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,440
 planet that is so big and the wind moves it. That's ridiculous. Even if it's not,

147
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,280
 it's not necessarily like moving it across the universe, but it's enough

148
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,920
 force to slow you down. That is lame. If we want to talk about planetoids and

149
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,760
 things that aren't planets, I think Venus qualifies for that, unless there's

150
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,960
 dinosaurs and jungles on it, and then I will take back everything that I said

151
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,120
 about it in the past five minutes. I do have a question though. I thought about

152
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,240
 this before. Could you have, and this is, there's some things you just can't Google,

153
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,600
 because I typed this into Google before and it nothing, I couldn't get anything.

154
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,880
 Google is actually, it's kind of lame, but I typed in, "Could you have a mountain so

155
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,440
 big it goes into space?" And I didn't, couldn't find anything. Here's my question.

156
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,160
 Could there be planets where there's a mountain so big, because you know, like

157
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,720
 Mount St. Everest, is that Mount St. Everest or just Mount Everest? It's so

158
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,360
 big that you climb up it and you start to need oxygen tanks, because the

159
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,080
 atmosphere gets thin. Can you have a mountain that's so big it actually pierces

160
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,280
 the atmosphere so you could walk up the mountain and float into space and just

161
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,760
 float away? Is that possible, or does the height of the mountain determine the

162
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,160
 height of the atmosphere? Like, will the atmosphere always like be bigger than the

163
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,320
 mountain, because it's like circling the globe and the mountains part of the globe?

164
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,000
 Could you imagine though, if there was a mountain that was so tall, you could

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,960
 literally walk up and float it into space? Like, we wouldn't need our space

166
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,640
 program would be so advanced. We could literally have people up there just like

167
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,000
 throwing stuff, like climbing close to the top, and then they're like chained onto

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,400
 the planet so they don't fly away. And they could just be like, have a fire

169
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,840
 brigade chain, where like one guy at the bottom is like throwing up a box, and then

170
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,000
 you keep throwing up the box, and then you throw it up there. Or I guess what would

171
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,240
 be easier is just the truck. You can just drive a truck up there, that's probably

172
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,280
 easier than fire brigade and stuff, but imagine, that'd be awesome. If we had a

173
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,480
 mountain that tall, you could just like jump. That becomes like people are like,

174
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,120
 "Mom, I'm run mom, dad, I hate you, I'm running away from home," and you like run up

175
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,560
 the mountain and just jump into space. That'd be cool. I don't know if it's

176
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,840
 possible though, because Google has let me down. What was the other story that I...

177
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,040
 There was actually a lot of stories I wanted to talk about today, but I've

178
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,840
 realized that I can't really control what I rant about in the beginning, and then

179
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,280
 I go off on a side tangent. So I tried to keep it down to about two stories. What

180
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,800
 was the second one? Was it aliens? Oh no no no no, I have an alien story, we'll see

181
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,120
 that for tomorrow. This one's really cool. This one's about people who appear. And

182
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:57,760
 there's two parts to this story. The first one is the story. So in 1954, in a

183
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,320
 Tokyo airport, in an airport in Tokyo, the Tokyo airport, there was a passenger

184
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,400
 who gets off the plane, 1954, he gets off the plane and they show their passports

185
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,120
 because it's an international flight, and the passport is for a country called

186
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,520
 Torrid, T-A-U-R-E-D. And the traveler looked European. He definitely wasn't

187
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:28,120
 Japanese. And the Japanese official was like, "This passport is fake. There's no

188
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,320
 country called Torrid." And the passenger was like, "No, there is. Yeah, I'm from

189
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,720
 there." And the him and the immigration official, you know, a little

190
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,320
 polite at first, but they're just going back and forth. And they can't...

191
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,720
 They can't convince each other. The man's trying to convince them that

192
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,480
 Torrid, he's from a place called Torrid, and the immigration's official is like,

193
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,440
 "No, that's impossible." Now, what was weird is they look at the passport, it had

194
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,200
 been stamped before. So like, he had traveled to different countries, and

195
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,480
 they said, "You know, why don't you show us on a map where your country is?" They

196
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,320
 tell you to come aside. And now they're like, because they think, you know, is this

197
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,600
 guy some sort of like criminal or something like that? They take him aside,

198
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,760
 and they pull out a map, and they go, "Where is Torrid?" And he looks on the map,

199
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,800
 and it's not on the map. And at this point, the man starts to get frustrated,

200
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,920
 and he goes, "It's between Spain and France. There's a country here called

201
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,240
 Torrid, and it's been there for like a thousand years. It's an old, old country."

202
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,440
 Now this guy, he spoke multiple languages, and he could speak Japanese well. He was

203
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,000
 fluent in that, and he could fluently speak French as well, and he's like, "That's

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,240
 where that is." And yeah, they couldn't figure it out. So at this point, the

205
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,200
 Japanese official said, "We need to take, you know, like, this is gonna take a

206
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,760
 little more time than we think, so we're gonna put you up in a hotel, and we'll

207
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,600
 convene again tomorrow." And so they put him in a hotel, and again, they don't,

208
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,240
 didn't know what this guy's motives were, so they posted two guards outside of his

209
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,720
 hotel, and they said, "You know, have a good night's sleep. We'll meet you tomorrow."

210
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,640
 And there was like no, there was like a ledge, a window with no ledge, and it was

211
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,640
 high up. And so, the next morning, they go in there, and he's gone. The guy's

212
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:28,320
 completely gone. There's no proof that he was ever there. So I heard about that

213
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,640
 story, the man from Tourette, years ago, maybe like 20 years ago, and it's been

214
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,880
 one of my favorite stories. The idea of people appearing into our world, or

215
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,960
 appearing into our reality from somewhere else. I think we always hear about

216
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,920
 people disappearing, and it's always like, "Oh my god, what happened? It's totally

217
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,480
 scary." And I'm not talking about like people getting kidnapped. That's just

218
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,600
 tragic. Talking about like weird disappearances, like disappearances that

219
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,440
 could be chalked up to some sort of paranormal event, which are still

220
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,000
 tragic. But you know what I mean? Like a dad abducting his daughter, that's not

221
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,680
 necessarily paranormal. Just just terrifying. So, but this story always

222
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,120
 interests me, because it's the other side of that story. People just appearing in

223
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:18,400
 our reality. Imagine in this man's reality, he gets on a plane, and then he

224
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,680
 goes to sleep in his reality, and wakes up in ours, and when he's on the plane, he

225
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,080
 doesn't notice anything's different. The two realities are so closely linked. The

226
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,320
 plane lands in Japan, which is where he wanted to go, which where he planned to

227
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,680
 go, and he got off the plane like he always has, and nothing seems out

228
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,400
 ordinary. The two realities are so close to each other. Maybe he spots an ad for a

229
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,160
 product he's never heard of, but you know, nothing's really clicking for him. And

230
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,640
 so he goes, and he shows his passport, and then that's when people go, "That

231
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,120
 country doesn't exist." You know, that's, "You're not, that doesn't exist." And then I

232
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,400
 imagine when he's in the hotel room, kind of the same thing happens. He goes back

233
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,920
 to the reality where he was supposed to be, and is in a hotel room in that Japan,

234
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:13,400
 and comes out, and they're like, "Oh, hey, you know, you're, yeah, you are from

235
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,880
 Torred. We know Torred. We know where that's at." Interesting. Now, there's two,

236
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,000
 like I said, there's two parts of that story. So, I had heard that story, and I'm

237
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,640
 gonna post this link up, because it's fascinating. The great thing about

238
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,640
 conspiracy theories and paranormal stuff, and I talked about this a little bit

239
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,600
 when I was talking about that rapper who got shot, how conspiracies grow, how you

240
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,920
 take a single thread of information and have it grow. I was doing some research

241
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,920
 on the man from Torred today, because I wanted to talk about it. This whole story

242
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:49,920
 that I just told you comes from a single line that we know of, from a book

243
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,400
 called The Directory of Possibilities. It was edited by Colin Wilson, Colin

244
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,160
 Wilson's is one of my favorite authors of all time. He's a nonfiction author, and

245
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,560
 he has put together several collections of true... He wrote a book called The

246
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,360
 History of Crime, and it is the best nonfiction true crime book you

247
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,320
 will ever read. It is literally The History of Crime. We learn about the very

248
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,320
 first time fingerprints were used. They go all the way back to the oldest types

249
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,480
 of crime, and most of it's centered in England, like in Europe, and the

250
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,400
 Americas. But it's amazing. The book has to be like 600 pages. Please, please, if

251
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,080
 you're interested in true crime, pick up The History of Crime, I believe it is.

252
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,800
 But you look at Colin Wilson, all of his stuff is good. However, he edited a

253
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,200
 book back in 1981, 27 years after the 1954 event, and in a part of this book

254
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,360
 there, this line, it had a section on appearing people, and it said this line,

255
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,720
 "And in 1954, a passport check in Japan is alleged to have produced the man with

256
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,320
 papers issued by the nation of Toret." That was it. That was the only line in that

257
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,240
 book playing into that. And then back in 1999, again this is what I find

258
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,640
 fascinating, this is kind of... and none of this has been cited. These are kind of

259
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,360
 the evolution of these stories. In 1999, there was another book called Strange

260
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,600
 but True, the Mysterious and Bizarre People. Let me read this real quick.

261
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
 This is an excerpt from that book that was 18 years later. "There have been many

262
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,320
 reports of visitors from other planets dropping in on Earth. In 1954, the

263
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,640
 Japanese authorities detained a man trying to enter the country with the

264
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,640
 passport that revealed he was from an unheard country named Toret. A thorough,

265
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,240
 thorough check was made by custom officials to see if there was any such

266
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,600
 place, any such a place anywhere on Earth by the Dura Blank. The stranger refused

267
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,880
 to throw light on the whereabouts of mysterious nations of Toret and quickly

268
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,280
 left Japan." So the story that I told you originally was a story that I had

269
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,080
 always heard, and this is that evolution of that story. Now I'm not saying it

270
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,680
 didn't happen, because this is one of those mysteries that I did... I hope it

271
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:17,040
 happened. But from that single line in that Colin Wilson edited book, and then 18

272
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,760
 years later a little bit more, and you're starting to see how that story grows.

273
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,320
 You're starting to see how that paranormal story grows. And I think that is

274
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,360
 another level of fascinating information on the story. The initial story I find

275
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,640
 very fascinating and intrigues my mind, but the fact that we can watch this story

276
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,200
 grow, we can kind of go back and read about this. And kudos to the person who

277
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,640
 put this article together. I like I said I'll post the link, but it's a great...

278
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,320
 and this guy sources it and every... or woman I don't know. But yeah, so check out

279
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,520
 this link, and I'm gonna spend some more time on this website and look around. But

280
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,720
 you know, I think one thing about the man of Toret is cool is that what if

281
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,440
 that's what happens to people who go missing in the woods? They go missing in

282
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
 the woods in our reality, but then they just go to another reality where

283
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,320
 everything's normal, or it would be creepy if they go to a reality where

284
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,440
 something is totally abnormal, and they're stuck there too. I always wonder

285
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,680
 what happens to people who just go missing in the woods. I think everybody

286
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,240
 does, but yeah, it's like, is it like a wolf eating them, or is it something

287
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,960
 creepier? I don't know. I don't like the woods. We've been over that a hundred

288
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,640
 times. I would much rather get zapped away on an airplane and end up in another

289
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,480
 country. Another... I guess everyone gets zapped up in an airplane. It goes to another

290
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,120
 country, but you know what I mean? Like go to another reality, then be shifted into

291
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,120
 another reality in the forest. This forest should be anyways. So that's gonna be

292
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,160
 our episode for tonight. I hope you had fun. A research that man from Toret story.

293
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,800
 Again, I think that's a fascinating thing. There's other stories out there about

294
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,720
 people appearing, which again, it's... some of you don't hear it very often. You hear

295
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,960
 the disappearing, you hear the missing 411s, but appearing people, I think, isn't

296
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,120
 just another spin on that. And that's what I like to talk about. I like to talk

297
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,680
 about stuff we really haven't heard of before, so... We're gonna go ahead and

298
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:13,840
 call it a night. I am Jason Carpenter. Oh, so yes. Let's go over this again.

299
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,600

302
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,920
 That is my Twitter handle. We're gonna... tomorrow we are going to do ghosts. I've

303
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,840
 noticed this podcast has been kind of ghost light. I want to do a lot of... not

304
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,840
 a lot, but I want to do more ghost stuff. I was like, "Oh, we're talking about science

305
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,240
 and stuff like that. Boners." I think we talked about that in a previous episode.

306
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,440
 But I want to talk about some ghosts. So tomorrow I'm gonna give you some ghost

307
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,520
 news. I found some good ghost stories. We're gonna go through that. So hopefully

308
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,400
 you tune in for that tomorrow. I am Jason Carpenter. This is DeadRabbit Radio and

309
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,760
 I'm just gonna come up with a sign off right now. Let's see. I am Jason Carpenter.

310
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,920
 This is DeadRabbit Radio and you have just entered the rabbit hole. I'm Jason

311
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:24,000
 Carpenter. This is DeadRabbit Radio and... dude, is there any rabbit-based puns?

312
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,120
 Don't get bit by a dog with rabies or you'll get rabid. I could work with that.

313
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,760
 I might be able to... I could work with that. I don't know. There's something there.

314
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,360
 Have a great day guys. I will see you back tomorrow.
