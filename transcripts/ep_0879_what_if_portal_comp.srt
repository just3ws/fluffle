00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Ghosts of Arizona concludes with two creepy tales of hauntings that are a little weirder than normal.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we travel to Northern California to meet a young father who's out hunting.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 When he's walking through the woods, he sees a shimmering portal appear before him.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And he realizes he has a choice to make. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 As you guys know, I've been talking about it about a month now.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 This weekend, May 14th, I will be at the McMinnomins U.F.O. Festival at McMinnville, Oregon.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I've been looking forward to this. I've been looking so forward to this.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 This is really awesome. We're going to have a vendors table up. We're going to be giving out free stickers.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And speaking of that, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Give it up for Adam Carter. Woo! Yeah, come on in buddy. Come on in. He's carrying in boxes full of stickers.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Set him down over there. There's more boxes in the car. You can go grab those as well.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Adam Carter, longtime supporter of the show through the Patreon. Thank you very much for that.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 He also has provided us the art for one of our fan art Fridays.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You'll see that right there. We've used it in the past as well.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 But this now has been turned into a sticker. And this is an exclusive sticker.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 The only way you can get the sticker is to come. You're like, Jason, I wish you had told me this before.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 The only way you can get the sticker is to be present at the McMinnomins U.F.O. Festival in McMinnville, Oregon.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 We did a limited run of 2,000 stickers. We're going to be giving these stickers out for free.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And this is it. This is the official sticker for the McMinnomins U.F.O. Festival 2022.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Fan, Tastic, Fan Art. Thank you so much Adam Carter.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And I want to draw your attention to something real quick because I know I'll get emails about this.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 We changed the tagline of the show, but only for marketing purposes.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Now, over printing, I figured a coffee shop doesn't say "coffee, bagel, muffin, coconut, candy shop."

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 It's just a coffee shop that says they advertise themselves.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 When I called it a daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast, that's what it is.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 When you walk into the coffee shop, that's what you're getting.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But for marketing purposes, you'll see we changed it to, say, a paranormal podcast.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Because I think that sums it up best. It's succinct.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But fear not, we will continue to cover conspiracies and true crime, as well as depressing and dark as that.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Sometimes Adam Carter, thank you so much for designing this fan art.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Thank you so much for supporting the show. You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. That really, really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Adam Carter, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit dune buggy.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're headed all the way out to Mesa, Arizona.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 This place is on 48th North Robson in Mesa, Arizona. This place has a haunted reputation. You can look at it online and people have left comments about how haunted it is, stuff they've experienced, or stuff they've heard from people who work there back when it was cafe talk.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But according to Shadowlands, the Shadowlands.net, which a lot of you guys were really happy that website was still around when I started mentioning that, it's a really cool website.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 It's just a repository of really cool hauntings.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 If you go into the back house, so apparently the cafe talk, you're like drinking your coffee, and there's like a spooky shed in the back.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Apparently there's a basement and that's haunted, but there's also apparently like a back house.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 In the back house, you can go back there and you can communicate with something.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Apparently if you go back there and you sit there for a while, something that was never human will tell you about your past.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And, you're like, Jason, I don't care about that. I know my own past. I didn't get bonked on the head before I came over here. I don't have amnesia.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Well, sorry, I'm still a ghost, right? Some spirit telling you about your past.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Don't worry, you complain and worry, you complain and you're already at this coffee shop that's all spooky and stubborn and you complain it's not spooky enough.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Imagine if you walked into a place and you heard a ghost say, "I remember you cheated on that test."

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 That'd be spooky, right? You wouldn't be like, "Oh, I already knew that. I already knew that coming in here."

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 The fact that something new about your past, that would be creepy.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Not only tells you about your past, it tells you about your future, too.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Apparently if you go to this back house at Cafe Talk and now it's inside the bungalow, if you go to the back bungalow,

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 you'll hear the voices of the damned tell you about your past and your future.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 But, after it tells you this tale, after it weaves this tale, it will say, "For this, there is a price to pay."

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Now, to be fair, I did find a lot of people say that the Cafe Talk was haunted, that employees said the basement was haunted,

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 that they had seen like glasses moving.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Outside of the shout, outside of the shout-alands.net, no one else said, "Oh, and the Crypt Keeper is in the back."

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And he'll go, "For this, there is a price to pay."

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 No one else said that, to be fair.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But, I did find it online and I thought it was creepy, so I wanted to talk about it.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Obviously, the idea is so interesting because who doesn't want to know about the future?

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I remember when I was a little kid, I was obsessed with knowing what my future was.

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 When I say little kid, I mean like, up into my 20s, I was obsessed with the idea.

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I was like, "Oh, if only I could fall asleep for 100 years."

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I was always fascinated by the idea of me and cryogenically frozen and skipping ahead 100, 200, 300 years.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And not necessarily even my future, but the future.

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 But even then, I would settle with knowing what my future would be.

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I used to be really obsessed with that and I kind of just got out of it.

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I don't know if that's a normal thing.

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I think everyone's kind of curious about their future, but I don't know if everyone's so obsessed with it

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 and I don't know if it's something you kind of get out of when you're older.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 But what price would you pay to know your future?

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 That's really what the question is here.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 If I was a young man, if I was in my 20s, I'm not.

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 I'm 45 now and I'm fine with just having the future be revealed to me day after day.

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 But if I was in my 20s, what price would I pay?

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Would you sell your soul to know the future now?

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I think that price is too high.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Would you trade knowledge of your future but have 10 years of it shaped off?

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 The first thing that goes, "You're going to die in 10 years and you die right then."

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 What point would be the price to know your future?

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 It's interesting because as an adult now at 45, nothing.

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I'd be like, "I won't even go back to the bungalow."

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 There's all these portals opening up and all these ghosts.

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I was like, "Whatever. I'm just going to drink this coffee."

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Do you have any bungalows on sale as well?

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I would go back there.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I wouldn't say that I want to go back there, but I don't know what.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I wouldn't really pay a price to know my future.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I wouldn't pay a price to know my past.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I know that one.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 But what's interesting about this story is that you...

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It doesn't tell you the price, right?

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 You've already gotten the information and then what if the price is too steep?

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 What if the price is now you're allergic to chocolate and you're a dog?

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 You're like, "Ah!"

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 You turn into a little puppy.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Actually, that'd be pretty cool.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Playing basketball and stuff like that.

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But outside of my Disney Channel movie fantasies,

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 you...

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Like, once you've already heard the information,

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 then you have to pay the price.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It says that afterwards.

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Now there's a price to pay for this, but it doesn't tell us what the price is.

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I just find that fascinating because part of paranormal research is that quest for knowledge.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And there's a little additional thing to that.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 A scientist has a quest for knowledge.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 A historian has a quest for knowledge.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 But in paranormal, it's a quest for forbidden knowledge,

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 or unknowable knowledge, stuff that may have driven other researchers mad.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 That's something that paranormal researchers constantly are dealing with.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 You have run-of-the-mill UFO hunters,

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 run-of-the-mill ghost hunters and stuff like that.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But when you're like a hardcore paranormal researcher,

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 you're constantly on that line of learning about the dark arts.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Like, that's just something that plays a part in it.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 How often can you learn about ghosts,

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 but be like, "No, I don't want to know anything about demons. They're too spooky."

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Bloody children, hunting a graveyard, I'm totally down.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 You can't. You can't really divide it like that.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 When you go to research aliens, it's all kind of packaged in.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 UFOs and gray aliens and reptilians and stuff like that.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 But none of those necessary, like you can be aware of like the Galactic Federation,

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 you're not at personal risk.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 But if you're learning about ghosts, then you start learning about demons,

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 and you start learning about like how to summon demons and these dark arts

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and this demonic knowledge and stuff like that,

131
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 you're constantly walking further and further into the world of darkness.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 There's no other way to do that.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 That's one of the drawbacks to being a paranormal researcher,

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 is that you're constantly walking away from the light of reality.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I don't know where I was going with this.

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I don't know where I was going with this.

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I started off walking on a coffee shop,

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and the guy says you'll have a price to pay to know your future.

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 But yeah, so like what would be that price?

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And as a paranormal, as like a hardcore paranormal researcher,

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I think a lot of people are willing to pay any price.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 I don't think there are people who are like,

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 "I'll sell my soul to know if Bigfoot exists."

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And then a demon shows up and he goes, "Nope," he doesn't.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You're like, "Aww."

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 As demons pulling your soul out,

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 he's like, "Have a fun 40 years left on Earth."

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And the rest of eternity and hell, you're like, "Oh man."

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 But with paranormal research, you're constantly coming up against that sort of darkness.

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But what price would you pay?

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 What price would you pay to know your future?

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Or none, because at this point, you know, my future is pretty dope.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I'm sure it'll continue along that line.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 That's how futures work, right?

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 It's just once you hit a high point in your life,

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 it's like that, it's smooth sailing till the end.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Go ahead and leave behind Cafe Talk.

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 We're walking down the street with our coffees and our bungalows in our pocket.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 We're gonna go to Phoenix, Arizona now.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And this, again, this is what's really cool about some of these haunted locations.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 We have exact addresses.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 This one, at least, the general area.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 19th Avenue, Northern Avenue.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Right now, as we're walking down the street, we see it's an Albertsons.

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 It's an Albertsons grocery store.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 But before it was an Albertsons grocery store,

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 it used to be the Good Shepherd Home for Girls.

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 This was a Catholic facility.

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So you had a bunch of nuns and you had a bunch of wayward girls there.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And basically, people would say, "You know what? You're not being a good daughter.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 We're gonna ship you off to the nun school."

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And you'd be like, "Oh, man, it should have been a better daughter.

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 But now I'm gonna go get slapped by nuns with rulers."

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And these girls would go there.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And the Good Shepherd Home for Girls was an operation from 1947 to 1981.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And even when it was in operation, there were a lot of stories about bad things happening there.

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Sometimes it was just like, "Oh, you don't want to go there.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 The nuns are gonna spank you with rulers."

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Or, "You don't want to go there. The nuns are torturing girls in the basement."

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 So somewhere in between, somewhere in between,

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 getting your hand slightly paddled with a piece of wood

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 and being chained up by nuns saying, "God allows me to do this."

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Is there torturing you?

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I mean, somewhere in between those two is what you would find at Good Shepherd Home for Girls.

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 So it should be no surprise that the Albertsons is considered to be a haunted location.

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Right? You're going there, you're gonna buy some bread,

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 and then all of a sudden there's like this ghost nun floating down the aisle

188
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 and she's wagging her finger at you.

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 She's like, "That's not whole grain. You're eating that white bread. That's just processed sugar."

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 You're like, "Ah, you're running."

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And then you go to buy some Reese's Pieces and the nun shows up.

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 She's like, "Uh-uh, those aren't M&Ms. Reese's Pieces aren't disgusting."

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And you're like, "Ah."

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And basically, you go there with a shopping list

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 and there's a nun standing behind you with a ruler

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 and she's like having you scratch stuff off till eventually you just go home with a pair.

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 That's all you have for the week. You just have one pair.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 That's one thing the nun will allow you.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And then when you get home, you're like, "Oh, well, I better go put this pair in my basement."

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And then there's a bunch of nuns in there and they're getting ready to torture you.

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 You're like, "No."

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 The Albertsons grocery store is reportedly haunted,

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 but the Good Shepherd Home for Girls was also reported to be haunted.

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Whatever hauntings was at this location preceded the torture nuns.

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 We had the Good Shepherd Home for Girls built and then that got shut down in 1981

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 and then he had quite a long period of time, like two or three decades,

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 where the Albertsons was built.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 You basically just have these old abandoned buildings that were reportedly haunted

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 and so teenagers are constantly breaking into these buildings walking around.

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And it was a classic ghost stuff at this point.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 People said that you could hear the sounds of whimpering in empty hallways.

212
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 No, no, no, no.

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And the teenagers are like, "Do you know the future? Do you know the future?"

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Whimpering young girl who's being tortured by ghosts.

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 "Do you know the future? Nah, let's go get some coffee."

216
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 But that, again, is just typical ghost stuff, right?

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 We've handled all that stuff before.

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 What I find so interesting about this is to this day,

219
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 so now the torture nun school is destroyed, it's Albertsons.

220
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 But during the time of the torture nun school and after it was abandoned

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 and now that it's in Albertsons, this is so creepy to me.

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I can't think of another time I've come across a haunting like this.

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Apparently, like this has been a long-standing haunted site,

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 a haunted phenomenon in this area, on certain nights, under certain conditions,

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 underneath the light of the moon.

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And I don't think anyone's ever been able to put together a pattern for this,

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 but on certain nights when the moon shines down from the sky,

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 there's an area where three gravestones appear.

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 There's this little patch of a field in this location.

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And it's like a little patch of the field behind the Albertsons.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 They'll have these three gravestones appear late at night.

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 There's a large gravestone and then on either side there's two smaller gravestones.

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But during the day and really on most nights as well, it's just an empty lot.

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 It's just an empty parcel of land.

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I find it interesting that this haunting outlasted the Good Shepherd home, right?

236
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 It was visible when people would break into these abandoned buildings.

237
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 They were all visible in the 80s.

238
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And now apparently people say they can still see it today.

239
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 There's a little part.

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And you have to wonder why didn't Albertsons go over that patch of land as well?

241
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Maybe they had all the square footage they needed.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Maybe the building was as big as the city would allow it.

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Maybe as they were doing a survey of the land, the general contractors were like,

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 "Okay, so here we're going to put your frozen food.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Here we're going to put all of your baked goods.

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I don't recommend putting anything over here because last night I saw three spectral gravestones.

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 So why don't we just have that as an undeveloped patch of land?

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Trust me, you don't want to disturb these ghost graves."

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And they're like, "Thank you, General Contractor."

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And as he's walking away, it's a none.

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 It's a ghost none.

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Ghost none is like, "Woo!

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I'm sure glad I took the general contracting school and I'm still alive.

254
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And now I can decide where Albertsons are built."

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 That was God's true purpose for me.

256
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It's still apparently there.

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You can see these three gravestones.

258
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 What I find so terrifying when I read this story, and I found this story in multiple locations.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 This wasn't just on theshadowlands.net.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 My first inclination, again, talking about paranormal research, is what's in those graves.

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Like, that's some straight up Indiana Jones stuff, right?

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Like at a certain time, there's three graves there.

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 There's three gravestones.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Could you dig them up?

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And I would argue that during the day, if you dug up that plot of land, there'd be nothing there.

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 There could be three skeletons, right?

267
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 There could be three people who died.

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 But what I find so interesting about it is the way reality can sometimes warp.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Is that if you went there during the day and dug up, like you know exactly where those gravestones are and you dug it up,

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 there'd be nothing there.

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 But if you went there at night, when those three gravestones were visible and dug right there,

272
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 what would you find?

273
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Like, I feel this is less of a haunting and more of a alternate reality or a different dimension being placed on top of ours.

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 You could dig up the whole area and there could be nothing there and people go, "Oh, I was just an urban legend."

275
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 But if you went back there late at night and saw those gravestones and dug right there,

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 you would find something there, you're now accessing this other reality.

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And who would have the guts to do that?

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It's so interesting because ghosts are very fleeting, right?

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 The idea of so many ghost stories is you see something out of the corner of your eye or you're standing in your bathroom

280
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and you look in the mirror and there's a bloody woman standing behind you.

281
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 All of that stuff, right?

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 You turn around, she's gone, right?

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 She's never like you turn around, she's like, "Fancy a drink."

284
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And then she walks out to your living room and she's making martinis and stuff like that.

285
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 She's like, "Let me tell you about your past. Let me tell you all about their past."

286
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 You spend a lot of time in the bathroom and "Pewwee, isn't that smelly?"

287
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 You're like, "Oh, great. I'm going to get judged by this ghost."

288
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Generally, it's fleeting.

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Even though it may be in the location all the time, you have someone who dies in location,

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 they're there all the time, you're getting ready to do the big play and you know Walter's going to be walking around.

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 That's such a famous ghost story. They're pretty much everywhere, like a Phantom Hitchhiker.

292
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 But to see a location, right, to see gravestones, it's not fleeting.

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 You're actually looking at them.

294
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It's objects that are physically there and it's not like you turn away and they're gone.

295
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 They're there. It's a marker.

296
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's a permanent marker.

297
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 We just can't access it most of the time.

298
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Rare occasion underneath the light of the moon, you can see these three gravestones.

299
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Digging those up would be,

300
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I think, catastrophic.

301
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I think you'd be accessing something that reality was actually keeping us away from.

302
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 So it was blocking it for most of the time.

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 What a way to end Haunted Arizona Week.

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I actually have more Arizona Haunted Arizona stuff, but I don't want to just continue to do a month of Haunted Arizona stuff.

305
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 We were doing a lot of it this week, but what a-- that's so creepy, like to have those locations.

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And I believe, I believe that stuff like this is possible, 100%.

307
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 The idea that you can go to locations and have these communications with spirits.

308
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Going back to the cafe talk thing, I think that's probably a place where just the veil is very thin.

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I mean, it could be made up story, right?

310
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Every story I cover on here could be made up.

311
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But it could be a place where the veil is so thin that something is able to speak to you.

312
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And Arizona has a long reputation, a very long reputation of having a very permeable barrier between our reality and the next.

313
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And that's actually a great segue for the next story.

314
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Adam Carter, let's toss you the keys of the carbonar copter.

315
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 We're leaving behind Phoenix, Arizona.

316
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 We're headed all the way up to Northern California.

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 [imitates car engine]

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I just came across this story the other day.

319
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I came across them on Tuesday and I was like, "Man, this is a great way to finish out the week.

320
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 What a cool and creepy story."

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 It was posted online by someone going by the name "Nobody Is Here 71."

322
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I really want to point this out. I like pointing this out.

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I was looking through his posting history and it's just a bunch of normal stuff.

324
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Just a bunch of normal stuff.

325
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 These what makes these stories feel so authentic, right?

326
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 You post about just random stuff, stuff that's going on in their lives, stuff they have questions for,

327
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 and then they post this absolutely bizarre story and it just adds that credibility to it.

328
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 This story isn't necessarily his. It's actually happened to his father.

329
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 We're going to go ahead and give his father the name of Peter.

330
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 The story takes place in the early 1970s.

331
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 The reason why we're in Northern California is there's a little homestead near the Klamath River in Northern California.

332
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 The Klamath River dislocation, he's by the town, or the biggest town there, the closest to is Eureka.

333
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Not Eureka. Why Eureka? Why Eureka? Maybe?

334
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And so anyways, Peter is a dad. He has a wife and a little baby.

335
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 A little baby that eventually will post online under the name "Nobody is here, 71."

336
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And this is just an outdoorsy family, right?

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They got this little homestead by the river and Peter goes out hunting all the time.

338
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 He knows this area very well. Specifically, he's hunting through the Shasta Trinity Forest area.

339
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Mount Shasta has a long history of being connected to paranormal activity.

340
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So this story again tracks for this area.

341
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 So one day, Peter goes out hunting in the woods.

342
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 A couple hours later, he comes back home and his wife's sewing something.

343
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I mean, she's not Lord Englewilds. This isn't a little awesome prairie, but I don't know.

344
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Maybe she was sewing, I'm assuming.

345
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And she's stitching up the baby. The baby fell down.

346
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 She's like, "Oh no, hope Peter hasn't come back before I'm done stitching up this baby."

347
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 She's putting this baby back together like cabbage patch doll.

348
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And Peter walks in and he looks at his wife and he looks at his babies.

349
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 "Oh my god, what happened to my kid while I was gone?"

350
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He looks like Frayn Sainz Monster.

351
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Peter turns to his wife and says, "Dude, you won't believe what happened.

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You won't believe what happened to me in the woods."

353
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 She's like, "Is there anything to distract me from my monster baby? Please tell me the story, Peter."

354
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Peter goes, "I was hunting in the woods. I was hunting in the Shasta Trinity area.

355
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 I've been here a lot. I've hunted this area for a long time. I know the woods."

356
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And I saw something.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 As I was walking, all of a sudden...

358
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 [humming]

359
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 A portal opened up in front of me.

360
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I'm looking at this.

361
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Looking at this gateway to somewhere.

362
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Like, I know it. I know this was a portal.

363
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Not like I'd ever seen one before.

364
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Not like I'd ever experienced something like this before,

365
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 but I knew in my soul what I was looking at.

366
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 This was a gateway to somewhere else.

367
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And I wanted to go in.

368
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 I wanted to step into that portal.

369
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I wanted to step through that doorway and find out what was on the other side.

370
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But even though I'd never seen a portal before, even though I'd never experienced anything like this,

371
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 I knew once I'd sent through this portal, I could never come back.

372
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 It was a one-way trip. I just knew it.

373
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And I wanted to walk into that portal, but I would never see you again.

374
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 I'd never see our baby again.

375
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 I'd never see home again.

376
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Six months later, Peter was working at his brother's restaurant.

377
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 He's working the graveyard shift.

378
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 He's up all night serving customers.

379
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 When the morning comes, he sits back. He drinks some coffee with his brother.

380
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 They talk for a bit, and Peter gets in his car and drives down.

381
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And he actually visits some other friends, and he sits there and he's drinking coffee with his friends,

382
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 having a good morning, just chatting it up.

383
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But now it's time to go home.

384
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 The ops in his car is he's headed back down the road, driving alongside the Klamath River.

385
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 According to police investigations, what happened was, he fell asleep at the wheel,

386
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 lost control of his car.

387
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 His car slammed into the mountain side, because they could see paint from his car on the mountain,

388
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 and then damaged to his car.

389
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And the police believe that when he fell asleep driving his car, he lost control, he slammed into the mountain side,

390
00:25:47,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and that knocked him unconscious, and then the car drove off the road into the Klamath River, and he drowned.

391
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 This story is, this story really kind of stuck with me.

392
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Standing there, looking at this portal, and having to make the decision about whether or not to step inside of it.

393
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 When I was 20, I had a family that loved me, but I would have stepped through the portal.

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 At 45, I still have a family that loves me, I'm assuming that I haven't burned many bridges.

395
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 But would I step through the portal now?

396
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 My family is my family that I grew up with, if I had a wife and a kid, even in my 20s, I may not have stepped through that portal.

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 But maybe, maybe my baby's like, "Papa, Papa, Papa!" and I'm like, "See you later, loser! I'm going to the other side!"

398
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Papa, leave me!

399
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But that's life, isn't it, right? You're giving these choices.

400
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 He stumbles upon something that so many people would love to see.

401
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Wouldn't think twice about walking through that.

402
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 We covered this story a long time ago about that guy in Arizona, who kept wanting to jump off a cliff because he thought a portal would show up, and like, the people in town had to keep stopping him.

403
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And here's this guy just out hunting one day, and he comes across proof of other dimensions, alternate realities, gateways to another world.

404
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He just stumbles upon something that people spend their entire life searching for.

405
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 He decides not to walk through that portal, an experience that a minute number of humans throughout history will ever have standing in front of a portal to another world.

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I mean, it's truly a statistically extremely rare, right?

407
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 It's so rare, people don't believe they exist.

408
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 People believe they can't exist. It's that impossible sounding, but here he is, and he chose not to do it.

409
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And then he died six months later.

410
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 That's why this story sticks with me.

411
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 He said, "No, I want to be with my family," and he only had from that moment on, six months to be with his family.

412
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 How did he know then? Had he gone to Cafe Talk in Mesa, Arizona?

413
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Had he known when he looked at that portal that he only had six months left to live on Earth in this reality?

414
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 If he knew at that moment, in six months, he would be dead.

415
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Do you think he wouldn't walk through that portal?

416
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Would six more months with his family be worth not going here?

417
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 It's so fascinating.

418
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 This story just, I find so intriguing because he had a choice and he chose to stay, but in the end, he didn't have a choice.

419
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Six months later, he died.

420
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 He was going one way or the other and he could have taken the journey that we all take, right?

421
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 We are all going to pass on. We are all going to die.

422
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Billions upon billions of people throughout history and trillions going forward will die.

423
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Or he could have taken the path that happens to what, maybe, 10,000 people throughout history?

424
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Maybe 5,000, 1,000 people throughout all of human history passing through one of these portals?

425
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Of course, his family would have just thought he got lost in the woods. There would have been search parties.

426
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 They wouldn't have found any trace of him.

427
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 His wife would always wonder what happened to him. She'd be thinking the worst.

428
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 He got kidnapped. He fell in a crevasse and was screaming for help until he slowly died of exposure.

429
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 She wouldn't even think he'd walk through a portal.

430
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 So, going back, was stepping away from that portal to spare his wife those years of wondering what happened to Peter.

431
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Was that worth it?

432
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Like, to give her a peace of mind?

433
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I mean, dying in a car accident is pretty brutal, but it's better than just not knowing.

434
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Never knowing what happened to her husband, for the father of her child.

435
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 What if?

436
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 What if?

437
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 What if he had stepped through that portal and entered this new world and possibly lived much longer than six months?

438
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 He could have been shredded in a spaghetti by some creature. Killed him instantly, but what if?

439
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 This is really one of those stories. We hear about people disappearing in the woods and maybe it's something paranormal, like missing 411.

440
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Maybe it's not. Maybe it is them falling. Maybe it is them getting lost. Maybe it is them getting kidnapped.

441
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 But here we have a story of a guy who saw the portal, decided not to enter it, and then died six months later.

442
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 To me, that just seems like a cruel joke.

443
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 He had a choice to go on this once-in-a-lifetime journey. That even makes it minimize it, right? These are so rare.

444
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 He had the chance to go on this journey, and he chose not to, to be with his family, and then fate took him from his family anyways.

445
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 When Peter walked into the woods that day, he thought he was just going to go on a normal hunting trip, like he's done so many times in the past.

446
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Instead, he was confronted with proof that the world is not what it seems.

447
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 But six months later, his family was reminded that the world is what it seems.

448
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Random chaos. Unpredictability.

449
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Maybe there is an advantage to knowing what the future holds for you, no matter the price.

450
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 He could have either known the future and avoided the car accident, or known that there was no way to avoid his death six months from now, and stepped through that portal.

451
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Peter was offered a choice that day to enter the portal or to walk back home.

452
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 But I know whether or not Peter was destined to die six months after that, or he lived a long life.

453
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 He would spend every day of that life asking the question, "What if?"

454
