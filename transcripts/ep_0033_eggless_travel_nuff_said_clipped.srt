1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 Today we travel to the town of Ong's Hat.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,320
 Did it exist?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,760
 And what happened there?

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,960
 And we cover one of the most requested stories.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,880
 Even a story I have been so curious to find the truth out about.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,400
 Ageless Travel.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,360
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,440
 Hope you're having a great day.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,840
 We're recording this one a little early.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,500
 I always wanted to get an episode out on Sunday nights, and so I have episodes coming out

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,560
 Monday through Friday, so I'm hoping that we can keep the schedule going.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,200
 I think that works out for most people, because if they're working Monday through Friday,

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,800
 how who works Monday through Friday anymore, actually?

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,440
 Who has a job like that?

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
 I don't know.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,920
 I haven't worked a job Monday through Friday in 15, 20 years.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,160
 But I guess they still exist.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,920
 I guess they still exist.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,440
 So let's just go ahead and jump in.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,480
 Because this is kind of a weird, both of these stories are related.

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,960
 It's kind of a little two-parter.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,280
 I'm going to try to get it into our normal time allotment.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,000
 I like to hear these episodes between 20 and 30 minutes.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 30 minutes max.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,120
 Normally, until an interesting, quote-unquote, interesting story right now, we're going

28
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,840
 to jump right in, because I think this story is interesting.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,520
 It was originally spread out over two days.

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,120
 I'm going to be able to fit it into one, though.

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,000
 And Ong's Hat is a story that I was looking into originally when we started the podcast.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,200
 It's only been like-- we're at episode 33.

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,800
 It seems like we've been doing this forever.

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
 But it's only been maybe three or four weeks.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,200
 But I looked into Ong's Hat, and I was like, yeah, I don't really know if that fits.

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,600
 We've kind of covered it with the Bellray Surge and Dublin, Wisconsin.

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,280
 I wanted to do an episode on ageless travel, though.

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,640
 That was always something that popped up.

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
 You always laugh.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,360
 What does ageless travel mean?

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
 You just think it's word soup.

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,080
 It's one of those things you think people threw it up on the conspiracy iceberg chart

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,640
 and was having a laugh.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,000
 But both Ong's Hat and ageless travel were on there.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
 And boy, boy are the interesting stories, and they're connected.

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,480
 So I want to get them both in the same episode here.

47
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,920
 Now Ong's Hat, just Ong's Hat story alone, now that I've looked into it more, is very

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
 interesting.

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,360
 So first off, we have to go, what is actually verifiable?

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,200
 So yes, there is a town called Ong's Hat.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,320
 Ong's Hat is an unincorporated little town in New Jersey that has just kind of, the

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,120
 people have just kind of moved out of it, moved out of the area.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,040
 It's mostly just rubble now.

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,320
 The buildings are pretty much rubble now.

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
 Basic small town.

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,120
 The story that I came across was that it was some sort of dimensional portal.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,880
 First off, I just heard that the town was abandoned.

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 But the conspiracy theory was that a portal was opened up and a bunch of people walked

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,120
 through it or disappeared.

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,000
 And I was like, I've already covered that with Dublin, Wisconsin.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,760
 I knew I was going to do Bell Ray Surge, so I kind of left Ong's Hat on the table.

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,640
 However, I've gotten some more information.

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,480
 So Ong's Hat supposedly is what happened was there was a group of scientists who believed

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
 in what's basically chaos science.

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,400
 They believed that we should embrace the chaos of the universe.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,840
 And if we do that, if we take it full to the metaphysical extreme and incorporate drugs

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:25,400
 into science and expanding the mind, we can find new ways of energy, new ways of using

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
 technology.

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,640
 All of these advancements can come from embracing the chaos instead of trying to find order

70
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
 in it.

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,880
 Now, they were these groups of scientists, obviously it was controversial.

72
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,200
 So this happened pretty much in, say, the 70s, the 80s around there.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,720
 They went to the small town of Ong's Hat.

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,680
 One of them had purchased a bunch of the land and basically was a commune for scientists

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
 to do whatever they needed to do.

76
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,160
 They could run wild with the technology, whatever they could think of, they could make.

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
 There was going to be no academic review board.

78
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
 There was going to be no government interference.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,120
 They were going to do what they wanted to in this fairly, I think at this point it was

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
 abandoned as well, town.

81
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,120
 So now this group of scientists basically has carte blanche in this small town of Ong's

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 Hat.

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,040
 What happens when a bunch of scientists who have all of the intelligence in the world

84
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,080
 and no restrictions, it generally doesn't end well.

85
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,760
 We've seen that in Nazi death camps or the Japanese death camps where they're running

86
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,160
 all those horrible experiments.

87
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,640
 If no one's there to tell them to stop, the scientists will just fulfill their curiosity.

88
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,600
 Well these scientists kept pushing and pushing and pushing the boundaries of reality, the

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 boundaries of science.

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,760
 And what they discovered was a device called the gate.

91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,640
 Now the gate was actually a series of other devices and these things would allow, they'd

92
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,880
 get into these machines and they could transport themselves to another dimension.

93
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,800
 Now not a dimension of sight and sound, but of mind.

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
 I'm going to copyright that, that's great.

95
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,480
 They'd go to these dimensions and the dimensions would either have two defining factors to

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
 them.

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,120
 One, they'd go to a dimension that was exactly like ours, but there was no humans.

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,440
 It was completely empty.

99
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 Who built the buildings?

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
 I don't know, but the buildings would be there.

101
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
 I think.

102
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,800
 Well it doesn't specifically say the buildings were there.

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
 It would make more sense if they traveled to Earth and there were no buildings there,

104
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,960
 but you know they're inter-dimensionally traveling so I think the rules are kind of out the window.

105
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,040
 They'd go to a planet, they'd go to a similar Earth without buildings, but there would definitely

106
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,240
 be no people there.

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,880
 The second dimensions they would go into is they'd go into dimensions with these amazing

108
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,080
 structures, these amazing fortresses and then ruins of fortresses with glyphs that nobody

109
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,480
 can understand and in these dimensions they were creatures, aliens, no one is the lemurs.

110
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,840
 They're called lemurs because they had big eyes.

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,960
 I know what you're thinking.

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,240
 Jason, aren't those called gray aliens?

113
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,240
 Well kind of, but these ones are different because apparently gray aliens have the big

114
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,040
 eyes, but they can only drink water and the water comes out of their skin.

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,280
 That's how they relieve themselves, which is kind of terrifying because if you think

116
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,120
 if you ever like surprise an alien and he starts to get slippery he's probably pissing

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,880
 all over you and their genitals are in the inside of their body and they don't exist.

118
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,720
 With lemurs they're actually more mammalian so that you can see their junk and they eat

119
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,480
 food and drink water like humans.

120
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,640
 But anyway so you could go to these dimensions full of these lemur creatures is what they

121
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
 call them.

122
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,240
 They're constantly traveling to these dimensions.

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,040
 They were scientists so they were going there, they were taking information and trying to

124
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,800
 communicate with the lemurs and trying to understand their glyphs.

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,760
 Then the government finally figured out what was going on there.

126
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,560
 So what would the government do?

127
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,920
 We've seen them do this with all sorts of inventions.

128
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,160
 They went in, they decimated the town.

129
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,000
 Now the theory, there's a couple theories there.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,640
 One, the government went in, took all their information and destroyed the population.

131
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,280
 Secondly is that by the time the government got there everyone had disappeared.

132
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,840
 They're in an alternate dimension in Ong's hut where there's no humans.

133
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
 They're the only ones there and who knows what type of scientific technology they're

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,120
 coming up with.

135
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,800
 Third one is that the government took the technology, took them and that's just it.

136
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,560
 Now they're working for the government maybe against their will, I don't know.

137
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,200
 So that's the story, that's the basic story of Ong's hut.

138
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,920
 I'm going to give you a ton of resources on this because there has been a lot written

139
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,040
 about Ong's hut.

140
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,760
 Some of it is historical and some of it talks about this group of chaos scientists that have

141
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,600
 basically broken reality.

142
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,880
 Now the way that they would travel has been lost to science.

143
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,240
 The way that they travel to these alternate realities, we can't replicate because whoever

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,880
 came up with the information, they're gone now.

145
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,640
 But do we need that technology to travel to those dimensions?

146
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,360
 You see what that technology was called was the egg.

147
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,520
 It was an egg-shaped ship that you would crawl into, hook all the electrodes up to your body,

148
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,400
 power it up, I'm ready to go chief.

149
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
 Five, four, I don't know if to count it down.

150
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,240
 I guess if you're going to alternate dimensions you probably don't need to count down because

151
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
 time doesn't matter.

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,600
 Anyways, it was called the egg.

153
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,920
 I backtracked this because first I was looking for Ong's hut thing and I dismissed it, but

154
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,000
 as I was looking for Ong's eggless travel I was looking for it for a while.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,520
 I've been looking for that probably about as long as I've been looking for sexual assault

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
 missiles.

157
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,400
 Again, if you know anything about sexual assault missiles please email me, deadrabberradi@gmail.com

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
 because I'm losing my mind over that one.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
 Eggless travel, I found this quote in a book.

160
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
 "The travel cults are quite real, let me assure you."

161
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,520
 A certain pagan group in Northern California has been working on things like eggless travel

162
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,160
 and dimensional doorways for some time.

163
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,560
 One such test of eggless travel, sort of like one of Michael G. Comey's invisible spaceships,

164
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,760
 occurred at a major Midwestern pagan gathering in 1988.

165
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,320
 That was the first lead I had found on even the term eggless travel.

166
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,640
 I typed in eggless travel, I've been looking all over for eggless travel.

167
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,880
 You know what kept popping up?

168
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,760
 Little tips for vegans.

169
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,360
 Is that a concern?

170
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,680
 Are vegans constantly afraid that when they're traveling there will be an egg next to them?

171
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,360
 That someone will sneak an egg into their bag?

172
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,640
 Type in eggless travel, you'll get a ton of vegan travel tips.

173
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,840
 I didn't know that there was like a constant war between the omnivores and the vegans,

174
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,160
 but apparently there is.

175
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,440
 And remember, if you see a vegan with tattoos, don't say anything, they might chop their arms

176
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
 off.

177
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,800
 Little tip from Jason Carpenter.

178
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,880
 So I found this and I was ecstatic.

179
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,960
 And I was like, yes, here we go.

180
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,840
 This is my first hint that somebody out there has some information about eggless travel and

181
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,920
 what eggless travel is.

182
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,480
 Then I had to backtrack it to the Ong's Hat Story and I found out their device they used

183
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
 to travel to other dimensions was the egg.

184
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
 I finally had something.

185
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,080
 Now here is the key.

186
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,400
 I had to look for those invisible spaceships in that guy's book.

187
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,440
 And I found the guy's book and read a little bit and I couldn't make so much sense of it.

188
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,160
 His book, it's called The Sack.

189
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,360
 Who wants to write in something called The Sack?

190
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
 Get in the sack, guys.

191
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,400
 Let's go on an adventure.

192
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
 That's gross.

193
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,760
 But it basically was an invisible ship, so you would fly around, but it would just look

194
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,120
 like you were sitting down like invisible, Wonder Woman's invisible jet.

195
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,640
 But it's called The Sack.

196
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,680
 So I was like, this is a dead end.

197
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
 Looked all over.

198
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,600
 I kept looking because I needed to find out more about eggless travel.

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,680
 I had been so curious about this since I first saw this phrase.

200
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,840
 And then I decided, maybe, maybe someone was at that pagan convention and witnessed pagan

201
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,080
 travel and I got something better.

202
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,160
 Here's a quote I found.

203
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,760
 At least they showed me theirs, which is more than I've ever gotten from the travel cults.

204
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,400
 Eggless has definitely been around since at least the mid-80s.

205
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:08,120
 I ran into it in 1988 at a pagan gathering, some sort of large, approximately 12-couple

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,680
 double yulking that opened the gateway into a higher dimensional space.

207
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,400
 I was in a high spin singlet state and accidentally got sucked up into the startup of the drive

208
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
 field they were building.

209
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,560
 The yulks merged, blah blah blah, everything merged.

210
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,160
 There was a wall of white at some sort of higher dim space open.

211
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,120
 Anyway, they went somewhere.

212
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,280
 I got yanked along, though I was bounced around and lost in the slipstream.

213
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,680
 I ended up briefly where some Philadelphia experiment folks must have went because I periodically

214
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,240
 have experienced similar phenomena on psychically, the overload damn near killed me.

215
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
 That's it.

216
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:53,920
 Eggless travel is the ability to travel from a dimension with no technology or to a dimension.

217
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,480
 Well from a dimension is relieving our spirit.

218
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,760
 It's the ability to travel, to leave our dimension into another dimension, lemur or not, without

219
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,160
 the egg, even though we don't have the science.

220
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,120
 Maybe what they did opened those gateways.

221
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,440
 Another source I have that says, "Eggless travel has become standard operating procedure

222
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,760
 for advanced travelers."

223
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,400
 There have even been permanent doorways that have been constructed that even work for people

224
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,520
 who aren't initiates into these cults, into these travel cults is what they're called.

225
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,240
 The groups of people who, Ong's hat scientists are gone, these people still are taking up

226
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,240
 the work in a more mystical, holistic way.

227
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,720
 Ong's hat, eggless travel, totally connected.

228
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,000
 Ong's hat is considered the first ARG.

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,720
 If you're not familiar with what an ARG is, it's an alternate reality game.

230
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,560
 It's basically a, it's like a proto myth.

231
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,600
 It's something that people get together to kind of add on and then other people can join

232
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
 this game and become part of the story.

233
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,160
 Sometimes they help shape the narrative.

234
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,080
 Sometimes they just have to unravel clues to find out the next step to it.

235
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,360
 So you'll see ARGs, a lot of times are used for marketing purposes.

236
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,120
 A new movie comes out and there'll be some cryptic numbers on the web.

237
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,640
 And a good example of it was Cloverfield.

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,000
 Cloverfield had a lot of ARGs with a slush-o, I think was their drink.

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,320
 You could follow the links because at first nobody knew what Cloverfield was and you could

240
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,520
 follow these clues and you'd have to figure it out.

241
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,800
 And usually like the whole Reddit community will come together and try to figure out like

242
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,120
 these clues to, you know, oh, what's under the ocean?

243
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,560
 Oh, slush-o owns an oil rig and they were drilling.

244
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
 Oh, what were they drilling for?

245
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
 Oh, and then the rig got shut down.

246
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,000
 Maybe this is some sort of monster movie.

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,640
 So a lot of times it's used to drum up support.

248
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,120
 Ong's hat, the story of Ong's hat is considered the first ARG.

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,120
 It was created on a bulletin board.

250
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,640
 It's a community created myth.

251
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,160
 And what's interesting about it?

252
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,040
 There's two interesting things about it.

253
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,120
 Well, three, there's a ton of interesting things about it.

254
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:06,640
 But one, it perfectly weaves true events, true groups, I guess I should say, true locations

255
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:16,920
 and groups along with well-known conspiracies tying into the Ong's hat myth.

256
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,440
 Ong's hat is a real town.

257
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
 It really is abandoned.

258
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:29,000
 They refer to real groups like the Church of the Subgenius, which was a crazy like,

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,520
 I don't want to say anti-religion, but I mean, it was again came out of the 80s.

260
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,440
 I used to have a ball reading about it because it was just, I forgot what the guy's name

261
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
 was, Joe Bob or something.

262
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,760
 But Church of the Subgenius was just like this really weird religion that kind of made

263
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,280
 fun of organized religions.

264
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,240
 Think of the precursor to the flying spaghetti monster, but a little more advanced.

265
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
 You'd have links to real groups and real locations.

266
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,600
 And then it would talk about print, they'd talk about like UFO sightings and then cite

267
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,960
 like actual recorded UFO sightings.

268
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,720
 And then in the middle of it, it would start talking about this series of chaos scientists.

269
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,920
 When I was reading this was interesting because one of the articles I read said the interesting

270
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,440
 thing about, I know I keep saying interesting, but let me come up with another word.

271
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,640
 The fascinating thing about this story, Ong's Hat story, is that if you come from a conspiracy

272
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:27,320
 website to the story of Ong's Hat, you will believe that it's an actual conspiracy.

273
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,720
 If you come from a website that talks about ARGs and they list it as the first ARG and

274
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,680
 they're talking about it, you will believe it's an ARG.

275
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,160
 Where you first find out about it from is will determine how you feel about it.

276
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,240
 Now there's one of the guys who started it, Joseph Methany.

277
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,880
 He wrote a book called Ong's Hat in the beginning and it tells the story in detail about the

278
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,560
 scientists and going there and their experiments and everything.

279
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,280
 It's basically a novel, but he won't say whether or not it's real or not.

280
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,200
 He says, well, some people think it's real and some people think it's false and maybe

281
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,880
 it's a little real and maybe it's a little false.

282
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,720
 He's very coy about it.

283
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
 So that just feeds the flame.

284
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,560
 People who believe in the conspiracy theory believe, oh no, no, no, this is real and the

285
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,520
 only way he could tell this story without the government killing him is to position

286
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
 it as a novel.

287
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,040
 And then other people who don't believe it's real go, no, no, it's just a novel and he's

288
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
 really coy on it, which again, that's a marketing technique.

289
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,960
 If he came out and said, no, it's just a novel, I wrote, it kind of ruins the mystique.

290
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,000
 This is how legends are born.

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,440
 This is how myths are created.

292
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,520
 A little bit of real, a little bit of false.

293
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,400
 It's gotten to the point where these resources, the book, a lot of the books and the stuff

294
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,200
 I'm sourcing was very hard to find.

295
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,200
 The main book, talk, his book is available online, but again, that is, it is basically

296
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,320
 written as fact.

297
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,000
 He just says, well, maybe it's true, maybe it's not.

298
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,160
 It's written as that it is real.

299
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,720
 It's not listed as a novel in so much.

300
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,600
 The main book that really goes into this theory and talks about how online myths are created

301
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,080
 and how it was called legend tripping is the name of the book and I'll put a link in it

302
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,840
 in the description, but it talks about how these stories by taking real life myths, real

303
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,040
 life legends that everyone knows about and weaving them into this complex story, you

304
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,360
 can create a, you can create a more grounded myth and say the most ridiculous stuff, but

305
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
 people go, well, I don't bigfoot.

306
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,600
 And I know UFOs and I don't know about Ong's hat, but maybe you give it legitimacy within

307
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,080
 the conspiracy corner by having the people in Ong's hat talk about those issues and

308
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,320
 talk about real life people who exist.

309
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,760
 That book is out of print.

310
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,600
 It's like 55 to $100.

311
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,880
 So as that book fades farther and farther out of the consciousness and gets harder and

312
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,800
 harder to find, the only things that we're going to find are the sources that position

313
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,880
 it as a real conspiracy theory.

314
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,480
 There was maybe two websites that said no, this was fake and one website that was kind

315
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,800
 of on the fence about it.

316
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,160
 Again, that's interesting.

317
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,120
 The way that they structured it.

318
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,560
 Now to Aiglis travel, if Ong's hat is fake, then Aiglis travel is also fake.

319
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,720
 So Ong's hat was just a narrative.

320
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,360
 It was just a story.

321
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,720
 It was just an ARG.

322
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,240
 So where does that leave us with Aiglis travel?

323
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 If the initial source of it was an ARG, let's assume that it was an ARG and it wasn't a

324
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,540
 way to get around government censorship because that's kind of where most of the evidence

325
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
 lies.

326
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,960
 Where does that leave us with Aiglis travel?

327
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
 Well, unfortunately, Aiglis travel falls into that same route.

328
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,680
 I think it's simply part of the myth being carried on.

329
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,520
 It's a fascinating story and it's one of the stories that I'm really glad I researched.

330
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,240
 Like as you're researching these type of stories, every time you find a piece of information

331
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,100
 that kind of unlocks the puzzle, you get that little endorphin rush.

332
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,440
 Because you realize that I've seen people ask about this for months and months and

333
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
 months.

334
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
 What's Aiglis travel?

335
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
 What's Aiglis travel?

336
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,440
 And when you're able to go in and you find that, find those phrases and it starts to

337
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,240
 make sense, you're just ready to go.

338
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
 You feel great.

339
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,200
 That's one of the things that I love about researching.

340
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,360
 And what is even a weirder coincidence?

341
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
 What is it?

342
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,860
 Yeah, I mean, it's, it was one of those things.

343
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,840
 This was kind of the last bit of research I did.

344
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,240
 So I looked into Aiglis travel, backtracked it to Ong's hat, researched that, came back

345
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
 to Aiglis travel.

346
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:44,640
 And the very end of my research to wrap everything up, it turns out that there was a kid show,

347
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,960
 or you know, like a young adult, you know, like, I don't know, 13 year old kid show called

348
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,520
 Gallador about a young boy who travels to the outer dimension to save the people there.

349
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,720
 And in it, he uses an egg.

350
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
 It's called the egg.

351
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,700
 It's this obviously egg shaped device, not the sack, which would have been, hey, 13 year

352
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,300
 old boy, climb in my sack.

353
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,580
 Hurry up, they're shooting the sack.

354
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,780
 It's going to leak.

355
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,060
 It's called the egg.

356
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,940
 And it's taken from this ARG, the story, this egg allows him to go to these other dimensions.

357
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,460
 That was interesting enough.

358
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:27,300
 But then, to surround it all the way back, the first time I saw the iceberg was on 4chan,

359
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,480
 which I go for a lot of my paranormal news.

360
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,120
 Actually also go to the fitness board a lot too.

361
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,640
 They have a lot of great exercise tips, but actually got to the fitness board because

362
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,960
 I was trying to get to the paranormal board and accidentally clicked on fitness.

363
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,160
 And that happened so many times, I just, I'm just going to look at the fitness board.

364
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,840
 And I've talked about my weight loss.

365
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,600
 I've lost 75 pounds in the past year.

366
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,360
 And a huge part of that is thanks to fit.

367
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,480
 So thanks fit.

368
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,420
 But anyways, found it on 4chan.

369
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,780
 Found out about Gallador.

370
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:06,540
 The main bad guy in Gallador comes from a planet full of evil, like an evil empire planet,

371
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,120
 called Keck, K-E-K.

372
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:18,900
 Keck is the name of the ancient Egyptian deity that members of 4chan worship and worship

373
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,600
 its current avatar, Pepe the Frog.

374
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,200
 Does it mean anything?

375
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
 No.

376
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,680
 But I thought it was just, again, it was one of those interesting endorphin rush moments.

377
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,960
 You know, what are the chances?

378
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
 What are the chances out of all the words?

379
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,800
 But you know, again, I just thought it was an interesting moment for me to find that

380
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,280
 connection there.

381
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
 So it's just weird how the universe works.

382
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,280
 It's weird how these stories all kind of came together in a per, I found this on 4chan

383
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,100
 and the last piece of evidence for me to find was that kids show with planet Keck, where

384
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,740
 all the evil, evil comes from.

385
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,740
 Fascinating.

386
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,340
 I like the little, a nice little bow tie on my egg.

387
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
 I actually hate eggs.

388
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,900
 I've never eaten an egg in my life.

389
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,140
 I might have had eggs when I was a kid, but I don't like them.

390
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,580
 Oh, I don't know if I don't like them.

391
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,100
 I've never eaten them, but they look disgusting.

392
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,780
 And I heard sometimes you crack them open and a baby chicken comes out.

393
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,760
 Not in a form, but like when you go to crack one to make eggs like to put them in a pan

394
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,960
 or whatever, you'll crack it and there'll be a dead baby chicken.

395
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,680
 And people tell me that's impossible, but if there's one thing I've learned, nothing's

396
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,280
 impossible.
