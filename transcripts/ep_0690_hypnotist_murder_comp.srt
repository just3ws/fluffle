1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 When a young boy starts having horrible stomach pains, he thinks he's just sick.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,760
 Instead, he laid an egg. An egg came out of his butt.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,360
 Then we travel back to the year 1909 to meet a young hypnotist putting on an amazing performance.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,560
 Everything is going perfectly until the finale begins. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:38,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,280
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
 having a ton of fun out there. First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,360
 patreons coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. Give it up for Andrew Light.

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,040
 Everyone give him a round of applause. He's coming in a pure beam of energy.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,640
 Andrew, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,120
 patreon, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show. Tell your friends,

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,400
 tell your family, talk about it online. That is how you can also help Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,960
 Andrew, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars for the Dead Rabbit Robo. We are leaving

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,520
 behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're going to take a nice little relaxing rowing trip. It's very,

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,920
 very far. I hope you have been working your upper body. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:29,120
 We're headed out to Gawa, Indonesia. Splash. Splash. I was recommended this story by Sheen

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,200
 Anagins on Twitter. So thank you very much for sending me this absolutely, absolutely disgusting

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,840
 story. A lot of times I say, don't eat while you're listening to this podcast. Actually,

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,920
 I don't say it enough. I don't say it enough. I should warn you guys more often. This episode,

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,960
 do not eat. Do not eat. I don't care how much food you've just prepared to sit down and listen

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,560
 to an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. Don't. Don't do it. If you're a condemned prisoner and this

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
 is your last meal, if you're sitting there and you're about to be taken to the gallows

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,000
 and somehow you're listening to this podcast, skip the meal. But thanks, Sheen Anagins, for

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,560
 sending this story over. We're in Gawa, Indonesia. It's February 2018. There's a young boy named

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,360
 Aukmal walking through town. I wish I was someone who'd driven me. Why am I walking like this?

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,960
 Aukmal gets to the hospital and the doctors are like, "Oh, not this character again. Not Aukmal."

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,920
 He walks in. He goes into his normal room. He's like, "I know. Room 6. Room 6." He hops up on

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,400
 the little gurney. The doctors are like, "Listen, we have a Hippocratic oath. We do have to take

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,960
 care of you even though you're sick, but we don't really believe you. We don't really believe what's

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,760
 going on is happening." And it's not like this guy's making up symptoms. It's not like he has,

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,960
 what is it, Munchausen syndrome. It's not like this little 14-year-old boy is pretending his

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,840
 stomach hurts. His stomach really hurts. The doctors are fully aware that his stomach hurts.

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,320
 The doctors know why his stomach hurts. They just don't understand how it hurts. This is completely

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,520
 shocking the doctors and they've seen it before with this young man. As he's laying there on the

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:30,400
 little gurney, a little egg pops out of his butthole and rolls across the gurney. The doctors are like,

36
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:39,040
 "Ockmole, that is impossible. What we just saw is impossible. Humans cannot lay eggs."

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,160
 Now, Shananigan sent me this story. I go, "This is so gross. I don't really like eggs that much to

38
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,760
 begin with. And here's a human laying an egg. How do I know the eggs again from the store are actually

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,800
 from chickens?" And I was telling my friend Sabine about the story and she goes, "That's impossible.

40
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:04,480
 Humans can't lay eggs." I look at her and I go, "Yes, in normal world, but in dead rabbit radio

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,600
 world, it is possible." I just can't cover this story and go, "That's impossible. That's not fun."

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,800
 And there's video footage of this. Sabine did not want to watch the video footage. And this is

43
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,920
 where the story really gets interesting because there's two layers to this. One is a human laying

44
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:29,200
 eggs. That's interesting enough, but we know that's impossible. But doctors are saying this is

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,280
 happening. There's photographs. There's video footage. So the other interesting part is the

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:41,360
 investigative side. Here's what we know. This kid, he'd been doing this since 2016. Between 2016

47
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:52,160
 and 2018, he has laid 20 eggs. Sometimes he would lay more than one in a day. Eggs coming out of his

48
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,960
 butt. The family's like, "It's delicious. Hey, Aukmaa. How's your stomach doing?" He's like,

49
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,080
 "Aww, they're like perfect." Eggs for breakfast. They're taking these eggs and they're cracking

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,280
 them open. And oddly enough, the eggs are either all yolk or all white. The doctors go, "This is

51
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,960
 impossible. A human can't lay eggs." But when they take an x-ray of him, there's eggs in him. There's

52
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,760
 some of their eggs in his body, just one at a time. But there is an egg up there in the x-ray.

53
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,880
 And the doctors are thinking, "Aukmaa is either swallowing eggs whole," which is a feat. That's

54
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,240
 bizarre enough, right? He's either swallowing eggs whole. They're working their way down his

55
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,560
 digestive tract. Or, more likely, he's stuffing them up his butthole. And they hurt. Your butthole

56
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,800
 is not supposed to hold a chicken egg or really any egg, an ostrich egg. And he's pooping them out.

57
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,280
 But they can't prove it. They have a 14-year-old boy come in and complain of stomach cramps,

58
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,600
 and his family say, "No, he's not sticking them up his butt. He's laying eggs." The doctors are like,

59
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,720
 "That is impossible." And this is where we get to the video. Videos. This is really interesting.

60
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,160
 Daily Mail. It's almost like lost media, because there is a full video out there somewhere of

61
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,600
 Aukmaa laying an egg. But really what it is, it's a 14-year-old boy having an egg come out of his

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,240
 butthole. So that video is not-- I don't think that video is legal. I'm sure the doctors-- I'm

63
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,840
 sure the doctors didn't even want to see it. They're like, "Ugh." There is a blurred screenshot

64
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,480
 on the Daily Mail. There's a screenshot of it, and you see the egg coming out, but it's super

65
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,000
 blurry, and you really don't want to see what the blur is anyways. And there is a portion of the video.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,880
 They show Aukmaa laying in this hospital bed, like this hospital rolling gurney thing. And he's

67
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,880
 obviously in pain. He's groaning. Oh, he's clocking. He's pulling feathers out. He's obviously in pain.

68
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,960
 And then they cut to the egg on the gurney, and he's just kind of like slumped around. He's like,

69
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,360
 "Ugh, finally." And for whatever embarrassing reason-- I don't know if the staff of hospitals in

70
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,760
 Indonesia are 13-year-old girls, or they just let a bunch of 13-year-old girls in, but I swear,

71
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,760
 like, the video ends with Aukmaa laying an egg. There's a bunch of really, really young girls

72
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,720
 taking photos of the egg with their cell phones. How'd they get in there? That would be so embarrassing.

73
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,120
 It's being embarrassing enough to lay an egg in front of your family. And then that would just

74
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,120
 be weird. But then laying an egg in front of a doctor, at least maybe he can help you. But just

75
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,680
 imagine a bunch of random girls walked in, and they're like, "Oh, this'll be on my TikTok." Sorry,

76
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,400
 Aukmaa, but that appears to have happened. He's all passed out. He doesn't even know until he's trending.

77
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,320
 If you go to the Daily Store, they have a longer version of the video, but they don't actually

78
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,240
 show the egg coming out of the butthole. And that's fine. I mean, as far as I wanted to, research

79
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,960
 on this, I'm totally fine in not actually seeing that. But the whole video is out there somewhere,

80
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,560
 because the Daily Mail had a screenshot of the egg coming out of the butthole.

81
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,000
 And the doctors are saying that it's impossible for humans to lay eggs. And when you go to the

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,760
 debunking websites for this, that's their answer. Humans can't lay eggs. It's impossible. But that

83
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,360
 is- UFOs are impossible. Bigfoot being undiscovered for as long as impossible. Like, you could just-

84
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,840
 that's not really skepticism by just going, "That's impossible." I mean, that's like lazy skepticism.

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,480
 So I needed an answer to this. We all know this is impossible, but we covered the impossible on this

86
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:47,280
 show. Is this boy actually laying eggs? As time has progressed in the story of Aukmaa, and they're

87
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,400
 able to- I don't know why they didn't- I do not know why they didn't test this on day one, but around

88
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:02,160
 2018, 20 eggs later, they do test the eggs. They're chicken eggs. And now the skeptic community goes,

89
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,440
 "A human cannot lay chicken eggs." Well, that's no different than what you're saying before.

90
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,160
 We know a human can't lay chicken eggs, but here is a man, a boy, laying a chicken egg. Explain that

91
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,760
 science. You saw the x-ray. Scientists leave in the room. I'm still yelling at him. You saw the x-rays.

92
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,800
 How does the egg not break in his butthole? They don't explain it. All of- like, it was so hard.

93
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,840
 I was- I go, "There has to be a rational explanation for this." That's- gives us more information.

94
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,480
 Yes, it is an impossible for a human to lay a chicken egg. Yes, but he's doing it.

95
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,360
 And there was just a lot of articles written around February 2018 when the story made it

96
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,320
 mainstream. And then a couple websites tried debunking it, and then there was nothing.

97
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,160
 And that's usually how we see these stories go. Like, some event will happen, everyone will cover

98
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,720
 it, and then no one will ever give you a follow-up. We've run into that a lot on this show, and I

99
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,680
 really have to dig through stuff. And whenever you try search terms, it brings you back to this

100
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,880
 flurry of articles in February 2018, because that's when it was mostly talked about. You have to change

101
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,280
 your Google search terms for anything after February 2018. And I found something. I found

102
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,440
 something. If you look for the story of Aukmal, you will find everything I talked to about. But

103
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,800
 if you change your search filters for anything after that big mainstream news flurry of articles,

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,840
 you'll find an article written in April 2018 called "Hatching Hoaxes" by Kenneth Young

105
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:44,400
 for the Indonesian expat. Kenneth verified the video. I don't- I don't know if he watched

106
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,680
 him himself, but Kenneth said yes. There are videos that exist of a boy pooping out eggs, but

107
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,280
 he was stuffing them up his own butthole. Without a doubt, he was stuffing them up his own butthole.

108
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,080
 And it had nothing to do with the fact that boys can't lay eggs, or girls can't lay eggs, or any

109
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,720
 human can't lay a chicken egg. It had to do with the fact that eventually the Child Protection Unit

110
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,120
 of Gawa, the Child Protection Unit of Gawa began investigating this, and they discovered this boy

111
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,640
 was suffering from emotional disturbances and was sticking eggs up his own butt. So they took him,

112
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,640
 they're treating him for psychiatric problems. Everything is normal in the world, and we wish

113
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,480
 the best for Aukmal. And that's the end of the egg story, right? Humans can't lay eggs, right?

114
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:43,040
 Well, as I was researching this story, the one thing that got the Doctor Show flummox is humans

115
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:52,800
 can lay egg-like objects. This is 100% true. I do not recommend looking this up. I do not recommend

116
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:01,200
 looking at photos of this. There is a thing called peritoneal loose bodies. It's a piece of fat from

117
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,840
 your abdominal cavity. It kind of breaks loose. Have you ever heard of diverticulitis?

118
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,080
 You're like, "I've heard of it, Jason. I've never heard of it pronounced like that before."

119
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,800
 It's where your intestines get inflamed, like a little seed gets stuck somewhere and it gets

120
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,080
 inflamed and it's super painful. This is something similar to that, but a piece of your

121
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,320
 abdominal cavity breaks off. I know I didn't pronounce it right, but we're just gonna keep

122
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,160
 going with it. The snowman, the yeti, is in your stomach. It breaks off of your... this little

123
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,200
 piece of fatty tissue breaks off of the wall and your body starts floating around. It begins to calcify.

124
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:45,920
 It's just this piece of fat that begins to grab onto things passing by. It's like, "Oh, that looks

125
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:56,000
 delicious. Little piece of a baguette." And it calcifies and it gets thick and hard and large.

126
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,400
 Now, usually, it's very small and you poop it out and you have no idea it's in there. But...

127
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,880
 But sometimes these things... so disgusting. Sometimes just flashing back to these pictures

128
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:21,760
 I saw. Sometimes these things will grow bigger than a chicken egg, but it looks exactly like a

129
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,960
 chicken egg. 100%. There's photos of them reaching into... they had to do surgery to get one out of

130
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:36,800
 this guy. There's photo of them reaching into his guts. And there's just an egg, a perfectly white,

131
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:44,320
 clean egg sitting in this dude's intestines. This one doctor was shocked. He had his old man come in.

132
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,560
 He was complaining of this horrible stomach pain. They couldn't figure it out. He hadn't pooped in

133
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,400
 four days. They're trying to flesh him out. He's like, "This isn't helping. This isn't helping."

134
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,520
 So they had to go in. This is like an emergency thing. They go in and the doctor goes, "Is that an...

135
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,400
 See that? Is that an egg in this dude?" And they pulled it out. It was like five inches around. It was

136
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:12,720
 this massive, twice the size of a chicken egg, but it was white and that oval egg shaped. Then they

137
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:23,360
 cut it open. And because it's a piece of fat and has all this calcium, all these calcium deposits

138
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,480
 around it, when they slice it in half, in the middle of it is this squishy... I don't know if it's

139
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:39,680
 squishy. It looks squishy. I didn't touch the picture. It was this squishy looking grayish, yellow circle.

140
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:49,840
 And the rest of the egg shape was a hard white substance. It looked just like a hard boiled egg.

141
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:58,480
 Exactly, exactly like a hard boiled egg. First off, can you imagine what that smelled like?

142
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,040
 You're like, "Jason, Jason, why'd you even say that? I didn't think about that."

143
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,280
 Can you imagine what it smelled like when they cut it in half too?

144
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:14,880
 Humans can lay egg-like items. So we're going all the way back around. All those articles just saying

145
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,200
 they can't lay eggs. They can't lay eggs. They can't lay eggs. And yes, they can't lay an egg. A human

146
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,880
 can't lay an egg and it can't lay a chicken egg. But there is a chance that tonight you will be

147
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,680
 sitting there and you're like, "Oh man, what a delicious meal. And as you're batting your tummy,

148
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,960
 because that's what I do after eating a meal. I rub my tummy. A little piece of fat breaks loose

149
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,920
 from your abdominal wall. It's floating around. You've had it a little too hard. And then pretty

150
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,720
 soon, "Oh my stomach. You're Jason. Why are you making your listeners go through pain for science?

151
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
 And then time will go on and you'll swear there's an egg inside of you and you're telling your

152
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,000
 doctors, "I think there's an egg in me." And they'll be like, "That's impossible. That is impossible."

153
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,640
 And then you look at the camera and you wink, "Ding!" Because you know the truth. You know the truth.

154
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,200
 I don't know why you want to just tell them you had one of these peritoneal loose bodies.

155
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,360
 You're like, "Yeah, yeah, I know what it is. I don't know why I'm winking at a non-existent

156
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,520
 camera." This could happen to you, dude. You're not going to stick eggs up in your butt. We know

157
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:25,040
 that is not going to happen. But you could lay an egg-shaped object soon. I mean, it doesn't happen

158
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,600
 overnight. It takes a while. I can't say it'll happen tonight. See, don't believe them when they

159
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,120
 just say that's impossible. It was. It technically wasn't possible. They didn't... It wasn't an egg.

160
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,000
 But I just kept digging and because I kept digging, I was able to share the fact with you

161
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,040
 that someday you may lay a giant egg-shaped object.

162
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,080
 Andrew Light, I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys of the carbonicopter. We're leaving behind

163
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,440
 Jakarta. We're waving goodbye. I really hope Aakmal is doing better. We are headed out to

164
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,480
 Somerville, New Jersey. You know what's funny? Both of these stories are really about the

165
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,200
 discovery of things. I didn't know humans could lay egg-shaped things. I never imagined what they

166
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,720
 could smell like if they did. But now I do. Now I know those things. This is the same thing. Whenever

167
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:25,200
 I thought about hypnotism, I thought it was a parlor trick at best. And I don't want to say a scam,

168
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:32,000
 but a joke at worst. It may be a scam because you know you'd see those commercials or there's

169
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,320
 ads and magazines about hypnotize me to stop smoking or to stop eating, stop eating so many eggs,

170
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,480
 stop eating so many of those eggs that your children are laying for you in that human farm out

171
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,880
 back. And I always thought, you know, maybe there's something behind it. But I don't know. I remember

172
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,760
 when I was a kid, we were at the county fair, the state fair, there was a hypnotist on stage.

173
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,160
 And he was asking for volunteers. And I remember thinking, "I'm going to do that. I'm going to do

174
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,560
 that." And my dad, I don't know how old I was. I probably was about, I don't know, nine or six

175
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,640
 or 12 or 24. I don't remember. But I remember thinking, I remember saying, my dad's not a telepath

176
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,200
 to say this out loud, I want to volunteer. My dad put his hand on my shoulder and he says,

177
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:23,120
 "Never volunteer for a hypnotist." Very, very, very weird parental advice, right? Very specific.

178
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
 And here's why. He goes, "Never, ever volunteer for a hypnotist because you don't know what they're

179
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,320
 going to have you do on stage." They may embarrass you, Jason. I never thought about that. I never

180
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,840
 thought about that because apparently I was nine or six or 12 or 24 and I'd never seen a hypnotist

181
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,880
 before. This was the first time I'd ever run into a hypnotist. Because if you believe in hypnotism,

182
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
 you could go up there and he goes, "Act like a gorilla." And that's kind of funny because that's

183
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,440
 a mighty beast. You're banging on your chest. You're stealing bananas. You grab a hot blonde

184
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,000
 and climb up the whirley wheel. He could say, "Be a donkey." That's not a fun, impressive creature.

185
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,040
 And then come out being hypnotized. You're in the middle of Mexico. You've been carrying

186
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,520
 pails of water for some dude for the past three months. But I always thought it was a parlor

187
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,080
 trick. I thought a lot of it was persuasion, persuading people. Plus, I've heard this before,

188
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,760
 too, when you go up to get hypnotized on stage. They're like, "You're sleepy. You're sleepy."

189
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,840
 And then you pretend you're asleep and he goes, "Be a duck. You don't want to ruin the guy's show."

190
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,800
 You just go along with it and be the duck. I've heard that before as well. I always thought

191
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:37,280
 hypnotism was either quack science or just a joke or an act. But I did a bunch of research on

192
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,560
 hypnotism and it's so funny. When I started researching this story, I thought, "I'm not going

193
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,080
 to do a huge overview on hypnotism. Everyone knows what it is." But as I kept researching,

194
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,600
 I thought, "I don't really even know what hypnotism is." Hypnotism? So I'm going to do this overview.

195
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:01,680
 I'm going to do this overview. Hypnotism is thousands of years old. But that's like self-hypnotism.

196
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:09,600
 That's meditation becoming one with the universe, eliminating all thought. Thousands of years old.

197
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
 But the way we think of hypnotism with going, "You are getting sleepy. I'm going to give you

198
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,880
 commands you're going to do." That is super recent. Late 1800s. That is very, very recent in human

199
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,320
 history. And it used to be called mesmerism because it was named after Franz Mesmer. He was the guy

200
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,040
 who believed this thing called animal magnetism that you could affect people simply by your presence.

201
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,080
 He was kind of the forefather of hypnotism and that's why they originally called it mesmerism.

202
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,720
 And that is a term that's used interchangeably. So hypnotism, two people sitting across from

203
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,440
 each other and one going into the other person's thoughts and controlling them, super recent.

204
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,920
 And this is what makes me think it's not a quack science. And a quack science would basically

205
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 be like a healing crystal. Your knee hurts. I'm going to put this crystal on your knee.

206
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,320
 Your knee doesn't hurt anymore. The crystal did it. And you don't think of the fact that you

207
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,120
 weren't trying to balance a crystal on your knee. So you kept it elevated for a long period of time.

208
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,000
 You weren't putting weight on it. That's probably why your knee is better. That's quack science.

209
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,080
 It doesn't really work. This stuff works apparently, like based on this research,

210
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,240
 works so well. It's very, very dangerous. Extremely dangerous hypnotized people.

211
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,080
 June 22nd, 1903 in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, there was an amateur hypnotist. And this is very,

212
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,080
 we're going to see a thread here through these stories. John Hilde, an amateur hypnotist,

213
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,840
 is at a local bar. He sees a pretty girl named Jenny B. Berninsky. It's a parlor trick. He's

214
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,520
 just trying to get the attention of a pretty girl. Hey, how would you like to be hypnotized?

215
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,520
 She says, yeah, sure. And he puts her under. He does his little hypnosis thing and actually puts

216
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:57,840
 her into a state of unconsciousness. But he can't bring her back out of it. She's stuck like that.

217
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,080
 Until 2pm the next day. That happened on June 22nd, 1903. This article in the Clinton County Times

218
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,040
 newspaper was published on June 26th, four days later. And in that article, it said she was still

219
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,360
 in critical condition. And there was no follow-up to that. There was no Google search I could find

220
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,160
 after that. She was catatonic for hours and hours and hours on end. And when they brought her out,

221
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,960
 she was still in critical condition four days later. There's a website called the Brookside

222
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,320
 Center for Counseling and Hypnotherapy. They say it's very, very important if you are going to do

223
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,680
 hypnotism. I never even thought about this before. I just thought it was some goofy thing. Never,

224
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:47,280
 ever use hypnotism to treat people for something that you don't know how to treat without hypnotism.

225
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,320
 There's a thing called dental hypnosis, where the dentist will hypnotize you to help you remain

226
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,960
 calm during the procedure. They'll still give you all the pain medication. They'll still do the

227
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,800
 novocaine. But some people have tremendous anxiety with going to the dentist and some dentists use

228
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:11,760
 dental hypnosis. And at the Brookside Center for Counseling and Hypnotherapy, they tell this story.

229
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,920
 There was a dentist who did this and it was very, very successful. And his patient goes,

230
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
 "You know what? I used to have such horrible issues with going to the dentist, but now I don't

231
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,160
 and thank you for your hypnotherapy. Could you use your hypnotherapy to help me stop smoking?"

232
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:33,280
 He says, "Yeah, sure. Totally." So he does. He uses the same hypnotherapy techniques to get

233
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:41,200
 this woman to stop smoking. And she does stop smoking. But she's hit with crippling anxiety,

234
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,400
 crippling depression. She can't go through the day without being overloaded by obsessive thoughts.

235
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:56,560
 Eventually, she can't even complete normal everyday tasks. Never ever use hypnosis for something that

236
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:03,840
 you can't treat without hypnosis. He doesn't know how to get someone to stop smoking. But he did it

237
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,560
 anyways and he messed with her mind. It's fascinating because you're basically fiddling around with the

238
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,920
 brain is what you're doing. And this makes me think it's real because if it was a hoax,

239
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,600
 then there would be really no downside to it. You also, it's interesting, you have to be careful

240
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,680
 what you say. This is bordering on like a wishmaster curse. According to the journal Clinical Hypnosis,

241
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,280
 Principles and Applications, there's a story about a burn patient who was having difficulty

242
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,760
 eating. They don't want to eat anymore. So they hypnotized them and put them under and said,

243
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,880
 "It's okay. You can eat. Eat everything on your plate. You'll be fine. It's okay."

244
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:50,800
 Well, one day this burn patient was eating and got sick and began to vomit, began to throw up

245
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,040
 all the food they just eaten and the vomit was hitting the plate. And after they were done vomiting,

246
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,120
 someone walked into the room and this burn patient was eating the vomit, not even thinking about it.

247
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,680
 Clean your plate. Eat everything on your plate. It's rewiring of the human brain.

248
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:16,640
 It's easy to mess stuff up with. But all of those stories really pale in comparison to where we're

249
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,680
 going now. Andrew, land this carbonar copter in Summerville, New Jersey. It's November 8th,

250
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,040
 1909. We're the Summerville Opera House. So hope you guys brought your tuxes. Hope you guys are

251
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,840
 always dressed in your finest clothing before you listen to this podcast. There's a travel

252
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,000
 lean magician/hypnotist, obviously. Otherwise, I would have done a whole overview on magic,

253
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,040
 named Professor Arthur Everton. And he's on stage and he's like, "Do I have a volunteer?

254
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,680
 Who wants to be part of my hypnotist show and my old time dad is holding old timey Jason?"

255
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,400
 And he's like, "Let's leave now." People get nervous during hypnotist shows. People don't

256
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,760
 always want to go up on stage. So there's a term for an assistant. They're called a horse

257
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,800
 because they lead the audience on. It's very, very common for hypnotists to have this. When

258
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,320
 you're calling for an audience member to sit up on stage, what if nobody does?

259
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,680
 That's kind of a bum wreck to your hypnotist. There's not anything else you can do. So hypnotists

260
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,240
 have these people called horses. And Arthur Everton's horse is his good buddy, Robert Simpson,

261
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,440
 a 35 year old man. They both used to be piano movers. That was his job before he broke into the

262
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,840
 hypnotist game. He was just a hard working dude, Arthur. And that's where he met Robert. He goes,

263
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,280
 "Hey, I'm doing this hypnotist thing. Would you like to join me on tour?" And Robert's like,

264
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,560
 "No, I don't think so." And then he gets hypnotized. The next thing he knows,

265
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,920
 he's in like a showgirl outfit. He's like, "Oh, how did I get here?"

266
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,960
 Robert Simpson is the horse. So he'll jump up. He'll get on stage. They do the thing. And then

267
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,440
 other people go, "Oh, that looks fun. Betty, you go up there." And other people start doing it.

268
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,120
 The hardest time to get people on stage is the beginning and the end. Because stuff gets more

269
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,520
 and more ludicrous as the show goes on. So someone goes up, you realize it's not that bad.

270
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,960
 A bunch of normal people go up. And then to finalize the show, you have someone else go up

271
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,760
 if no one else volunteers. Now, in this particular situation, Robert Simpson was the final horse.

272
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,800
 Because no one else was volunteering. Robert Simpson, it was his job to volunteer at last.

273
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:27,120
 Oh, shucks. I guess I'll do it. He goes up on stage. When I'm saying these people are the horses,

274
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,400
 they're accomplices is what they are. They are truly being hypnotized. They're not faking it.

275
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,240
 They are truly being put under. It's just, I don't want to make it think that it's some scam.

276
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,120
 They are actually hypnotizing them. But they're just, they know the process. They know the guy

277
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,840
 they're totally comfortable with that they're fine with walking around pretending they're a

278
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,000
 chicken, stuff like that. Or really thinking they're a chicken because they're actually hypnotized.

279
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,560
 Arthur has other assistants. It's this full show. I mean, I say he's an amateur hypnotist.

280
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,200
 I mean, he has a production company. He is on tour. So he has assistants,

281
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,680
 and they're bringing out these two chairs and they send them about six feet apart.

282
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,200
 He brings Robert up and he starts doing his pitch and he goes, I'm going to hypnotize you,

283
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,640
 Robert, and you're going to become stiff as a board. That's pretty easy, right? Some guys

284
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,880
 probably like, oh man, I should have volunteered for that. That sounds easy. And so he hypnotizes

285
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:24,640
 Robert. Robert gets sleepy, sleepy, and then becomes as rigid as a board standing up.

286
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:33,680
 Arthur's two assistants then grab Robert and place him across the chairs. So his head was on

287
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,320
 the back of one of these chairs and his ankles were on the back of another one. That's impossible.

288
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,760
 I mean, it may be a really good core workout. If you really nailed your planks, you could do that.

289
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,480
 But to have the back of your head on one chair and then nothing supporting you and then your ankles

290
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,960
 on the other chair, this man's truly hypnotized. That's not the whole trick. I mean, that's enough

291
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,000
 of a feat that a man is perfectly still between these two chairs. This is the finale of the show.

292
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,840
 Arthur jumps up on one of the chairs and walks across Robert. He's standing on Robert, who is

293
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,560
 still stiff as a board, and Arthur begins to jump up and down. Arthur begins to jump up and down on

294
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,400
 this dude and then walks off of him. I'm zooming in instead on his face. Takes a little bow.

295
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,840
 Amazing act. Everyone's applauding. The two assistants take Robert off of the chairs,

296
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,440
 stand him back up, and then Arthur goes, "Relax!"

297
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:39,120
 Robert immediately goes limp and as he is crumpling down, the back of his head hits one of the chairs.

298
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:48,160
 He's now just laying motionless on the ground. Some people are still clapping. They still think

299
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,560
 this is all great, so I've never seen a man crumple like that. Woo! On core! Arthur realizes something

300
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,040
 is wrong right away and the audience realizes as well when he begins calling for old timing 9-1-1.

301
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,640
 In fact, then it was just one. Eventually, the doctors show up and Arthur is standing over Robert

302
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,240
 going, "Wake up! Wake up! The hypnosis is over. Wake up!" And he's giving these commands to come

303
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,800
 out of this trance and Robert's just laying there. The doctors looking at each other and they're like,

304
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,160
 "What? Well..." They get close. Now, and nowadays, if this type of situation would happen, you'd take

305
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,040
 you to the hospital, they'd start running brain scans on you. Back then, these doctors get there

306
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,720
 and they go, "This man is clearly dead. He's dead." They really don't have any other way to test him

307
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,280
 other than cutting him up to see if his heart's still beating. But his heart isn't beating. I mean,

308
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,880
 at least have stethoscopes and stuff like that. There weren't caveman doctors. But nowadays, they

309
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,680
 would still take you to the hospital just to figure it out. But the doctor's to clear him dead

310
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,680
 of the scene and Arthur goes, "He's not dead. He's just hypnotized." Wake up! Wake up, Robert!

311
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:08,240
 Robert, come out of the trance. He spends hours trying to revive Robert. Because again, the

312
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,600
 doctors know that he's dead. It's not like, "They're like, 'Well, if you let us take him,

313
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,720
 you know, 30 minutes ago, we would have saved him.' The doctors, by the time they get there,

314
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,920
 he was dead. They don't know what killed him yet, but they can tell that he's dead."

315
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:25,040
 Arthur is arrested for manslaughter and he is adamant. "You gotta give me another chance."

316
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,000
 Like, "Wait, do we give you a couple hours of chances?" He goes, "Okay, you're right. But what

317
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,080
 if I brought in another hypnotist, one of the greatest hypnotists that I have a phone number

318
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,040
 two? There's a lot of great ones out, but I can contact this guy. His name is William Davenport.

319
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,360
 He's actually a professor at Columbia University and an expert hypnotist."

320
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:50,240
 Arthur explains what's going on and William goes, "Oh, man, it's clearly simply hypnotized. Did you

321
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,840
 try waking him up for hours on end, of course?" William comes to the morgue. "This guy's been

322
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,280
 dead for a while now." William comes to the morgue. The doctors are down there. The police are down

323
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,400
 there. Arthur is down there. And we have this quote from this news article. William is standing over

324
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:21,600
 Robert and saying, "Bob, your heart, Bob, your heart, your heart is beating. Bob, your heart

325
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,880
 action is beginning. It is beginning. Oh, I say, Bob, look, your heart is beginning to beat."

326
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:37,600
 He does this for four hours. And sometimes he's being very polite. Sometimes he's talking very

327
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,920
 politely to Robert. Other times he's screaming in his ear, "Bob, your heart action is strong.

328
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:53,840
 Bob, your heart begins to beat." But it doesn't work. At this point, since all of the hypnotism

329
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,440
 tricks have been tried, they do an autopsy on Robert. He died of a ruptured aorta.

330
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,640
 I didn't have anything to do with the blow on the back of his head. And the question is,

331
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,640
 the fact that Arthur was jumping him down on his chest, did that have to do with the ruptured

332
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,440
 aorta? And the coroner goes, "No." The coroner goes, "We can actually tell, based on everyone who

333
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,880
 was in the audience and Arthur and all the assistants, when Robert died. He didn't die when

334
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,800
 he was being jumped on. He would have crumpled there immediately. He would have totally ruined

335
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,880
 the show. Arthur jumped up and down on his chest, walked off. They picked him up, held him up right

336
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:42,000
 for a bit. And then Arthur said, "Relax." That is when he died. That is when his aorta ruptured.

337
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,920
 It's possible that his aorta would have ruptured if he had simply sat in the audience a little bit

338
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,720
 longer. We cannot say definitively. I mean, to be fair, if you're jumping him down on your chest,

339
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,520
 probably didn't help things. But the coroner said this was an accidental death. Arthur stopped being

340
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,240
 a hypnotist after that. I don't think he could probably get any more assistance. He stopped being

341
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,800
 a hypnotist after that. He only shows up one other time in history. I got this from a mysterious

342
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,840
 universe article, this cool little detail. I'll be in the show notes. He got busted for running

343
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,640
 liquor during prohibition. And as he was being arrested, he told the officers, "You guys are

344
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,400
 lucky. I could have hypnotized all of you. I could have hypnotized all of you and gotten away.

345
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,240
 Scott, free. I have a bunch of chairs. I have a bunch of chairs I can lay to you on." They're like,

346
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,920
 "Get in that car, you rumbum." So even then later, even though he was an hypnotist on stage,

347
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,960
 he was still boasting of his hypnotic powers. Maybe he perfected them over time. Maybe it was

348
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,600
 just a boast. It's a terrifying story to think about. It's either the story of a hypnotist who

349
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,960
 had an unfortunate accident and lost his best friend, or the story of a hypnotist who got a

350
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,240
 little too big for his britches and performed a feat of strength and mental mind control that

351
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,640
 got his friend killed. But then there's another version of it. Let's put on our conspiracy

352
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:10,400
 caps to wrap it up like this. What if Arthur and William were right? What if he was just hypnotized?

353
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:19,040
 He was told to go as stiff as a board, basically inanimate. And Robert complied.

354
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:30,640
 When he was told to relax, his body became loose, but he didn't awake. His mind was still in a body

355
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:38,240
 that couldn't move, that couldn't speak. He was trapped from the outside world, and he hears

356
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:46,320
 his friend standing over him, "Wake up, Bob. Wake up." And he can't. He's waiting for the right

357
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,760
 combination of words, the right command, to pull him back into the world of the living, where his

358
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,920
 senses are fully functional, and he can have a good laugh and a drink with his buddy afterwards.

359
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:07,840
 But he's trapped there for hours, he can hear his buddy calling his name, and he can't wake up.

360
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,840
 He feels himself being lifted up by strange hands, throwing onto a gurney,

361
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,880
 throwing in the back of an ambulance, taking to the county morgue.

362
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:28,560
 He loses track of time, how long he's in that solid black room. There's no sound,

363
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:37,760
 there's no light, there's no warmth, until he feels motion, and the morgue door is slit open,

364
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:47,680
 and his little cart is dragged out of this small hole in the wall, where he can once again see light.

365
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,880
 And for four more hours, he sees Arthur out of his peripheral vision,

366
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:03,840
 worried, surrounded by police officers. He sees a man he's never met, commanding him

367
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,800
 to come back to life, commanding his heart to start beating again. Robert wants nothing more,

368
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,920
 but the right combination of words hasn't been said yet, he is still asleep.

369
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,800
 Eventually he is put back into his small cubby hole in the morgue, for another

370
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,200
 indeterminal amount of darkness and fear, until one more time that door is slit open,

371
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:42,880
 he is brought out as men wearing masks stand around him, prepared to do an autopsy.

372
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:52,560
 He is still alive when they cut into his skin. The coroners don't understand how no one realized

373
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:01,280
 this until just now, but Robert was still alive, and they knew this would be the end of their careers

374
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:09,840
 if this news got out. So one of them takes a small scalpel and simply nicks Robert's aorta.

375
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:19,360
 Robert never woke up from his hypnotically induced coma, but as he bled out in that morgue,

376
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:26,080
 Robert was finally released from the prison of his own body.
