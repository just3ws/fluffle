1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 The world of conspiracy theorists lose another one of their heroes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we meet a man who believes that not only was Kobe Bryant's death not an accident,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 but that Kobe Bryant is right now being uploaded into a massive computer taken from Saturn

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 to become the Antichrist today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm a little angry, a little angry, but we'll get to that in a second.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 First off, check out this new art. Pretty awesome, isn't it?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 This art is from Smashers_25.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 That's her Instagram handle, and if you're looking for any sort of vector artwork,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 any sort of graphic design stuff, hit her up.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I love that Ash Black's logo he just made over, of course, a one-night listening to the show

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 has been dissected by other artists and reinterpreted.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 We had John from the Scar group, dude.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 His version now Smashers_25 has hers. It's just amazing.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Now, this show's really grown. I really, really love you guys so much.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Also, I found out that a group, I don't know why I didn't know this before,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 and I'm kind of disappointed in you guys. You guys didn't know this either.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 A group of rabbits is known as a fluffle.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Well, what's up, fluffle gang? What's up, little fluffles?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 We'll see how long that sticks.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Secondly, in other news, before we get started with the episode,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 this week is the end of season eight.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 By the end of the week, we're going to hit episode 400, guys.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 400, that's a myth. Can I do it without the fluffles?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Can I do it without the fluffles?

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Oh, let me rub your little tummy, little fluffle gang.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Couldn't have done it without you guys. That's amazing.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 What that means is that every 50 episodes, I take a week off.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 So next week, I'm just going to do some reruns.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 My friend Sabine, she listens to the show and she goes,

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 "I always listen to your current episode."

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Then I'll listen to one or two episodes back, because she just got into it about a month ago.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 This is a good way to catch up. If you haven't heard some past episodes,

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 the best of week is a good way to do that.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 But thank you so much, Smashers_25.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Fluffle Gang for one more. Again, we'll see how long that lasts.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Thanks for your support, and we're going to be taking a break soon.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But now we're not. Now I'm putting back on my angry eyebrows.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Angry. Angry Jason.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And I get angry every once in a while.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Normally it's a Friday episode, but I woke up this morning to this news.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Mad Mike Hughes.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Flat Earth conspiratorist. Is that a word?

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Flat Earth believer.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And also the man who's very well known for building a rocket.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 That he was going to climb inside. I think you know where this is going.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Climbs inside of his rocket and shoot himself up so he could see that the world was really a disk

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 and he was going to take all these pictures.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Because you know, airplanes have concave windows on them, so that's why the Earth looks like a circle,

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 because the windows design that way.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Anyway, so.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 He shoots himself out of a rocket.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Not a rocket. He's a self-styled or self-taught rocket scientist.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I will say this, that's smarter than anything I could have ever done.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So I applaud the fact that he taught himself rocket technology, because I couldn't do that.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 What I'm upset about is he's dead now.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Sorry, I probably could have doled that news a little bit more.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 You're like, you were just holding your little pinnit that said "Mad Mike."

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 You're like, "Oh, is this going to be awesome?"

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Sorry, if you like the guy, I'm sure he was a great person, but last time he did one of these,

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 he launched himself up about 1700 feet, and then the parachutes come out of the rocket

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 and he slowly glides to Earth.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Well, this weekend, when his rocket took off, what they believe is that the packages like holding the parachutes

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 got ripped on the launch pad on like the...

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I can say that's something, at least this guy, I can't even describe the stuff this guy built.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So he's definitely smarter than me in that regard.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 But the parachute thingies got ripped, and then that means the parachutes themselves got ripped.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So the rocket took off successfully, but it had nothing to stop the landing and the rocket fell to Earth.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And there were people there watching it, there were some journalists and supporters of his and things like that.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So that's horrible. That's absolutely horrible.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I feel really bad for him, I feel bad for his fluffle, I feel bad for his family, I feel bad just all around.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And so why are you angry, Jason? Why'd you put on your angry eyebrows for this story?

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Shouldn't this be a celebration of life? Yeah, I do think that he was a smart dude and he was doing something that he loved.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 The problem is he died over a conspiracy theory that we all know is not true.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Right? Shouldn't we be in agreement that this is not true, but he's dead now.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Because he believed that the Earth was flat.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And I don't know, there's just kind of, it's...

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 You know, one of the things that I like about the show is that it brings like the fun back to conspiracy theories.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 It brings the fun back to the world of the paranormal.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So many people take this stuff so seriously, and that's fine too, but then there's a limit.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 There's a difference between me joking about aliens, me beating up... That's not a joke actually, I'm just just lay out aliens.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But there's a difference between me joking about beating up aliens, again not a joke.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 There's a difference between people who are like, "No, aliens are actually 100% real."

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And then the people who believe that reptilians are taking over the planet.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And then even then a group of people is, "The reptilians are taking over the planet, therefore I have to shoot my minister eight times in the head."

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Which actually happened, and oddly enough the minister survived, which is weird.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Which is weird, Kyle Odom was that guy, he was the shooter.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Maybe we'll do an episode on him, it's really well known, that's why I haven't covered it yet.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 But there's that gradation there, so you can believe in Flat Earth all you want.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And I'm allowed to laugh at you all I want, because I think it's a stupid conspiracy theory.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And you can laugh at me and we can have that enjoyment.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But then when you die over it, it's just... It makes me mad.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So, Mad Mike Hughes, that's awesome you were doing your thing.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It sucks that it ended so tragically.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I wish that you had had many more launches, and you had been able to observe the splendor of the curved Earth.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And come down and said, "Hey, you know, I was wrong."

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That would have been the happiest ending of the story.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But instead, a man's dead.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And you know what, I just thought about this.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I almost can guarantee now, I don't live a lot in the Flat Earth world,

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 because again, that's a real popular conspiracy theory.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I just flirt in and out of it.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I studied it, studied it a long time ago.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But I bet you, I should check this out, I bet you there's a conspiracy theory.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I bet you anything that people are saying that he went so high that NASA took him out.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 It was, I bet you anything they're already claiming it's a murder.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I'll check that out and we'll see if we find anything out.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Let me write that down here, because I'll forget otherwise.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Because I'm a busy man, where's my pen?

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And speaking of being busy, I'm going to take this moment out real quick.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 You know, since I'm going to be gone for a week, definitely listen to my episodes, my classic episodes.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I think you'll have a lot of fun with those.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 This weekend I've been watching, and last weekend I watched a lot of movies.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 If you guys want to keep up on the movies I'm watching, you can sign up for my Twitter account.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 A lot of times I'm tweeting about movies I've seen.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But I saw a movie the other day called There Are Monsters.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Highly recommended.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 It's a great conspiracy horror movie.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 It's a great sci-fi horror movie.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 It's just a great horror movie.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And it's interesting because it's a, it's one long narrative,

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 but it took the filmmaker five years to shoot it.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And it came in like 2013.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 It took him like five years to shoot it.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And so there, it seems like a lot of little short stories connected together.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So like, we'll have our heroes go into a supermarket.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 We'll have our heroes go to a dentist's office.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 We'll have our heroes on a bus.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 You can tell like all of these were shot as almost like short movies.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Really, really good horror movie.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 There are monsters.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Check it out.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Dead Rabbit recommends there are monsters.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'm not going to say anything else because I just recommend watching it.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 But let's go ahead though and move on to our next topic, our next story for the day.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Now our next story, our next story coming up, we're going not to a place,

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 but to a mind.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 We're traveling into the mind of a man.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Actually, no, I guess we'll go to a place.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 We're at a diner because this is easier narrative setup.

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 We're now sitting at a diner across from a man.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 He's probably in his, I'm going to guess late 20s, early 30s.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And he's sitting there and he's drinking coffee.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 His eyes are shifting from side to side.

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 We're making us a little nervous, but it's in the middle of the day.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 We're sitting in the little diner and let's say Sedona, Arizona.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I don't know.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Somewhere where there is a road because we need to make a quick getaway if these things turned bad.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And he's sitting there and he's drinking his coffee and we're drinking our beverages of choice.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And we go, so sir, we've heard that you have some information for us.

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And he's like, I do, I do.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And can you reveal your name to us, sir?

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And he goes, yes, yes.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Well, I can give you my Reddit handle.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 He says with a grin.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 This is a good, this is a real dude.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I'm not making this guy up.

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 This guy is not a narrative device.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He's a real man.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 He's only known to the general public as blueberries for, blueberries for life.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Blueberries for life.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So blueberries.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Can I call you blueberries or should I call you Mr. For Life?

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Oh, no, blueberries is fine.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So blueberries.

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Now, what am I finding so, other than that name being weird.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And actually it's the most normal thing that we're about to discuss.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I find it odd that someone who believes what we're about to talk to,

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 the main thing in his existence is blueberries.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Just the fact that they exist.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Not blueberry pie for life, not blueberry soda, blueberry, just blueberries, right?

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Blueberries for life.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 He's sitting there across from us from the diner and he goes,

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I have important information for you guys.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You guys are true believers, right?

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And now our eyes are shifting from side to side.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 We're like, yeah, we believe everything.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And he's like, good, good, good.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Pulls out his notebook.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 January 17th, Eminem drops music to be murdered by.

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I haven't heard that album.

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I haven't heard that album.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I looked up some of the lyrics because I'm a boomer now.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I didn't have time to actually listen to the album.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I was like, yeah, that seems okay.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 He raps too fast for me now.

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I liked old Eminem.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I like his first three albums,

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 but then he just got faster and faster.

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I'm not into that.

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I know a lot of people are though, so I mean, he has his fans.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 January 26th, Kobe Bryant dies while the Grammys are rehearsing at the Staple Center.

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Kind of like each other.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 We're like, yeah, we know that he passed away.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Is it important that they were practicing at the Staple Center at the Grammys?

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, you see the Staple Center is where he used to play basketball.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So, but now they're doing like musical stuff there in the music industry.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And we're like, oh, great.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 It's one of these.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And then he started, we're like, just don't go into the music industry stuff yet.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Save that.

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 He's like, okay, okay.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 January 17th, Eminem drops music to be murdered by his new album.

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 January 26th, Kobe Bryant dies.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Helicopter crash.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 January 31st, Lil Wayne drops the album Funeral, which I have listened to.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And it's okay.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Like I was, I haven't listened to a Lil Wayne album since the Carter III.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And I, again, I think I just am a fan.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Rap music evolves incredibly fast.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Rock music, it goes pretty slow in the same rock band unless they're Maroon 5, which I think they're more of a pop band now.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 They kind of slowly grow over time.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Rappers, like you can go, you can miss an album and it's a completely different artist.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 It's rap music goes super, super fast.

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Anyway, so I wasn't a huge fan of Lil Wayne's Funeral album.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It is interesting though, Hidden Code, you take the album Funeral or the album Art for Funeral, you flip it upside down.

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It says Lil Wayne.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It was interesting.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And now at this point you're looking at me in the diner and they're like, dude, just let him finish his dumb conspiracy theory.

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 This isn't XXL Magazine.

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 You're not spin.

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Okay, okay.

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 January 31st, Lil Wayne drops Funeral.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 February 2nd, Super Bowl 54 happens.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And February 2nd famously was 0202 2020.

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And it was the only date within 1100 years that was a paladrome.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And then he starts going off on all this stupid date stuff, which I'm sure you guys have run into.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 If you're into any of this conspiracy theory stuff, that day, and I think we did an episode on it too.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 That day was doomed.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Like something was supposed to big was happen.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Nothing happened.

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 But that's not changing Blueberry's mind about this.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Because here's his take on Super Bowl 54.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And he gets real close to us.

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 We can smell the coffee on his breath.

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And then he says quote.

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 He actually says that word as well.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 That time show was a sex magic ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Now he leans back in his chair all smug.

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So he's dropped the bomb.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 That Kobe Bryant's death is linked to the Black Cube of Saturn.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 You're perplexed because you have no idea what the Black Cube of Saturn is.

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Hopefully not.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 If you do.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I think there's better uses of your time because I think the Black Cube of Saturn is one of the dumbest conspiracy.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 This is the other thing that makes me mad about this episode.

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Black Cube of Saturn is one of the dumbest conspiracy theories I've come across.

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And I'm going to go over it as briefly as I can.

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 This is what it is.

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 On Saturn, there is a hexagonal storm.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And basically a hexagon, if you draw lines over it, it becomes a 3D cube.

254
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 You can draw lines over anything and make anything.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So right there, the logic behind it is dumb.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 There's a hexagonal storm on Saturn and that if you draw a little line over it, that's a cube.

257
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 On Earth, you have a bunch of Black Cubes everywhere.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 You'll find these images everywhere.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 They're like, "Here's a Black Cube in Dresden. Here's a Black Cube in Brooklyn. Here's a Black Cube in Vermont. Here's a Black Cube in Berkeley."

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 See anything similar?

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Yeah, there's four photos of Black Cubes.

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Apparently, there's some Jewish ritual where they wear little Black Cubes on their head.

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Now, let me say this for a second, because they're saying that they're worshiping the Black Cube.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Let me say this for a second.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 When you think of something that Orthodox Jews wear on their heads, what do you think of?

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Do you think of the Black Cube or do you think of the Yamaha?

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So again, this is why this gets me worked up.

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I'm not like super, I'm like, "No, they don't like the Yamaha?"

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 This is the problem with this conspiracy theory, is that if you point out that eight times, or someone will be like, "There's 20 times."

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It doesn't matter.

271
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 You can point to me the 20 different Black Cubes in society, but you have to disregard every other thing in society that doesn't involve a Black Cube.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And that's the problem with these conspiracy theories.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 This one's fairly recent.

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 They really tried making this to be like, "Thousands of years ago, they discovered the..."

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Here's the thing.

276
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 We didn't know there was a hexagonal storm on Saturn until fairly recently.

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So how cavemen were worshiping the Black Cube on Saturn is beyond me.

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Also, apparently a wedding ring, putting the ring on the finger, is because of Jupiter.

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Damn it, because of Saturn's rings?

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So that's... But they didn't know there were rings around Saturn when we were putting rings on fingers.

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It's all backwards.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 It's all been created backwards, right?

283
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 They didn't know there was a hexagon.

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 They didn't know there was a cube, sorry, on Saturn.

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 They didn't know there were rings, but apparently people knew this way back when.

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And now I can point to the fact that in Spider-Man 2, apparently there's a Black Cube...

287
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 There's a list of movies. There's a list of movies that the Black Cube has been in.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 There's maybe like 20 of them, and it's like Spider-Man 2, Matrix Revolutions.

289
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Oh, and then they go, "Oh, and Avengers. Avengers the Cube because..."

290
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 It's not Black, so now it's just any cube possible.

291
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Also one of the movies they listed that has a cube in it.

292
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 The Movie Cube.

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But oddly enough, not the three sequels.

294
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 So what is going on?

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Basically, this makes me so mad, and this is why.

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It is...

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And we've seen a lot of conspiracy theories like this.

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It's a conspiracy theory out of omission.

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So I can point to the few times the cube is there, but I have to ignore the fact that...

300
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 What's the major...

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And they point obviously to Mecca, where the people walk around the giant Black Cube in the middle of Mecca,

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 and they're like, "No joke. They walk around it the way the rings rotate around Saturn.

303
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 They didn't know rings were around Saturn when they built Mecca."

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So, just really...

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 There are multiple religions that don't have Black Cube things in it.

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Most famously, I don't think Jesus had a Black Cube dropped on him.

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I'm pretty sure there's not a Black Cube in Buddhism or Zoroastheism.

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I know I can't pronounce the one.

309
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Or really anything else, right?

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 You can point to the few times there are Black Cubes and go, "Ah, it's proof."

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 That works secretly being run by people who worship the Black Cube,

312
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 because I can show you a room from the United Nations that's a prayer and meditation room that has a Black Cube.

313
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And at first off, I don't know where that photo was taken.

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I don't know if it's called a prayer and meditation room, and if both of those are true,

315
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I don't care that there's modern art in a room where you're supposed to go and contemplate things.

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 That d- if there was a Black Cube in every place of worship on the planet,

317
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 and not just Spider-Man 2 or the Matrix Revelations or whatever,

318
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 revolutions, it doesn't matter, if every single movie had a Black Cube in it,

319
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 and if there was a Black Cube in every single location of worship,

320
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 and every financial district, and every capital, you might be onto something.

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 It goes on to 50% of those locations. You might be onto something.

322
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 20? 20.

323
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And the lunatic I'm about to talk to you about, let's get back to blueberries for life.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I think I vented long enough, and this extra long Jason Vince, I hate that,

325
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I really dislike that conspiracy theory, because I think I dislike it for one or two reasons,

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 for two reasons. One, it's incredibly uncreative.

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 It's really, really lame. Let's look at, and again, they're not even restricting it to Black Cubes anymore,

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 just any cube, Ice Cubes, part of this. Actual Ice Cubes are part of it.

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Anyways, it's not just Black Cubes anymore, it's any sort of cube.

330
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Cubics. Rubics Cube? Be careful with those guys.

331
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 It makes me mad because it's completely uncreative. It's basically anything that's a basic geometric shape

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 that's proof of this conspiracy and tube. I think it irritates me how fast it's growing.

333
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's not as big as Flat Earth, it may not ever get as big as Flat Earth,

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 but it's definitely bigger than stuff like mountains used to be trees and things like that.

335
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It's growing. If you type in Black Cube of Saturn into Google, it's funny, you'll get a lot of results,

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 and it will be the same photos over and over and over and over and over again.

337
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Let's get back to this lunatic at the coffee shop, though. That was my rant for the day.

338
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I don't know. I may go off on one again because of this guy. So, he says this,

339
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 "The halftime show was a sex magic ritual to the Black Cube of Saturn."

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 On February 3rd, I love this, this is an actual quote. He's trying to convince us that Kobe Bryant

341
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 is going to be reconstructed as an AI. This is a quote. This is some of his proof here.

342
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 "On February 3rd, a photo surfaced from an airplane that had an article written about it.

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 The picture was from the 29th." Unquote. What in the world does that mean?

344
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 On February 3rd, okay, that's a date, I get it, a photo surfaced from an airplane?

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 What airplane? What photo that had an article written about it? Where's the article?

346
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 What are you talking about? You lunatic. And you go, Jason, you're being a little hard on this guy.

347
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 You're being a little hard on blueberries, right? He's just posting on something, oh, wait till we get into this dude's backstory, okay?

348
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And then you'll see why I'm a little concerned about this guy.

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So, he believes that Eminem releases an album about being murdered. Kobe Bryant dies while the Grammys are being practiced at his place of work.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Lil Wayne does an album called Funeral. And then on February 3rd, some photo gets taken out of an airplane.

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 That is all part of the conspiracy theory. Here's this quote, we're going back to his words here.

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 "This entire series of events I'm explaining is a ritual to the black cube of Saturn in order to bring Kobe, quote, back to life," unquote, through AI.

353
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And present him to the world and tell us AI is the new way of life.

354
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 This will be the Antichrist. Kobe died on January 26th, 2020. And as of this writing, it is 2/21/2020.

355
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And there are no funeral plans for him. That's not true. His funeral was held on February 7th.

356
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So right there, you didn't do the basic research to prove your point.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And at this point, you're kind of like putting your animal arm. You're like, Jason, we are at a diner. We are. I've never seen you this worked up, bro.

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Well, listen, dude, okay, first off, okay, I'll move your hand off my arm. I'll put it on my knee.

359
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And then secondly, if you're trying to convince me that the world government has taken a dead basketball player and is going to, of all people, of all people who died,

360
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 no offense against Kobe Bryant. But if Kobe Bryant's ghost walked in my apartment right now and told me that he was the way, the truth, and the light, I'm not going to start worshiping him.

361
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 No offense again, Kobe. But I think you understand. It would take more than a basketball-- or really, anyway, if Britney Spears ghost walked in my apartment right now and told me to start worshiping her, I wouldn't.

362
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And I love Britney Spears. I'd worship her while she was alive. But-- which I actually might be even more creepy, but my point is, is that it's going to take more than a-- one of the most amazing basketball players of all time to convince me that AI is the way.

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Right? Anyways, you get your basic facts right as well. He already had a funeral. He had a funeral two weeks before you wrote this stuff. After-- and I'm going to spare you a ton of this, but after this, to prove himself, to prove his facts.

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And he ends it with the normal conspiracy theorist thing. I don't care if you believe me. You do care if we believe you. That's why you spent eight hours writing this. You know people aren't going to believe you, so you kind of put up that deflection thing.

365
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Fine, it's a psychological trick, whatever. He goes into a ton. The next-- you can go through the show notes. The link will be there. But the next, I don't know, five, six paragraphs are just numerology stuff, number games.

366
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And I'll read this one. This is proof. This is proof. Get your calculators ready, guys. This will prove to you this madman's onto something. Quote. The score-- okay. The score of the game.

367
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 So the Super Bowl score was predetermined by the fact that the Black Cube Society or the-- say, whatever they are, the order of the Black Cube, the Black Cubians, they had preordained the actual score of the football game, which I'm sure a lot of 49er fans would agree with, at least that part of it.

368
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 But the score has something to do with all of this. Quote. The score of the game when it finished-- that would have been hilarious if you took the score, like, during, like, eight minutes before halftime, just an arbitrary number.

369
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 The score of the game when it finished read, San Francisco 20, Kansas City 31. 2 plus 0 equals 2. Thank you. 3 plus 1 equals 4. 24. Wait, what? Okay, so 2 plus 0 is 2, and 3 plus 1 is 4. So now we have the number 24.

370
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 2 times 4 is 8. Super Bowl 54. 5 plus 4 is 9. Kobe died nine days after the ritual began, which is a famous-- oh, and this is-- I can't believe I haven't gotten to this yet. So he does not ref-- he believes that the Black Cube Society of Saturn and the Illuminati are one and the same, or the Illuminati work for him, or Illuminati are their goons, or the goons control them. Who knows?

371
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 But he never uses the term Illuminati. He never uses the name Illuminati. He calls them throughout this-- throughout this post, the Illuma donkey. The Illuma donkey, which I love, actually. I love that. It doesn't rhyme. It doesn't make really any sense.

372
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Donkey, it's funny. Donkey worshipers are actually a slang term for Christians way back in the day, like 38 AD. People refer to Christians as donkey worshipers, because he rode into town on a donkey. I actually have a story coming up on that. There's an interesting little thing about that, but-- so it's weird. I know that.

373
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 When I keep seeing him call him Illuma donkey, I do, because I read that story so recently, I keep associating that as a knock against Christians, so-- and I know this guy's not smart enough to know that, but it throws me off, so I'm thinking, is he also mocking Christians? I don't think so. I think he's just trying to find a funny way to refer to the Illuminati.

374
00:25:38,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 He could have called him the Illuma Naughty, like, not boo, thumbs down. But anyways, Illuma donkey, it's funny. It's my one life preserver in the sea of madness that when I was reading this thing. Anyways, he refers to him as Illuma donkey, so he says that if you add up the scores and do all this math stuff, 5+4 is 9 and Kobe died 9 days after the ritual began.

375
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And you go, what about the 8? You set the score, add it up to 8. He-- again, he goes on for 6 paragraphs or 5 paragraphs. It doesn't matter. Wait, 5+6 is 11. Uh-oh. 9, 11.

376
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So anyways, I mean, that's basically the nonsense that he goes through. He begins going through Kobe Bryant's jersey number and finding Bible verses that correlate with it. And out of some of them, they talk about two mountains, and Kobe Bryant helicopter crashed in the mountains.

377
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And yes, the spiritual history of the Jewish people predicted the fact that Kobe Bryant's helicopter wasn't going to fly right on 2020.

378
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Who-- who knew, guys? Who knew? I'm convinced now. You know what's funny? There's probably a pretty good chance that this show could have just become this if this had been the first episode I ever did.

379
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 That it would have just been 400 episodes of me basically being just grumpy old-- old man Jason, reviewing some conspiracy theories. But it takes a lot out of him. I'm sweating over here, honestly.

380
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Anyways, let's-- let's start wrapping this up. This is definitely going to be a long episode. I don't want to edit out a lot, because I think a lot of this stuff is gold. And it's the end of the season. We haven't had a lot of long episodes this season.

381
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So here we go. This ends with this quote, right? His article ends with this quote. "It could all be coincidence." So at least he's open to that. It could all be coincidence.

382
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Though he continues, "Though I know coincidences don't exist as I was shown this on my very first shroom trip." Let's go back up and talk a little bit about blueberries for life.

383
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 We've left a diner and we're walking and we're like, "Dick has a lunatic." And I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a lunatic." But we're just getting to the tip of the shroom.

384
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Because this guy's not only an avid drug user, right? When I went to look to see if he had any more rantings about this on Reddit, any other conspiracy theories, none that I could find.

385
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Every other post on Reddit was about him tripping on some sort of hallucinogen. Okay?

386
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 "Hey man, I just took eight ounces of doozock, bloke, and you know, I'm tripping out. I'm seeing blueberries everywhere, man. Blueberries connect us all."

387
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Now, I mean, you're like, "Jayceen, you're not gonna start bagging on this guy for doing hallucinogens." Well, no, not necessarily. But let's keep...

388
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I will say it kind of makes your arguments a little less valid when you didn't discover them because you overheard a police officer and a governor talking about rigging an election.

389
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 You overheard them because a clockwork elf appeared out of your left eyeball and whispered it into your nostril. I'm just... that's just me.

390
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 But what he does, the type of drugs he does, I really don't care about.

391
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Unless... let's find out a little bit about this guy. Here's some quotes.

392
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 "Okay, so I've been awakening rapidly for the last seven months. I meditate several times a day and I've seen a lot of unexplained shit. I've also done my fair share of psychedelics."

393
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And then he goes on. And that's actually how he starts off. So he lets us know right up the front that this dude's tripping 24/7.

394
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Now, when someone says they've been awakening rapidly for the last seven months, I had a feeling for what was going on. And you may too.

395
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But let's continue. Let's move on down this Reddit post.

396
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 "I have abilities," he says. "I always had them. But I've ignored them since I was a teenager about 16 years ago."

397
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Yeah, remember when you had mutant powers? Remember when you had quote-unquote abilities and you're just like, "Nah, I'm not going to deal with those."

398
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 But anyways, apparently he's too good for his mutant powers.

399
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 "Muty, go home!" continued this quote here. But back to his quote, referring to his gifts.

400
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 But they are rapidly increasing. These last few days with these planet of alignments, it's been crazy.

401
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 The tugging and pulling of my spirit by the sun has been so strong. I felt like I was going to--

402
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Now, this is where I thought I think this guy might have developed schizophrenia.

403
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And I was like, he's talking about-- he's had these abilities since he was a teenager, and in the last seven months they've been rapidly awakening.

404
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And he's feeling like he's just so ecstatic and he's taking all these drugs. And that's what I was saying. I think I know what's going on in you, might too.

405
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 It almost feels like he has some sort of mental disorder that's rapidly overtaking him.

406
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Delusional thinking to say the least. Because if you-- I encourage you to go to the show notes and look--

407
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Okay, and I want to say this, don't harass this guy. I'm not telling you guys to harass this dude or nothing like that, but if you want to see, like, how someone can just spin, what--

408
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I mean, I'm sure all that math took him hours to do. And I'm sure not only was he happy to do it the whole time, but his mind was just blowing.

409
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Every time a math thing-- and again, with the math, it's the Black Cube, it's all a conspiracy of omission.

410
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Any math formulas that don't match the conspiracy you're looking for, you simply disregard.

411
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 What was the daily attendance of the-- you know what, I'm not even going to get into that, because I could go off on a whole other rant about numbers stuff.

412
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 But anyways, the point is, is that this guy might have some sort of mental issue.

413
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Let's go back to this quote here, because this is really the main reason why I'm so fired up about this, other than the fact that it's a stupid conspiracy theory, and it's a waste of time for anyone to believe in it.

414
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Other than those things, back to this quote. "These last few days with these planet alignments, it's been crazy. The tugging and pulling of my spirit by the sun has been so strong, I felt like I was going to fly a few times while driving."

415
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Next line. "Now I'm a truck driver by trade."

416
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 So this guy we've been talking about this whole time, who spends all this time on Reddit talking about doing hallucinogens, who so high that he believes that the order of album releases tell him that Kobe Bryant is going to appear in a computer.

417
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 His little face is going to appear on everyone's smartphones, and he's going to be like, "Hello, everyone." He believes, and he's driving an 18-wheeler down your street doing math equations while he's trying to steer, tripping balls all the time.

418
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Now, he does say he usually only microdoses. Dude, I remember when I was in a driver's class way back in the day, it was like, it would have been like 1990. It was a sophomore in high school.

419
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 I remember, I was always the combination of the jerk/cool kid. I thought I was cool. It wasn't that cool, but I was a jerk.

420
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I remember I was sitting in the back of class because I never sat in the front, and we were going over driver's ed stuff. There's all these rules of the road, and I remember just kind of sitting there leaning back, and the teacher's going over all this stuff, and I raised my hand, and I'm like, dude, all these rules, when are we supposed to have fun?

421
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 And the kids in Laugh class, and that teacher turned beat ready, goes, "Do you want a driver of an 18-wheeler having fun on the road?"

422
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And I just sat there, and I'm like, "Yeah, kinda." Because I was a jerk, right? I was a jerk. I didn't say, "Yeah, kinda, super loud," just enough for the kids next to me, but the initial question I asked in front of the whole class.

423
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 And as an adult, I think, I still laugh at it. Sorry, but as an adult, I think, yeah, you don't want someone to have an 18-wheeler be having fun, popping wheelies. You definitely don't want them.

424
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Tripping on hallucinogenics, thinking about the Black Cube. Let's go on with this quote.

425
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 "Now I am a truck driver by trade, and I meditate in my truck every morning. Please let it be parked, bro."

426
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Back to the quote. I am su- I love this part. This part. Remember those headmasters from Transformers, the old school Transformers?

427
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 The head was actually a separate little tiny guy action figure. If you'd transform in the head, you'd put it on top of the robot. So it was like, man and machine teamed up.

428
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 That's real life now. So at least I got this, because I love Transformers. At least this guy might be an actual headmaster.

429
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 Back to this quote. "I'm super connected to my truck in a strange way. I feel other vehicles when they are around me."

430
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 That's, again, dude. Just use your eyes and the brake pedal. Don't feel out the universe to whether or not you're scraping a family of four off the freeway.

431
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 "I feel other vehicles when they are around me." I feel this. I love this. "I feel the pressure washer on the truck."

432
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Spraying down with the pressure washer. "I feel the pressure washer on the truck in my forehead in the corresponding part as my face is the front of the truck and the back is the back."

433
00:34:45,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 I know. Super weird, right? Unquote. Yes, that is something that you should-- If I started feeling the intense pressure of a pressure washer anywhere in my head, I'm going to see a medical professional.

434
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I'm definitely going to be a little concerned if I'm spraying it on the front of my truck and it feels like my face is being caved in by 50 pounds per square inch of water.

435
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Now, maybe he just feels a tickle. Maybe he feels the mist on his face from the water splashing off and he's like, "Oh my God, this is-- What is going on? I'm a little concerned about him if he ever gets in a car accident or loses his job."

436
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Then what does he do? He's like, "No, my face!" And someone else is driving off. "No, no, no! Wash it in the gentle cycle." Wakes up. His face has all got a bunch of little dents in it from rocks and stuff.

437
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 I mean, like, this guy's nuts, right? This isn't just me. This guy's totally nuts. And it's scary. Because, again, this is really how I have to wrap this up, because I can go on for another hour about how my feelings on this whole thing, but the episode can't go that long.

438
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Here's my feelings about the whole thing. You can believe in the Black Cube of Saturn, okay? I have no problem with that, and you shouldn't care what I think about that either, right?

439
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I have weirdo conspiracy beliefs. I just have weirdo beliefs in general. Everyone has weirdo beliefs in general. It's not a big deal.

440
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 When you are driving an 18-wheeler, don't do hallucinogenics. I think that's a fair thing. I think we can all agree on that, right?

441
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 That's pretty simple. That's a rule of the road. It's a literal law! It's not even something we have to agree on. It's something that state legislatures have passed into law.

442
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 But I think this guy is so ingrained in this conspiracy that I'm not even really worried about arguing the conspiracy with him. If I met this guy in real life, I'd be more worried about his wealth, his health.

443
00:36:42,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 And my health! He's driving an 18-wheeler, but his health, too, right? And he's so deep. He's so deep that unless there's some sort of true breakthrough, any help rendered to him, I believe will just seem like it's part of the conspiracy theory.

444
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 If a bunch of you guys go to his Reddit page and you're like, "Hey, you're on this podcast," he's going to take it as the conspiracy's true. I mean ridiculed for revealing the secret of the Black Cube of Saturn.

445
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 If someone approaches them and says, "Hey, I saw this Reddit post and you seem to be going through some issues, would you like some counseling?" They're on to them. The Black Cube of Saturn people are on to them.

446
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 It's an interesting way we're going to wrap this story up like this, because Mad Mike, the guy we talked to first, the man who built the rocket to prove that the Earth wasn't really flat, he had an interesting quote at the end of this article that I read about him.

447
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 He says, "My story really is incredible. It's got a bunch of storylines. The garage-built thing in reference to the rocket. I'm an older guy. It's out in the middle of nowhere, plus the flat earth."

448
00:37:47,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 So he's just kind of talking about how his life seems to be quite unique. Seems to be having fun in this moment. The quote continues, "The problem is it brings out all the nuts also. People questioning everything. It's the downside of all of this."

449
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 So here's a guy who believes that the Earth is flat, that NASA is lying to him, world government is lying to him. I don't know if he believed that they were covering it up to cover up proof of God, which is kind of the standard flat earth thing.

450
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Some people believe they're just covering it up as a method of control. But he believed that. But he would get people, he would be approached by people who believed in things even more insane than flat earth.

451
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Monkeys don't exist. The color orange is satanic. Things like that.

452
00:38:35,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Album releases, Grammy shows, football scores, Bible verses, all pointing the path that the black cube of Saturn, which is an artificial intelligence on Saturn, is going to turn Kobe Bryant into an artificial intelligence that's going to convince all of us to worship the black cube is 100% more insane than flat earth.

453
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 There's no rocket test to prove that that conspiracy theory is true or false. And that's what makes it dangerous. People who believe in this theory have no other way to prove whether or not it's true or false than by taking action against this group of black cube worshippers.

454
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Hopefully nothing happens. Hopefully Blueberry's for life wakes up out of his awakening and just levels out or if needed, get some professional help.

455
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Hopefully his story does not end as tragically as Mad Mike Hughes. But only time will tell.

456
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,000
