 Tonight a game show reveals a terrible secret
 What would you do if you found tiny people taking a bath in your bathroom sink?
 What and then we travel to West Virginia or a small creek
 bubbling
 through the dark forest
 Actually has a powerful secret. Is there a ghost in West Virginia?
 That can warn us whenever a president will be assassinated today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too feeling a lot better
 I think you guys can hear that on my voice
 Still have the cough that coughs been around for a couple weeks now, but we got a lot of stuff to cover
 So let's go ahead and jump right into this now. This show is a daily show
 So this is happening tonight, but this also takes place in Germany. So by the time I'm recording this at 7 p.m. On
 March 24th by the time by the time I'm recording it. It's probably already happened in Germany, but still
 That's our timely music news so Big Brother is the show where you get the contestants
 They sit in the house and then like people get voted. I think I've I
 Can't ever say that I've ever watched more than a few episodes of it, but they get voted out
 I believe and
 If they win money or something or they win the house
 I don't know maybe the end the last person in the house actually owns the house
 But it was a British show and then it was spread all over the world
 Big Brother Germany is going on right now. There's a couple other big brothers going on right now and the the idea is this
 10 people or whatever you're chasing any basic research
 You get a group of people in a house
 They're totally cut off from the outside world and they bicker and squabble and us
 Normals us homo sapiens get to watch these guys 24 hour on camera feed
 Technically, we're the big brother. We're the observing audience
 But there's actually a big brother in the house that can give news alerts or it doesn't really give news alerts can
 Prompt drama basically there's an overriding force in the house
 So people get voted out of the house and then there's like this huge crowd
 Because you go in and you're a nobody and then you come out and your celebrity people have been watching your antics for a week
 Or two or three or four however long you last on the show
 Yeah, you come out and you find out you have a fan base and or a bunch of stalkers, but
 You know, I'm so we have two different things going on. We have a bunch of people isolated in a house
 And they have no access to the outside world. They have no television. No news nothing the big brother show in Germany
 It started on February 6th this season started on February 6th into that time
 coronavirus you had like maybe
 Couple dozen cases in Germany a couple dozen cases in America and stuff like that
 They've had no news about what's going on in the outside world. This is there's a lot of stuff this messed up about this one
 They're not telling them about it. They're not this is the gimmick. Okay, this is what they're doing tonight on IT on live TV
 They're going to announce to these people who have been sequestered in their house since February 6th
 They're like ladies and gentlemen for the first time in big brother Germany history
 We're gonna let you guys know what's going on in the outside world. Whoa. What's it gonna be?
 Everyone's sick. There's a there's a disease rampaging across the planet. Be like what?
 I want to know that they're getting ready to announce that on live television tonight
 There have been so when someone gets voted out of the house and other person takes their place
 The people who have taken their place one person just entered the house a couple days ago. I hope they tested them
 I hope they made sure the guy wasn't sick and they said you cannot mention what's going on outside at all
 Even the pandemic especially the pandemic you can't say anything where they've been teasing
 They've been advertising this tune into night where we let ten people know what's going on and that's horrible
 That's horrible and that definitely raises the stakes for the show because now you definitely don't want to get voted out
 Because you know where you're at you're isolated you're in the lap of luxury you have unlimited food and water now
 You're like oh my god
 I live in an apartment with like ten other roommates and they're super disgusting
 Please don't vote me out like the stakes for the show are so high now
 So and I guess I should say this when we had a similar thing here in the States
 9/11 happened and they were doing a season a big brother and the rule was don't tell anyone what's going on in the outside world
 But one of the girls in the house lost somebody in 9/11
 So they did say hey guys
 We got attacked by terrorists and they kind of broke the rules for that and they a couple other seasons are doing big brother right now
 They've broken the rules for that but to let them know what's going on in the Canadian big brother. This was Crete. This is creepy
 Canadian big brother right the way I described you remember the people get voted out and they leave and there's like a massive crowd outside the house
 Charing you were nobody two weeks ago, but now we love you
 Recently they had the vote out thing right and
 They voted the person saying goodbye to him and they walk out the door and everyone's like getting ready to hear the abhorious applause
 It's dead silent outside because there's no audience
 Social distancing the Canadian television network or whatever didn't have anyone come they you can't be that close to anyone
 So you know the gimmick of the show you've been watching it growing up and now you're on it
 You know what to expect someone walks out the door. It's dead silent outside
 The people are like
 Because they have the hour-long special that you can watch on television and then you can watch them on webcams
 When people were watching the webcam footage after the person leaves
 People in the house are waiting to hear the roar and they don't hear anything
 And then they're talking among each other later that night and the people are like why didn't why didn't we hear anything?
 Another person's like, I know that was really weird right and they're yeah
 Yeah, like did they like soundproof the house somehow which would be impossible, but
 That's what they're thinking. That's the only thing you can think of like they must have somehow created some sort of did the Canadian television
 use all that money they got from Degrassi High and build like a
 soundproof
 sci-fi dome around the building like what and they start discussing why weren't there anyone outside and
 Then the big brother who like I said can speak in this intercom system over the house to talk to them as these people are trying to figure out
 What could possibly be going on outside that there was no one there to greet the person exiting the house
 The big brother voice speaks from above and says please stop talking
 Everyone in the house just gets quiet
 They did eventually a couple days a couple days later
 Tell the big tell the people in that house what was going on and that's why there was no crowd
 But again definitely raises the stakes for the show. You don't want to get voted off now
 I wanted to cover that story for two reasons one
 I think it's absolutely inhumane to make people fight to stay in a house when this is going on - I want to talk about a
 Show called
 Dead set this is and when I was reading this article
 They talked about the show dead set dead rabbit recommends dead set it is a show
 About the big brother house in Britain, which is where big brother originally started the big brother house and all these people
 They're totally isolated
 They're a bunch of like you get all these strangers put in this house together and they have 24-hour cameras on them and a zombie apocalypse starts outside
 It's it's one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen it was actually a mini series
 But I have it in the show notes. You can watch it on YouTube. I also got that movie dig. I said it was super rare to find
 I found that on YouTube. That's also in the show notes for this episode as well, but I definitely watched dig
 I watched the other night. It's still an amazing documentary, but dead set
 It's and then they're in the big brother house and zombies are laying siege and this one girl's boyfriend is like
 Trying to get to the big brother house to save her. It's really dark
 So you may want to save it till after all this is done, but
 Definitely it's on their dead set dead rabbit recommends dead set and dig. It's such a great documentary
 I also want to say this
 I've reached my level with
 Coronavirus like news
 I don't even read it anymore and I would suggest to most of you guys if you haven't reached it to stop reading it
 I know the basic stuff. Don't take ibuprofen. They say don't take ibuprofen
 Keep your hands washed it can stay now. They're saying it can stay on services for 17 days
 But then you look into that and it's like it doesn't it's not contagious at that point
 You know, I just know if I get cardboard from outside. I don't touch it for 24 hours anything
 You know what the basic stuff I stopped reading all of the horror stories about it
 I don't even look at the headlines. That's not true. I look at the headlines
 But I got tired of clicking on these clickbaity links
 And finding either fake information
 That makes it far more horrible than it actually is
 And there's a lot of that going on. It's really weird
 I found stories that were 100% that were absolutely horrifying
 I was like, oh my god
 And then other people goes that twitter from that doctor who's telling you that story from italy that he's misspelling words
 He misspelled his job
 That's not a real tweet. This is fake stuff
 But they're getting clipped in hammock. It's scary. Don't get me wrong. It is scary and you should
 Social distance and if you can self-isolate and do all these containment things
 I'm not saying that it's fake or anything like that
 But what I'm saying is that we can overdo on the scary news about it. We need to know the basics
 That's the same thing. There's one thing between knowing about ices and then watching ices be heading videos, right?
 You get the point. There's a there's a brutal terrorist regime
 Taking over swaps of the middle east. You should be aware of basic facts
 But that doesn't mean you have to go start reading articles where it's telling you what they did
 Stuff like that. So that's that's the approach I've taken towards this
 I got the basic information and I think it was really overwhelming for me, honestly that first week and a half
 We're still in it, but just reading so every hour looking for new articles to read about stuff
 And it was really really affecting me. It was really getting to me. Doesn't mean I'm ignoring the danger
 But it doesn't mean that I'm overwhelming my sense of self and my
 My like you don't want to get too anxious about it. You just want to be careful. That's the main thing
 This is something that we and now this is turn kind of preachy
 But I just I want to be preachy right now because I don't I don't I know that we already feel isolated just in a normal life
 And now that we actually have to stay away from people
 We can feel it even more isolated
 So don't ignore the news, but know your limit. I've reached my limit
 Now I'll go to websites a look at the headlines
 That's it. I've reached my limit. I'm doing what I can do
 And I'm I'm no longer clicking on these horror stories of this person suffering from this or this
 I got really too deep into it
 And it was just too much people may say, ah, you're putting your head in the sand, but I say no
 I think it's the same thing as
 Knowing about a global terrorist group versus having to delve into what they do when they enter a village
 You don't need to know that information. You just know that they exist
 and stuff like that so
 Know what the problem is know how you can prevent it yourself
 Know what you can do to not get yourself sick or other people sick
 And then go on you don't have to be clicking on every single creepy twitter or article that has a sad headline
 Just keep going forward. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story though
 Our next story takes us to Malaysia. So let's hop on board the carpenter copter. We're flying out to
 Salingh Bahru Salingh Bahru
 You guys know where that's at, right? I hope so because I don't I'm flying the carpenter copter. We're flying out there
 It's march 1989. We're gonna meet a little kid, right? So nine-year-old boy his name's faizul. Affindi
 And he's walking to school
 He's a little backpack. He has it over one shoulder because he's one of the cool kids
 He's not one of those lamos that has it over. I used to be that kid
 I didn't want to put my backpack on both
 Both shoulders because it looks super lame and then like your back starts to hurt
 But the time you get to high school and the books are super heavy
 You're like, oh you look like quasi moto every time you walk everywhere
 But anyways, I still did it nowadays. I put it on both shoulders because I don't care
 Faizul is walking on the street to school and he sees this guy walk by now
 That's normal, right? A lot of times when you're walking on the street other people are walking on the street too
 But this guy was only six inches tall and this little dude
 Is just kind of walking by now here's the thing you're walking on the street you see a six inch person
 Which is unreasonably small
 Obviously there are people there are little people and they'll be like three feet two feet tall
 But six inches is is not normal for anything outside of a uterus, right?
 But you see a little six inch person walking on the street. What do you do quick?
 Quick reaction time. What do you do now? I would
 Probably like jump back
 And then I would um regain my composure because I'm cool and I'd put my
 Easily take my backpack off because it's only on one shoulder and then I'd get down on one knee and go
 Who are you?
 And I'd try to communicate with this six inch person
 Faisal does what I think I think you'd basically have three reactions
 You'd run away
 Because it's super spooky you try to talk to the six inch dude
 Or you'd grab it because anything that's small enough to grab now again. He's a kid
 But I can understand why he grabbed it because actually no I can't because I think kids don't normally walk around grabbing squirrels and stuff like
 I mean babies, maybe but I mean now that I think about it. What if this was just a six foot guy?
 Faisal was walking on street. Would he be grabbing on it? Get off of me kid. What are you doing?
 But he grabs the six inch dude the little guy little guy
 bears his teeth and then begins super scratching him up
 And scratches him up so much that fazal drops the dude
 Guy runs into the bushes
 And they're thinking okay, that's bizarre right a little feral, you know, it's not that he just scratched him up
 Bared his teeth and then scratch him up
 It wouldn't make sense for a six inch person to have some really good self-defense techniques
 Not that it has to know like chokeholds and stuff like that, but that it would have claws
 I wonder
 No, that's not wait a second think about it
 Small animals have claws and big animals don't right so like cats have claws
 And then tigers have claws like tigers aren't small. Well think about okay
 You have like birds they're tiny they have claws right, but then humans don't
 And then cats have claws because you know, they're like claw on it
 Mice and stuff like that
 Why don't dogs have claws? Why don't dogs?
 What would that be like good when they're like attacking bears and stuff like that bears have claws
 They're pretty big that doesn't work in my hypothesis. But this is what I'm getting at hippopotamuses rhinos
 Elephants they don't have claws
 So I think the bigger you get the less likely it is you're going to have claws
 If you have claws you need every advantage possible to have what if
 Everyone says that cats are small tigers, right?
 So like there's a bunch of tigers running around and they kept having
 Having babies and the babies got smaller and smaller and that's where house cats came from
 I'm going to give a different idea
 You're like Jason that's nobody said that that's no scientific theory
 You have what if all cats started off as little and then they got big and that's why they still have their claws
 But then a thousand years from now lions and tigers will no longer have claws because they'll not need them
 What do they use claws for anyways? They don't they don't really climb trees like
 Why do bears have claws actually like isn't just because gorillas don't have claws, right?
 So I I'm going to stand by my theory. I'm going to stand by my theory that the bigger the animal
 The bear doesn't count the bigger the animal the less likely it is to have claws
 Because if an elephant had claws is an elephant eat meat that might be the thing maybe it's meat eater
 Wait, no, but rhinos. Oh wait. No, that's it. That's it
 Meat eaters have claws and omnivores and herbivores
 You have elephants being like ah rip and open but in every minute. Okay, so where was I at?
 Oh, so so this guy must be a carnivore because he has claws. That's what I was trying to get at
 I wonder if there's a carnivore. Never mind. I'm not gonna. Okay, so
 That's that april 1989 one month later. Selang Bahru Malaysia. We're still here. We never left town
 We've been eating their delicious noodles. I'm assuming that they eat noodles over there
 We're eating noodles and rice and it's so super tasty
 It's tasting so good in my little quarantined belly
 tasting so yummy
 We're gonna meet a dude named nor osmy mod jamal nor osmy mod jamal
 He's walking home from school. It's coming the opposite direction, but the same area
 I don't actually know if it's the same geographical area, but same town. He's walking home from school
 He is sees walking across the street
 Two six inch dudes one of them is actually a girl
 So two six inch dudes one of them is wearing a brown shirt and shorts
 Which is actually kind of comfortable because malaysian is pretty tropical
 They're not dressed like the leprechaun. They're not dressing like big old hats and stuff like the jackets
 That's actually a good point. The leprechauns dressed up like
 Okay, wait a second. I'm thinking of the leprechaun from the leprechaun movies. That's not his actual
 But leprechaun wears a jacket and you wear like big old socks and pants like pants like shorts
 They're shorts, but he has like long so because irland is cold irland's cool
 but if you had
 Cryptids in more tropical areas, they'd be wearing like little sun hat and like
 Bermuda shirt little short-sleeve shirt
 You wouldn't want to see like if you are a cryptid if you were a mythological creature in a warm climate
 You would dress accordingly. That's actually really interesting because it shows
 Well, it shows one of two things
 It shows that cryptids would have to maintain some sort of internal body temperature that they're also
 Effected by the climate or that the people making up the stories make them up in a way
 That's relatable to the people in their culture. i.e. if you were in irland and you were talking about a leprechaun
 You wouldn't say he was he had a boogie board and it wears shorts and no shirt people be like
 But it's run any freeze to death and why does he have a boogie board? What's a boogie board?
 So it's one of those two things most likely the second one. Anyways, he's walking on the street
 He sees two six inch people one of them is wearing a brown shirt brown shorts
 the other one is wearing a brown shirt and a little skirt and
 He sees these little guys and he does this is what I think would be more likely than reaching out and grabbing one
 He starts chasing them
 Now I said I would sit down and go. What's your name? But if it was like walk
 I would also probably be likely to pursue them as well. I'd still want to talk to them
 But that's a pretty natural thing. He starts chasing them and they take off into the bushes
 But a few days later nor this kid nor is at home
 So he walks into his bathroom and there's like you have like the bathroom sink
 And he sees one of the little dudes just kind of hanging out sitting on like the porcelain
 Just hanging out just chilling on his sink. What the world's going on?
 And then he looks and he sees that the basin of the sink is filled with water and the other one's totally naked
 Washing itself now. I don't know if it took like a sliver of soap
 Aye, laddie. Gotta get clean irish spring. Maybe this is a really commercial for irish spring
 The little dude is washing himself which
 that
 Would be awesome, right? I would do multiple things right there one. I'd get a camera now to be fair
 That's not I'm not pervert. I'm not a pervert. I'm not gonna post these photos on found cryptids new dot com or like
 Cryptids on camera stuff like that. I'm not trying to be a pervert because there's a there's a naked cryptid in my sink
 I'd grab a camera for proof because no one's gonna believe you obviously
 And then I would still try to talk to the guys, but then I would sell the water online a bunch of weirdos and be like
 Hey guys, how would you like to buy water that a six inch person took a bath in?
 And they would respond man or woman and I'd go
 Doesn't matter a six inch person took a bath in this
 Okay, it was the woman. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'll buy it to buy it. So anyways
 He doesn't specify if it was the dude or the girl who was taking the bath
 But we'll just assume just to make the story a little more sexy
 It was a six inch woman in there
 And so anyways, he's watching her take a bath and then he reaches in a court. This is the instinct
 He goes to grab the girl in the sink
 and surprise surprise
 He gets attacked he gets bit really really hard and dropped sir and the two little people took off now
 He goes to tell his parents obviously asked to explain why his hand is bleeding profusely. What happened to you?
 I tried grabbing a naked woman. No mom. Don't give me that. She was only six inches tall
 Okay, I'm not pervert. Well kind of a pervert. But what would you do?
 He tells his parents this and this story I got both of these off of that website think about it docs.com
 Historians with this sentence quote. He told his parents about the incident
 But they did not believe him
 Unquote isn't that the the tragedy that lives on forever
 Haven't we all been there that moment where we got bit by a naked six inch woman and we went to our parents the people who love us so much
 Mom dad. I got bit by a tiny person taking a bath in our sea
 And then you being not believed that is the true tragedy of this world
 Let's go ahead and move on to our I find that story funny. I like that story
 I like little people running around I think it's cute. I mean the the constant assaults by the giants
 Maybe not so cute, but I do find it fascinating and it makes you think what would you do if you saw a tiny person
 I think I would try to talk to them
 And probably take pictures of them and sell their bath water
 But I don't think I'd be grabbing them all the time just because they're tiny because again
 I don't grab mice that are running around. Let's go ahead and move on to our last story
 We're headed out to west virginia all of this information I got from an article
 I want to give credit where credit's due from a website called west virginia explorer
 The article is horse creek ghost set to foretell the demise of presidents and it was written by david sibray
 So let's hop back on board the car. Let's take the jason jelopy. We haven't been driving for a long time. We're in melasia
 Fine. Let's hop back on the carboner copter. We're gonna fly out to west virginia. We're gonna learn about the horse creek ghost
 april 8th
 1865
 Major walter hansen and his buddy elisha miller. Those are some old-timey names for you are hunting
 They're out hunting by horse creek in west virginia and they hear something the bushes turn around quickly
 They spin around to face the noise think it's a deer an elk possibly an elk with claws
 They've evolved they eat meat now and is the majors ready to face this evolution abomination
 A woman steps out of the bushes
 Dressed in all black clothes
 soaking wet
 She points her finger at the man and says
 Lincoln will be gone
 For the full moon rises
 And they're like what because lincoln's still president and then she I don't know if she flashes away
 Or she just kind of like points at him for a while then kind of puts her arm back down
 This just stands there silently and then is kind of like i'm gonna i'm gonna go back into the bushes
 She turns her walks away. She simply disappears now. It's 1865. It's not like you can just pick up a newspaper
 Major Walter Hanson said it took him two months to find out that abraham lincoln had been shot
 By the coward what was his name and i remember jimmy olson. What was that guy's name?
 Lee Harvey olswald. No, that was the other guy
 Who was the guy who shot lincoln not erin burr and then he jumped and he like
 Fell day jumped and he like slid down a curtain all dramatically. What was his name? Dude. He was that actor
 um
 Who shot lincoln?
 And then he ran and then he hid in a barn and then the authorities surrounded you're like jason
 You know all this stuff. You you don't know his name. They said the barn on fire and he died
 There's always been that big conspiracy theory that he didn't die in the barn
 That he got away. What was his name?
 Patton hallswald it started with an o. I think it had an o in it, right? I'm gonna google it here real quick
 Had an o in it that that's specific. Let's see. Um, who killed lincoln?
 What
 What was his name perkins john wilkes booth see there's three o's in it. That's what was throwing me off
 There's too many o's is throwing me off john wilkes booth shoots a ram lincoln
 Uh, then does all that other stuff I said and may or may not have gotten away with it
 But anyways now we're going to go to the year 1881
 And this guy named clide purdew and his wife doesn't matter what her name is are driving are
 Writing their horses or whatever down this same street by horse creek in west virginia
 And this one's interesting. So the first time you had the woman i'm gonna assume she was hot coming out of the bushes
 Dressed in all black dripping wet this one you still have the black clothing. So this thing comes out in a black shawl
 That's still dripping wet, but this time it's a flaming skull and crossbones. It's kind of weird
 They're driving down the road and they see this flaming skull and crossbones with a wearing a black dripping wet shawl
 up here in front of them and the skeleton guy goes
 James carfields going to be assassinated
 Again, I don't know if it faded away or just kind of floated there for a while
 And then they drove past it and they're like waving to it in the rearview mirror or they're on horses
 So they were just I don't actually know whether what were cars
 I was thinking that I was like cars who are around in 1881, right?
 But like there was only like two of them and you're like Jason this might be your least informed episode ever
 That that may be true, but I think cars were around in 1881, but nobody had him
 So I think these guys are on horses. It doesn't really matter as no bearing on the plot
 The point is is that a flaming skull and crossbones said that james garfields are going to be assassinated and he was
 in 1881
 1963
 There's this dude named max alberts. Tell me if this is the most depressing job possible
 He's a traveling
 I mean how much money could you possibly this is the albundi of the 1960s
 He was a traveling magazine subscription salesman
 So you would just walk around the country or drive around the country because I know cars were invented in 1963 or they were around
 And you go knock on people's doors and says would you like to buy 12 issues of this life magazine?
 Like how much money could you possibly make doing that?
 It's ridiculous. I mean and then you basically or you can buy a magazine and all those little cards fall out of it
 That you can do subscriptions and stuff like that for complete. That's so sad
 That's so sad, right? But anyways, this guy maybe it was his favorite job in the world max albert's
 traveling magazine subscription salesman
 I remember once this this salesman came to my mom's house. Why was my house too when I was a kid?
 She this traveling salesman came to our house to sell us like a vacuum cleaner or set of knives or whatever he was selling
 Right and we had a little bowl of milk laid out
 For like a local cat. It wasn't our cat was like a stray cat, but we fed him fit of milk every day
 I mean if we were you know, we didn't know that milk causes cats to have diarrhea everywhere
 But it wasn't our cats and we didn't care and so we'd set this milk out
 And I remember one day my mom like I see her talking at the door and she's like no no
 That's okay. We don't want anything and then she goes. Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry and um
 Then she shuts the door and I was like what what happened and mom goes
 Oh my oh my goodness. I feel so bad. I feel so bad. I go what what okay now
 What's going on? She goes well this man came to the house and he all he looked down on his luck
 He looked like things were not going well in his life and he's a door-to-door salesman
 so that's a really difficult job and he already looked like things weren't going well and
 Knocked on the door tried selling my mom something. She said no and then as he went to leave he stepped
 he stepped
 He stepped in the bowl of cat milk spilling cat milk all over his pant leg, right
 It wasn't cat milk. It wasn't milk from a cat
 But it was it was a sizable amount of milk. He got her all over his leg
 And I remember my mom was she felt really bad about it because here you have this guy
 Who's already things aren't going good for him now he has milk all over his clothes the worst material because you got to wash it
 Right away. Otherwise you're going to start smelling like sour milk. It's all over his sock. It's all over his shoe
 And my mom's telling the story and she can't finish it without kind of smiling, right? Because it's also kind of it's like
 You're so down on your luck and then you get milk
 And then you get milk all over you and we always we always felt super bad for the guy
 But me and my brother and my mom always used that as
 An end of a phrase whenever we were talking about bad news
 We're like, yeah in johnny not only did he fall down and break his ankle
 But then his girlfriend left him and then he stepped in some milk
 Like that was always the way for us to end a phrase of a streak of bad luck was stepped in some milk
 So maybe that maybe that salesman is listening to us right now
 Anyways cat milk aside or just milk for cats aside
 1963
 Max albert's is driving down the street. He sees the woman. It's a woman again this time
 Dressed in all black soaking wet clothes now. This is interesting
 Because all of these stories were a local legend in the area and then they became campfire stories that people told all over west virginia
 And then they were collected
 In a book of writings by a guy named jim comstock. He wrote wrote about this story in the 1970s. It's been
 nationwide sense
 This one's interesting because this one he's driving down the road and this phantom this woman walks out of the bushes
 Dripping wet black clothes a phantom an oracle of death and the guy doesn't hear what she says
 He's driving down the road and he sees her step out into the road
 And she points at him and he's she's saying something but he doesn't hear what she's saying what what i'm sorry
 Lay what she's like kennedy will die. He's like, well, I can't hear you. I'm like what car's super loud
 She's like i'm trying to warn you kennedy's gone. He doesn't stop
 He just keeps on driving and this story is included in this collection because in 1963 is when kennedy died
 Now he apparently told people when he got to the next town of super weirders or haven't on the road
 This woman popped out of the bush just started yelling at me
 And I just kept driving and people are like, uh, and then kennedy dies that year
 What's interesting about that part of the story is that
 If the story is made up
 That wouldn't be in there, right? If the story is 100% made up
 You wouldn't add in a part where the guy doesn't hear the warning
 Does that make sense like if you're I've always you I've used this for a couple different times a couple different episodes
 If the story is made up, it should be more
 A little more sensational doesn't have to be over the top
 It doesn't have to be that she actually like hopped out of his glove box and said lee harvey all's well
 It's going to shoot you don't have to have it that dramatic, but he should at least have heard the warning
 Because if you're making it up you can change the facts here if you want
 The fact that he didn't hear the warning at all and simply told someone later that this happened and everyone was like, oh
 Makes me think that the story might be true
 So that's kind of creepy that for whatever reason this location now there are five different places in west virginia called horse creek
 Nobody knows which one
 It actually is which again makes me if it was made up
 You would say it was this horse creek and this location and these these are what happened each time
 This is what the person said you can make it super specific because you're making it up out a whole cloth
 This is the interesting part. Let's say that this is true. Let's accept that these stories are true
 There's a location for whatever reason horse creek in west virginia
 That a phantom will appear whenever a president is assassinated
 If that story is true, you know as well as I do that there is a secret service agent
 in that area now
 The first time there was no secret service back when Lincoln was killed. You didn't know what to think about
 And the second time when garfield died, you'd be like, oh, that's kind of weird, right?
 But by the third time that it happens, you know if the cia is testing like psychic abilities
 Walking through walls all this stuff. You know that someone in the government has heard these stories and said
 Let's find this horse creek. There's only five of them
 And if they don't know which one's which you could have someone in each location
 You could easily pay someone to just fish all day long at horse creek
 It doesn't have to be the same guy. They can work shifts, but you'd have someone there all the time
 What would it really cost you have five locations?
 Rotating shifts you have two to three people working a camp at a time. So for 15 employees
 You could predict whether or not a president was going to be assassinated
 And what's interesting is that the last sighting was in 1963
 And all of these sightings the person warns of the death ahead of time
 Let's them know it's coming
 So is it possible that after 1963 word gets out about this urban legend of west virginia
 Which is right in that hub of you have the pentagon you have Langley all that stuff. They say let's take some agents
 Have them camp out
 Big big ol they can sit there and make s'mores all day long big ol jamboree. We can come and visit on the weekends
 And if this happens again
 Will be warned in the 1980s the Reagan was almost assassinated he was shot
 You got a secret as the guy was pulling the trigger putting bullets into Reagan
 one of the secret service agents jumped in and stuck his finger in between the trigger
 And the other part of the gun where the trigger goes he stuck his finger in behind the trigger
 So another shot couldn't get out. That's one in a million
 That's what training's for sticking your finger as it's going pop as that trigger's pulling back pop
 Pop his finger goes in and jams the gun. He can't get another shot off
 Is it possible that on that day people were prepared for an attack?
 On the president. Is it possible that there are creeks in west virginia staffed by secret service agents?
 Just in case
 It may seem like a tall tale. It may seem like a campfire story
 But when you have the life of the leader of the free world on the line
 Is it really that much trouble to have a couple secret service agents fishing?
 hunting and waiting
 For a spirit to warn them of an assassination
