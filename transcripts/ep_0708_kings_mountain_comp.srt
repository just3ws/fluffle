1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 What happens when a love spell goes to write?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,500
 We take a look at a bizarre new film that if this is not a cursed film, I do not know what is.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to Kings Mountain in North Carolina.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 If there is ever a story that deserves to have ghosts tormented for eternity,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 this is that story, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 This is not just another episode, I don't... guys.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We beat the Simpsons, everyone round of applause.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Even if you're driving your car, if you're flying a jet, I want to hear a round of applause right now.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 We have beat the Simpsons.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 This is Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I'm having a phenomenal day, I hope you guys are having a phenomenal day as well.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Episode 708, we now have more episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio than episodes of the Simpsons.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I never ever, ever imagined that at some point in my life, I would create something...

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 You're like, Jason.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Quality over quantity.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I think this show is good.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 If I wasn't making this show, I would love this show.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So I do believe that you can have...

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I always say when people say quality over quantity, I go, "BMW makes hundreds of thousands of cars a year."

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You can do both.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And then they just kind of look at me and they go, "My whole world view has changed, man.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 You've changed everything for me."

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And I go, "You're welcome."

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We beat the Simpsons.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I love the Simpsons.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I'm a huge fan of the Simpsons even to this day.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So it is awesome that Dead Rabbit Radio now has more episodes than the Simpsons.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And that is thanks to you guys, you guys supporting the show all the time.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Speaking of show supporters strutting into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone's going to be strutting this episode.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 It's one of our legacy Patreon supporters, Evan Young, everyone.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Look at that strut.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Look at that strut into Dead Rabbit Command.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Evan, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Because you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 That's fine.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Just spread the word about the show.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Make sure your friends, your family, your enemies, your sworn enemies know about the show.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 That also really helps out a lot.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So Evan, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 We are headed out to a small town in the middle of America.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 [imitates plane engine]

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Evan is flying us over the beautiful blue skies of America.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I found this on the export recently.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's a very, very short story, but I thought it was fascinating.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 It kind of ties in a little bit what we were talking about yesterday too.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 If you haven't listened to the episode, I'll do a quick overview at the end of this.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 But in 2008, this is the story I came across on the export.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 In 2008, this dude, we're going to call him Jerry.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Jerry finds a ritual on the export.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Very, very dangerous thing to do.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Because you don't know who's posting. Everything's anonymous.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And most likely it wouldn't work, right?

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Most likely it's just someone goofing off.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 But Jerry finds this ritual on X.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Here's the ritual.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Write this down if you've ever wanted someone to fall in love with you.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 However, before you perform it, you might want to finish listening to the segment.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 You're like, "Hot dog!" and you run off and you do it.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And then you're like, "Now to finish this segment."

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 You're like, "Oh no."

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Here's what you need.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 First off, you need an object of desire.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 A human.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Another human, right?

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 This can't be for like a pickle or like a cantaloupe rolling on the street.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 You have a human that you're in love with.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 You need three strands of their hair.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So it doesn't turn off with the easiest ingredient.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Obviously, if you know them, you could like get it out of their hairbrush.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I'm not rec-- Let me back up too.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I'm not recommending doing this.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I'm not recommending doing this.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I'm just saying that this is possible.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 You can get their hair.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You get three strands of their hair.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 You need one photo or one personal item.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 You're a thief, right?

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 You're a thief at this point.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 You need one photo at best or one personal item from the person.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And then a wooden box that you could buy at Home Depot.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 You don't need to go like, "Well, you make this box for me, please."

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And they're like, "Why? Why?"

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Three strands of hair, one photo or personal item of the person, and then a wooden box.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 You take the personal item, or the photo.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 We'll just say photo from here on out.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 You take the photo and the three hairs and you put them in the wooden box.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And then you got to know all about moon stuff because you bury it on the waning crescent night of the lunar cycle.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Then you got to know more moon stuff because I know what a waning crescent is.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 But then you dig up the box on the waning gibbous night.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I have no idea. Look at that.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 The waning gibbous night, you take one hair out of the box and you eat it.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 You stop bringing stuff down.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You're like, "Ding it. I'm not doing this love spell. That was too gross."

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You already told me to break into this person's house.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I never said break in.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I'm assuming you're their friend already, but you want it to be more.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It doesn't make it less creepy.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 But I'm assuming you're not just like sneaking in while they're gone.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 You dig up the box on the waning gibbous night.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 So you bury it on the waning crescent.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 You dig it up on the waning gibbous night.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 You take one hair out of the box and you eat it while you say their name three times,

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 holding their photo or the personal item to your heart.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So you go, "Um, num, num."

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 You don't make those noises otherwise you're going to fall in love with grimace.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But you eat the hair and then you say the person's name over and over again.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And then you bury the box again.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And then you repeat it on the waxing gibbous lunar cycle.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 You dig the box up. Now there's two hairs in it.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 You eat one of them. Do the same thing.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Hold the item in your heart.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Don't say, "Nom, num, num." Say their name three times.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And then you do it a last time on the waxing crescent night of the moon cycle.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 That's it. That's the love spell that Jerry found on the export.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Fairly simple, right?

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 You guys are all taking notes.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And then you gave up when I said you had to eat human hair.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Jerry's story goes, "I found this ritual and this is what happened.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I found this back like in 2008 and it worked.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I didn't have a belly full of hair.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 It took more than three times.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I coughed up a hairball by the end of it.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I had to do it for four months, but no, he says that it worked.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 He got the girl he was after.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And he goes, "The sex was really good,

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 but there was no, like, love there.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 There was no love there."

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And eventually she cheated on him and he just moved on with his life.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But then six months later, she comes back into his life and he's like, "Ah, you know, whatever."

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So for on and off they have this relationship. It's purely sex. There's nothing more to it.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So he moves on again, meets another woman, gets married.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Yesterday he posted this. He said, "On June 26th, 2021,

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 out of the blue he gets a text from this girl.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 She goes, "I don't know. There seems to be a connection between me and you.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I feel like part of me is still entangled in your lower intestine."

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 He's like, "Ah."

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 She texts him out of the blue. She's totally in love with him.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 She's totally in love with him all this time later.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 She's wanting to come over and he's like, "I'm married.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I live with my wife and he's basically, he's TLDR.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Don't mess with this stuff."

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 That fascinating story, that's it, really.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But this is one of the stories that we can extrapolate a lot of stuff from.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Yesterday's episode of talking about a man who murdered two women,

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 it just happened last year. I found that story the same day I found this story.

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 I was like, "Dude, export is really kicking in the gear the other day."

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So I'm reading these both at the same time.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Yesterday's episode was about a man who murdered two women so he could win the lottery.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 He didn't. He didn't win the lottery. He did kill the two women.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 He's on trial right now.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 So yeah, it's just, the love spells themselves are interesting.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Like this is an incredibly simple spell versus trying to win the Mega Millions.

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Trying to win the Mega Millions.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And I wonder why love spells are so easy to perform and they do tend to work.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 My personal hypothesis is that everyone wants to love and be loved.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And so you're tapping into something that's totally natural.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Being a millionaire, being a mega millionaire, isn't natural in the modern world.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 It's nice, but there's no equivalent to it in nature.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Money is a man-made construct.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 But love is something like even a little goat.

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Even a little goat.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And we cover that story about the goat and the dog. They're buddies.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Everything has a need to love, to give love, and to be loved.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And so a love spell seems to tap into that super quickly.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 But I will say this, like this story I believe that Jerry, I mean, you could totally be making it up, right?

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And then Jerry's having a good laugh and that's fine too.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 But I do believe that this story or stories like this are possible.

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Because love spells are very, very simple. Very dangerous, like he says.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Like now this story is as recent as June 26th and this woman's trying to get a hold of him.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 She wants to continue this fiery passion.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And here's the thing, most love spells don't have an off switch.

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 That's part of the problem because you're tapping into something that's so primal.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 There's no way to shut it off.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And he's moved on and he's married and this woman is most likely going to show up and start causing static at the house.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And he'll have to make a decision.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 He can cheat on his wife, which is not advisable. That's not the good decision.

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Or not. I guess that's the only decision, right? It's not like this one.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 But what if she's crazy? What if she comes after him with an axe or something like that? Who knows?

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Love spells, very simple to do.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 There are a dime a dozen. You can find them all over the internet.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Most of them are false. I don't know if this one's true.

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 But don't mess around with love spells.

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I don't think I've talked that much about my magic past.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I mentioned it here and there. I did an episode where I fought a witch.

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I think that's kind of where I covered it the most.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 But yeah, interesting stuff nonetheless. Thank you, anonymous user on export.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I really, really enjoyed that story.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Evan, let's go ahead and call in the Garmenter Coptor.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I'm going to toss you those keys here and I'm sitting there.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I'm eating a plate of spaghetti. You're like, that's weird. Where'd you get?

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Where'd you get the plate of spaghetti? It's human hair.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I'm like, oh, mom, mom, mom, mom.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Everyone will love me soon enough.

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Evan jumps out. Evan bails out of the helicopter. It's on autopilot.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 No, he sticks around. He's no coward.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Even though now he's strangely in love with me.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Evan, go ahead and fly us on out to Kings Mountain, North Carolina.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 But as we're flying out there, dude, I saw a movie the other day that I'm going to put on Dead Rabbit Recommends.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I 100% recommend that it's only a half hour long.

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I can't even tell you the plot. You just got to trust me.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Well, let me back up. You got to trust me.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 You got to trust me and trust me when I say this is one of the most distressing movies I have seen in a long time.

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 It's free. It's 29 minutes long. It won't take up most of your day.

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 But you will spend most of your day thinking about it.

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I'm not going to give any warnings because that will spoil the plot.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 I will say this. If you are a sensitive soul, do not watch this movie.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Do not watch The Strange Thing About the Johnsons.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The Strange Thing About the Johnsons is the first film.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I think he made it another short before this, but this was the film that got him deals in Hollywood.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 When I'm saying him, I'm talking about director and writer Ari Aster.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 He made Hereditary, which I didn't really enjoy. Very well-made movie. Great acting.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Some of the best acting I've seen in a horror movie, honestly. Great cast.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 But I didn't like it. The thing is, when you watch Hereditary, after the movie, after all the secrets have been revealed,

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 you start to reflect on it and you go, "Wah, well, I mean, then, like, if that...

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 If everything was planned out, they knew she was going to eat the peanut, and they knew she was going to eat the peanut here,

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 because then this had to happen here, and then this person showed up."

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And so either the characters had no agency, because there was this prophecy, so really they made no decisions.

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Everything was guided out for them, or this super secret group could plan out when someone ate a peanut.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Do you think that doesn't make any sense? Is that an analogy? No.

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 A big part of it is about eating peanuts, but beautifully shot movie. Great casting.

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I just wasn't a huge fan of it overall.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 So, and I didn't watch Midsummer, because I didn't really like Hereditary, and I watched the trailer for Midsummer,

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 and I go, "Cool, it's the Wicker Man." And that's apparently what it is, for the most part.

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 So, when I found out that Ari Aster had made a short film that really propelled him into the sights of big studios,

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I wanted to check it out, because that was my big thing. I always talk about the guy who directed the Spider-Man movies.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Got his start, he made a short film on YouTube called Clown. It was a fake movie trailer.

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Eli Rothsot was super impressed, got him to make a movie, a full-length movie called Clown, which was okay.

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 The last 20 minutes were really good, but everything was, the concept was great.

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And then next thing you know, he does Spider-Man trilogy, so I love seeing that.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 That's why I'm always pushing you guys to do stuff too, because it's those little things.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 You can't get to the big thing unless you do the little thing, so we got to do the little things.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So, I wanted to check this out, right? But again, I wasn't a huge fan of hereditary, you know, but I still want to see what was all about.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 The strange thing about The Johnsons is one of the most distressing movies that I've seen in any recent memory.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 An unlike hereditary. When you watch The Strange Thing About The Johnsons and you go, "Well, wait a second,

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I wonder if," and you start to try to fill in the gaps with your mind, it gets worse.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Right? Like, the stuff he doesn't show is more disturbing than the stuff he shows, and the stuff he shows is super gross.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I'll do an audio--here's basically my audio commentary for the whole movie.

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Oh, what?

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Ah...wait, huh?

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Oh...dude...

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Wait, oh, no.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Ugh...there you go, that was pretty much it.

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Imagine that spread out over 29 minutes. That was basically like one scene.

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 You'd be like, "You'd have all those emotions. There are a couple times you'll chuckle, and some people classify it as a comedy."

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Like, some people say it's deeply satirical. I find it incredibly distressing.

252
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 There are a couple times where there's just moments. Horror and comedy are very closely intertwined.

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 This isn't like scary movie rights, not like guys are tripping down the stairs.

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 But there's one or two moments where you do kind of laugh.

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 If you guys watch that, you guys are going to be like, "Dude, I have no idea what fart you're talking about when you're laughing."

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 If you are not--if you are--trust me, dude, if you are a sensitive soul, do not watch this movie.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I watched this movie a couple days ago. I've been waiting to record this segment.

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Like, I--it's such a distressing and dark movie that it's close to cursed.

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Like, it's stuck in my head. But Ari Aster, amazing job. The cast is really, really good.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 He can really pull performances out of actors.

261
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And a cool little trivia note. The--one of the characters in this movie was actually in one of my favorite movies of all time,

262
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 "The Evil Within," which if you ever watch any movie that Dead Rabbit recommends, "The Evil Within" is still, I think, one of the best independent horror movies ever made.

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Like, I still think about that movie constantly.

264
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 I'll put that in the show notes as well. "Watch The Evil Within." But anyway, season that movie as well.

265
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But it's very distressing. It's very dark.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And you'll watch it, and it will probably upset you.

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Or laugh for you and chuckle it a couple of times.

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 But yeah, if you're not a sensitive--I don't want to say anything else because I don't want to give away any plots.

269
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 You have to go and blind to this movie.

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 You are warned. This movie is close to cursed. It will distress you.

271
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 So don't watch it before you go to a--don't watch it before you go to a social gathering.

272
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Or you're going to a party or something like that because you'll just be standing off--you'll be staring off into the corner.

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And people will be like, "Hey, dude, what's going on?" And you're like, "Uh, I think--I think the strange thing about the Johnson haunts me."

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 There's a Vimeo link and a YouTube link. You can watch it for free on either platform. I'm putting those in the show notes.

275
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Evan, let's go ahead and leave behind when we're watching the movie in the "Garbonic Doctor."

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Evan's closing his eyes. He's like, "I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it. I'm a sensitive soul."

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 He crashes the carbonic doctor. We are now at Kings Mountain in North Carolina.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I got a lot of this information from a website called ThisIsWhyWeStand.net.

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 I think it's like a military historical website, but very, very well-written article about the Battle of Kings Mountain.

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And when I came across this story, I thought, if ghost exists, if any ghost stories are real, this story is real.

281
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It's May 1780. The Revolutionary War between the American colonies and Britain is on.

282
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 [imitates gunshot]

283
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Load 'em up, boys! [imitates gunshot]

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Actually, at this point, the British are winning the war. They've conquered Georgia. They've taken South Carolina. They're making major inroads into North Carolina.

285
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Things are not looking good for the colonies. And in May of 1780, on the border of North Carolina and Virginia, 350 Virginians are massacred by British troops.

286
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 People were begging for their lives, and the British were like, "Nope, shooting them dead, adults and children getting slaughtered."

287
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And this is the type of thing that can either break the will of the people, or unite them.

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 In North Carolina, one of the military leaders for the British was Major Patrick Ferguson.

289
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 He had an army of soldiers, as well as what were known as "Loyal Americans," which today would basically be an American.

290
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 But back then, they were colonists who were loyal to the British.

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 So, Loyal Americans actually fought for the British, and American volunteers as well.

292
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 So, he had a fighting force of British soldiers, as well as colonists on his side.

293
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 And he was marching through North Carolina, and he warned the people, "You guys need to stop this rebellion. We're going to destroy everything in our path."

294
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And they'd already done this. They'd already killed these 350 people. He wasn't part of that.

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 But the message was very clear. The British government was not going to cease. They were this empire. They were THE empire.

296
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And who were these colonists? They were just going to destroy...

297
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 They would rather burn everything down than lose this battle.

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 But because of this war crime, and others, obviously it wasn't the only war crime,

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 but you saw colonists finally realizing we have to fight, they're going to kill us if we don't.

300
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 They're going to kill us if we do, and we lose, but they're just slaughtering civilians at this point.

301
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 On September 25th, 1780, 840 colonists, known as "over-mountainmen."

302
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 I think nowadays they're just mountainmen. They don't go over them. They just hang on to the bottom.

303
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Basically, frontiersmen. Raggedy old hermets who shoot stuff for food, right?

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I guess that's how they all got their food back. Then I guess they were slaughtering cows,

305
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 but people who live in the wilderness, they know the wilderness, and that's how they eat.

306
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 They're eating bark of trees, "um, num, num." See someone else shoot a squirrel? You're like, "Oh, I should do that."

307
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 This is their land. Well, technically it's the natives, but right now, they're there.

308
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 The over-mountainmen, there's 840 of them, they begin to, they decide to take the battle to Ferguson.

309
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And Ferguson gets word that there is this massive militia. He has 1100 men.

310
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 So 840, that's pretty even odds, and these people know the lay of the land.

311
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So Ferguson decides to make his stand at King's Mountain. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's a mountain.

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 But this mountain also has a bunch of craggly rocks at the top, which is a perfect, it's basically described as almost like a castle fortification.

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 You can hide behind these huge jagged rocks, open fire, they're going to have a really hard time shooting you.

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Any places that were a little more exposed, they put their supply wagons there.

315
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 The mountain man militia is headed their way. Ferguson goes, "We'll make our stand at King's Mountain."

316
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 He then sends out two messengers, their brothers actually. James and Douglas Duncan.

317
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 He says, "You guys need to go to General Cornwallis for reinforcements."

318
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 He hesitated because he didn't remember Cornwallis was a general, I'm pretty sure he was a general, Brigadier General.

319
00:20:47,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 "Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop

320
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Let's stop by this little tavern and let's get some refreshing beverages. So these two British soldiers walking on a bar. This isn't a joke. This is not a joke.

321
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It's going to turn out to be an incredibly bad decision. Apparently, the British troops were wearing clothes similar to the loyal Americans.

322
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 They had on their British uniforms, but on top of that, they would have on these long shirts, these long like, like the shirts you would see in like a David Bowie show, like the leather shirt with the fringes.

323
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So they weren't so conspicuous. They weren't walking around in these giant red outfits with these hats, but they wore the big giveaway.

324
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 The big giveaway is the British accents, right? They go into this bar. They're wearing like leather jackets, but underneath them, you can clearly see like these brass buttons sticking out of it.

325
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Bright red collar. They go in there like two of your finest ales, Barwench. And it's actually some big burly guys like, you call me a Barwench one more time.

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 They're at this tavern and again, like it's a it's a revolutionary war. So it's not like everyone in America is on the side of the rebels.

327
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 They're working with a bunch of Americans who want the British to succeed.

328
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 So they're not really thinking they go into this bar in North Carolina where war crime has been committed to a couple months earlier.

329
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 These two brothers are brutally murdered in this bar. They're slaughtered, because the people in this bar were not loyal Americans.

330
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 They were loyal to America. October 7th, 1780.

331
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 The Mountain Man forces now are 1400 men, right? They started off with 840 and other people are like, hey, what's going on over there?

332
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And you see 840 hillbillies walking through the woods? Hey, Mom, I'm going to go join them hillbillies. Be back by sunset, Joey.

333
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 They're walking. They just walked and walked and walked. They said that they were they didn't stop. These were men on a mission because they knew where these British troops were.

334
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 They get to the bottom of King's Mountain and it's a firefight. It's a firefight. You have 1400 people at the bottom of a mountain.

335
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 You have 1100 at the top. Any other location, any other fighting force, the British probably would have been able to hold out for a long time.

336
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 They're waiting for the reinforcements. They're like, we sent those guys out for reinforcements like two weeks ago. No one's ever come back.

337
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 But they're fighting mountain men. And when you think of a mountain, right? Like normally when you think of a mountain, or maybe this is just me, because I only see them in cartoons, it's like a giant rock in the middle of the landscape.

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 But this mountain, it was a mountain. They did have a high ground, but every every three feet going up this mountain, there was giant trees and goalies and like big rocks.

339
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And the British troops, because some of them survived, were at the top of King's Mountain and they see this army of 1400 ragged old hillbillies at the bottom of this mountain.

340
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And they start shooting. They start shooting. They're like, oh, we have the high ground. They'll never get us. It's not like they have air superiority, right?

341
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 They don't have to worry about mortars or anything like that. But then they start to realize that these hillbillies, these mountain men walk a couple feet up, take shot, and then hide behind a tree.

342
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And reload on their gun. And the British are like, oh, well, he'll pop back out from behind that tree, right? But then he just runs to another tree, takes a shot from that tree, and reloads.

343
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Then he runs to another tree, takes a shot from that tree, multiply that by 1400 people. And they're watching, they're surrounded.

344
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 They're watching these people creep up the mountain. They'll shoot, run to another tree. There's just a barrage of gunfire.

345
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 They have no clean shots of these people. And these mountain men are getting closer and closer to the top of the mountain. This is their home. This is where they're from.

346
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 The British troops are like, great. This is not going in well. But eventually reinforcements are right around the corner. They're looking. They've seen this little corner there.

347
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Oh, man. Eventually they are able to get to the top of the mountain and they encircle them and just annihilate the British troops.

348
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 It is a massacre. There is a quote we got from a rifleman named James Collins.

349
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 "On examining the dead body of their great chief, it appeared that almost 50 rifles must have been leveled at him at the same time. Seven rifle balls had passed through his body. Both of his arms were broken, and his hat and clothing were literally shot to pieces."

350
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 He was on a horse by the way. They don't say what happened to the horse. Remember the loyal Americans and even the British troops were dressed in the American garb. They were wearing the long coats and they were wearing the wide brimmed hats.

351
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 The people at the bottom of the hill were dressed the same. Now that was totally fine when one person's at the bottom of the hill and one person's at the top of the hill. You know who's on your side.

352
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 As they start getting closer and you're going to have around 2,000 people at the top of this mountain shooting at each other, they have to figure out a way. I can barely figure out who to shoot in battlefield, right?

353
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 My guys have gamer tags and the other team doesn't. They're in this battle to be able to tell each other apart. The loyal Americans up at the top of the mountain, they took twigs, they took branches and stuck them in their hat.

354
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 So if you see someone with a branch in your hat, that's you. That's one of your guys. The people at the bottom, the mountain men, they took little slips of paper, little white piece of paper, put it in their hat.

355
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 "How, dude? So many people must have gotten blown away by the wrong side." They're not looking for that. It already takes you 2 minutes to load your gun, right? And then you're like twig twig twig twig paper.

356
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And then you have the paper in your head and you're like, "Dang it! I got him confused again." Could you imagine being in a battle of 2,000 people?

357
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Half of them are you, half of them is the other side, and you guys all look the same. You guys are literally wearing the same uniform.

358
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 When they shot Ferguson off his horse, he was wearing the long shirt and the hat as well, but he had his British uniform on underneath.

359
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And the bullets just... a gun didn't even shoot that fast back then. There was no machine gun, but somehow they still made that noise.

360
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 The loyal Americans began to surrender to the mountain men. Didn't matter. Now was another war crime. They just began assassinating these surrendering troops until eventually cooler heads prevailed and they're like, "Okay, yeah, you have to put your gun down. Put your gun down.

361
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 I know he has a twig in his hat, but that's not how we do things. The British, between their own forces, between the loyal Americans and the American volunteers, lost 225 people.

362
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 The mountain men, 28. I mean a total route and 700 prisoners were taken by the mountain men as well.

363
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 This battle was so... we're getting into the ghost thing, right? You're like checking your watch and you're like, "Oh, I didn't know I was... we're listening to the Wikipedia hour."

364
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 This battle was so instrumental in the defeat of the British. This battle showed that a ragtag militia could stomp across the state, walk up a mountain, and annihilate the enemy.

365
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Thomas Jefferson said of this battle, "That glorious victory was the joyful annunciation of that turn in the tide of success, which terminated the Revolutionary War."

366
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Even the other side, even the British, we have this quote from the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Henry Clinton, called... this is interesting because, you know, I'm an American and I see the Revolutionary War as good.

367
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 I've never heard it described as evil before, but British Commander-in-Chief, Sir Henry Clinton, he called it, quote, "the first link in a chain of evils that followed each other in regular succession until they at last ended in the total loss of America."

368
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It was just one year later from this battle, it completely turned the tide of the entire war, that the British lost the Americas.

369
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 King's Mountain was one of the most, if not the most pivotal battle of the Revolutionary War.

370
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 So let's go back to these brothers. These brothers who were sent to get reinforcements and instead got a delicious cold beverage.

371
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 I found the story of the brothers. They weren't mentioned in the article about this is why we stand.

372
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I found the story of the brothers from the National Directory of Haunted Places, which is one of my favorite books, I'll put it in the show notes.

373
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I was going through it the other day and I found this story about James and Douglas Duncan.

374
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 To this day, if any ghost story is real, this one, I read this ghost story and I thought this is, this would make so much sense if ghosts are real, this has to be real.

375
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 To this day, when you're traveling through the area of Salisbury in North Carolina, which is where King's Mountain is, which is the path they took to go to get reinforcements,

376
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 you can be traveling down King's Mountain Road, you may see two ghostly spirits, British soldiers, riding their Phantom horses down the road.

377
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Their once bright red British uniforms are now soiled in mud and in blood.

378
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Their skin is rotten, it's green, and they ride past you on their horses with hollow sunken eyes, looking for help.

379
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 They're galloping off towards a place they can never reach.

380
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Sometimes you'll see the figures off their horses.

381
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 You'll see two soldiers with a map laid out on a rock, and they're steady in this crude piece of parchment, trying to figure out which way to go.

382
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Eternally lost, eternally damned.

383
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 They may not know the war is over, they're playing out their final moments, they may not even know that they're dead, but their phantoms rot and mold and decay.

384
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 But they're still trying to find their way off of King's Mountain.

385
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 They're still trying to find hope, help, reinforcements.

386
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 But these things no longer exist for the Duncan Brothers.

387
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 We cover stories about ghosts that have died tragic deaths.

388
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 We cover stories about ghosts who have a mission left on earth, so that's where they're still hanging around.

389
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 These two ghosts not only caused the death of 225 of their brothers in arms, and the imprisonment of 700 more, these spirits caused an empire to fall.

390
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 These two men were on a mission and they were murdered, and because of that, an entire nation broke its shackles from British rule.

391
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 If any ghost is tormented, it would be these two.

392
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 They had one job to do, and they failed.

393
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So now they will wander through King's Mountain for eternity, trying to find redemption.

394
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 But it is always just a little farther down the road.

395
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
