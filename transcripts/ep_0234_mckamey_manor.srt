1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 Oh, hey, I didn't see you there. Hi, my name is Jason Carpenter and welcome to a special

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,600
 episode of Dead Reparator. Actually, it's not special. I was doing something else. I forgot

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,920
 I was recording, but let's go ahead and roll with this. So, what are we -- oh, yes. Spiritual

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:23,960
 healers, counselors of the cloth, men of faith are all people that we tend to put our trust

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,200
 into, but what happens when those people push the trust a little too far? And then we take

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:36,800
 a look at the extreme haunted house known as McKamey Manor. People say it's a great

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
 thrill ride. It's an adrenaline rush. You go in, you don't know what's going to happen

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,040
 to you. It is the scariest haunted house you can ever go into. However, others believe

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,720
 it may actually be a cover for the production of snuff films today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:03,560
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,920
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Oh, you guys are having a great day too. I'm going

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,000
 to play again. I'm in another play and I don't even know why I signed up for it. It's actually

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,200
 like a Shakespeare showcase, so I have to be Lord Capulet. I've done that role before.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,360
 I have to be Pyramus, aka Bottom. I always find that name so funny. Pyramus in A Midsummer's

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,840
 Night Dream, which I've done that before, not Bottom, but I was Demetrius in that. And

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,120
 then I'm some dude named Lucius or Lactaceous or something from Hamlet. It's a short scene.

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,480
 It's all short stuff. But anything that I have to remember aligns and do a weekly television

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,040
 show, daily podcast. I don't know why I decided to sign up for it. Actually, I do know why,

19
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,560
 because there's going to be hot chicks in the audience. Girls love Shakespeare. So there

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,440
 is a reason why I'm doing it. But the show's like in 20 days. And I have one monologue

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,440
 remembered, the monologue I did in Romeo and Juliet when I was Lord Capulet. So let's go

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,560
 ahead though and move on to our stories here. I'll try not to pay attention to the script

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,280
 that's sitting on my feet from me. Let's go ahead and move on to a couple of interesting

24
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,280
 stories. Now, as first one, I just read about maybe 40 minutes ago. And it's funny, the

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,080
 way the show works, it's pretty liquid. A lot of stuff can kind of bump other stuff out

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,560
 of the way. I'll have certain stories ready to go and I'll be like, "No, this one, this

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,760
 one's fresh in my mind. It's interesting. Let's dig into it." Let's go ahead and hop

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,560
 in the Jason Jalopy because we're driving all the way from Oregon to Linden, New Jersey.

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,440
 We should put a cassette deck into the Jason Jalopy. Play copyright free music. But anyways,

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,000
 until we do that, you know even copyright free music can get you in trouble because

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,720
 at some point someone can go, "Nah, I don't want it to be copyright free anymore." And

32
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,600
 then they copyright it, the producer will copyright it, and then stuff gets taken down.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,960
 It's totally tricky to do stuff like that. But anyways, we're in the Jason Jalopy, we're

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,520
 listening to the sounds of nature, which actually is copy written as well. You just can't play

35
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,920
 sounds of nature. Birds and stuff. You know, tweet, tweet, tweet. We're driving to New

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,760
 Jersey. We're there. We're in the town of Linden, New Jersey. And there we meet Reverend

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,400
 Dr. William Weaver. I actually had that question about is Martin Luther King Dr. Martin Luther

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,960
 King or Dr. Reverend? This guy let me know. He's Reverend Dr. William Weaver. Presbyterian

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,760
 minister. 69 years old, old chap. He's definitely a pillar of the community of Linden. He's

40
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,040
 been a Presbyterian minister for a long time. Don't have that written down in my notes,

41
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,200
 but just imagine a long time. He's been a chaplain of the hospital. He's been the chaplain

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,720
 for the local police department. It's a small town, 40,000 people. So quite a small little

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,640
 burb, burg, I mean. And when you're, you know, my father was a minister. When I was growing

44
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
 up, my father was a minister. So a big part of the job isn't just like preaching, doing

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
 sermons. A big part of the job is counseling, family counseling, marriage counseling, and

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,920
 then one-on-one counseling. But we, you would have people who, who not necessarily would

47
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,040
 come over to the hospital, but call it all hours and saying, Hey, I need some help with

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,320
 something. My dad would be like, Yeah, you know, it's part of the job. So Dr. William

49
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,360
 Weaver, Reverend Dr. William Weaver, he doesn't even enjoy that distinction. We'll just call

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,440
 him Willie. So Willie has this same thing where he basically has to be a spiritual counselor

51
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,680
 to all of these people. But he mixed it with a little bit of spiritualism. He said he was

52
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,560
 like one eighth Indian. So he had a little bit of these spiritual powers in him. Now,

53
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
 he wasn't very open about that with this main congregation, but he told a couple people

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,880
 about it. And so when they came to him with particularly troubling problems, the death

55
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,480
 of a loved one, a traumatic event, he would say, Come over to my house and I'll get this

56
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,760
 out of you. I'll get the demons out of you. Cause what, that's what it is. You got these

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,520
 demons in you, son. It's always a dude. Always a dude. He's saying this to, so that should

58
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,440
 give you an idea of where this is going. Son, you got, you got demons in you. You got demons

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,480
 that only Willie can get out. So what he would do is he would bring you over to his house

60
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,440
 and say, Okay, first step, have you ever heard about the armor of God? And it's so funny

61
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,120
 because we talked about the armor of God, like maybe like four or five episodes ago,

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,140
 but then this story came up today. He talks about the armor of God and he recites this

63
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,600
 Bible verse, put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the

64
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,480
 devil's schemes. And then he kind of pauses for a second. Then he goes, You can take your

65
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,920
 shirt off now. What? He's like, Yes, yes, take your shirt off now as I'm reciting the rest

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,880
 of this Bible verse for our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers,

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,080
 against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world. And okay, now take your

68
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,760
 pants off. You can set your shoes in the corner. Just take, just take it all off. The spiritual

69
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,180
 forces of evil in the heavenly realms, therefore put on the full armor of God. Yeah. Okay,

70
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,260
 no, no, you don't want to keep your boxers on. Yeah, you got to take those off for this

71
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:03,060
 tort. Taking them off. Okay, good. So with that, when the day of evil comes, you will be able

72
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,940
 to stand your ground. And after you have done everything to stand. But actually, I want

73
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,340
 you to lay down. Okay, so you're totally making your laying down in my dark room. Yeah, no,

74
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,320
 we're not in the church. It's not a normal traditional counseling session, but young

75
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:24,440
 man lay down in the dark. So he would have these men strip naked and put a gem on each

76
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,760
 like put like a gem on their hand on each hand and then a gem on each foot and then

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,040
 an angel coin on their head and go listen. If you move and one of these gems fall off

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,600
 of you, the demons are going to get you. Now at this point, you're thinking, Okay, if this

79
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,740
 was going on with you, you would say this is this is hogwash. I'm not doing any of this.

80
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,860
 I'm not stripping naked. You're you're this is weird. I'm out. But he was focusing on

81
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:58,580
 young men like in their 20s or 30s who mostly in their 20s who who were suffering horrible

82
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,180
 calamities. Death of loved one one guy lost the loved one and his father within a course

83
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,260
 of like a year or something like that just really kind of shattering you type of stuff.

84
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,080
 One guy saw a dead kid floating down the river and just kind of get it out of his head and

85
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,520
 someone goes, why don't you go talk to Reverend Weaver? He's really good at helping people

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,040
 get through stuff. He goes like, Yeah, I just can't sleep. I just picture this 12 year old

87
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,280
 boy dead 12 year old boy fall. So you're looking for an answer and you meet someone who at first

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,040
 he would be very friendly just like all predators very friendly and give you really good advice.

89
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,320
 But then he started to convince you there were demons inside of you and you needed the

90
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,380
 armor of God on you. But first we need to get the demons out of you. So putting the

91
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,860
 gems on your hands, put the coin on your forehead and he's like, Okay, I'm going to take this

92
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,100
 feather and I'm going to run it from your forehead to your stomach and the gems can't

93
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,260
 fall off. Otherwise the demons are going to get you. And he would do that for a while

94
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,060
 and then he'd be like, Ah, okay, good. I was able to work all the demons down. I was able

95
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,100
 to work all the demons in your body down to one as part of your body. And now I just have

96
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,840
 to do an exorcism and get them out. Don't move those gems though, because that's part

97
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,080
 of the containment. And I'm going to give you I'm going to exercise you by giving you

98
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,320
 a blow job. And then he would give these dudes blow jobs and then spit the semen into a ziploc

99
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,520
 bag and seal it up and go the demon is trapped. You can leave now I got the demon out of

100
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,800
 you son and then the guys would say I felt really odd. It seemed really awkward. But

101
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,700
 at a certain point I didn't know what to do. And then generally like a month or two later,

102
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,560
 they'd see a willy walking down the street and he'd be like son, son, I just had a vision.

103
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,000
 I just had a vision. You got possessed by a demon last night. You got to come over to

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,360
 my house. Got to come over to my house now. The demons are going to get you. Now this went

105
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,040
 on from 1999 to about 2016 and it wasn't the same. The same dude didn't keep getting blow

106
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,560
 jobs given to him. It wasn't like he was a constant victim, but his spread of victims,

107
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,060
 they can date him as far back as 1999. Three people have come forward and said he did this

108
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,800
 to me and they all described the exact same thing. They said I was at my lowest point.

109
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,080
 This guy was supposed to be a spiritual leader. Gave me a blow job trying to get a demon out

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,640
 of me. One guy said, I'm sorry to laugh, but one guy said, because the reason why I'm laughing

111
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,080
 because it's just such a cheap magician's gimmick. One guy said that after he gave me a blow

112
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,480
 job, he then like made a little metal ball appear in his hand and goes this was inside

113
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,200
 of you and it got it out through your penis. It's just like such a cartoon magic trick.

114
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,840
 I sure at that point the guy was probably questioning him being like, yo, why you got

115
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,720
 to keep giving me blow jobs. One guy said, again, they're thinking logically. They might

116
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,280
 not be acting logically in the moment, but one of them said, do you do the same exorcism

117
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:55,480
 to women? Willie goes, women, gross. No, I didn't do that. Willie said, no, no, no, no,

118
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:02,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

119
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

120
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

121
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

135
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

136
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

137
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

138
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:21,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

139
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:28,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

140
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

141
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,480
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

142
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,480
 I may fall victim to that crime, but I'm not going to fall victim, I hope I wouldn't fall victim to the crime of being preyed upon by a spiritual leader.

143
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 I feel bad for these dudes, it's absolutely terrible, but they've all gone to the records with their names and they're like,

144
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,480
 "Yeah, this totally happened and it ruined my life and stuff like that. They want to get this information out there."

145
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,480
 So, yeah, weird, just a weird story, weird story to wake up to, but let's go ahead and move on to a request now.

146
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 This story is just as weird. I got this request a long time ago. I got this request on Twitter via slobbering demon,

147
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,480
 which is quite a fitting name, I guess not, there's really no demons in this story, but it's haunted house, so it is kind of, kind of,

148
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,480
 I have no idea what I'm saying. So, slobbering demon wrote me and said, "Hey, have you ever heard of Makame Manor?"

149
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:34,480
 I was like, "Yes." And then he, it wasn't a real-time conversation, I said that to myself as I read the email, I go, "Of course, slobbering demon."

150
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,480
 He goes, "Have you ever heard of Makame Manor?" He goes, "I think it might be a red room."

151
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,480
 Now, what a red room is, it's basically a live-streamed torture.

152
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,480
 So, this is an internet theory that's been going on for a long time, and generally a lot of times it's connected to ISIS.

153
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,480
 I guess I'm doing an episode on red rooms now too, it's connected to ISIS right now, but basically, I don't, okay,

154
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,480
 let me explain what they are and then I'll give you my feedback on it, but what happens is, ISIS or any other criminal organization

155
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:16,480
 takes a person, canaps a prisoner of war, normal person, whatever, puts them in a room that's painted red, or it's red because all the blood, who knows,

156
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:25,480
 but they're in this room and then you bid money saying, "For $10,000, I want to see that person's eyes put out with a power drill."

157
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 Or, "For $20,000, I want to see that person's genitals electrified till their head blows up."

158
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:40,480
 And the winning bid gets the death that they want, and everyone else is just, I've heard versions where everyone else just watches the death,

159
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 even if it's not the one they wanted, or you don't get to see the death unless you actually picked the one, paid the most for the one that the guy gets electrocuted and his head blows up.

160
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 So, that is a conspiracy theory that's been going around for a while. Recently, it's been connected to ISIS.

161
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,480
 Now, I looked into that, and that's actually the title of an old school Japanese horror movie called Red Room.

162
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 About four people, they're playing a game show, they're locked in the game show, and the only way to get out is to be the most brutal,

163
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 so I think it's two couples, a man and a wife and a man and a wife, and the review, I didn't see it.

164
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:18,480
 The reviews were like, it's just dumb, like it's not even that gory, or if it is that gory, it's just like shock gore.

165
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
 Like, you have to have gore with emotion, it just can't be people's eyeballs being popped out all day long.

166
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 There has to be some connection between the characters, otherwise then it's just a Friday the 13th movie.

167
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,480
 So, Red Room could be based on that movie, like that movie could have came out and someone created a conspiracy in real life about this,

168
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 but it was inspired by this movie.

169
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 The way that the Red Room was described to me, the way I just said it, where you, it's a particular room and people bid,

170
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 that's actually the plot for Hostel 3, which was awful.

171
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 On my movie review website, when that was still up, Video Vandals, I have a review of Hostel 3, it's one of, I love reading that review.

172
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,480
 I'm a sick of fan for myself, so anyways, I'll read that review and I'll laugh, because that movie is so bad.

173
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 But, I think that what happened with the idea of Red, now there could be something like Red Room's existing,

174
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,480
 but the live streaming of human torture and people getting killed and stuff like that, this is always the thing with the FBI,

175
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,480
 and I have to get to the McCamey Manor thing, so I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to do all this, because the Red Room stuff,

176
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 the thing with the FBI is their definition of snuff, a snuff film, their definition of snuff is so concise,

177
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,480
 that it basically makes it so it doesn't exist.

178
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 So, for example, the definition of a snuff film is a film that is made for the sake of commercial gain,

179
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,480
 which features the purposeful killing of a human being.

180
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 So, it doesn't include any video of people doing yard work and a lawn mower running over them as they're unaware,

181
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,480
 like digging through the ground and their husbands push their lawn mower, that's not covered at all.

182
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,480
 It doesn't cover movies that are made, like, what was it, a movie that had that Deadpool 2,

183
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,480
 where the stuntwoman was riding the motorcycle and her brains got bashed in in real life.

184
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
 It doesn't cover that.

185
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 It wouldn't cover, like, grumpy old men where there was like a boat jump.

186
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,480
 No, no, it wasn't grumpy old men, it was the one with Joe Pesci and...

187
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,480
 Who's the guy from Predator 2, the black dude? Glover? Danny Glover?

188
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,480
 The movie with Joe Pesci and Danny Glover, there is a scene in the movie where there's a boat stunt and a dude dies during the stunt in real life,

189
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,480
 and they kept the scene in the movie. That isn't covered as being a snuff film.

190
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,480
 It has to be a movie that features a person being killed on purpose for the sake of commercial gain.

191
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
 And the FBI did this huge investigation, they said snuff films do not exist.

192
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,480
 Yes, there are movies of people that are getting killed that are then sold to people because it's gross,

193
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,480
 like faces of death and stuff like that, but we have no proof that anyone has ever said we are going to make a movie,

194
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,480
 kill a person in that movie and release that movie all in like one action.

195
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,480
 Yes, people have filmed stuff where people have died and people have killed people and then sold it afterwards,

196
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,480
 but there's never been a snuff film made.

197
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,480
 Producers, directors, everyone gets together with the intent of killing people during the production of the film and that is the selling point.

198
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
 FBI says that doesn't exist.

199
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:37,480
 That's a super, super narrow definition of snuff films. It basically makes it so it's almost impossible to have a snuff film.

200
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,480
 You have to hit all those markers.

201
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,480
 But they set it up that way for a reason and it could be because otherwise in everything's a snuff film,

202
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,480
 every piece of footage of some guy getting hit by a bar train or getting stepped on by an elephant, then that's all snuff films.

203
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 So really they were looking at is like cannibal holocaust.

204
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,480
 Would a movie like that really exist where the producers are like, hey, let's hire all these actors, go out to the middle of nowhere,

205
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,480
 kill them off one by one, and then come back and sell the film and release it?

206
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,480
 I think that's another thing. It has to be released in some sort of fashion.

207
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 I don't think it can be for your own collection because then serial killers, I think that that's a different.

208
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,480
 It has to be for commercial gain. You have the purpose needs to be for making it.

209
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,480
 So all that being said, I think it's possible that something like Red Rooms exist.

210
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,480
 But I think that, one, I don't know how fast internet is in ISIS controlled territories.

211
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:41,480
 I don't know how they're able to have all this high, you'd have to have pretty high speed internet to do like internet wagering and then live video.

212
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:48,480
 And I don't know if they have that capability in ISIS, but I'm sure they have that capability in Eastern Europe or any other country in the world.

213
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,480
 Is it possible there's a place where you can bid on people to be executed or tortured and stuff like that? Sure, you sure.

214
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,480
 But Red Rooms may exist. I just don't think they are as a big a thing as people make them out to be.

215
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,480
 But let's go ahead and get into McKamey Manor here because what McKamey Manor is, it is known as an extreme haunted house.

216
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,480
 It's not like Boogeyman jumping out. You go there and they make you sign a waiver saying they can do whatever they want to you, right?

217
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,480
 And the rules have changed over the years, but if you can last 10 hours in this house, you can win $10,000.

218
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:32,480
 Now it used to be in San Diego, now it's moved to Tennessee and some other state, not Minnesota, some other state down south, Mississippi or something like that.

219
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,480
 So you go to this house and it's manned by a bunch of volunteers. No one gets paid to do this. It's opened every single weekend.

220
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:50,480
 The only payment you pay is a 50 pound bag of dog food and I've heard multiple versions of this because the guy who runs it, whose name is Russ McKamey,

221
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,480
 he either gives it to his dogs or he donates it to a charity, but anyway, so they take in no cash whatsoever.

222
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,480
 They're open every single weekend. They have two locations. They used to have just one. Now they have two locations in two other states.

223
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:12,480
 And you go there and they beat you up and they tie you up and they blindfold you and they throw you underwater and they choke you.

224
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:21,480
 They don't do that much anymore, but they used to choke you and they shave your head and shave your eyebrows and they basically like, "You're scum. You're scum. Just drown."

225
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:29,480
 They'll make you eat rotten food, throw up, they'll force you to throw up and you're just like, "No, I don't want to do it anymore. I don't want to do it anymore."

226
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 And he's like, "So I have to watch a bunch of videos of this stuff."

227
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:44,480
 And it's so, you know what's funny? I must say this too, from what I've read about Russ McKamey, and I could be wrong, but I think he is a type of guy like,

228
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 he's going to find this video, he's going to find this podcast and begin responding to it. He seems like the type of guy who's constantly doing Google searches for his own name

229
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:03,480
 and trying to control the narrative of any press that comes out about him. But anyways, with that disclaimer being said, the video is so stupid.

230
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,480
 Basically, it's, I think a lot of it's fake. I think most of it's actors.

231
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 Now of course, whenever people say that, he goes, "Maybe you should come to my house." If it is real, I don't want to come to your house and get slapped around for three hours.

232
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,480
 It's not entertaining to me. It's not entertaining for me to watch other people who are dumb enough to fall for that either. It may be true.

233
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,480
 And I would say it's probably a mix of some of the promotional videos are acting and then some of the videos are real.

234
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
 But I have no interest in paying someone to slap me around. I'm not into that stuff.

235
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
 I'm in no interest in watching other people getting slapped around because I'm not into that stuff either.

236
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:47,480
 But I watched maybe a total of maybe an hour of this guy's stuff. One video, the first 20 minutes, was people reading a contract as they're getting slapped in the face.

237
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 Now the reason why I think a lot, they always go, "It's just smoke and mirrors," because people complain and go, "You're torturing these people."

238
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,480
 And they're like, "It's just smoke and mirrors." That's a, which makes me think a lot of it's fake.

239
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,480
 Because here's the thing, they've been in operation for years and they've never once been successfully sued.

240
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:15,480
 Even though they have a video of people signing a waiver saying, "This is what's going to happen to me," and they're getting slapped and going, "Sign the waiver, sign the waiver."

241
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:26,480
 In any real court of law, if I went to sign a contract with Nike to sponsor my show and then I come out and I said, "Yeah, they slapped me around for three hours while I was reading their contract."

242
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:34,480
 That contract is null and void in any real world scenario that would not fly. You can't sign contracts under duress.

243
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,480
 But I'll have a bunch of videos in the links, and thank you Slavery and Daemon for the recommendation. I'll have a bunch of videos in the links, but I mean, they're just boring.

244
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:51,480
 Like, I thought it would at least be a little titillating, because sometimes when I'm watching a horror movie, I'm like, "Oh, you know, there's just kind of hot chicks being chased down the hallway by the guy with an axe."

245
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,480
 There's something that might sound brutal, but it's this drama, it's this intense thriller moment.

246
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:07,480
 But watching a real live, like if I had to watch a blonde woman sit there and get smacked by a guy who is like torturing her, I don't find that titillating at all.

247
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:15,480
 Like, in that same scene, if I was watching a video and it's like, you know, viewer discretion beware, a woman gets chopped up with axe by a seer.

248
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,480
 I don't want to watch that video. I'll watch the movie, the fictional version of it. I don't want to watch it in real life. That's not titillating to me.

249
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:36,480
 So this is kind of in between where it's like shot with really good high definition cameras and like everything really pops, but it's just people just going "bleh, blah, blah," and then getting slapped in the face for an hour.

250
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 So but here's the question. How do they afford to do this?

251
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,480
 So the Slaughtering Demon goes, they have an unknown source of revenue. And Slaughtering Demon's theory was this.

252
00:24:47,480 --> 00:25:01,480
 That it may be some sort of real life red room or snuff light where people contact Russ and say, "I want to see a young woman have duct tape wrapped around her face and dipped in the water a couple times.

253
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,480
 I'll pay you $10,000 to give me that footage." Because he records everything. Everything.

254
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:14,480
 Everything is recorded and that's part of the thing they say on their website. Everything will be recorded. And I understand from a legal standpoint, you want it all recorded.

255
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 But also if you're a fetishist or if you're selling this stuff to fetish people, then you're basically, that's how you'll make your money.

256
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 Because his place gets paid in 50 pound bags of dog food. It costs nothing to do it and they're all volunteers who work there, but you still have to pay rents on these locations and property taxes and stuff like that.

257
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:46,480
 So where is this stuff coming from? The theory that's been going around is that he sells the video to people. Some people personally request certain pieces of video.

258
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:57,480
 Some people say, "I want to see three blondes." Let me tell you this too. I don't want to like shame anyone in these videos, but I was expecting the people to be running this stuff to be a lot hotter.

259
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:11,480
 They just look like normal people because again in my brain in horror movies it's hot girls being attacked by monsters, not the librarian. The librarian's assistant.

260
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:22,480
 But anyways, not even hot enough to be the sexy librarian. He's just a librarian's assistant. Anyways, that's a side note. I lost so many subscribers yesterday and I can't figure out why, but I guess I want to lose more today.

261
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,480
 What was I talking about? Oh yes, yes, yes. So is he getting money from people who are requesting this stuff?

262
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,480
 Now, I started looking into that and again I tried to look it all over. I could not figure out how this guy makes any money. So that's definitely a possibility.

263
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:47,480
 I was also going with the idea of maybe it's a setup for a snuff film, but the problem is there's not a bunch of missing people around where these places are at.

264
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:55,480
 I think that would be a lot harder to hide because he hasn't been investigated by the IRS. The IRS was like, "Hey, you owe us all this back tax."

265
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,480
 And that's one of the reasons why he left San Diego. There's a couple reasons he left San Diego, but so government agencies have looked into him.

266
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 People have complained to the police saying, "Hey, I went to this place and I got beat up." And the cops go, "Well, you signed a waiver."

267
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:20,480
 But again, I can't imagine that the cops would see that video and go, "Oh, he got beat up." And I also can't imagine that Russ is so powerfully connected to the police like he has him on their dole.

268
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:28,480
 But the police are pretty, I think again, most of it's fake. I think that the stuff that isn't fake is smoke and mirrors.

269
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,480
 At one point they're like, "Shave your head! Shave your head! Shave your head!" And they gave her like a dole set of clippers.

270
00:27:35,480 --> 00:28:05,480
 And it's like, "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

271
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 And she's like popping out. It's like her daughter shaved her head while she was sleeping.

272
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,480
 She's like, "Eat!" Anyways, and she's like bawling my hair. My hair. And I'm thinking, "Your hair wasn't that good."

273
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,480
 You didn't have your hair. It wasn't that great to begin with, lady.

274
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,480
 But anyway, so a lot of it's psychological and it's just people getting slapped and stuff like that.

275
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,480
 I have no interest in it. It's not something that interests me at all. I'm not interested in watching it and stuff like that.

276
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 Do I think it's possible that someone from the outside is paying him to do this stuff? Yeah, definitely possible.

277
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,480
 Someone wants particular fetish footage of someone really freaking out. They could do that.

278
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,480
 What's weird is at the end of it, they go and they chill in his living room and everyone's like, "Yeah, man, that was pretty fun."

279
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,480
 And I was like, "Hah." They just went through like this horrible traumatic experience and now they're drinking Miller Lite and playing Mario Kart.

280
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,480
 It's just such a bizarre setup and I have a hard time taking any of it seriously.

281
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,480
 But it is possible that someone's requesting him to do particular stuff to particular people.

282
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,480
 I'm sure that worldwide footage of white people, like suburban white people being tortured, is quite rare.

283
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,480
 If you wanted to get footage of, you know, like cartel members getting tortured, just go to LiveLeak.

284
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,480
 But if you wanted footage of like suburban moms suffering, it's quite rare.

285
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,480
 I would believe that on the global market it'd be quite rare. So I'm sure you could get a pretty penny for that stuff.

286
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:35,480
 I've also heard that McKamey Manor has a live feed to a place in Las Vegas where everyone sits around and makes bids on how the people suffer,

287
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 which is the plot of Hostel 3, which again makes me think that the entertainment world and the real world keep intermixing.

288
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,480
 And I don't think Hostel 3 was based on anything real.

289
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:56,480
 I think stuff, people watched Hostel 3 and it was such an obscure film that they almost feel like it's easy to make connections to because it kind of sounds real.

290
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:04,480
 And no one saw Hostel 3 so it's not like they're saying, "Oh yeah, once I knew this guy, his aunt and uncle were killed and he had to go and run from the law."

291
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,480
 But he ended up running into a sister and her friend and they went on this big adventure together.

292
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,480
 They're just all over the place and eventually they ran into the cop who was chasing him. It turns out it was their dad.

293
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,480
 And you'd be like, "Isn't that the plot of the first two Star Wars movies?"

294
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:29,480
 I mean, the plot of Hostel 3 is so obscure that you could say it as it was factual and no one would call you on it because nobody saw it except me, the director and the editor.

295
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,480
 That's it. Places like McKamey Manor, that's actually not the only one that does these extreme haunts.

296
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,480
 It's one of the most visible ones. It's one of the most known ones.

297
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:53,480
 But these places do exist. And if they exist, it's only a small leap in logic to think that all the video footage they have isn't just for posterity or legal reasons or something like that.

298
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,480
 That this video footage is floating around out there.

299
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:14,480
 In those contracts, it would be interesting to see if they're part of the contract is we have the rights to show your video, image, your voice everywhere to transmit it globally like any sort of other contract involving audio or video footage.

300
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:27,480
 So the next time you think about going to one of these extreme haunts, one of these things that's going to push your mental endurance and see how well you would do against some terrorists, canaping you or just some hillbillies or whatever,

301
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:43,480
 before you sign that waiver, actually before you even show up, think that while you're sitting in the dark having your head fake shaved and vomit shoved down your throat, a sheik in Saudi Arabia is furiously masturbating to images of you.

302
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:52,480
 If that doesn't get you to not go to McCaymey Manor, then you deserve that $10,000.
