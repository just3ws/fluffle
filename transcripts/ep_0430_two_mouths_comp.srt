00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 An alien lets a human know he's not to be trifled with.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 We take a quick look at the newest conspiracy film out of Shadows.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And can a cryptid really be considered a cryptid if it gets caught all the time, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I really, really do.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Want to give a shout out to a legacy Patreon longtime supporter of the show, Dave H.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Dave, thank you so much for supporting the show. You're gonna be our pilot, our captain, whatever vehicle we take for this episode.

 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine, just help get the word out about the show, that helps a lot.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:18,000

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 [Music]

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I got this request actually from a listener. It was from Scotty Mac Duder.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Scotty Mac Duder, a listener on YouTube, thank you for this.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 He sent me the story that apparently, in a current video, this is a real big sidetrack.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Apparently there is a very recent video, a video from April 13th, 2020, where the Pope's doing his prayer thing at a window.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 The mafiosos are standing in the shadows, punching their hands like this.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And the Pope's like, "Oh, I better make this prayer last longer, because when I'm done they're gonna beat me up."

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 He's like, "And bless each blade of grass."

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And the acorns, people are like, "Dude, is he gonna pray for every life form on the planet?"

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 He's like, "God bless the cardboard cutout of Pamela Anderson."

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 People are like, "What? Mafiosos have bats."

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Anyways, the real story is the Pope is doing his prayer thing, and then he's at a window.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So we can all see, I guess I should have said that in the beginning, he's not in the corner of a room.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 He's doing this thing at a window, he's in Vatican City, and he's like praying, excitedly calling for help.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And then he turns around and he walks away, and then he disappears.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Just blinks out of existence.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So Scotty Mac Duder, thank you for that recommendation, I was looking at that and I go,

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 "Okay, there's basically an obvious explanation for this, but it also just looks like the Pope is a hologram, and somebody shut it off too early."

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And so the idea is that the Pope died of the coronavirus, and they had to replace him with a hologram.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 The Vatican's like, "Op, good thing we have this sci-fi technology.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I mean, you can make two Pocs up here as a hologram, but he's blue. The Pope's not blue. He doesn't look like a force ghost.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Pope's up there rapping, how do you want it?"

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 But no, so obviously that was a conspiracy theory, but it's interesting because I looked into it.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 First off, the Pope is only like 5'8' tall, and so he has to use a platform to wave out of the window.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 He's not a munchkin. 5'8' isn't terribly short, but the windows, the way they're situated, they're quite big.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 So there are different angles of the same prayer, camera angles, right?

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And one of them straight on, and you actually see him step down.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So that was my first clue, I go, "Okay, so he was on some sort of pedestal.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 When he stepped down, maybe the other camera view had him step down odd."

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 But it wasn't. What happened was, it was kind of a combination of a bunch of different things.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 One, you have the lighting quality of the actual light source, which is the sun, which is pretty good lighting quality, right?

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 But then it's a pitch black room behind him, so the Gambino family can hide.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 You then have him stepping down.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 So, and basically, like all these camera people started, and you could say they're all lizard people, they're all part of the conspiracy,

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 but all these people you know about camera technology, they go, "It was a combination of very bright light source shining on him."

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Then him stepping into almost complete darkness. Plus, the camera is far away, and it's a digital camera,

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 which you're going to have some sort of pixel, you're going to have more issues than you are going to be with a film camera.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Plus, him stepping down. That actually was a factor. I was at least right on that part.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Him stepping down changed the light quality, changed so much.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Because what happened was people started slowing down the footage where he blinked out of existence, and he fades.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It does look like if you just watch at regular speed, he immediately blinks out in between frames,

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 but if you slow it down, you see him slowly fade, which actually made more people believe in the hologram.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But the film people, you know, the great film industrial complex that is always lying to us,

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 but they came forward and they said, "No, no, no, it was a combination of these different factors."

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Anyways, let's get back to my story. We're in Italy. Let's go back to the story that I had planned.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Thank you, though, Scotty, for that recommendation.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 We're in Italy. We're in the town Padovo. Padova?

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Ah, Padova. We're in Padova, Italy. It's June 8th, 1994. It's midnight.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Oh, super spooky. I don't know if they have wolves in Italy. Actually, I know they do, because the founders of Rome were raised by wolves.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 How's that for a tidbit of knowledge? Put that little wrinkle in your brain.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So, there's a farm in Italy, and there's this farmer walking around at midnight doing who knows what.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Right? Maybe he was looking for a ghost. But anyways, who's out? Maybe there's farm stuff you do at midnight. I don't know.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 He's walking around his farm at midnight, and then...

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Beep, bop, burp, beep, bop, burp. No, that's not the beginning of a Power Man 5000 song.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 There's a robot to be specific, a robot-like entity walking through his farm. Beep, bop, burp, beep, bop, burp.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And he turns, and he's like all lit up with these lights.

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I'm turning him into just a full robot, because I really don't know what a robot-like entity is.

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 He's just a big old robot, right?

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 He looks at the farmer. The farmer's like, "This is not what I expected to see when I came out to check on my chickens."

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Robot guy standing there. And he looks at the farmer, the farmer looks at him, and the farmer gets a telepathic message beamed into his head.

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And the robot goes, "Do not try to stop me. You cannot. Click, click. Hurt me.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 There are 14 other of my kind, just like me in the woods. You cannot stop me."

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And then he flies away. Woooo!

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Up into the clouds.

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Now, that's the end of that story, right?

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But I told you it was true. What I love about that story, I got it from ThinkAboutItDogs.com and they took it from a magazine.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But what I thought was funny about that story was, I don't think, I think it's true.

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Let's just say for the sake of argument, it's true. This is what I think happens.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Let's assume, again, the story is true and the guy just didn't make it up, because you never know.

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The robot, this is what I honestly think happened.

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 The two versions. One, the robot's walking around the farm doing, "Who knows what?"

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Again, what do you do at a farm and the robot's walking around?

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 The farmer walks out and the robot was not supposed to be caught.

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 If anything, the robot's actually incredibly nervous because here's a big old human walking around and he probably is armed, right?

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I don't know. Big old pitchfork. The robot immediately starts robot sweating.

87
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Uh-oh. Going to malfunction. What is this perspiration on my metal head?

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I think the robot was lying. I think the robot got scared when somebody popped out of the darkness.

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 The robot goes, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You may want to try to take me, but there's like 14."

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 He's just guessing a number, 14 of me in the woods.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 So if you do anything, it's basically the equivalent of, "If you beat me up, my brother's going to find you."

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Type of thing, right? Like, don't, no, no, no, don't hurt me. There's 14 other, and they're so much stronger than me, and they're like really cool.

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 They're not as good looking or smart, but they're like, "Super strong, so you better stay away."

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And then he flies and he runs away.

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 That's the one version that the robot was totally bluffing, because he was afraid he was just going to get wrecked by this farmer.

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 My other favorite version of this story is that the robot's walking around the farm, and there are 14 other robots hiding in the woods.

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And they're like, "Okay, if this goes according to plan, we're going to cut open a couple chickens and then do some stuff to cows.

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 We're going to do our normal..." Oh, did Gary just get caught in all the robots' look?

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And there's this robot standing in the middle of the farm, and they see a farmer yelling at Gary, and they're like, "Oh my God, what's he going to do?"

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And then they hear Gary's telepathic communication.

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 He's like, "No, no, no, don't hurt me, don't hurt me. There's 14 more of me in the woods."

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And they're like, "Did he just rat us out? The other robots are all trying to fly away."

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Basically, if the story is true, the robot's either a snitch or a scaredy cat, but I just love the fact that he's like...

104
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And again, that's the end of the story. The farmer doesn't then go search the woods or anything like that.

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 But if he did, I would imagine either he found nothing, meaning the robot was lying to him trying to get a quick getaway,

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 or there were originally 14 other robots there, and because Gary the robot got caught, he hindered their plans for world domination.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 They're like, "Oh, dang it, plan B, time to make a hologram of the Pope."

108
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Really awful, I hope.

109
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic, "Out of Shadows."

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 This is kind of a Dead Rabbit recommends, but it's for a particular audience.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It's funny because I was thinking about, I talked about this on yesterday's episode and edited it out,

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 because there's just too much. Yesterday's episode was kind of too long.

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But then Nick44 on Instagram was like, "Hey, have you seen Out of Shadows?"

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So Out of Shadows, it's a documentary on YouTube that is going really well.

115
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 They got like 5 million views in the first couple of days, and never hit trending, which, you know, YouTube messes with their algorithm and stuff like that.

116
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 But it's a really, really popular conspiracy documentary.

117
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 This one's pretty well done. I will have to say...

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Let me go over it briefly. I'll say this.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It is a great primer for a particular set of conspiracy theories.

120
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 If you don't know anything about these conspiracy theories, I would definitely recommend watching this.

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 To me, they're all fairly no-brainer, especially the first 30 minutes, so I was kind of like, "And?"

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And I was waiting for them to...

123
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Basically, the first part, it's interesting, you have a high-level Hollywood stuntman who gets injured, and during his physical therapy,

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 he finds... And this is not fictional.

125
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Like, you could argue that the stuff they're talking about is fake, but the narrative is real.

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 The guy who made the documentary, I believe, is the stuntman who got injured, and while he was going through physical therapy,

127
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 he got "red-pilled" to how Hollywood was really run.

128
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 He'd been in it for years, for most of his adult life, if not all of his adult life.

129
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Then he's finding out all these secrets.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Now, the first half of it, or the first 30, 40 minutes of it is...

131
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It's actually quite short, is about the CIA's involvement in Hollywood.

132
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Then that's a no-brainer, I mean, and they show all the dot...

133
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 But if you didn't know that, this is a good primer for it.

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 CIA's deeply entrenched in Hollywood, they're deeply entrenched in the news media.

135
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Every major newspaper, and I'd argue every newspaper, has some connection to the CIA.

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I'm not faulting the CIA for that, either.

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 CIA, FBI, all government organizations, they've done good stuff, they've done bad stuff.

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 But if any government worth its salt is going to control the means of propaganda in their country,

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 and in this country, it's Hollywood television, it's a media week,

140
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 and through Hollywood, we can control the propaganda of the world.

141
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So of course, CIA's going to get involved in that.

142
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 So are the communists going to get involved in Hollywood.

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 That was really interesting, though, because they go over, like, documents,

144
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 and, like, these exposés and these hearings.

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 So if you didn't know anything about, like, Project Mockingbird, it's a great documentary.

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 They go into MKUltra a little bit, which was nice, because I think that's been beaten to death.

147
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 If you don't know anything about MKUltra, CIA mind experiments, that's really good in there.

148
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And then it ends with probably the best primer I've ever seen on PizzaGate.

149
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So if you want to know the or- if you don't know the origins of PizzaGate, this is a great documentary.

150
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Where the documentary actually loses me, so it starts off with a stuntman,

151
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 ends with a journalist. In the middle, you have another stuntman who's a little more...

152
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 on the fringe of things, and he has this monologue that he goes into.

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 He's a little more... So he goes like this. He talks about, "What is Hollywood?"

154
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And this, I've talked about people like this on my show before. I'm sure he's a nice guy.

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I'm sure he knows what he's talking about, but... And he was doing fine, and then he got to this part.

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 He's like, "Hollywood, what does that mean?"

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 "Hollywood" is what the druids used. They used a branch of "Holly" for their wands or their ceremonies.

158
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Now, television, what does that say? You tell a vision.

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 You see, the television is controlling your brains. It's like the druids are casting these spells on you.

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Because when you sit down in front of your television, you get to choose from channels.

161
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Like people used to channel spirits in the old days.

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And what is a show called on a channel? Programming. They're programming your soul, and I'm like, "Okay, movies."

163
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 You can say television means television, but what about a movie or a projector?

164
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 What do those things mean? Which existed long before television.

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 So you can pick stuff. I mean, that's the type of stuff where I was kind of like rolling my eyes.

166
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Like, to me, that's where you start to get into the loony stuff.

167
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 CIA working with major media. Obviously they're doing that, right?

168
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It's an open secret. If you want to make any movie with any piece of military equipment, the army gets to look at your script.

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 That's not even a hidden. But, yeah, CIA probably does have...

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It absolutely has people working at Nickelodeon. If they don't actually have agents there, there are people high-level Nickelodeon people who can talk to CIA agents, or ABC, CBS, Disney, whatever.

171
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Totally not shocking at all. Good information. It's that little middle part where they start trying to talk about...

172
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 CIA is now also infested with Satan worship...

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 The television thing that kind of fell apart from me.

174
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 But overall, it's a very well-done documentary. It's a good primer on conspiracy theory.

175
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I don't agree with all of their conclusions.

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 It's nothing really that you can't find out of a couple days of research on your own.

177
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 But it's very, very entertaining packages in short. So you gotta love that.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So Dead Rabbit recommends, out of shadows, don't run out to watch it unless you're interested in that stuff.

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 If you listen to this podcast to hear ghost stories and stuff like that, I don't think it's going to red pill you anymore.

180
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 I mean, it seems to be a lot of obvious conclusions, but there are worse ways to spend an hour of your time watching something.

181
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Let's go ahead, though, and move on to our last story.

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So we're leaving behind the "Tell a Vision," which I actually just did. Didn't I tell a vision to you?

183
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 What does "podcast" mean? Well, if you take a pod, if you take the pee and pod and you turn it upside down, and you added two more?

184
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 666. Now without the pee, it says "odd cast." How do you perform a spell? You cast it.

185
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And if you are a witch, some might consider you odd. Hmm, 666 odd cast.

186
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So "podcast" isn't supposed to be fun at all. Just the very act of me recording this into a "mic" rafon.

187
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 "Mic" as in the archangel Michael, and "o-phone" as in... I don't know.

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 But basically, you know what I mean? You can do that in anything. I have a mic stand, meaning Michael can't stand for me to record.

189
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 You see what I mean? I could literally do this all day long. All day long. ADL? Anti-defamation League?

190
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Oh my goodness. Everyone's involved in... I know I'm mocking this, but there are people who spend a good amount of time adding up numbers and doing stuff like that.

191
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And that was all literally off the top of my head, if you couldn't tell. If you couldn't tell.

192
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And that's all it takes. People could just go on and on. Let's go ahead and move on to something that really matters. Cryptids.

193
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Let's leave behind the Carbnercopter. Dave, let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. We're going for a drive.

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 We're leaving behind the Tell-A-Vision station, because they want us to stay and be shunned by all of the non-believers.

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 We're leaving. Dave's like, "Uh, slumped over the wheel." He's like, "Can I just breathe in the exhaust fumes of this car?"

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Like, "No, wake up, wake up, wake up." We're driving down to South America.

197
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Now, when we get there, we're going to stop by a little tribe. They have little Amazonian dudes, right? They're hanging out.

198
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 We're in Fejo, that's in Acre, Brazil. So we're in Brazil. I can pronounce that, 100%. A little place called Fejo. It's May 1994.

199
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 An Indian chief walks into a village in Fejo. Hey, guys, what's going on? And they're like, "Oh, hey, what's up, Phillip?"

200
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And he's like, "Ugh, you won't believe what just happened. Half of my tribe just got massacred."

201
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Everyone's in town like, "You're a little non-plussed about the whole thing." He's like, "Yeah, what are you going to do?"

202
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 "Well, half my tribe got massacred." Well, who killed him? He's like, "The beast."

203
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 That's say, month, a couple weeks later, another Indian chief from the Cocoaqu settlement comes into a town, different town this time.

204
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Guy walks into a different town and he goes, "You won't believe what happened to me." He's hanging out, a couple other hunters, and the beast came for us.

205
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 He takes a drink. I don't know if he drinks. He might be a Tito toddler, but anyways, he just sits there then in the bar.

206
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Now, we're sitting in this bar too. We're like, swatting away big bugs. It's super humid.

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I'm sure May in the Amazon rainforest is quite humid. We're sitting there and we're looking at each other and we're like, "Dude, what's this beat?"

208
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 There's a creature hunting people in the Amazon. This is crazy. This is nuts. Plus, also, then that guy seems surprisingly calm.

209
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 He just sits there not drinking anything, not even water. So we ask him, "Hey, this beast, can you describe it to us?"

210
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 We are cryptid hunters ourselves. The Amazon chief turns to us and he goes, "It's big. Six to seven feet tall."

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Look at each other. It's Harry. It's a giant Harry monster. I'm looking at you and I'm like, "Dude, it's a Bigfoot."

212
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 You're like, "I don't know, maybe." "It has one eye!" He says. We're like, "What? That's not Bigfoot. Bigfoot."

213
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Maybe he got poked. I was like, "Oh, yeah. I didn't think about that." Sometimes you only do have one eye because one eye is gone.

214
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 And then a giant mouth and stomach, giant gaping wound in his stomach. We're like, "What? That's not Bigfoot at all."

215
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And he's like, "I never said it was Bigfoot." This is a creature called the Mappengarie.

216
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And it's... Okay, so anyway, let's get into this thing. This thing primarily exists in Brazil, Amazon Rainforest, general location.

217
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And it's an interesting cryptid for quite a few reasons. One, it's incredibly recent. There were no sightings of it before the 20th century.

218
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 So there's nothing going back, long-term natives saying, "Oh, yeah, I remember back in my day, it used to come through and kill half the people."

219
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And our chiefs just didn't care. They just walked into town. None of that stuff. But now, if people find Mappengarie tracks, they'll move their entire village.

220
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It's not worth it. These things are so vicious, they'll just walk into town and start killing people.

221
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 So not a long history, but very, very brutal recent history.

222
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 There is some debate whether or not they really have one eye. Some people say they have one eye. Some people say they have two.

223
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 They're always big. They're always hairy. Some people say, though, they're guerrilla-like. So you do get that Bigfoot idea.

224
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Other people say, and I don't know what it is with South America, why they're scared of these things, but other people go, "What a pfft! Those aren't scary. It's a giant sloth."

225
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Almost every cryptid in Argentina, and I covered this on a past episode, they're all giant sloths. Giant sloths all the way down.

226
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 This one is also compared to being a sloth, when they see tracks of it.

227
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 The name Mappengarie, which I'm almost for sure I'm mispronouncing, means a thing that has a bent or crooked paw.

228
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 So basically, it's interesting that it's also related to its footprint, like Bigfoot is specifically Giantfoot.

229
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Giant footprint. This one is also related to the track it leaves. Some people say the feet are turned backwards.

230
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Very, very common in South American legends, South American cryptids, have feet facing backwards.

231
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Because that way you can't track it. You don't know which way it's going. It's really weird. There's so many that we've come across like that.

232
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Some people say, though, that's the toes of a giant sloth, because the toe... And this is a really interesting look at it.

233
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 With a sloth, apparently they like, or they can. When they walk on their feet, their toes will kind of curl underneath them.

234
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So it will look. You'll see the toes facing in the wrong direction, and it walks.

235
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And if there are... See, that's the big debate. People say, yeah, giant sloths were real at some point in time, but they're extinct now.

236
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 That would explain why we have so many cryptids in South American lore that walk backwards.

237
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Because basically the way this giant sloth is walking is its toe nails kind of curl underneath.

238
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Because you don't get backward walking creatures in America. You do get them sometimes in like Portugal, Spain, maybe a little bit farther east.

239
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 But it's almost predominantly, almost all the cryptids have some form of walking backward in South America.

240
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So that's a weird connection. You have the idea that there might still be giant sloths over there, and all sorts of other ghost and goolies that walk through the jungle also leave backward footprints.

241
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 But anyways, they debate giant sloth monkey, giant sloth monkey. The most unique thing about this thing is it has a mouth-like opening in its stomach.

242
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So when you look at drawings of this, it basically looks like some kid just drew a picture of Bigfoot, and then just goes, ah, I'm going to give it a second mouth because I'm bored.

243
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 I got 30 minutes left of math class, so I'm just going to keep drawing.

244
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 The thing is it's not a mouth. It's actually a defense mechanism. It shoots out the most noxious smell.

245
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So you're walking through the woods, and you see something in front of you.

246
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 [imitates sound of a gun]

247
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And it turns around, and you pull your rifle up. [imitates gun]

248
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 You get ready to shoot this thing. Oh, you can't wait to blow its brains out. And then all of a sudden you wake up. It's like four hours later.

249
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 You're lucky a bunch of jaguars aren't circling you.

250
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Because it releases a smell that's so noxious a man will go unconscious like that. It'll just drop you.

251
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And what's funny is that a lot of times people, the thing will get scared and run away.

252
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Sometimes it murders entire villages. Sometimes it just goes, ah, and runs away and throws a stink bomb at you.

253
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And so you wake up, and people are like, what does it smell? This is the best description of a smell I've come across in a while.

254
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 You wake someone up, you take them back to the bar.

255
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Dude, so you ran into one of these things, and he's like, oh yeah, it was horrible. It was the worst smell I ever smelled.

256
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 What does it smell like? This is how this smells is described.

257
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It smells like rotting flesh. So that's pretty gross. Most of us have never smelled rotting flesh.

258
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I've never smelled rotting flesh. I mean, I guess if you probably like took some chicken.

259
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Now let's do a science experiment. Get some chicken from KFC, throw it in your closet, wait two weeks, and then email me what that smells like.

260
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 I can't imagine it's a good smell. I can't imagine it's a good smell.

261
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Gain green, stuff like that, you smell your own flesh rotting. So it already smells disgusting. On top of that, it smells like putrefying feces.

262
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So not just poop. That's not bad enough, right? If it smelled like fresh poop and rotting flesh, you might be like, well, I can get used to it.

263
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 That could be worse. I did used to take a subway in New York.

264
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 But the fact that it's bubbling old poop, it's to the point where it's starting to liquefy and get moldy at the same time.

265
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Oh, that's making me sick to my sense. I've never smelled that level of poop either, but I've smelled some pretty rank poop.

266
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I think we all have. So I can't imagine rotting flesh. I can't imagine poop that's in the right temperature where it doesn't cake up and dry, but it also just keeps getting wetter and wetter.

267
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Okay, so that and the guy sitting in the world like holding back this dude's eating, chilling the corner. He's like, pushes it back across the bar.

268
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 He's like, no, no, he tells us it smells like rotting flesh. It smells like putrefying feces. And the guy looks around the bar.

269
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 A skunk.

270
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Everyone's like, what? This is described as smelling like rotting flesh, putrefying poop and a skunk. And when I read that, I thought, do you really need the skunk at that point?

271
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Like, is there a smell? Is there a... Basically, it would be the equivalent of you walking into a crime scene. Someone had been murdered three weeks ago.

272
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 The birds have been there. The dogs have been there. The body's completely decaying. You walk in and go, did someone fart?

273
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Like, there's enough other smells going on to not notice that someone just passed gas. I think if this thing blasted me with a...

274
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I don't think I'd be like, oh, I smell the skunk. I smell the skunk. It's all the other smells that knock you out.

275
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 But anyways, that's a really good defensive weapon. You could say armor. This thing does have armor. Actually, they say it's big and hairy, but they say sometimes when it moves its neck, just right.

276
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 You can see what appears to be crocodile skin, or the very least reptile skin, a small amount of armor on this thing. People shoot at it with different levels of success.

277
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 We'll get into that in a second. Now, of course, some people say it's just a giant sloth. We don't know why it has this mouth and its stomach, or that's just a local legend, but it's a giant sloth.

278
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 That's cryptid enough. Some people believe the cryptids are just... There's no legend attached to it. It's just something we haven't discovered yet.

279
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 With this one, you have the basic cryptid legend. Some people believe, 1,000 years ago, there was a shaman who became immortal, and the gods wanted to punish him, so they turned him into this gross monster.

280
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 That doesn't make any sense because it wasn't seen before 1900. Unless he smelled himself right after he turned him into a monster and passed out for 10,000 years and woke him and said, "Where am I? I better go here and start harassing people."

281
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 It doesn't make sense. Some people believe it's a nature spirit. When people start going into the Amazon and start logging, I think that's more propaganda than anything.

282
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Because it's not like people started abusing the environment and it's like, "Oh, it's the year 1901. Let's start cutting down all these trees." That stuff was going on for a long, long time.

283
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Again, the nature spirit was really slacking off if he didn't get started until 1910. He's like, "Oh, I'm supposed to wreck vengeance? Oh yeah, I'll go do that. Ah, vengeance, hate."

284
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 People who've got down trees and the gods are like, "No, no, no, go commit vengeance." He's like, "I don't know what I'm avenging. They've been doing this for centuries."

285
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 People have multiple encounters with this thing. To the point, like I said, people know it well enough they'll move their tribe if the sightings are too close to their tribe.

286
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 So people have seen this thing up close. People have survived attacks from this thing. They said that it walks on all fours quite speedily, but it can walk on two legs.

287
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 But when it does, again, it's like, it's so funny because you start to go, "Okay, here's a creature that smells." He can do all this stuff quite fierce.

288
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Walks like Charlie Chaplin. So when he's on two legs, he kind of just wobbles towards you. That's not terrifying.

289
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 He's all throwing a cane around like a six, seven foot tall hairy creature with reptilian skin underneath its fur charging me on all fours.

290
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 That's nightmare fuel. But it's like slowly standing on two legs walking like a baby.

291
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 That's not scary, but anything, this thing does apparently kill people all the time.

292
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 But what's interesting about it, you have people who have dedicated their lives to finding this and they'll find like a pile of poop.

293
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Here is this poop. Oddly, it smells even better than the animal itself. It smells like lilacs.

294
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Apparently, like people have poop samples and footprint samples and there's people who've dedicated their whole lives to finding this.

295
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And then they send the poop off to a laboratory and the laboratory writes back, "Quit sendin' us your poop, okay?"

296
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 "We'll tell you one last time, this is horse poop or this is donkey poop."

297
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 One of the main experts on this thing. Keep saying it poops like a horse.

298
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 The poop that it poops is consistent with the horse's poop. It's probably just a horse's poop, bro.

299
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And you're spitting it up and putting it in bags and your wife's like, "Can't you find another hobby?"

300
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 "I can't you do like model trains or 3D puzzles or something? Do you have to keep bringing own bags of poop?"

301
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 But what's interesting is this guy, there's a couple guys even spending their lives looking for this thing.

302
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 This might be the most easily caught cryptid we've ever covered on this show.

303
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 First off, I said it has the reptilian armor underneath its body, right?

304
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Here's its weakness. So this is one of those cryptids where a lot of times you have cryptids like if you have gold teeth,

305
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 you take them out and you throw them at the cryptid and the cryptid explodes or you remove the left earring from this ghost.

306
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 The guy, you know, just basic like old witchcraft remedies.

307
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 This cryptid, it has to be shot in the head or the chest or the neck, which is the weakness of any living animal, right?

308
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 That's how you kill this thing. They're like, "Ah, if you ever run into a map and gary, make sure you have a loaded gun

309
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 and you shoot it in the vital organs." People are like, "What? I came to a witch doctor for that?"

310
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 "Yes, you did. You owe me 50 bucks. You needed that information."

311
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And I'm like, "Dang it, here's my 50 bucks." You just shoot it in the brain and it dies. So these things get shot all the time.

312
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 There's apparently three... Well, here's the thing. They get shot and they get captured all the time, but conveniently,

313
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 you know, there's something happens. This is a lot of people have claimed to have encountered these things and they got away.

314
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 They've actually been quite a few captured living specimens captured.

315
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 You had a bunch of these things. And again, they're incredibly vicious. They will kill you on sight.

316
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So you do have to shoot them or hopefully they just get scared of you and they run away.

317
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 They go, "Oh, there's 14 of me in the forest and they're way smellier than I am. They're not as charming or handsome, but oh."

318
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And then he runs away. The guy's like, "Oh, I want to get those 14 in the forest."

319
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Here's this, this. In the 1980s. So again, it's very, very interesting because everything's so recent.

320
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 In the 1980s, there was a group of Indians called the Kanamari.

321
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 They're living in the Rio Jorahora? Jura?

322
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 They're living in a valley. These Kanamari Indians are living in this valley.

323
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And they actually caught two of them. Two little baby Mappengaris.

324
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 "Hey, little guy, come here." "Oh, look at me. He's trying to eviscerate my stomach."

325
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 "Wah, wah." And they're holding them up.

326
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Picking up these two little guys. Now, they actually had these guys.

327
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And you imagine the other tribes. Most of these people were devil worshipers.

328
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Because when I say these things are vicious, like we've talked about them just walking through, like, killing tribesmen.

329
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 They would destroy cattle. They would destroy all sorts of stuff.

330
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 They would walk through your farm and basically rip--

331
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 There was one story where they walked through a farm.

332
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And over the course of three weeks, killed a hundred cows and ripped their tongues out.

333
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 A delicacy, maybe?

334
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 So, definitely economically devastating your life as well when they kill you.

335
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 And they're horrible, just giant.

336
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Seven-foot-tall monsters. No one wants this hanging around.

337
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But these Kanamari Indians get two of these little baby guys.

338
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Now, you could argue, maybe they just found baby sloths.

339
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Not giant sloths. They're just a regular-sized sloth.

340
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And they're like, "This must be an infant!" And it's actually like 80-year-old sloth.

341
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Anyways, they have these sloths.

342
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And they--

343
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 So anyways, they have these Mappengarys.

344
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And they're hanging out. The story apparently was that they were hanging out with their mom.

345
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And, "Hey, mommy. When am I gonna be able to kill humans?"

346
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 "Mommy, when do I get to kill cows?"

347
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 "You wait, young pups. Someday you'll both be able to devastate humanity."

348
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 But for now, you guys must learn how to play.

349
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And then some hunters showed up and scared the mom away.

350
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 The mom's like, "Beat feet, kid!"

351
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 She pushes the kids towards the hunters.

352
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 "Get them! Get them! Fourteen more of me in the woods!"

353
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 She runs away into the woods. The babies are like, "What?"

354
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 So the hunters, I guess, probably felt bad that they scared away this human-eating creature.

355
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 They take the babies home and raise them.

356
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 But what happened was, they're feeding the babies bananas and milk,

357
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 which is a pretty good diet for a baby, right?

358
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 I don't know. Actually, I don't have a baby. I know milk is good.

359
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 You're like, "Eat more bananas!" They're like, "No, my legs aren't cramping anymore!"

360
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 "Nah, nah, nah."

361
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Anyways, they're eating all these bananas.

362
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And then eventually, they got older, so they started feeding them, like, leaves and stuff like that.

363
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Which at that point, the guys were like, "Can I pretend to be a baby and get more bananas?"

364
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 They're like, "No, it's time to eat leaves."

365
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 They're like, "Aw, man, I'm gonna kill you first. Would you say nothing? I'll eat my leaf."

366
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Hiding a banana in the leaf.

367
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Anyways, the point is that eventually, after a couple years, right, this is so funny.

368
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 For about a year or two, we're raising these little mythological creatures.

369
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Back in the 80s, again, this wasn't the 1880s. This was the 1980s.

370
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Reagan was in office when this was going on.

371
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 You had the village elders start sitting around the village and they're like, "We need to talk about those Mappengarys."

372
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And everyone's like, "Uh-huh, yeah, yeah."

373
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Everyone's like, kind of, they're like, sitting in their giant hut with, like, a podium.

374
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 The regular old podium PowerPoint. Powerpoint projector on there.

375
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 We need to talk about these little Mappengarys we have.

376
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Yes, their mother was scared off and that was tragic and it takes a village.

377
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 But man, do these things stink and everyone's like, "Yeah, it's super gross."

378
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 I can't smell. The other day, I took a dump. I didn't even know I took a dump.

379
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 People are like, "That's not a problem." He's like, "It's a problem for me."

380
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 I need to know when I go poop. I have no feeling in my butthole, so I don't know if I'm done.

381
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 But I can't smell it and everyone goes, "Yeah, I guess that could be a problem."

382
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 So the townspeople go, they take the babies, they throw them into the junk.

383
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 They get rid of them because they smelled so bad.

384
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Now, here's my thing. There have been stories of people capturing these things, right?

385
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And then having to let them go. There have been people of...

386
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 There have been stories of people killing these things and being like, "Phew, I'll come back and get in the body later."

387
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 These people lived with these things for one to two years.

388
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Even one year. Imagine it's day 360 and you wake up.

389
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 "Oh, why should it take such a deep breath?"

390
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 I can't yawn. Every time I yawn, I get a mouth full of rotting flesh and putrified poop.

391
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 That's day 360. And then people go, "Listen, man, we've given it a year.

392
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Should we get rid of these things?" And someone goes, "Let's say one to two years."

393
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 The town's like, "Ugh, so anyways."

394
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Now we're going. It's the two-year anniversary. They take these babies.

395
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Again, these creatures that have plagued the people of Brazil, they just boot them off into the forest.

396
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Which makes... I mean, it would be worse if they executed them, right?

397
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 They walked them out and they're like, "Hey, Mappin' Garry, look over there.

398
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 You see all the cows? Yeah, I see the cows.

399
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 You're gonna rip those tongues out someday. I sure hope so.

400
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 This is supposed to be a parody of the ending of Mice and Men botching it.

401
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 But anyways, the point is... And they shoot him in the back of the head.

402
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Spoiler alert. The point is, is that...

403
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 I think this is... I think it's hilarious. But I also love this cryptid.

404
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 It's the perfect blend. You have a man...

405
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 We don't get many cryptids that actively kill.

406
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Some cryptids are like curses or spirits.

407
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 They are nature spirits where if you do something wrong, they'll get you.

408
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 We see a lot of that in South America. We see nature spirits.

409
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 But those stories go back to the time of the conquistadors.

410
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 We have cryptids that kind of mind their own business, like Bigfoot.

411
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 We have cryptids like vampires and werewolves.

412
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 But this one, basically, it's incredibly modern.

413
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 It's still, to this day, people will move their tribes if they start to see footprints.

414
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 They're not moving small towns or villages, but when you have a group of people congregated in a little area,

415
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 you guys know what a tribe is. They'll just move, because it's not worth dealing with these things.

416
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 They're aware of them. They're massive. They're bulletproof, unless you shoot them in the neck, head, or chest.

417
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Everyone else is pretty well armored.

418
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Which is evolutionary. That would be evolutionarily weird to not be more armored where your internal organs are.

419
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 But anyways, again, we're talking about a guy who has a mouth and his stomach that shoots out stink bombs.

420
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 But I just think it's interesting, and Blin, it's an incredibly vicious cryptid that has a body type built for what it does.

421
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 It's not like a little goblin who casts magical spells. It's a giant monster that needs monster strength to eat you.

422
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 And it's active. It still affects people's lives today.

423
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And it has a believable defense mechanism. There's no curses, no magic involved.

424
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Just a big smelly monster that wants to eat what you have.

425
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Now, do I believe that it's real? I don't know. It's definitely fun to talk about.

426
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 I think it's definitely, I think something like this would be more believable than a Bigfoot.

427
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Simply because it does get caught and killed all the time.

428
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Again, you could say everyone who's telling these stories are lying, but again, if you kill something and you're in an Amazonian tribe,

429
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 you kill something. You're not calling up Fate Magazine the next day. By the time an explorer gets there, they're like,

430
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 "Oh yeah, that pile of bones over there. That's what you're looking for if you only got here a couple weeks earlier."

431
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 They don't have cameras. They're not hopping on the internet talking about this on some forum, on some cryptid Reddit site or something like that.

432
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 They're just shooting monsters that are attacking their livestock and then throwing the bones into the river and being like, "Lack!"

433
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Or raising it. So, real life herring and the hindersons were little monster men raised by loving families until they got too stinky and then thrown out into the woods?

434
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 Possibly. The question is, what happened to those monsters now? Would they be a little more caring for humans since they were raised by them?

435
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Or would they be filled with nothing but vengeance and rage at being abandoned once again? Who knows.

436
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 The only way to find out is for us to take a trip to the Amazon, wearing necklaces of bananas and carrying huge glasses of milk.

437
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And as we walk through the jungle, we'll keep our noses peeled for a smell. The unmistakable smell of poop, flesh, and a skunk.

438
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Because if we smell those smells, then we know for sure the legends are true. But it won't do us any good.

439
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 We're soon about to be devoured by the beast with two mouths.

440
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 DeadRabbitRadio.com is going to be our email address. You can also hit us up at facebook.com/deadrabbitradio.

441
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Twitter is @deadrabbitradio.

442
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't have to listen to it every day.

443
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 But I'm glad you listened to it today. I love you. Be safe, be kind, and I will see you guys later.
