00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 Is there an audio series out there that can create an alternative personality in your brain?

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,600
 One of a mindless bimbo?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:18,000
 And are the mountains we see around us really the stumps of giant trees today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,640
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I'm having a better day.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,400
 Every episode, you know, was probably the most, is definitely the longest I've released.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,840
 And I ended up working, I started, I think I started recording around 11 o'clock at night.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,920
 And by the time I was finalized, it was maybe one in the morning. I'd actually tried going to bed,

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,080
 couldn't sleep, woke up because I wasn't going to do the episode. Woke up, did the episode.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,440
 And that's probably honestly the most authentic episode of the series. That's probably the closest

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,040
 you would get to actually talking to me where I, at a certain point at the beginning, I was like,

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,200
 some of these facts, they're somewhere on my notes, but I'm just going to say what I think.

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,640
 I still don't know where the Isle of Man is. And the yawn in the middle. By the time I got to the

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,600
 yawn that pops up in the middle of that episode, it was about 1230 when I was editing it. And I was

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,360
 like, there's no way I'm going to be able to cut around this. I think I yawned in the middle of a

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,640
 word and then started the next word. There's a lot of editing that goes on in this podcast.

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,960
 I usually, the episodes usually run about 30, 40 minutes, and then I'll chop out 10, 15 minutes

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
 of it to get into the range I want, which is generally around 25 minutes. But last night's

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,440
 episode, I was like, I, there's, I can cut here and there, but I'm just going to let the episode

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,480
 stand. I really need to go and get some sleep. But I think it was probably my favorite episode so

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,200
 far because it was just kind of a moment. It was kind of a moment. And I liked both of those stories.

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,000
 Jeff the talking mongoose and my history of Stanley Hotel. And I woke up this morning, you know,

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,040
 I feel bad at people who comment on YouTube. I can respond really quickly and people who comment

24
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,600
 on Gmail. I can respond really quickly. But the pod being website, which is where this podcast

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,960
 is hosted, I don't know how to respond to people. But after the last night's episode, or I was pretty

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,560
 down while I was recording, and it definitely cheered me up while I was doing it. And then I

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,640
 got down again as I was editing it up until one in the morning. I woke up this morning and podcast

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,160
 user and forgive me if pronounced your name, but ariana blackmon21 just did good episode.

29
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,400
 Gave me a little comment, good episode, which is nice. I'm glad you appreciated it. I love

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,360
 reading comments like that. It was something nice to wake up to. So I appreciate that. Thank you.

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,960
 Thanks to everyone who reaches out. But I wanted to go ahead and highlight that one because I had

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:58,800
 no other way to respond. Now, I talked before about how to unleash your gay lust demon, I think

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,520
 was the name. It was a video that if you watched was supposed to turn you gay. And I watched it.

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,240
 And it didn't have any effect on me. Except like I said, it made me realize that everyone in the

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,560
 world has a bigger dick than I do. But there's another audio program. This one has no video

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,000
 attached to it. And you know, the how to unleash your gay lust demon, all the comments were like,

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,880
 yeah, this video totally rocks. I'm totally gay now. There's another thing out there. It's called

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,800
 Bambi sleeps. Now, if you know what Bambi sleeps is, if you've encountered it in the past,

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,920
 and you don't want to be reactivated, I just skip ahead 10 minutes because we're going to talk about

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,280
 it. We're going to play a little bit of an audio file from it. So Bambi sleeps. What it is, is it is

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,080
 a series of audio files. There's quite a lot of them that you're supposed to listen to while you're

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,320
 awake. They have there's so many of them because they're supposed to be for different phases.

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,280
 First, you listen to from what I understand the series. And then they have a file that's like

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,520
 a rapid induction that just kind of like puts you into the hypnotic state. These ones focus

45
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,040
 specifically on hypnosis. And you listen to them when you're awake. So you're conscious,

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,920
 then you listen to them while you're sleeping. And what it does, what the pitch is, is that it

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,040
 creates a new personality inside of you called Bambi. So it creates this new personality inside

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,280
 you named Bambi. And she is super horny, and she's really dumb. She's a bimbo. And her only goal in

49
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,440
 life is to be stupid and flirty and dress up in nice clothes and have sex with as many men as

50
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,280
 possible. So again, we're back in the gay, sissy, mind control thing. And that is a fetish of that

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,240
 community. So it's not you go, Well, how come there's no like, hypnosis to, you know, want to bang

52
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,360
 two girls at the same time, because that's not part of the fetish. It's some people in the sissy

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,480
 community, which is, which is different than the transgender community. Sissies are generally,

54
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,280
 it's it's it's the hyper sexualization of transgender, you can be transgender and say,

55
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,880
 you know, I'm a woman, I'm as a male born woman. And I want to be identified as a woman. And this

56
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,920
 is how I want to live my life. And sex is a component of that the sissy side would be the

57
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,800
 opposite. I want to have the sex is the overriding goal of it. And I'd be identified as a woman

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,040
 only in the context of having sex. So it's not about, you know, equal rights and restrooms or

59
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,280
 political access or anything like that. It's all sexual. It's a sexual fetish. They have entire

60
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:47,040
 websites dedicated to sissy hypnosis, sissy hypnotic videos, it's a huge subset. People watch

61
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,800
 these videos, and they, you know, jack off or they go off and blow dude, I don't know. But

62
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,080
 Bambi sleeps is different than that. Bambi sleeps is meant to create a new personality inside of you.

63
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,520
 Now, because there's such this sissy hypnosis community, it took off. People are like, oh,

64
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,680
 this is totally awesome. Like it will finally turn you into that brain dead bimbo slut you've

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,880
 always wanted to be. But user reports have started coming back saying, don't ever listen to this.

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,560
 It ruined my life. This is true hypnosis. This created personality disassociative disorder things.

67
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,960
 Stay away. This is not fun. People have reported, you know, I was reading one report, the guy's like,

68
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,680
 I called in sick to work the other day and just listened to Bambi sleeps for eight hours on a loop.

69
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,360
 Other people have complained that they don't, they can't walk as well anymore. Like it's ruined

70
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,920
 their motor skills. They kind of walk like a their man who presents themselves as a man to the world,

71
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,600
 but they find themselves kind of moving in the way of an exaggerated bimbo. A lot of them have

72
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,000
 complained about getting dumber. They've said I have a hard time spelling. I have hard time,

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,440
 you know, saying proper grammar sentences, things like that sentence structure. The even the positive

74
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:12,080
 like reviews will say this video will give you the IQ of the equivalent of 75 to 85 IQ points,

75
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,240
 which is retarded. Like that is that's retarded. I'm not using that word as a slang that is

76
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,240
 medically retarded. If you're at 75 IQ, you are retarded. I can't think of any other word for it.

77
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,280
 You are mentally challenged. I guess I could use that word a hundred times. But so and also like

78
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,440
 if you're not dressed up in girly clothes, you'll get angry. And they say so the video, the audio

79
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,640
 files, when people have reviewed them, some people again review them glowingly. This is the person

80
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,840
 I've always wanted to be. Another people have said the files are created in such a way because

81
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,120
 there's transcripts and everything like that. The files are created in such a way that the more

82
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,480
 you try to think when you get to a certain phase of listening to the audio clips, there's

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,520
 safety mechanisms, but not safety mechanisms for you. Safety mechanisms for Bambi. The more you

84
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,200
 try to think about how you used to be, Bambi will come out. And the more you think about Bambi,

85
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,800
 Bambi will come out. So no matter what you do, you can't override the programming. These are the

86
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,600
 first file. These are the names of the first set of files that comes with it. Rapid induction,

87
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,200
 which puts you to sleep and gets the process started. Bubble induction. And that is where

88
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,600
 it's really bizarre. You take, it tells you to take your earliest childhood memories,

89
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,280
 put them in a pink bubble, and then you pop it and the memories go away. Then you take your

90
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,960
 middle school memories, put them in a pink bubble and pop it and then those memories go away. And

91
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,800
 it goes through this whole process. And what it is is it's clearing the slate, clearing your mental

92
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,120
 slate for Bambi to have room to grow. So again, that's way different than, you know, Suck a Dick

93
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,360
 for Satan. It's, that was just like, suck, suck, suck a dick. This is like actually going through

94
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,840
 a process of like a mind wipe. Next one is bubble acceptance. I think that's when they're creating

95
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,640
 the new memories. It goes on a bit. We have Bambi IQ lock is one. So that's where it's kind of

96
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,840
 locking you into that stupid phase. Bambi body lock is again, where she's starting to take control

97
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,240
 of the way that you move. Bambi attitude lock is starting to make you more slutty. Bambi uniformed

98
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,280
 is actually, I know where you have, I know from reviews, I have not listened to these in full

99
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,400
 yet, but Bambi uniformed is having to dress up in girly clothes. So if you find yourself at work

100
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,000
 and you're wearing a suit and tie or, you know, you're at school and you're wearing like jeans

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,680
 and a t-shirt, you'll start to get angry. You can't wait home to put your bra on. And then

102
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,840
 all these videos are designed to basically like break down your normal personality and create

103
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,440
 this Bambi alter ego. Bambi takeover is basically you're allowing her access in your body. And then

104
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,720
 the last two are Bambi cockslut. That's where they after all of these files, they finally introduce,

105
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,840
 now you got to go off and have sex with all these dudes. And the last file is Bambi awakens, where

106
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,280
 she takes full control. Now, obviously, it's not like you listen to it one time and you're like,

107
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,840
 I'm Bambi, want to have sex with me? It's you keep playing it over and over and over again.

108
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,720
 Now, what happens? People have said, again, anecdotal, but the battery views have come in and

109
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,480
 they said that, you know, you get addicted to the audio files. And they just be, they take over your

110
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
 life. You can't wait to listen to them again. You'll just listen to them on loop over and over

111
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,080
 and over and over again, until it actually does begin to wipe your memory. You have a hard time

112
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,640
 concentrating and remembering things like that. And you're like, Jason, that is the most ridiculous

113
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,920
 thing in the world. None of that stuff sounds like it'll, it'll work at all. Here's my thing.

114
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,800
 You're probably right. I think that the battery views could be again, part of the fetish.

115
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,840
 I think the battery views are people go, this is the worst thing it's taken over my life. It turned

116
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,640
 me into a total cockslut. My name is Bambi now. And that's part of the fetish. So they're like,

117
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,080
 Oh, I can't wait to listen to Bambi sleeps. But you know, people, there's always been that thing

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,520
 like hypnosis doesn't work on people, you can't make them do anything that they wouldn't want to

119
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,280
 do. And first off, obviously, these people would like to do the stuff. That's why they're listening

120
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,640
 to these files in the first place. But I think, I think you can hypnotize people standing right

121
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,400
 in front of you. I think hypnotize is kind of the wrong word, but social engineering is a better

122
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,880
 word. You can stand right in front of someone. And with the right combination of words, not magic,

123
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,560
 just persuasion, you can get them to do things they might not otherwise do. I can't walk up to

124
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,440
 someone to convince them to commit murder. But I can walk up to someone or anyone really can do

125
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,440
 that. And you through the combinations of words, the combinations of empathy and the way your body

126
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,840
 posture is and everything like that, you can actually convince people to do things to make

127
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,120
 small decisions. So the mind can be hacked. You may not be able to swing a watch in front of somebody

128
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,480
 and hypnotize them. But I think in between the level of social engineering and the level of somebody

129
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,320
 who knows the maximum potential of social engineering and how the brain works and how like the

130
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,560
 theta waves and all that stuff goes around, I think you could create a file. I think you could

131
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,320
 create some sort of audio or visual presentation that could push susceptible people over the edge.

132
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,240
 That's my first theory. My second theory, this is going to get out there. But what if, what if

133
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,440
 there's something more sinister behind it? This is kind of sci-fi, a horrorish, but what if it was

134
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,120
 a way to like break down your brain so much that some sort of entity could lock onto you. And for

135
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,120
 some people, they accept the entity. I know you're Jason, you're like Jason, you've totally lost your

136
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,360
 skepticism hat this episode, but wait for the next segment. What if it breaks you down so much on a

137
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,160
 level that some sort of entity could latch onto you and basically ruin your life or possess you or

138
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,000
 something like that? I don't know. It's really weird. Knowing the superstition and again, I said the

139
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,560
 two theories that it could be someone who made it, who really knows how to brainwash people or knows

140
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,000
 how the human mind works on a biological and a emotional level. It could be some sort of like

141
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,840
 evil conspiracy by demons to take over people. I think both of those are not very likely. I think

142
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:28,800
 that it probably is an effective fetish audio clip that turns otherwise susceptible people

143
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,920
 to take their fetish a little too far. Here's my question. Would you listen to this series? It's

144
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,920
 going to be linked in the show notes. Now I'm part of the conspiracy. Would you listen to

145
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:47,040
 all of Bambi's sleeps? I don't know if I would. I'm going to. I'm going to have to. I didn't want

146
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,800
 to listen to it before this episode because I would run out of time and I kind of wanted to

147
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,200
 talk about it and then come back to it. But I was like, what if I listen to it and I get

148
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,880
 dumber? Like what if it is possible to, and let's put it this way, it is possible to break

149
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,600
 people's brains and create disassociative personalities and then we know it's possible

150
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,000
 because it happens on accident. And if it happens on accident, I'm sure that governments and other

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,560
 institutions have figured out ways to do it on purpose. But if you abuse people constantly,

152
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,200
 they will create a separate personality to deal with that abuse. It doesn't happen all the time,

153
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,320
 but we do see that it happens. So Bambi sleeps. Would you listen to it? I also have another

154
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,400
 question when I was listening to this. There is even a subset of Sissy Hypno community where it is

155
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:42,560
 videos and audios to make women sluttier, like you listen to it, and it makes them dumber

156
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:51,680
 and them want to sleep a bunch of people. Where do I find those? Where do I find those videos and

157
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,560
 clips? You'd be like, hey, have you heard the new Ariana Grande song? You have to listen to it for

158
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,480
 eight hours straight and you have to call in sick to work. But here you go. Let's just move

159
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
 let's just move on to the next star. So

160
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:15,120
 there are no forests. Now when you hear that phrase, you're like, what? No, there's there are

161
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,720
 forests to see them all the time. I saw Robin Hood and there are forests, obviously. But what we think

162
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:31,600
 are forests aren't forests, they're bushes. There's just a bunch of bushes in a confined area,

163
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,320
 like a hedge maze. So when you go to like Yellowstone, it's just bushes everywhere.

164
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:45,280
 And you go to what's another famous forest. Or you go back to Yellowstone, you go there again,

165
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:53,120
 it's just bushes everywhere. The real trees have all been cut down. And you've seen these

166
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:02,320
 trees. They're called mountains. So what this theory is is that trees, the mountains, the

167
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:11,440
 mountains that we see used to be giant trees. And if the mountain is like craggly, it's because the

168
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,840
 tree fell over. And I can show you a photo of a tree that fell over with a craggly stump.

169
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,000
 And then I can show you a picture of a mountain that's all jagged and they look exactly the same.

170
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,520
 So then you go, Jason, that doesn't make sense. And I go, well, I didn't finish showing you photos

171
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:38,160
 on a podcast yet. Maces, plateaus, those are trees that have been cut down. Did you know that?

172
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,160
 Those are trees that have been cut down. Because I can show you a picture of a stump

173
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,760
 of a tree that's been cut down. And then I can show you a picture of a mesa.

174
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,920
 I go, hey, look at it. It looks the same, doesn't it? These two things that are made of

175
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,920
 completely different materials, completely different sizes. Guess what? These pictures

176
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,560
 look the same. And then you go, Jason, that's quite clever. You're right. You've shown me now four

177
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,880
 photos and I'm quite convinced. However, what about volcanoes? Hmm? I've never seen a tree with

178
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:24,720
 hot lava in it. And I go, wait, hold on. Volcanoes, the hot lava is nuclear waste. And it's a chemical

179
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:34,000
 waste that's burning in it. And they basically just put waste in the trees slash mountains.

180
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,200
 And then you go, whoa, whoa, whoa, who's they? And I look at you and I go, the giants, of course.

181
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,280
 So what this theory is, it's an offshoot of flatters, but it's actually gaining steam among

182
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,800
 other conspiracy theorists is that mountains and maces and all that stuff used to be giant trees

183
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,760
 that went 10, 20 miles up into the sky. And we could calculate it, they would go that high because

184
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,560
 of the size of the base. And what we're seeing basically to the giants of the old world, that

185
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:13,680
 our forest, our puny little Homo sapien forest would look like just little bushes or weeds compared

186
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,160
 to these 10 mile high trees. The giants who used to live here, not only cut down the giant trees

187
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:29,200
 and use the wood to do giant stuff, I guess, they also all of the gorges of the world

188
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:38,480
 or quarries impact sites, a meteors, nope, quarries. That was actually giant stinging stuff out of the

189
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:46,880
 ground. Did you know that if you look up at the map of the earth, that all the deserts,

190
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:56,080
 all the main deserts of the planet are in a line? And that's not because the way that the equator goes

191
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,760
 around and the temperature differential and certain, no, no, no, no. It's because that is where

192
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:10,640
 the giants threw all their sands from digging. I'm not making, well, I'm not making this up.

193
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,960
 Somebody did. This is a really fast growing conspiracy theory. So deserts are where the

194
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,760
 giants like they dug up a quarry, they dug up the Grand Canyon and then hauled the dirt to the Sahara.

195
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,640
 It's ridiculous. And I also might push, well, there's a thousand pushbacks on this, but why is

196
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,920
 it that it seems that every gorge has a river running through it? It's not because the river cut the

197
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:44,080
 gorge. It's because the giants did. Now, what's weird about this theory, other than the fact that

198
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,040
 people are trying to claim that there are no forests, is that, you know, I've talked to a

199
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,520
 couple people about this one. I'll run into people and they'll say, what are you working on for your

200
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,840
 next episode? And I'll say, there are no forests. Trees used to be giant and I go into the whole

201
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,240
 spiel I just went into. And I've had more than a few people go, hmm, I'm like, what do you mean?

202
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,800
 Like, hmm, they're like, it's a very comforting thought. It's like, what? Because, you know,

203
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,880
 I approach this stuff, like I said, as I'm reading it, I'm thinking, okay, I'm going to go into the

204
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,760
 mindset of someone who believes this. And then I start to shred it apart. But when you throw out

205
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,280
 conspiracy theories to people who don't normally talk about conspiracy theories, they can have a

206
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,160
 wide range of reactions. Oh, and I want to say right now, this story comes, I've heard about this

207
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,720
 conspiracy before. But the idea for doing this as a story comes from Matthew, from Gmail. So

208
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,760
 Matthew sent me an email saying, hey, you know, I saw this on 4chan, why don't you cover this?

209
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,680
 And so I appreciate that I always appreciate people throwing up story ideas. Jeff was also a

210
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,560
 recommended story. So thanks, Matthew. I talked to a couple people and they were like, hmm.

211
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,600
 And I read an article. And it was interesting, as I was doing my research, this article was saying,

212
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,640
 it was talking about it in conjunction with Flat Earth. They said, there is something comforting.

213
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,280
 There is something comforting to know that the world was once more lush and vibrant and beautiful

214
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:20,160
 than it is today. That nature was so out of control that trees could grow to touch the night sky.

215
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,440
 And we're living on the husk. We're living on a planet that's a husk. And when we look around,

216
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,240
 then we see wildlife being taken away and housing developments go up. And I think that's why this

217
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,960
 has taken hold. The first real, this is a fairly, fairly recent conspiracy theory. It started with

218
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,640
 a YouTube video from like Crimea. That's really where it kind of took off. And then an English

219
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:54,720
 translation of the video came out. And since then, it's really taken off. Now, yeah, 2016 is when

220
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,160
 this conspiracy theory took off. So it was about two years ago. So this video came out and it

221
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,080
 basically was a video showing a stump of a tree and a mesa and saying, name 10 differences.

222
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,600
 You can't, you can only name two, material composition and size. Look at these hexagons.

223
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,640
 This can't be done by anything other than a tree. This, look at this. And the thing is,

224
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,200
 it's the same thing with Flat Earth where they'll throw out, like I'm watching the video and they're

225
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,640
 like, look at how this stone is like a hexagon. This is impossible anyway other than a tree. Now,

226
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,920
 I don't know a lot about how trees grow or how rocks form. So if I didn't, if I, one, if I was

227
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,680
 already suspicious of the scientific community or two, I really didn't care. I would watch them go,

228
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,280
 whoa, yeah, he's right. That is how only trees can look like that. But when you look into the

229
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,600
 science of it, they'll go, no, you know, it has to do with like this type of flow and this type of

230
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,360
 composition of rock and the weathering and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They've done hundreds

231
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,000
 and hundreds of years of research on why these rocks form the way they form. But to know that,

232
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,600
 I'm going to have to go and Google a bunch of stuff or I could just watch this video and you

233
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,000
 just throw out fact after fact after fact after fact and it wears you down. Sometimes the, the

234
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 knowledge barrier between the laymen and the scientists does get a little impenetrable. So

235
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,400
 you bounce back, you hear the conspiracy theory, you try to research it scientifically. You don't

236
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,720
 really get it and then you jump back down to the conspiracy theory. I think that's why stuff like

237
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,040
 these things really take hold. Also, it is something that you can look at something and go,

238
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,560
 I don't see a horizon on the planet. People are telling me there is a curve, but I don't see it

239
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,800
 at all. So any information I get is going to be based on my physical senses. I can look at this

240
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,320
 photo of a mesa and look at this photo of a tree and they look the same and I know trees can get

241
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,560
 petrified and turned into rock. Using my knowledge of science, I can make that comparison. And the

242
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,840
 weirdest thing is the people who say there are no forests say, oh no, there are regular mountains

243
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,200
 too. Just some of the mountains were giant trees. What? So how do I know which ones? Because see

244
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,400
 some of them just peek out. They don't look like broken jagged mountain ranges. It's just

245
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:17,280
 a giant mountain. And they go, no, no, Mount Everest is real, but this other mountain used to be a

246
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:24,080
 tree. We'll see what type of traction this conspiracy gets. I honestly think it's going to take off.

247
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,280
 I think it's going to get really, really big because I think people find it very charming to

248
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,120
 think we live in a planet that is not living up to its full potential. I was reading an article

249
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,000
 there actually saying that a lot of old myths are based around the idea of, you know, Tiamet,

250
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 who we talked about during Anticosmic Satanism, but I think he's from Babylonian mythology.

251
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,320
 He died and our world is based on his guts. Like our world is created from his death.

252
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,640
 And they were talking about other creation myths where something had to be destroyed for the world

253
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,280
 to become what it is. And they're saying that that's another reason why this idea is so attractive,

254
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,080
 because we're living in this world that is simply a ghost of the power it used to be.

255
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,960
 I think it's going to take off. I think Flat Earth is fairly easy to debunk because you can just be

256
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,320
 like put a GoPro on a balloon or whatever. And they go, no, the GoPro lens, it's fish-eyed, fish-eyed,

257
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,600
 but you can say, people go, well, no, of course I'm a globe because it took a plane from here to

258
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:35,280
 there. However, I did see a mesa once and it looked like a tree stump. I think that this may

259
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,680
 overcome Flat Earth as far as the most popular dumb conspiracy theory, because it has a natural

260
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,800
 attraction, the visual evidence is there, and the scientific language to explain how, I mean,

261
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,680
 you can explain how gorges are formed, but then people are like, well, what about this? And what

262
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,440
 about, it's like with 9/11. They are never happy. You explain one thing, they're like, what about

263
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
 this? What about this? What about this? Eventually, scientists go, well, you know, we have a theory

264
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,640
 about that and people go, a theory? That means it's not true. I believe that giants mind that,

265
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,000
 gorge, and the science just walks away. Well, how do these hexagons grow in this plateau? Well,

266
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,080
 it went like this, went like this, went like this, and then we have a theory theory. It used to be

267
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:26,000
 a tree. So get ready for a whole slew of books, videos, all sorts of stuff on this thing. Trees,

268
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:36,880
 are bushes, mountains, are trees, and the desert was dirt from all the quarries of the world.

269
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:47,680
 It does have a nice magical ring to it. Middle Earth, Pandora, these worlds of just like unbridled

270
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,080
 nature. But we have to accept it's not true, as much as it sounds nice, because that's just

271
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,800
 it's foolish. It really is foolish. A mountain is not and never was a tree.
