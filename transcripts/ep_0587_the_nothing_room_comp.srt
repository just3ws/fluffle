1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 Hey guys, this is Jason Carpenter here with a little introduction.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,680
 This episode was actually recorded before I went to the hospital.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
 It's been sitting on my computer and I wanted to get it out to you guys.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,200
 And I wanted to do them both on the same day, but I don't know how the algorithm works.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,560
 Tomorrow Christmas Day, we're gonna have a Christmas special, so I'm doing good, I'm

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,040
 doing fine, I'm just super tired.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,800
 But I went to the doctor, everything checks out, I got some stuff I need to take care

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,640
 of, but really really tired.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,400
 You can hear that in my voice as opposed to the episode you're about to hear.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,760
 But I love you guys, I wanted to get this episode out to you on Christmas Eve and tomorrow

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,440
 we will have, I've already recorded it, just gotta edit it, a Christmas special.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,720
 Thank you so much for your well wishes, but enough of this sappy stuff, let's get this

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,160
 episode started.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
 Drop the beat.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,520
 I don't know, I don't know how to end this.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,280
 So here you go.

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,560
 A conspiracy theorist legend hangs up his worm hat.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,040
 Two pieces of lost media may be out there.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
 Are you willing to find them?

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,160
 And then we travel to a woman's bedroom.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,400
 One night, like any other, she shuts the light off and goes to bed.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,280
 But when she wakes up a few hours later, she realizes she's not in her bedroom.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,320
 She's nowhere.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,040
 Day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
 I'm having a great day.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,040
 I hope you guys have a great upcoming weekend.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,720
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna slide right into this.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,440
 First off, I want to give a shout out to today's supporter of the show, Jones.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,880
 Everyone give a round of applause to Jones.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,160
 He's dancing in all slow and weird like the little dude from Twin Peaks.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
 He's just dancing around.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
 He's like, I don't even know what that dance is.

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
 Dance Jones dance.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
 Dance Jones.

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,920
 Jones actually supported the show on the Thanksgiving livestream, a very generous donation.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,520
 So thank you so much, Jones.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,960
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,440
 You can't financially support the show.

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
 I totally understand.

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,960
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,800
 You'll also see today is Fan Art Friday.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,440
 And today's artwork is from Lars Dudestan on Twitter.

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,160
 It's a pyramid with a rabbit ear that also has a rabbit head built into it and then a

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,400
 UFO is abducting it.

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,880
 Or the pyramid is holding up two arms and carrying a UFO like the movie The Bodyguard.

49
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,200
 One of the two, I don't know.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
 Lars.

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 Lars can explain that.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,520
 I'm pretty sure it's the first one.

53
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,480
 Thank you so much for the fan art for Fan Art Friday.

54
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,240
 Jones, now that you're done dancing, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy, but

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,840
 before we go anywhere, this first story is very, very short.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,160
 And depending on your view of monkeys, very, very sad.

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:07,120
 Hans Wormhat, longtime controversial conspiracy theorist, has quit YouTube.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,400
 Longtime listeners of the show know that Hans Wormhat is the architect behind the conspiracy

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,320
 theory monkeys aren't real, which has really become one of our slogans on the show.

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,400
 He quits.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
 He's done.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,320
 He's very interested and I watched his last video and he goes, "I'm just tired of making

63
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,240
 the same video over and over and over again."

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,720
 He really does make three types of videos.

65
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,400
 Bible verse videos.

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,280
 Videos claiming X isn't real or X doesn't exist.

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,600
 And then videos that I would not touch with a 10 foot pole.

68
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,320
 As far as the content creation of it, he goes, "I make the same video all the time and he's

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
 burned out.

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
 He's burned out."

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,960
 He says that he's gonna move to a blog, but he's not gonna tell anyone what the blog

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
 is.

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,680
 He's gonna have to, if you know how to find it, you'll find it is what he said.

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,160
 So basically, there's a one-eyed willies map out there that leads to a jungle fortress

75
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,880
 guarded by men in monkey suits and in the middle of that fortress is Hans himself.

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,440
 So Hans is gone.

77
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,920
 That is kind of the end of an era.

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,160
 His channel's been around longer than mine has.

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,040
 And we actually just probably wrapped up the Forrest Finn story as well.

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,080
 Is this a harbinger for a new era of Dead Rabbit Radio?

81
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,720
 Or are we actually in the coming months and years going to meet a whole new host of weirdos

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,760
 that we can exploit for views?

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,160
 Who knows?

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,240
 But someday Hans may come back to YouTube, but for now he is no more.

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,040
 So Jones, now that we're done giving a eulogy to a man who's still alive but his YouTube

86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,720
 channel isn't, go ahead and drive us in this Jason Jalopy.

87
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,920
 We're going to head on out to MTV Studios.

88
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 Eeeew.

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,280
 Cars driving on the road.

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,720
 This episode has a bit of a little challenge for you.

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,760
 I'm going to present two stories of lost media.

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,600
 One is true and one is false.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,760
 Or both are true or both are false.

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,200
 You won't know until the end of the segment.

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
 That's normally how narratives work.

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,720
 You don't know the ending until I get there.

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,720
 But I want you to think, which one of these lost medias could be true or either of them?

98
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
 This is my best.

99
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
 Jonathan Frakes in Russian.

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,120
 I just ask questions and then stop talking.

101
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,720
 Jones, stop right here.

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,440
 We're going to hop out of the car and we're at MTV Studios.

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,880
 It's January 21st, 2000.

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,320
 That was a time to be watching MTV.

105
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
 All the stars, all the songs.

106
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,200
 It was the coolest place you could be.

107
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,560
 So who wouldn't want to visit MTV Studios in the year 2000?

108
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,080
 It was a great time for MTV.

109
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,920
 In MTV Studios they're filming a new show called "Dude This Socks".

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 That's how you had to say it.

111
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,720
 That's how it was written on the stationery.

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,920
 You had to pronounce it just like that.

113
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,640
 It was a gong show.

114
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,220
 So basically you had these judges sit around and people would come out and do these wacky

115
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,680
 stunts and at a certain point the judges would go "Dude this sucks" and they'd get

116
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
 yanked off.

117
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,200
 But these weren't just people playing tubas.

118
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,800
 Well maybe a tuba full of yogurt.

119
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 This was edgy.

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
 They didn't want just your grandpa's gong show.

121
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,560
 Cause if they saw your grandpa's gong show they would go "Dude this sucks".

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
 January 21st, 2000 people are watching them film this show.

123
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
 We're sitting in the audience.

124
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,440
 And one of the directors go "Hey I need some volunteers.

125
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
 I need some volunteers to be in this next scene.

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
 Now you go to get up."

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,280
 And I look at Jones and Jones looks at me.

128
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
 We both kind of shake our head.

129
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
 We're like "No, no, no.

130
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,240
 You don't want to be a part of this."

131
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
 Instead a bunch of teenage girls get up.

132
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,920
 They're like 13, 14 years old.

133
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

134
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

136
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

137
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

138
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

139
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

140
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

141
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

142
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

143
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

144
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

145
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

146
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

147
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

148
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

150
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

151
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

153
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

154
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

156
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

157
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

159
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

160
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

161
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

162
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

163
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

166
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

167
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

168
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

169
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

170
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

172
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

173
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
 They're having the time of their lives.

174
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:23,560
 And spray liquid diarrhea all over the teenage girls in front of the entire studio audience as it's being filmed.

175
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,560
 Does that video footage exist?

176
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 Would anyone think that was appropriate at any time to air on television?

177
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
 We'll figure that out in a second.

178
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
 Jones, I'm going to toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable.

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
 We're going to leave behind, how do you like that for Cliffhanger?

180
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
 We're going to leave behind MTV Studios.

181
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
 We're headed out to Nalchik, Russia.

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,560
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

183
00:07:46,560 --> 00:08:01,560
 Russia in 1983 was the place to be.

184
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,560
 The bread lines were amazing.

185
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
 You're going to be at Russia at any point.

186
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
 Actually, Russia didn't exist.

187
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
 Soviet Union in 1983 was peak Russia.

188
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,560
 May 5, 1983.

189
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
 UFO is spotted flying through the night sky.

190
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,560
 Soviet air defense, hey, comrade, look.

191
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
 Look at that thing.

192
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
 I don't know.

193
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
 Apparently it's a caveman.

194
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
 They're like, how did the Neanderthal get a job?

195
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
 Me not know.

196
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
 Hey, comrade, look.

197
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
 There's something up there.

198
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
 We don't know what it is.

199
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
 Shoot it.

200
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:44,560
 Soviet air defense begins launching missiles at this object.

201
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
 It's trying to dodge them.

202
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 But eventually, spark shooting out.

203
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,560
 1950s sci-fi quality spark shooting out of the side of this ship.

204
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
 You can see the little string on it.

205
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,560
 The spaceship crashes into the Stolovia mountains.

206
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,560
 Later that night in that same area, a local man is doing something that local men do in the Soviet Union.

207
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,560
 And aliens talk to him.

208
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,560
 We don't know for some reason.

209
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,560
 The report is detailed enough that the aliens went to meet a guy, but we have no idea what they said.

210
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
 They might have just been holding their heads and have space bandages on.

211
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,560
 They're like, "Can you give us some more band-aids, some human band-aids?"

212
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
 "Our band-aids don't work in this gravity."

213
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
 We don't know, but maybe he did.

214
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,560
 We also have this report that some tourists from Moscow were visiting the Stolovia mountain region.

215
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
 Because that's what you do.

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,560
 You're from Moscow, but you want to go see what a mountain looks like.

217
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
 They didn't have geography books back then.

218
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
 You actually have to go to the mountain.

219
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:00,560
 They said that when they were in the mountains, they saw the crashed UFO sitting there.

220
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 The hole is ripped open.

221
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 Still little shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh

222
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,560
 Here's this quote I got.

223
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:15,560
 The local tourist "reported that they had actually got inside the UFO, but had not found anything."

224
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
 How can you not find anything on a UFO?

225
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 Nothing?

226
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 Nothing at all?

227
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,560
 That's basically like a tough shed that fell out of an airplane.

228
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 It's just basically like a thing that you go in and there's nothing.

229
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,560
 Even if a tough shed fell out of an airplane, you'd find something in there.

230
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,560
 But no, these tourists apparently went, saw the UFO, walked inside, didn't find anything left.

231
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
 I would have moved in.

232
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
 I would have moved in.

233
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
 I told them, "This is my place."

234
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,560
 Brought in a little comforter, hanging out, trying to hook up and watch some intergalactic television.

235
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,560
 But this is where the lost media comes in, because the military eventually moves in on foot.

236
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,560
 And somebody in 1983, Russia, you'd have to be very, very wealthy to own one of these,

237
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
 because you had to be pretty well off to own one in the United States, had a video camera.

238
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,560
 This video camera is, now it might have actually been a soldier's video camera,

239
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
 and could have been assigned by the government, but we don't have that information.

240
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,560
 This was from a book called The Soviet UFO Files by Paul Stonehill.

241
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,560
 I got it from, think about it, docs.com, but they got it from that book.

242
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,560
 But whoever's taking the video footage, there is video footage of a second alien craft

243
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
 floating over a grassy plane in the region.

244
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,560
 [imitates flying]

245
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,560
 1983 video technology wasn't the best, but you could still make out the outline of this ship.

246
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,560
 [imitates flying]

247
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,560
 The video footage then cuts to a gray alien walking through the grass,

248
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 and the Russian soldiers gripping their weapons.

249
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,560
 They're probably under orders to capture this guy, but there's that inhuman fear in them.

250
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,560
 You can almost sense it through the videotape, as this expressionless creature is walking towards them.

251
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
 Broad daylight.

252
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:09,560
 Even though this creature is not human, you could tell its eyes were intensely staring at the scene in front of it.

253
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:19,560
 That emotion was visible, even in this creature, even on videotape, that at this point would be over 37 years old.

254
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,560
 One of those two videos, which one is fake, or are they both fake?

255
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,560
 I will stop recording this episode until I get emails from all of you.

256
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
 Can you guys figure out, are they both fake, are they both real?

257
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
 Well, I'll tell you this.

258
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,560
 I don't know entirely, but about the alien one.

259
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,560
 The alien one might be real, because again, it's probably not, but it may be.

260
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 We'll get into that in a second.

261
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
 Dude, this sucks.

262
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
 Happened.

263
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
 It's 100% real.

264
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,560
 When I was reading about it on the Lost Media Wiki, I was like, "Oh, this is just something like Squidward Suicide, but with poop."

265
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 No, there's court cases because of this.

266
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,560
 The families of the girls sued MTV, and MTV had to issue a formal apology and settle with them.

267
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,560
 Someone at MTV thought it would be a good idea to have two men diarrhea all over a bunch of teenagers in front of an audience, and they videotaped it.

268
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
 And that tape is out there somewhere.

269
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
 Somewhere.

270
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 You wouldn't destroy that, right?

271
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,560
 The head of MTV would be like, "You'll get rid of that. We have a reputation to uphold. Now we're going to get a bunch of teenagers drunk and lock them in a house for three weeks and call it a reality show."

272
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
 That tape exists.

273
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
 Dude, this sucks.

274
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
 Somewhere out there, there's a video.

275
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
 There has to at least be a screenshot, right?

276
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,560
 Of just two dudes smiling wearing Boy Scout uniforms, and the girls behind them are super happy and then lights the screen grab.

277
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,560
 Lost media. That's true lost media.

278
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
 I do believe it's out there.

279
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:57,560
 I don't think I'd watch the moment of explosion, but I'm curious that it exists in the first place.

280
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,560
 The Alien 1, we don't know if it exists. That's the report that somebody videotaped it.

281
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
 And it's funny because on the face of it, it's just kind of a cluttered UFO story.

282
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
 UFO gets shot down, and then they visit a farmer for some reason.

283
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,560
 Inexplicably, tourists find nothing on a UFO, and then this.

284
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:23,560
 But I thought the image at the end of that story of the gray alien walking through the grass towards a bunch of Russian soldiers and it being videotaped.

285
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,560
 And I think, you know, on the one hand it's not like the alien is being captured or roughed up or being shot or anything like that.

286
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,560
 It's walking towards a group of armed men with a very intense look on its face.

287
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
 That's a very, very vivid image.

288
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,560
 It's not afraid of the 10, 15, 20 people in front of it.

289
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
 Very, very cool image. Does the tape exist? Who knows.

290
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,560
 The story, again, is pretty fragmented.

291
00:14:46,560 --> 00:15:01,560
 But the reason why I wanted to cover it, because it just gave me that image, and then it made me think, how many blank videocassettes are out there just floating around in bins or in garage sales or stored somewhere in the attic?

292
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,560
 That is something so bizarre.

293
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,560
 Someone made a videotape of them killing somebody, somebody made a videotape of them getting killed.

294
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,560
 They're filming it and they're like, "Oh, I got ejected!" and throw it in that bin.

295
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,560
 You have that stuff, but then think about like video footage of someone was investigating a haunted house before the internet.

296
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 So you had nowhere to share that stuff.

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:35,560
 All these videocassettes, you would shoot a video and if it was shot before the year 2008, 2007, it only exists on that cassette.

298
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,560
 So how many ghost sightings, alien sightings, and I'm not even talking about blurry lights in the sky.

299
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,560
 I'm talking about legitimate alien sightings that you videotaped somewhere in Ohio back in 1992.

300
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:55,560
 And you showed it to your friends and they didn't believe you and then you got embarrassed and you kind of put it away and maybe you think about it, but you can't find it anymore.

301
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
 The video still exists. It's out there somewhere.

302
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:07,560
 How many sightings are still out there on these black videocassettes that have already been recorded over for an episode of "Rosanne"?

303
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:17,560
 But there may be a videotape of a gray alien staring down a bunch of Russian soldiers trying to find what happened to his fallen space brethren.

304
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:26,560
 Jones, I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbonicopter. We're leaving behind Russia. We're saying goodbye to MTV Studios again.

305
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,560
 I don't even think they exist anymore. I think Nickelodeon's the flagship of that entire Viacom brand.

306
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:41,560
 We're leaving behind Russia. We are headed out to a small house in a normal neighborhood.

307
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:54,560
 Now you'd think that would be a difficult thing to find, but I've actually installed a new device because so many times I just told you to go to random places, hit that button little GPS.

308
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,560
 It's going to take us right to this young woman's house.

309
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:08,560
 Now this next story is interesting for two reasons. One I'll explain right now and one I'll explain later. That's the best way I can describe it.

310
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,560
 There's a young woman we're going to call her Margaret and her sister Veronica has come to stay at her house for a while.

311
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:25,560
 Now we don't know the ages. Those are names I made up. We don't know the ages, but we'll assume they're early 20s because it doesn't really matter to the story.

312
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,560
 But if you want to picture it, two sisters, they're both in their early 20s.

313
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,560
 The year's 2018 and I already forgot the names. Veronica's the older one. What was the other one, Margaret?

314
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,560
 Veronica and Margaret are having a grand little time doing whatever sisters do, making jeans and stuff like that.

315
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,560
 Who knows? I'm not a girl or a sister. I've never been a sister.

316
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,560
 But it's time to go to bed. The gene making is done. Apparently the sweatshots they opened in their house.

317
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 Someone blew the whistle. They already worked 18 hours a day. Now they can go to bed.

318
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:00,560
 Veronica goes up into her bedroom. Now this bedroom is relatively small the way Margaret describes it.

319
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 She says it's a standard size room. There's a light switch on a wall.

320
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 You take a couple steps and you're at a queen-sized bed, which takes up the bulk of the room.

321
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,560
 There's some shelving, a little nightstand, a vanity. Overall not a big room.

322
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:23,560
 There's a window where a street lamp outside shines enough light in that you would want to close the drapes to get a good night's sleep.

323
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,560
 But you're still going to get a trickle of light coming in.

324
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,560
 So as Joan lands the Carpenter Copter, we're standing outside this house. We see the bedroom light flick off. Veronica is going to sleep.

325
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,560
 In the middle of the night Veronica wakes up. She has to go to the bathroom. She jumps out of bed and she begins walking towards the bedroom door.

326
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,560
 And she's walking and walking and walking.

327
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:53,560
 The room's pitch black, which is kind of what she expected. That's how we tend to wake up in dark rooms.

328
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:03,560
 This isn't the room she normally stays in. She's visiting. So you don't know exactly how dark it's going to get, but this room is pitch black.

329
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:12,560
 And she realizes she's walked 20, 30 steps in a room that should be crowded by a queen bed and a few other items.

330
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,560
 She's not really thinking right now. She actually turns around and she walks back and she finds the bed.

331
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:26,560
 Even in the pitch black she can find the bed. Now that she's back in her bed, she's still not thinking about the distance she covered.

332
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,560
 She's still just waking up. But she goes to grab her phone off the nightstand. There's no nightstand.

333
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:40,560
 She's sitting on a bed in a black void. Now the panic is starting to set in.

334
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:48,560
 She jumps off the bed and begins walking back towards the door. Cannot find it. She goes back to the bed.

335
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 She figures, "Maybe I'm disoriented. Maybe I'm on a conveyor belt like Tom and Jerry." She walks in another direction. 20, 30, 40 steps.

336
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:08,560
 She walks back to the bed. No matter which direction she walks from the bed, there's no walls.

337
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
 Just a pitch black void.

338
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,560
 The next morning she tells her sister this story. Because her sister could tell she was a little upset.

339
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,560
 She's like, "Hey, what happened last night? Did you not have a good night's sleep? Did you not have a good night's sleep on the edge of a black hole?"

340
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:30,560
 Veronica's like, "What?" And she's like, "No, no, no. I didn't say the last point." Veronica goes, "Yeah, I didn't have really good sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and she tells Margaret the story that I just told you."

341
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:40,560
 That's really the end of the narrative, but it's not the end of the story. I found this on Reddit. It was by Auspicious Arrow on Reddit. She posted this about her sister.

342
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:48,560
 In and of itself, it's a story that obviously could be a waking dream. It could be made up. It could be completely made up. It could be true.

343
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:56,560
 There's one detail that's missing is why did Veronica go back to bed? Did she just decide to get asleep in the middle of the edge of reality?

344
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 Did she remember falling asleep? Did she stay up until the morning? We don't know. That's kind of a detail I would like to know.

345
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,560
 And not to say it's a deal breaker. There's a lot of stories where people are confronted by aliens or demons and then they go right to sleep.

346
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:17,560
 But I thought it was interesting detail. As the story itself, I thought it was a creepy visual that was probably worth a mention on this show.

347
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:24,560
 But then something really bizarre happened. I read this stuff constantly. That's all I do. That's all I do.

348
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:36,560
 It's read, hear the exhaustion in my voice. I have to consume tons of... I have to consume about 10 stories for every two I share with you on the show.

349
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:45,560
 Like, no joke. I'm just constantly researching, researching this stuff. The reason why I say that is because something happened that I don't really see often.

350
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,560
 And I've never seen it with this type of phenomenon. This is very rare. I've never heard of this happening before.

351
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:58,560
 Sometimes people will post stuff about astral travel or I think my sister is possessed by a demon or I think monkeys aren't real or whatever it is.

352
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,560
 The reason why I say all that, because I wanted to tell you how much of this stuff I read.

353
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:09,560
 An interesting thing happened on this Reddit thread. A bunch of people jumped in and said, "That happened to me, too."

354
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,560
 Now you may go, "Jason, that's just people like latching on. It's karma farming or whatever."

355
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:26,560
 I read a ton of this stuff and if someone does a post about astral travel and it has maybe 20 comments, you might get one or two who say that same thing happened to me.

356
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,560
 But astral travel is very common. So even out of those 20 comments you'll get one or two who say, "That happened to me."

357
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,560
 A couple other people will say, "You're headed to hell because it's like demonic." And then some people will say, "That's not true."

358
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:46,560
 Same thing someone will say, "I think I saw a big cat in Britain or I think I saw the mothman." And you might get one or two people who go, "I also saw that."

359
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 Other people will say stuff like, "I've heard of people saying that." But you don't get a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon.

360
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:03,560
 With this one, about one third of the comments, there's about only, there was about, I think, 20 comments on that and there was about four or five of them who said, "That happened to me."

361
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,560
 And they explained their own experience in detail that it also happened to them.

362
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:16,560
 Goonie in real life said 33 years ago when they were a little kid, they woke up, they were in a pitch black room. They could only find their bed.

363
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,560
 No matter which direction they walked in, they could find nothing else, but they could always find their way back to the bed.

364
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:31,560
 There was a Reddit user OVO Dave 15 years ago said that when he was 13, he woke up in a pitch black room.

365
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:38,560
 But in his case, he saw a white light far in the distance. It was nothing he could get close to. The more he walked, it just stayed there.

366
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:47,560
 And the whole ordeal terrified him so much he began screaming out loud. His parents came, they opened the bedroom door and he was standing right in front of the bedroom door.

367
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:56,560
 You had a couple other people marrying that same event. You had one person said that they woke up. This one, out of all of them would make me think it was a dream.

368
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:07,560
 She woke up and she looked down and the universe was under her bed. So it wasn't so much that everything else was black, but when she looked down, she could see galaxies below her feet.

369
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:19,560
 That one sounds a little more dreamish, but you see, so that's what's interesting about this is like you could have people making this up, but generally a lot of times they'll try to outdo the original poster.

370
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,560
 You have these people going on and on, the same thing happened to me and you would think it only happened to you because there's no literature on this.

371
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:33,560
 It's not like astral travel. It's not like Mothman or Mummies. Those are not really pester people. It's not like Mothman or Bigfoot or anything like that.

372
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:42,560
 There's no real literature on this. We had one user named Latalis Kalim say that it didn't happen to her, but it happened to her grandma.

373
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:54,560
 Her grandma was in the rest home and she told this story to her family one night she woke up and the room was gone. It was an endless sea of flowers in every single direction.

374
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:04,560
 And the apparition continued until a nurse walked into the room. Just like when the boys' parents opened the door, the room all of a sudden became a room again.

375
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,560
 The nurse walked in and the nurse remarked, "It smells like flowers in here."

376
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:16,560
 Now again, that sounds more farfetched than the idea of just being in the darkness, but I just thought it was kind of a pleasant one.

377
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:32,560
 But again, that out of all of them, the universe and the flower ones are the most skeptical ones, the ones that you'd be the most skeptical about, because if we take the original idea of waking up into a void, which again, I've never seen any literature on, that's weird.

378
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:40,560
 The story itself is weird, but again, it was kind of a one-off story, but once I started looking at the comments and other people acknowledging that this had happened to them,

379
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:56,560
 I wonder if this is a real phenomenon, and I wonder if this is something that happens to people and because you can't go to Giles and he goes through the Watchers manual and can point to it, and you go, "Oh, this is that. This is this no one thing. This is poltergeist. This is UFO."

380
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:12,560
 It's so unique that if it happened to you, you may not ever register it, or if you did, it was a scary childhood memory or a nightmare or sleep paralysis or something like that, because there's not hundreds of other cases to go off of.

381
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:32,560
 Imagine if you had no context for aliens or angels, no religious deities, no aliens, nothing like that, and you were walking through the woods and you were abducted, and then when they dropped you off, not a single other person in the world ever talked about celestial beings or things from the sky or anything like that,

382
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 you would think you were insane. You would have no point of context for that. Same thing if you saw a cup fly out of your cupboard and smash against the wall. We know about poltergeists. We know that's a thing.

383
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:56,560
 So you would go, "Oh, smashed cup. That's a ghost. I can go to a priest. I can go and burn sage." Like, you have all of these things from the lore.

384
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:10,560
 I've never come across this before. Just someone waking up in a pitch black room, a limitless pitch black room, it does verge on alien encounters. We've had people go to bed and wake up in other locations, but they're just that, a location.

385
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:21,560
 You wake up, and then you run out the door, and then you're outside of some medical facility. We covered a story like that maybe about 40 episodes ago, his grandma was trying to fight the aliens.

386
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:31,560
 I'll see if I can find that in his show notes. That's super vague, but we've had that happen before. It's right on the cusp of that. But it's not astral projection.

387
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:43,560
 It's not, we know it's not astral projection because the kid woke up and he was standing in front of the door. Very, very curious. And that's why I love to cover obscure stuff on this show.

388
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:53,560
 Because even though we can look at all the paranormal stuff, we have no idea what's really going on out there. There are so much other bizarre phenomenon out there that we're not aware of.

389
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:09,560
 Look at David Pilates and Missing 411. Whatever you're opinion on that, whether you think it's real or Bigfoot or Ghost or the government, that phenomenon never existed. It wasn't in the cultural context until he wrote those books.

390
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:18,560
 There's so much out there that is, now that's a mainstream thing, but it used to be incredibly obscure. The books went for like $100, they were out of print.

391
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:30,560
 So there's so much out there. I'm never worried about running out of content for this show because of stuff like this, stuff that I've never heard of in my decades of researching this.

392
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:46,560
 Not someone just being teleported out of the room, being abducted, but the room not existing anymore. It sounds fictional, but so did two dudes sprained diarrhea on teenage girls. That sounded, I didn't believe that existed either.

393
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:56,560
 And to top it all off, it's just creepy. When you go to bed in the back of your mind, you're thinking, someone might kick into my door and stab me in my sleep.

394
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:02,560
 You're like Jason, that's why you haven't saw me. That's why you can't sleep. I think about that all the time.

395
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,560
 But then I'm laying there and I think, okay, someone could stab me while I'm sleeping. I could wake up. There could be four gray aliens standing around the bed.

396
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:21,560
 I could wake up as killer Bob. It's crouched at the edge of my bed. You could wake up with a phantom's hands wrapped around your throat. All this stuff.

397
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:36,560
 Like I've thought about all those things, but not once have I ever thought I might wake up and there's nothing around me. Just nothing. No walls, no windows, no Lil Jon directing me to either of those locations. Nothing.

398
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:44,560
 I never thought about nothing. And sometimes nothing is the scariest thing of all.

399
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,560
