1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 A military meeting of the minds turns into a disaster.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,200
 And then we travel to the Philippines, where we meet a creature.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,100
 Sometimes it's a werewolf, sometimes it's a vampire,

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,000
 sometimes it's a witch lurking in the village.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,100
 What happens when you take some of the world's worst supernatural creatures and cram them into one species?

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,100
 You get the ass-wing today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:33,600
 [music]

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,800
 You know, it's funny. It's been one week for you guys.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,100
 It's been two weeks for me since I've recorded anything, so we're gonna see how this episode goes.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,600
 Hopefully it goes pretty smoothly.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,100
 I got a lot of Patreon's over the vacation break, so I'm gonna kind of break them up over the next two episodes.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,100
 So first off, I have Trashman 1101.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,600
 Thank you. Sounds like a Star Wars character.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,600
 I don't know. It sounds like the worst Star Wars character ever.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 We have Quigibo Alpo.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,100
 Quigibo being the famous Bart Simpson Scrabble word.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,100
 It means a North American balding ape. Great reference.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,600
 We have Ash Adams.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 So Trashman 1101, Quigibo Alpo and Ash Adams.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
 Thanks so much for joining the Patreon.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
 And we got more Patreon's coming. I will go over you guys tomorrow.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,100
 I just didn't want to cram everyone in one episode. I wanted to give you guys space to breathe.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,100
 I wonder if Ash Adams, I want...

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
 It almost sounds like some sort of like band name.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
 I wonder if that's a real name.

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,600
 If it is, that's a cool name.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
 So thank you guys for supporting the podcast.

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,100
 Now, I think that's... Oh, oh, let me say this too.

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,600
 I've talked about her a couple times on the show, Lana.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,100
 She's done a couple episodes.

34
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,600
 She's had a couple suggestions for us.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
 She's a good friend of mine.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
 She got on a car accident today.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
 She's fine. She's totally fine.

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
 But, you know, I've been in a lot of car accidents.

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 And a lot of times you walk away and then the next day you're kind of sore and your back hurts and stuff like that.

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 Lana, I know you don't listen to the show, but yeah, I hope you're doing good.

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
 She sends me story suggestions, but she can't stand the sound of my voice.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,100
 So, but no, I hope she's doing okay.

43
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,600
 So let's go ahead and move on over to our first story here.

44
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 Now, our first story is...

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 Let's hop on board the Carvenercopter.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,100
 Because that is our device that has time travel capability.

47
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,100
 So I think they all do actually. We just retcon 'em so they do.

48
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
 But anyway, so now the helicopter does...

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:31,100
 We are back in the year 1164.

50
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,100
 Sorry.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
 Now we gotta go forward because they said the wrong date.

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,100
 Adjusting it.

53
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,100
 We're in the year 1184.

54
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,100
 Man, it feels nice to be doing this podcast again.

55
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,100
 It's July 1184.

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,100
 Carvenercopter... Flying over Erfurt, Germany.

57
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,100
 So the reason why we're here is at the time a bunch of dudes were having problems.

58
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,100
 And not just like normal, like peasants poking each other with pitchforks.

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,100
 Like these were like royal guys who were like attacking each other's castles.

60
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,100
 Which sounds dope.

61
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
 I mean, that would be...

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:08,100
 If my problem was, "I need to send these troops out to go smash that dude's castle."

63
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
 I don't have a problem.

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
 Like that's pretty awesome.

65
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,600
 And even if my castle was getting attacked, I'd be like, "At least I have a castle."

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 But anyways, these guys are getting tired of fighting.

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
 And they're all hanging out.

68
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,100
 Now, not hanging out.

69
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,600
 They're all hating each other.

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,100
 But they figure we need to sort this out.

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,600
 Because things are just getting out of hand.

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 And the people...

73
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,100
 We have these guys.

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,100
 I don't know who these dudes are, but some European English nut may know.

75
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
 Ludwig the Third.

76
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,600
 Ludwig the Third.

77
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 Landgrave of Therngia.

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,100
 I don't believe that's a real person.

79
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,100
 I think that's a Star Wars character.

80
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,100
 And then Archbishop Conrad of Mainz.

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,600
 So anyways, these dudes are beefing with each other.

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
 And they're like, "Please, King Henry the Sixth, fix this."

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 And actually, no, I think it's the other way around.

84
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
 I think King Henry the Sixth was like, "Hey, you guys need to stop fighting amongst each other."

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,100
 "Meet me in Erfurt."

86
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
 "We're all going to meet in Erfurt in Germany."

87
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
 "We're going to go to Saint...

88
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,600
 The Church of Saint Peter."

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,100
 "We'll have a little conclave."

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,100
 "We will talk about what's bugging you guys."

91
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,600
 And they're like, "He started it."

92
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,100
 "He killed my wife first."

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
 And they're like, "But you killed ten of my peasants."

94
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,600
 Like, I'm sure it wasn't just...

95
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
 Actually, you know what's funny?

96
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 I was about to say, I'm sure they didn't really have real problems.

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 They didn't.

98
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
 Because what happened?

99
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,100
 Okay, so I'm getting ahead of myself.

100
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,600
 So these three dudes go, "Let's all meet."

101
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
 "And we're going to kick it with the King and we'll get this resolved."

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,100
 And then other people said, "You know what?"

103
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
 "I have a problem too that I need resolved."

104
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,100
 "So I will also go to Erfurt and get my problem resolved with the King too."

105
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
 "Because I'm beefing with this dude."

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 Now, one of these guys who came in was this dude named Count Heinrich the First.

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
 "Why are you the first?"

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,100
 "I'm Jason Carpenter. I'm the only Jason Carpenter in my family."

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
 "So everyone is the first."

110
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,600
 That's kind of stupid.

111
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 But anyways, Count Heinrich the First of Schwartzberg shows up.

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,100
 He was beefing with people.

113
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,600
 And the reason why people were beefing with him, because he stole the book.

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,100
 So people were getting like...

115
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
 Peasants were like walking, like, you know, like doing peasant stuff.

116
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,600
 Eating apples, cutting down rice.

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
 Not rice, not rice.

118
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,600
 Wheat, cutting wheat and stuff like that.

119
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
 And some knight would come up and smash their brains in.

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 The family would be like, "What would he do wrong?"

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,100
 And the knight would be like, "Uh, his master stole the book."

122
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
 And they're like, "What's a book?"

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
 The reason why it's because books took a long time to write.

124
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
 Not write, but like to publish back then.

125
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,600
 So that's how petty some of these squabbles were.

126
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,100
 But anyways, so the King's like, "Fine."

127
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,600
 Whoever has a problem, who's rich and powerful, come to the Church of St. Peter, St. Peter's Church.

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,100
 We're gonna meet on the second floor.

129
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,100
 We're gonna meet.

130
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,600
 And we're gonna squash all of this stuff.

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,100
 Everyone's like, "Yeah."

132
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
 Count Heimerich's like, "I'll be there."

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
 And he's like hiding the book.

134
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
 He has a mysterious book-shaped bulge in his jacket.

135
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 So anyways, they all show up.

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
 Now, they're rich and powerful and they're royal people and they're warlords,

137
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,100
 so they don't just like walk in.

138
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,600
 They are fully armored.

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,100
 They've got all their chain mail on.

140
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
 And they bring their goons.

141
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,600
 Everyone shows up with their own little click of goons.

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,100
 You have like the sharks and the jets.

143
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,600
 And then the Thuringians, who are all like, they're like the lizard people,

144
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,100
 'cause that's not a real place.

145
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,600
 And then the Archbishop brought in a bunch of like fighting priests and like sexy nuns

146
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,100
 and like tight black leather outfits.

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,600
 Anyways, so they're all on the second story of St. Peter's Church.

148
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
 The monks are like, "Can you leave the nuns outside please?"

149
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 We took a vow of celibacy.

150
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 They're all on the second floor of this church.

151
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
 Now, you should kind of start to see-

152
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,100
 This is a true story, by the way.

153
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,600
 This is 100% true story.

154
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
 So what happens when you put a bunch of people in full armor,

155
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,100
 a bunch of people in full armor on the second floor of a building that was built before 1164?

156
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,100
 Like what do you think is going to happen to this story?

157
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
 So, and I forgot this point.

158
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
 I have to say this point real quick too,

159
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
 'cause this actually plays into where we're going.

160
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,100
 Count Heinrich I was always like, would go off on these adventures or do these great things.

161
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,100
 He's like, "Ooh, a library! I will steal all the books!"

162
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,100
 It only has three books back then.

163
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,600
 But he would always go on these quests and he would make this scene.

164
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
 And I'm gonna say it in German.

165
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
 It's "Wandassneichtraist"

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 So "sterbe ich in ihm scheiß."

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,100
 And people would laugh.

168
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,600
 People think that was funny.

169
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 I'll explain what it means in a second, but if people would laugh and think it was funny,

170
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
 he'd go off on his adventure and come back.

171
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
 So, they're all in this second story of this church.

172
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 And at a certain point, two of the main dudes.

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,100
 Can remember we had the Archbishop, Landgrave, he's trying to get his lightsaber repaired,

174
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
 that's why he's there, and then Ludwig.

175
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,100
 And the King, those are our four main players, and Heinrich is kind of a side player.

176
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
 Those four dudes, two of them actually say,

177
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,100
 "You know what, let's go into this other room. Let's talk privately."

178
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
 "Maybe we can sort this out privately."

179
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,600
 So they go into another room.

180
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,100
 And everyone else is still on the second floor, and they hear a...

181
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
 [makes a sound of a ghost]

182
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
 And it's not someone's hungry tummy.

183
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,100
 The floor is starting to bow.

184
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
 [makes a sound of a ghost]

185
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
 And then, [makes a sound of a ghost]

186
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,100
 All of the support beams in the church, holding up the second floor, give out.

187
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,600
 There's just too much weight with all these people and all this armor.

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,100
 Now, as the floor is starting to collapse, the King and one of the other dudes,

189
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
 I don't remember which one, it doesn't matter,

190
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,600
 the King and one of the other main guys grab onto these metal bars that are guarding a window.

191
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,100
 Because apparently this church is in a bad neighborhood,

192
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,600
 that they have to have bars on the inside of the windows too.

193
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,100
 They grab onto the metal bars.

194
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,100
 So the floor, the second-story floor collapses.

195
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,600
 [makes a sound of a ghost]

196
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,100
 And everyone else there, except for the four main people,

197
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 the reason why this whole thing got started in the first place,

198
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:42,100
 and I guess I should say this, we're talking around 60 to 100 people are on this floor.

199
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,600
 So there's some historical accounts of how many people, but 60 minimum up to 100.

200
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,100
 The floor opens up and 60 to 100 people fall down

201
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,600
 and they hit the first floor of the church.

202
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 Now some of them are killed when they hit the floor.

203
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,100
 [makes a sound of a ghost]

204
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,600
 I died the same way I lived on the floor.

205
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 [makes a sound of a ghost]

206
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,100
 Who probably- Well, those are weird final words.

207
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,600
 You know, the first floor is nice.

208
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
 It's the- Oh, it's where the church is, right?

209
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
 It's like where the pews are and stuff.

210
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,100
 So you fall- Well, it's not nice to fall on a pew, but anyways, they fall down.

211
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,600
 Now, some people die immediately when they hit the ground,

212
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 but when they hit the floor, that floor also gives out.

213
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,100
 So all these people, all these 60 to 100 people hitting the first floor,

214
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,600
 weakens that as well and that collapses.

215
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,100
 Now, underneath the first floor is the latrine.

216
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,100
 So basically, we're talking 1184 and they're just pooping.

217
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,100
 The monks are just pooping into holes and it all goes underneath the church.

218
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
 I have no idea what they expected to happen when they just pooped for 100 years

219
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,600
 and the poop is like soaking up through the first floor.

220
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
 But the entire bottom of the first floor was just a giant latrine pit.

221
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,100
 How did it not stink walking into the church?

222
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,600
 You're like trying to pray and you're like, "Oh, it smells terrible."

223
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
 They fall through the second floor, through the first floor,

224
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 into an ocean of monk feces.

225
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 [Burp]

226
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 That's not the monk going to the bathroom.

227
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 That's 60 to 100 people sinking into poop.

228
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,100
 They all died.

229
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,600
 Not a single person except for those four people survived that event.

230
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,100
 Most of them drowned in poop.

231
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,600
 Now, I'm assuming too that just statistically,

232
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,100
 I'm sure there's at least one guy who survived the first fall.

233
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,600
 [Squeaking]

234
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
 Survived the second fall.

235
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 [Squeaking]

236
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
 Fell into the poop, cushioned his fall, didn't drown,

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
 but probably had a nut allergy and little peanuts,

238
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,100
 little peanuts floating around in there.

239
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
 He's like, "No, no, he's trying to swim away from it."

240
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,600
 When a peanut touches a skin, he dies as well.

241
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 Statistically, that probably happened.

242
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 I wonder if you had a peanut allergy and someone who ate peanuts pooped

243
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,600
 and you touched the poop, or does the peanut allergy only, like, is it the oil?

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 Like, can you ever take a peanut?

245
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 When I was in school, I had a teacher, when I was in third grade,

246
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,600
 I had a teacher, Mr. Rojo's, who told me that in some countries,

247
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,100
 they're so poor that they go through poop to find corn and they turn it into bread,

248
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
 or tortillas or something like that.

249
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
 And I went home and told my dad that, and he's like, "What? What?

250
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,600
 Why are you going to that school?"

251
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,100
 That same teacher also told me that when you see the clouds moving really fast,

252
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
 that means the Earth is rotating faster.

253
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,100
 Like, the speed of the clouds is how fast the world is rotating.

254
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,100
 And I told my dad that, and my dad goes,

255
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
 "What happens when you go outside and the clouds aren't moving?

256
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,600
 Does that mean the world has stopped? I don't know how that guy had a job teaching.

257
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,600
 But anyways, I don't know how long a peanut is. You're allergic to a peanut.

258
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 I wonder if, like, if you ate it, could you process out the allergen?

259
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 But anyways, one guy, two, one guy died of that, nut allergy and a thing of poop.

260
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
 So anyways, a bunch of people died. A bunch of people died.

261
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 Now, the king went on to become Emperor Henry.

262
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
 He ended up becoming like some world famous guy.

263
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,100
 The other people survived the incident.

264
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,600
 But let's go back to Count Heinrich I.

265
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,100
 Remember that quote I read you in my impeccable German?

266
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,100
 This is what he would tell people before he would go on adventures, in English.

267
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,100
 "If I fail, so may I die in excretement."

268
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
 Uh-huh, uh-huh.

269
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,600
 A little, what's that word? A little scene into the future there, Heinrich?

270
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,100
 Was there a paranormal event? Was he destined to die in monk feces?

271
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
 We may never know.

272
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 All we know is 60 to 100 men lost their lives.

273
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,100
 Because monks liked eating and pooping.

274
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,600
 Enough to fill an entire basement of a church.

275
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
 That's a lot of poop, by the way.

276
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,100
 So that's the story of, and it's known as the Erfurtlaternstruse.

277
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
 Which means the Erfurtlaternfall.

278
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,600
 A bunch of people died in monk poop.

279
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 Which if you're going to drown in anybody's poop, it's probably best you're drowning in monk poop.

280
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 Because it will probably be pretty healthy, I'm sure.

281
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 They mostly ate berries and twigs.

282
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 They're not bears.

283
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
 But it's not like they're eating Taco Bell.

284
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
 It's not like they're eating super greasy food.

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
 Your last, it wouldn't be the most pungent poop in the world.

286
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
 It would be, it would be okay smelling.

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
 As it filled your nose and lungs.

288
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
 Horrible, horrible way to go.

289
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 But if you had to go that way, do it, go, drown in a monk's bathroom.

290
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
 So let's go ahead and come back to the modern times.

291
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
 We're coming back to the year 2019.

292
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
 So we never even got off the carpet or got on that.

293
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 We didn't want to fall into the poop.

294
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 We're flying to the Philippines now.

295
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 This story is actually a request from one of my Patreons.

296
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 Actually, if I remember correctly, was my first Patreon.

297
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 It's Elkie.

298
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 Thanks Elkie.

299
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 This is the story of the ass-wang.

300
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 Now, there's a 99% possibility I'm pronouncing that wrong.

301
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 So I'll spell it and you can decide whether or not I'm correct.

302
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 It's AS-W-A-N-G.

303
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,600
 So maybe it's Oswong or ass.

304
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 It doesn't matter.

305
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
 It's an ass-wang.

306
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 So this creature is everything rolled into one.

307
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 It's basically a smorgasbord of cryptids.

308
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
 And thanks for the recommendation.

309
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
 Okay, this is a really fascinating creature.

310
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 Because there's a lot of origin stories.

311
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
 It's fairly recent and there's a lot of origin stories of how it came about, what it means.

312
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 And we'll get into that in a second, but let's explore.

313
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 So let's get out of the carbonar copter.

314
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 Take off our gas masks.

315
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 And I hand you a bolo knife.

316
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 Big ol' knife.

317
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 I'm like, "Here you go.

318
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
 Take this son.

319
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
 Use it."

320
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 You're gonna need it.

321
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 And you're like, "Are we gonna murder people?"

322
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 And I look at you, glint in my eye, and I go, "They're not people."

323
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
 So now you're really concerned.

324
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
 You're like, "Thank you, man.

325
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,600
 Can I take this guy and get the helicopter keys and get out of here?"

326
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 And I read your mind.

327
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 I'm like, "No, you can't.

328
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
 Let's go."

329
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 We started walking through the jungle and now you're really scared.

330
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 You're like, "Ah."

331
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
 So we're walking through the jungle.

332
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,600
 We're chopping down banana bushes and vines and stuff like that.

333
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 We're chopping down a bunch of stuff.

334
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 People, farmers are like, "No, those are my crops."

335
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
 We're chopping down corn.

336
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
 They're like, "Get out of the way, wilderness."

337
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
 And we stumble across the small town.

338
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
 And we're walking through the town with our machetes, with our bolo knives.

339
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 People are like, "Eh."

340
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
 They're shutting their doors.

341
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
 Some guys like making caskets.

342
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 It's like a Western town.

343
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
 Tumbleweed made of bananas rolled by.

344
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,600
 And we see some unusual things in this town.

345
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,600
 Over certain doorways, over most doorways, we see a little vile.

346
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 That has some sort of liquid in it.

347
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 We're like, "Hmm, I wonder if you could drink that."

348
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
 I wonder if you would get high if you drank that.

349
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 But we're not going to try.

350
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
 We might later on.

351
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
 But anyways, we're not going to try right now.

352
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,600
 And we're walking around and we start to see ladders outside of windows.

353
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 We're like, "Oh, that's kind of weird.

354
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
 Why would you lock your door up?"

355
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 Put a ladder outside your window.

356
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
 And so some old guy comes out and he's like, "Oh, that's not a ladder, lads."

357
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
 It's no ladder.

358
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 Well, it is a ladder.

359
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 It is a ladder.

360
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 But look closer at it.

361
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 What do you see different about it?

362
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 We're looking at it.

363
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 We're like, "I don't know.

364
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 It looks like..."

365
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 Can I chop it?

366
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
 Can I chop it with my knife?

367
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 And he's like, "No, you can't chop it with your knife.

368
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 That's private property.

369
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 You can get arrested for that."

370
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 But you see that ladder is reversed.

371
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
 We're looking at each other.

372
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 How?

373
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 So when I was reading about the ass wing, one of the things that you can prevent an

374
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 ass wing, and I'll get into what an ass wing is, but I think this is kind of important for

375
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 where this legend, where we go with this legend or this story, is that one of the ways you

376
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,600
 can keep an ass wing from getting into your house is to put a reversed ladder outside

377
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 of your house.

378
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 How do you reverse a ladder?

379
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 If you put it upside down or backwards, it still functions as a ladder.

380
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 If you just had a ladder, you lean up to a building.

381
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 There is no way you could turn that that would make it reversed, or at least no way you could

382
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
 turn that someone could not climb up it.

383
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,600
 So we kind of look at the old man and we're like, "Yeah, reversed.

384
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 Uh-huh.

385
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
 Oh, yeah.

386
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 Makes a lot of sense.

387
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 We just keep walking."

388
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,600
 We realize that we're in for a wild ride, because we explore the myth, the legend, and the reality

389
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 of the ass wing.

390
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
 So the ass wing works like this.

391
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 It's basically an umbrella term for multiple creatures that exist in the area.

392
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 One version is a vampire, but instead of sharp teeth, it shoots out like a big old tongue

393
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,600
 with a little tube on the end of it, and it sticks you in the neck or anywhere, anywhere

394
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,600
 that has blood in it, which is your whole body, and it sucks the blood out of you slowly.

395
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 And then you die.

396
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 Now this version likes, and all of them have shape-shifting abilities, but there's two of

397
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 them specifically that have a more sinister side.

398
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,600
 The vampire version likes to shape-shift into a woman, marry a man in the village, and then

399
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 slowly drain the life out of him over the course of the marriage, which is like, "Any

400
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 marriage you feel me, guys?

401
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 Elbow, elbow."

402
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
 You're like, "Jason, I do have a knife.

403
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
 Don't elbow me when I'm holding a knife."

404
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
 I'm like, "Sorry."

405
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
 That's one thing to do.

406
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 They also like to marry into communities so they can blend in, and then at night, when

407
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,600
 they're not slowly draining their husband of all hope, all like joy in his life, they

408
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,600
 will use the village as their base of operations.

409
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
 They go out the jungle and kill strangers, so no one suspects them.

410
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 They don't see their husband getting all weak and all pathetic and being like, "Oh, I shouldn't

411
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
 have gotten married.

412
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
 I should have started that rock band."

413
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 They go, "Oh, he must be married to an asswing."

414
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,600
 But if they're attacking people outside of the town, then no one would suspect this particular

415
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
 person.

416
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 There also is a version of the asswing that is known as the viscera sucker.

417
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 This one also shapeshifts into an attractive woman, marries a man in the community.

418
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 But this one doesn't suck blood.

419
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,600
 It still has the long tongue with a little suction thingy on it, a long hollow tube.

420
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
 But this one likes to eat guts.

421
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 It likes to eat the guts of sick people.

422
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
 So this is another thing.

423
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 If you're sick, you can't groan, you can't go, "Oh, I'm so sick.

424
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
 Oh, my head hurts."

425
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 Because that will attract one of these viscera suckers.

426
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,600
 They come in, stick their tube and you suck out your guts and you die.

427
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,600
 Now, they have a particularly brutal tactic where they join a community and then when

428
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 a woman is pregnant, they sneak up to them while they're sleeping and suck the fetus out

429
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 of the pregnant woman.

430
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 So that's gross.

431
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 I mean, that's gross.

432
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 So let's say you have a choice.

433
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
 You can move into a town with a vampire or you can move into a town with a creature who

434
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
 eats fetuses.

435
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 I'd pick the vampire town.

436
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 The vampire town, there's a higher chance of me getting killed.

437
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 I'm not a fetus, so I'm not worried about the second one, but that's just gross.

438
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
 Imagine you're shaking hands with someone and you're like, "Hey, why are your hands so

439
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 sticky?"

440
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
 They're like, "Oh, I just ate."

441
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
 I mean, I guess that really, they could have just made me in a lollipop.

442
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 But if you knew there was someone in town that was eating babies, you would just be

443
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
 disturbed all the time.

444
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
 So they have that one.

445
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,600
 Now, there are also three other versions I'll go over really quickly.

446
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
 There's one that's like a werewolf.

447
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
 And technically, this is lame.

448
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
 It's a were dog because they don't have wolves in the Philippines.

449
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 Like, I guess in India, they have were tigers and in Europe, they have were wolves.

450
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 This one just has were dogs.

451
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
 Blame.

452
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
 I'd live in that town.

453
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 I wouldn't be scared of that thing at all.

454
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 There's just like some dog walking around eating people.

455
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 You like whatever.

456
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,600
 And then they have one that is a witch.

457
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
 You know, just basic, basic witch stuff.

458
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 She has powers at night.

459
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 She cast spells.

460
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 She's a witch.

461
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
 She's a witch.

462
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 She's a witch.

463
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
 She's a witch.

464
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
 She's a witch.

465
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 She's a witch.

466
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 She's a witch.

467
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 She's a witch.

468
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
 She's a witch.

469
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
 She's a witch.

470
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 She's a witch.

471
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
 She's a witch.

472
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
 She's a witch.

473
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
 She's a witch.

474
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
 She's a witch.

475
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
 She's a witch.

476
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
 She's a witch.

477
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 She's a witch.

478
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
 She's a witch.

479
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
 She's a witch.

480
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
 She's a witch.

481
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
 She's a witch.

482
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
 She's a witch.

483
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 She's a witch.

484
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
 She's a witch.

485
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 She's a witch.

486
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
 She's a witch.

487
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
 She's a witch.

488
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
 She's a witch.

489
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 She's a witch.

490
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
 She's a witch.

491
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
 She's a witch.

492
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 She's a witch.

493
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 She's a witch.

494
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
 She's a witch.

495
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
 She's a witch.

496
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 She's a witch.

497
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 She's a witch.

498
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 She's a witch.

499
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
 She's a witch.

500
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
 She's a witch.

501
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 She's a witch.

502
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
 She's a witch.

503
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 She's a witch.

504
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
 She's a witch.

505
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
 She's a witch.

506
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
 She's a witch.

507
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,920
 none left to date, but you go back three, four hundred years and there was enough back

1076
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,800
 then interbreeding with humans.

1077
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,440
 And their genetic code is still being pushed through the population.

1078
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,120
 Half human, half cryptids, and their body is just not able, it's not compatible.

1079
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,680
 It keeps wigging out.

1080
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,760
 So what if the Spaniards didn't make it up?

1081
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,760
 What if it was a creature that existed long before them?

1082
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,880
 That hunted these people in the woods.

1083
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,120
 And then as people began to protect themselves, build villages and then cities, these cryptids

1084
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,240
 realized they needed to change their tactics.

1085
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:53,320
 Why hunt at night in the dark jungles when you could trace your prey during the day by

1086
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,660
 blending into society?

1087
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,920
 They may have wanted simply to feed on people the first time they entered a city, but in

1088
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:10,240
 the end they ended up creating a genetic disease that still affects Filipino men today.

1089
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,240
 It's more likely that the legend came out of a reason for why people suffered from this

1090
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,560
 disease, but in the darkness and the wilderness that still peppers the Philippines.

1091
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:48,200
 People still claim to hear the ass-wang hunting.

1092
00:32:48,200 --> 00:33:10,280
 Twitter is @DeadRabbitRadio.

1093
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,860
 (upbeat music)
