1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A private security alarm at a house sends police racing to the location.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 They're expecting the worst, but what they find is simply bizarre.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And no one wants to talk about politics here on Earth.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We've been talking about it for too long.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 So today we're going to talk about politics in space.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 More specifically, how would you overthrow a dictatorship on Mars?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm a white freak down. Actually, I'm a white freak down.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an awesome Halloween.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I hope you guys had a lot of fun. Hope you guys got a bunch of candy because you're 10 years old.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And they don't even let you treat anymore, which sucks.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 But technically everyone wasn't wearing a mask, so it should be fine.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But no, that kind of sucked. We actually did a Patreon Halloween livestream, which was a lot of fun.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 We had a bunch of people show up for that and I enjoyed it thoroughly and everyone seemed to be having fun.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 We just talked about some behind the scenes stuff, talked about ghosts a bit.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Veronica made an appearance. The haunted doll Veronica was hanging out.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Didn't do anything. Didn't dance around or a little ghost pop outfit or anything that would prove that she was haunted.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But she's always good for her laugh, just hanging out and stuff like that.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Jack.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Jack. He's been supporting the show for a while now.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Really, really appreciate your support. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 A lot of people have said they've brought in new listeners. Really appreciate that.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So Jack, I'm going to toss you the keys to a brand new vehicle. I just made up.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 We just came up with it. The hair hovercraft or maybe the hairvercraft.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 No, the hair hovercraft. I've always wanted a hovercraft.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And we have one now. I have one in my imagination now.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 The hair hovercraft. The reason why we have a hovercraft is because we're going to the swamp.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So we're never...

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 This story doesn't take place in the swamp. It takes place in Florida.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But I want... Anyways, since we're doing donuts in the middle of the swamps in Florida,

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 and after we get done doing that, then we get in the dead rapid.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 We just get a taxi cab and we go to this location. Jackson in the back seat is like,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 "Oh, I can't even drive the taxi cab." You got to drive the hair hovercraft.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Okay, so anyways, we take a taxi. We're headed out to Orange County, Florida. It's October 15th, 2020.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Jack is having to pay the taxi cab driver. There's a house in the middle of a normal neighborhood.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 There's no swamp. There's no swamp anywhere around. There's a house in a normal neighborhood.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 We're walking through the neighborhood and we hear it.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 We're kind of looking at each other. We recognize the sound.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It's a residential alarm. We've broken into many houses ourselves.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 We know what it brings. Residential alarm sounds like, "Ee, ee, ee."

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And the neighbors are like, "Oh, man, that's annoying. I'm trying to watch The Bachelor."

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 There's this alarm going off. Nothing bad's going on. Cops are racing to the scene.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Because this residential alarm is not just anyone's house. It's a house of a sheriff's deputy.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So they're thinking something really bad could happen. If it's happening in your house,

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 they'll take their time. They're doing donuts in the swamp and they're like,

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 "Oh, we'll get there in a second." But when it's a sheriff's deputy, they want to get there right away.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 So the Orange County police walk up to the house.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Hey, Christopher. Christopher Dottry. You're a member of...

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 He's like, "It's Dottry." They're like, "Whatever. We don't know how to pronounce your name."

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But you're a sheriff's deputy and we're cops, so let us in.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 The article doesn't actually say how the cops got in, so we'll embellish that part.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I'm sure they just opened the door and walked in, or maybe Christopher opened the door for him.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But I think it was a little more than that, so...

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 [Makes noise]

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 The door opens super slow. It's all rusty. There's cobwebs everywhere.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Flickering light on the end of the hallway.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 There's a guy moving all super fast in the corner. They're like, "Ahh!"

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Get back up here. They go into the house... At some point, they get in the house.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The reason why I don't know if the door was opened or if they kicked it in

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 was because of a detail that's coming up, but they get into the house and this is what they find.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Christopher Dotterey, he's a 37-year-old sheriff's deputy.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 He's been a sheriff's deputy since 2006. He's not like some rookie.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 He has a pistol on him. That's not weird. It would be weird if the cop didn't have a pistol on him.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 He's just sitting home reading a book. They're like, "My God, what are you doing?"

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 He's like, "Uh, I don't know. Something's wrong with me." He had a pistol on him. That's fine.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 His son was there as well, who had a taser. He was holding a taser.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 The article doesn't say how old these kids are, and it actually makes a big difference,

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 because if these kids are like 16, 17, then it's just kind of a fun family romp, maybe.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Let's play dress-up. Here, you can have my taser, son.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 But if the kids are like 12 or 8 or 3, then having a taser is not good for those ages.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 They're not built for anyone under the age of 16.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So if a 3-year-old is like playing with the taser, trying to eat it and stuff like that, that's not good.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 But anyways, they don't say the age. We'll just say they're 12 years old.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I don't know why, just because it makes the story more chilling.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 So his son has a taser, and the cops are like, "Oh, no."

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And then they go into the bedroom, and his daughter is in there, and she's laying on the floor,

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 holding a rifle in a perfect prone firing position,

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 and she has on a kelvar helmet and body armor.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Which to that, I imagine the cops were like, "Aww, look at that. Look at how giant that helmet is."

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 It's like covering up her vision. She's wearing like her dad's body armor.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 She looks like she's in the bad news bears or something like that.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 They weren't like, "Oh, that's so adorable. Lookit."

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 They were concerned because here's this child, again, we don't know the age,

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 but holding this rifle in a firing position, they very quickly are able to figure out kind of what's going on.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It doesn't make any sense, but at least they kind of know what's going on.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 So all of this is alleged, by the way.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 The kids tell this story that the dad started telling the kids that the house was infested with demons.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 At that point, the cops are like, "Aww, cops are like, "Go in the bathroom, do bloody Mary.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 "No way, man. I did that in our last crime scene. You do it. Ah."

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 They're pushing each other into the bathroom, but the kids say,

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 the kids are like, "Are you done joking, dude? This is super serious. They're all concerned for their dad."

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 They said, "Our dad came home and told us their house was infested with demons,

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 "and that the boy, the son, was possessed by a demon,"

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 which is not a comforting thing to hear.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 "And so the dad did an exorcism on the son and pulled the demon out of his son's body.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 "I release you out of my son."

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 But there were still demons all over the house.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 At that point, Christopher Daughtry started handing out weapons,

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 and he told his daughter, who was in the firing position,

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 "If anyone enters the house, you kill them."

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 He got taken to the hospital, right?

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 That's not something the cops are gonna be like.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 We'll come back to ask more questions later.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 They have a thing called the Baker Act, where you can actually hospitalize someone against their will

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 if you think they're a danger to others.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He was also fired from his job as a sheriff's deputy.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But not because of this.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Not because of this, by the way.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 This didn't get him fired.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 He got fired for bad performance at work.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So basically, he's like misfiling paperwork.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 They're like, "Can you go make copies of all this evidence?"

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 He's like, "Yeah, boss, sure."

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 He's putting it in the shredder.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 They're like, "Christopher!"

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 He's walking around with a burrito and his holster.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 They're like, "Where's your pistol?"

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 He's like, "Oh, no, I ate it."

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 I don't know. I don't think he's a cartoon character.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But they didn't fire him for performing exorcisms,

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 which I guess probably isn't a fireable offense.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It's probably a hireable offense.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You're like, "Oh, you can perform exorcisms?"

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 That's dope. Put that on your resume.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He did get charged, though. He did get arrested for child abuse.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And I don't think it was...

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 He might have been doing some punching the demon out of a kid or something like that.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 But I think child abuse, I think it's kind of a catch-all.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And it would include mental abuse.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 If you're telling your kids, like, there's...

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I think even if you told your kids your house was haunted and there were demons everywhere,

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I don't think that's child abuse.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I think giving your children weapons and telling them to shoot people who come in the house,

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 that's... I'm not an expert of the law,

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 but I'm pretty sure that's what he got charged with.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But, yeah, so anyways, he's in jail. He was arrested for that.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It's interesting because the police, when they're giving their statement on it,

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 they're like, he was fired for an unrelated offense due to job performance

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 and that ended with saying, we hope this guy gets some help.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So I'm wondering if they saw warning signs along the way,

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 where he'd be at work, and he'd be trying to perform exorcisms on stuff.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 He's pulling the jelly out of a jelly donut with just his mind.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 They're like, Christopher, how do you do that?

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 He's like, I don't know. Who knows.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 But apparently that's on the level of pulling the demon out of a human body.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But anyways, a bizarre story.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And luckily, luckily, that girl didn't open fire.

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 That girl must have been smart enough to know her dad was going crazy

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 because you give a gun to a kid and you tell them,

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 if anyone comes in the house, you shoot them.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And that's why I don't know if Christopher opened the door or not.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I don't know if the cops had to kick it down or something like that,

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 but that girl, who had that rifle trained, ready to shoot, didn't pull the trigger.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And the most mysterious part about the story that I couldn't find in the articles I read,

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 was set off the residential alarm.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Because remember, that's what brought, this was ongoing in this house.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 That's what brought the cops was the alarm going off.

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You got to wonder what would have happened here if that alarm hadn't gone off.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It turns out there may not have been a demon in the house, but a guardian angel,

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 protecting the lives of those two kids and anyone else who showed up to help.

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Jack, let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter. We are leaving behind Florida.

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 We are headed up to that red marble in the pitch black sky, Mars.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 [MARCHING]

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 We're going through the atmosphere and stuff like that.

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 We're flying out in deep space.

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Hope you brought your space too, because I don't provide oxygen on this show.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It's very, very expensive. Hold your breath if you didn't provide that.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 I recently did an episode last week where we took back Mars from the slave colonies

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 that don't exist up there. The planet exists, but the slave colonies don't.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 But we took them back anyways. We defeated the alien menace.

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And after I did that episode, I got an article from a YouTube listener called Jorge Duarte.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He sent me this article written by Richard Hollingham.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 It was called "How to Overthrow a Martian Dictatorship."

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I thank you so much for sending that article. It was a very, very interesting read.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Jack is flying us over the barren Martian landscape, but all of a sudden we're in the year 2150.

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And we see a glimmering domed city over the horizon.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 [MARCHING]

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 We land. We can breathe now because we're inside this beautiful oxygenated dome.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 We're walking around. And we just see like miners working there. The job, not the kids.

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 We see scientists walking around with beakers and test tubes.

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 It looks like a pretty well put together society.

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And then we hear over a megaphone, "Citizens of Mars Colony, Colony."

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 We can come up with a better name than that.

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 This place is now controlled by the Carpenter Corporation.

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 All dissents is illegal. All laws are things I will make up in the future.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I didn't have time before the revolution. This place is now controlled by me.

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 We're like, "What? What's going on?"

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 At that point we see my great, great future ancestor, descendant, whatever the term is, appear on screen.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And a bunch of dudes start walking around. They're dressed like how you would expect it to be a tolitarian army to be dressed.

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Future imagination, there's been so many through world history. And they're walking around and they're beating up people with truncheons.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And they're kicking over beakers. They leave the miners alone because those guys are kind of tough and they have pickaxes.

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 My great descendant has taken over the Mars colony.

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 This was a really interesting article as we're hiding out in a basement now.

198
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 We're talking really, really softly. We just have candles to light ourselves.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 This was a really interesting article because Richard Hollingham goes over this group called the British Interplanetary Society.

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And they got together and they had a meeting and it was, "How could you overthrow a tolitarian government on Mars?"

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 They were basically wargaming it. They were pretending they were MI6 agents on Earth trying to communicate with colonists on Mars to help free this colony from a dictatorship.

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And it kind of lays a couple things out. One, any violence coming from the government would just be the government walking around with sticks beating you.

203
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 There's just more of them and they have an overwhelming physical force. But if you wanted to fight back against that, the violence you would commit would be devastating to that city.

204
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Case in point, you can have a government rule and area of land. And they have the military might, they have the police might,

205
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 they have the rule of policies and the control of all these aspects. So to fight back in our planet, you would start doing asymmetrical warfare.

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 You'd be blowing stuff up, targeted assassinations, things like that. That wouldn't work in a dome sitting on Mars.

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 One, it's not like you like plan a bomb in a pub and then you run away and the pub blows up. On Mars, it would take out the dome.

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It would take out the dome. There were Basque terrorists back in the 1960s who wanted to blow up some politician driving down the road, some Spanish politician.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 They knew which way he was going to go down the road on a certain day. They packed the sewer with explosives and when they detonated it, the car blew up, of course,

210
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 but then flipped in the air and flew over a city block and landed on the other street a block away.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 If you did that on Mars, everyone's dead. Unless you were trying to kill everyone on Mars, you couldn't do asymmetrical warfare.

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Guns are meant to pre- I remember us talking to a friend of mine at work. We're both really big guys and he was talking about getting a gun.

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I said, "Guns are to protect people like them," as I was pointing out, kind of like the groups of just normal people.

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Guns were built to protect people like them from people like us. We are just big people and if we were in a battlefield or in a contained space or something like that, it's really, really hard to beat us down.

215
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 For an untrained person to fight somebody my size, it's very difficult. So guns were basically invented so someone who is 150 pounds could fight someone my size and to hunt.

216
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But you know what I mean? I mean, there's other, but that's a revolver. That's the purpose of it.

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 If you have 50 soldiers in your local government, your Martian government, with billy clubs, they're going to rule that city.

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 They're not even, if you had like a minor strike, a minor coalition, they're going to be stronger, but you would want to make sure those guys are on your side too.

219
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And if not, you just beat them up with your billy clubs and take their pickaxes or whatever. You want to be able to be shooting guns, like targeted assassinations.

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 What are you going to do? Walk up to the president of Mars and start beating him with a bat. You're like, "three or four more blows and you're finally going to go to the ground as guards are wrestling you."

221
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 It's going to be, if we don't have energy weapons that aren't actually piercing through physical things, it's mostly going to be hand-to-hand or melee combat.

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And you're going to see this theme play out for the rest of this segment, how we're going to see ourselves going backwards to actually move forward into space.

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So these people are theorizing this and they said, "you wouldn't be able to do any sort of bomb attacks. You wouldn't be able to do any asymmetrical warfare."

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 They said, "what happens if the leader doesn't necessarily control the whole Dome City, but controls the air supply?"

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You wouldn't need to actually take political control if you were able to control the vents.

226
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 These are things that you don't have to worry about on earth. If someone takes over a government, if you're lucky, you can just leave the country, go to another country.

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 "What are you going to do? That's it, I'm out of here. Give me my space suit and five years worth of air you're walking around with a three ton container on your back."

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 You're stuck. You're absolutely stuck there. And if he just controls a portion of it, the most important portion of it, water control, air, sewage, anything like that, you're doomed.

229
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And on the flip side, what if you have a terrorist group, you have a totally benign government going on, but someone thinks it's not harsh enough, they need to change their views, they need to do something, they then take over the air supply or simply destroy it.

230
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 The article goes into ways to prevent this in the first place, and this is where I really just started to disagree with them.

231
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I think these ideas are great in principle, but we'll get into why I don't think any of this would work.

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 First off, they said, "You need to have labor unions. If you have labor unions on Mars, that'll be a big buffer against the takeover by a totalitarian government."

233
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 They also said having a free press on Mars would do a lot to stymine a dictatorship, because then people would be reading the Martian Daily each day and they'd be like, "Wait, what? Says this guy's a bad guy. You're a bad guy."

234
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And he's like, "Oh, what? Oh, man. Okay, guys, knock off the whole people in the street thing that needs to be said we're a bad guy."

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 They also said the government of Mars, or this colony, should be based on the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution.

236
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Here's a quote from the conference organizer Charles Cockell. He's a professor of astrobiology.

237
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 "We need to arrive at a balance between a society that maximizes civil liberties, but also maximizes the potential for people to survive the lethal conditions of space."

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 This wouldn't work at all. These guys sitting around playing war games with their astrobiology degrees, which I'm sure I'm not like, "Why they went to college?"

239
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 This wouldn't work. I guess I am kind of saying this. This wouldn't work and I'm going to tell you why. If a colony arose on Mars, it's going to be a hell hole.

240
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Think about it this way. The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, was crafted over time, but it didn't show up on the Mayflower.

241
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Early settlers in a country can't have freedom of speech. They can't have the right to disagree with the local leaders.

242
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 You have to go there as one unit. You can't go there and get there and be like, "You know what? I think that I want to have a society where we follow this new religion I just made up. You'd be ostracized from the colony."

243
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 If 200 people show up at a location and 20 of them decide to follow a different path, that colony will collapse.

244
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 You would have to go to this colony with one goal, with one singular mindset. It would have to be everyone of the same philosophical makeup, everyone of the same religious makeup, everyone with the same idea.

245
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Because if you went up there and someone goes, "I want to start doing this differently," it will collapse. This idea of having this dream society on Mars wouldn't work.

246
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 200? 300 years after people had already been chilling on Mars? Perfect. You can start coming up with all of this freedom, which I love.

247
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 See, this is the thing which is funny. I love the Bill of Rights. I think all of those are very important.

248
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Also, here's the thing. When you go up there, you're like, "Yeah, we're based on Bill of Rights, but this thing about the government not putting people in our house," which is like, I think, the Fourth Amendment or something like that, Fifth Amendment.

249
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 The government can't force you to have a British soldier as your roommate. It's super weird. They'll leave that one out.

250
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And then once you start leaving stuff out, it opens the door to leaving even more stuff out. You can't have a Second Amendment on Mars.

251
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 It would actually be counterproductive for everybody to have guns on Mars, like I explained earlier. It would simply destroy the colony.

252
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 You could say you have the right to bear a battle axe or nunchucks or something like that, but most of those weapons, martial weapons, are based on the skill and the strength of the user.

253
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Firearms are based on skill, and even a dummy can learn to pull a trigger. Grouping your shots and stuff like that takes more skill.

254
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But if you get to Mars and you have people from all these different philosophical make-ups, it won't work unless it's money-driven.

255
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 This isn't another idea I have. We think about a bunch of scientists being up there and miners mining rocks and things like that.

256
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 We have this idea of this Star Trek feature. That's not what it's going to be like, either.

257
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I honestly think one way you can make Mars work, and it would be a total hellhole, is if it's like the way that day laborers are in the United States.

258
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 What you have is you have people come from other countries. They work here in barely legal conditions, and they send their money back home.

259
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 You would be shipping people up to Mars for contracts. You'd say, "I'm going to stay up there for two years."

260
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 You don't get to leave. It's almost like a prison sentence, but your money goes back to Earth. Your family back on Earth is going to make a bunch of money.

261
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Because at today's technology, it's a six-month journey, minimum. The farther Mars gets away, which was funny because I made a joke about that in the last episode, but it can take up to a year.

262
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 So they fly you out there. For two years, they provide you room and board and a little bit of entertainment. They'd have some space strippers or something like that.

263
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And the money you get is sent back home. And the reason why that works for everyone, I mean, it sucks for the workers, but the company or the government that's up there knows that these people, they can't really complain.

264
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And the people working there know that the people back home are getting paid fairly well for what they're doing, because it wouldn't be a great job.

265
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 But this idea of people walking around Mars and kind of waving at each other and there's lush green trees underneath the dome sitting and stuff like that, it doesn't work for a long, long time.

266
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 You would have to have a labor force up there. But then I started to think, and they're not going to resist because they're like, "Listen, I only got eight months left."

267
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 It's just the same reason why people don't ride in prison all the time.

268
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I got eight months left, at least I'm not in prison. I can enjoy this amazing view and I'm getting paid like my family's making money. Or when I go back, I'm going to have, you know, 200,000 credits in my account and stuff like that.

269
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 So that's another way this would actually work. One, you send everyone up there who has the same religion, the same philosophical beliefs, the same version of self-sacrifice that we're going to go up there and we're going to bleed and die to make this colony work.

270
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And there will be no free press. There will be none of these freedoms because those are actually counterintuitive to a stage one colony. It just simply doesn't work.

271
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 We're going to be going up there, we're going to be trapped. And I try to compare this to Antarctica. If you go to Antarctica, it's a two-day trip by boat or two-hour plane ride.

272
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 We're talking about six months to a year. And Antarctica, that's what they do. They don't let a bunch of people go over there.

273
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And it's not like the real world or big brother where they try to get people with different ideas. No. We're going to take a bunch of highly trained American scientists and put them in a base full of other American scientists.

274
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 They don't go, "Well, let's see what happens if we cram a couple philosophers in there. Let's throw in some people who don't have a scientific degree, but they're just curious about the world."

275
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It wouldn't work because you're isolated. And that's only a two-hour trip by plane. You never know if the plane's going to be able to get there. But even in Antarctica, they're very, very homogenized.

276
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Like, here's the Finnish station, here's the American station. And even over there when I was researching, I guess people are constantly getting kicked out of Antarctica for like, when they're like beating each other up, very rarely.

277
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 They don't have a lot of crime in Antarctica. But they'll like take dirt bikes they'll take. I didn't even know they had, these would work in Antarctica.

278
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 They were saying that people were taking motorbikes and driving around Antarctica, like running over like ancient Lychun or Lichun, ancient moss, hitting penguins, doing donuts around penguins, scaring them, making them lay a bunch of eggs.

279
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And they could kick out of Antarctica for that, even. So imagine what you'd be doing on Mars in that dune buggy. So you could do a labor force that's just manual labor. You could do what they do in Antarctica.

280
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 You could have highly trained people up there. You couldn't combine them because that would cause immediate stress between the two groups.

281
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 So you could either have a research station where everyone up there is an egghead, or you could have a mining station where everyone up there is basically like, I'm doing my two year stint, I'm getting back home, my money's getting paid to my family, things like that.

282
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And these problems are even worse when we start looking at generation ships. The secret's to faster than light travel. Hypothetical would be awesome if we overcame them, but until we do, we have to build ships.

283
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 This is kind of the goal. The 100 year ship, the 1000 year ship, we build a ship that can fly for 100 years or 1000 years, and it's constantly being maintained by the people on the ship.

284
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 That's another thing. You could not have people of different dispositions on that ship. You would have to say, guys, no religion on this ship. There's no chapel built onto it, nothing like that.

285
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 You want to pray in the privacy of your own room, that's fine. But there's not going to be any newspapers. This is a ship, its goal is to get from Earth to 1000 years away.

286
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And we can't have someone popping up with some brand new ideas about a space god. You're worshiping the nebula, and all of a sudden you get 10 followers and 30 followers and 50 followers, and that's enough to take over the engineering room.

287
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You would have to completely eliminate religion, you would have to completely, you would basically turn people into robots. And that's when I realized, when I was researching this, humanity has no future in space.

288
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 It really kind of sucks. We always dream about this idea of being on a starship, or walking around an alien planet and looking up. But that's not going to work. It's just not going to work.

289
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 You don't need minors on Mars, you don't need scientists on Mars. We'll have rovers and robots, and maybe a handful of humans, 5, 10 maybe?

290
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And then eventually it'll all be rovers controlled from Earth. We talk about these generation ships, but you cannot strip mankind of religion or philosophy.

291
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Because both of those, I believe, are simply built into the human spirit.

292
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 You can't cram a thousand people on a ship and say, "We're going to send this ship offline for a thousand years, and by the time it gets there, there'll be 10,000 people on the ship and we'll have this new colony."

293
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Because we know, we just know, if you took a thousand people and put them on a cruise ship, and said, "We're going to make this cruise ship and it can't stop for anything, and we're going to sail around the world for three years."

294
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 It would be a cruise ship full of corpses. That's actually a really good idea for a reality show, right?

295
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Humanity can't do that. We're at each other's throats over the dumbest things.

296
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And now we're going to put them in a deep space.

297
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So, the future of space travel is humans sitting in a lab on Earth, watching a monitor.

298
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And that monitor is staring out into the vastness of space.

299
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 The man sitting at that lab, his grandparents weren't even born when that ship was launched from Earth.

300
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And his great, great grandchildren may see that ship land in another star system.

301
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 But when it does land, that world will be explored, catalogued, analyzed, through the eyes of robots.

302
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Humanity is not going to be trapped on Earth because of any sort of technological limitation.

303
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 We're going to be trapped on Earth because we just can't get along for a long enough time to do it.

304
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 We are the ones who are limiting ourselves to only exist on Earth. Until we overcome that craziness that exists inside of us as a species,

305
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 we can look up at the night sky and wonder while the tools of our own creation, the robots, get to enjoy the splendor of the universe.

306
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:55,000

307
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't have to listen to it every day.

308
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 But I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
