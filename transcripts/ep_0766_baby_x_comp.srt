00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 Following episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains violent and disturbing imagery.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 A mysterious radio signal echoes across the ocean.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Who, or what, was behind it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And then we take a look at this saga of Baby X, an unidentified body that was found in a burning barrel.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Were these remains put here by a grieving mother who can no longer take care of her child?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Or does it point to a more sinister answer that Satan worshippers have infected every level of government today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 [music]

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm your host, Jason Garminer. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys had an awesome Halloween and all these other crazy holidays that are coming up.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I heard a little rumor, Thanksgiving may be around the corner, don't tell anyone, but it'll be dope.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 A bunch of cool holidays coming up and I hope you guys ate a bunch of candy.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 There's a listener he's diabetic, he's like, "Ahhh, ahhh."

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 But other than you, other than the listeners who have medical problems, I hope everyone else ate a bunch of candy.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 But speaking of sweetest candy, we got an episode to start. There will be no Patreon pilot.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 There will be no Patreon pilot this episode because this episode is honestly so disturbing.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I didn't want anyone to go, "Oh man, I don't want to be in that episode."

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So you're the pilot. You're the captain today. Don't you feel swell?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I mean, honestly, the second story we're going to talk about is really, really disturbing and not only is it disturbing, I have to keep referencing the crime.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Sometimes I'll tell disturbing episodes, disturbing stories, but this one because...

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 So that's just a fair warning. Let's go ahead. We're going to hop in the Dead Rabbit Robo. Tosh you the oars.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We're all going to be... It's going to be a little team effort. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We're going to row all the way out to the Philippines. Splishity Splash. Row that boat. Splishity Splash.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Keep rowing that boat. We have a theme song going the whole way. So our arms are sore. Our throats, we can't talk.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Our throats are sore from singing all the way across the ocean, but we're here.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We're in the Philippines. Specifically, we're off the coast of Isla Han Samar.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's a little island floating around. It's January 17th, 1993, and we're kind of kicking back. We're fishing.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And all of a sudden the radio goes, "sure."

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 [imitates radio sound]

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Now that's not a muffet. That wasn't a sound of Ernie getting a hold of the controls and Bert's like, "Stop it."

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 That was supposed to be the sound. Let me try this again.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 We're sitting and we're listening to the radio. We're no longer listening to PBS for kids.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 We're tuning through the radio station and we hear a [imitates radio sound]

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I guess that's a little... The point is, it doesn't matter.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 It doesn't matter what puppet or muppet sound was coming out of the radio on January 17th, 1993.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 That one was even less human. January 17th, 1993, off the coast of Isla Han Samar.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 A radio broadcast hijacked every news station for boats off the coast.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And for 17 seconds, there's nothing left but the sound of a man screaming.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 [imitates screaming]

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 That for 17 seconds and then 50% less gonzo on that.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I still imagine when I was screaming, I can still imagine Fuzzy Bear running around with his arms in the air.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 For 17 seconds, they heard the sound of a man screaming and then all the power went out to every single boat off the coast for about a half hour.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 An interesting story. I came across this on the Forty-In map.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 We've talked about it a lot on the show. It was one of those... And the Forty-In map has these.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 It was one of those stories that is fairly detailed. We have a date. We have a specific location.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And we have the story itself. 17 seconds, the sound was heard. The boats were out of commission for 30 minutes.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I could not find any other sources of this story. I love it. If it's true, it's super creepy.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I do want to say this is one reason why it's so important to source things for other paranormal researchers out there.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 It's so important to source things because even if the source was, I heard this from my uncle, the person who put together the Forty-In map,

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 who I've talked to, he's a lovely person, but I'm not specifically talking about this, but going, you know, for everyone in the community,

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 site your sources because it would be great if we could figure this out.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But we can't. We just have this as a source and the Forty-In map has been pretty good to us in the past.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So yeah, just a creepy story that makes you think what could it have been?

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Like, you have to break it down. First off, the radio signal is getting hijacked only on boats to no other radio is picking it up on land, only on boats.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 The signal getting hijacked is possible. That's something that can definitely happen. You need a pretty powerful transmitter to hack through everything,

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 but you know, you can do it. It's been done in radio.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But then you have the man screaming, and that alone, the signal getting hijacked on the boats and the man screaming makes you think

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 someone is being held captive and they're trying to get a message out.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I mean, they were in so much terror once they got the equipment working.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 The only thing they could do was continue to scream where they were like working on the equipment feverishly and they're like hitting buttons,

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 and they're turning all this stuff and then right when they're about to give this detailed message about their location, where they're at,

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 how to rescue them, the bad guys burst through the door and you just hear his screaming, "Ahhhh!"

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So he knows he's gonna get dragged back to Sesame Street. That alone is a creepy incident, but then you have the idea,

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 which this is the, that, that's still a super interesting story if that happened and that's plausible.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 The second part of the story is where you have to go, "Ugh!"

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Like, this is why the source, this is why we like sources, because the second part of the story is when it becomes fantastical.

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Someone's screaming over the radio, that's everyday, that's your morning commute,

69
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 but, and then it's spreading to other radio stations, technically can happen, but then,

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 every boat losing power for the next 30 minutes, which would be chaos, right, in the open seas there, you're flying around,

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 and you have no, you would think it was just you, you would just, "What? That was weird, someone's screaming?"

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Power goes out, but by the time you got the power restored and you go back to the wharf or the fisherman's hideout or wherever they hang out,

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 then you would start comparing notes, "Oh yeah, it sucked, that guy was screaming."

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Power went out and then you'd realize that it spread everywhere.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 That points to a paranormal, like, some sort of ghost, like a man who'd been tortured to death, and his soul took to the radio.

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 He's like, "I always wanted to be a singer!"

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 "Ohh!"

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And that was his last gig before he went to the other side, or like, a guy was being abducted by aliens, and that would also cause,

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 see, I think alien because of all the power going out.

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Alien technology interrupting radio signals and shutting off vehicles, that's like basic, that's like, alien tech 101 type things.

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Ghosts don't normal, ghost will flick your lights and open your doors, they very rarely cut power to your vehicle.

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And that's an interesting question though, could they? If you were trying to outrun a ghost, you're like, "whoa, we got away from him!"

83
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 and then you look and he's hiding under your car.

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So yeah, interesting story, I'd love more sourcing on it, it's definitely creepy, and if true, another reason never to go into a boat.

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I hate the water, there is no, there is no mystery to long time listeners of the show.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I hate water, I hate boats, and now, and now I also hate boat radios.

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So let's go ahead and toss you the, and this is your last warning because it gets pretty grim from here on out,

88
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter, we are leaving behind the Philippines, radio is firmly off, we don't want to hear any spookiness.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 We're flying all the way out to Columbia.

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 [imitates car noises]

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 On October 25th, 2018, very very recent story, October 25th, 2018,

92
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 in the town of Vigia Del Ferrete, that's in Antioquia, Columbia, there's a little house, and in this house, it's bedtime, and there's a five month old child fast asleep.

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 The next morning, the mother wakes up, and the child is gone, snatched, right out of the house.

94
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I was recently reading an editorial the LA Times wrote, it was entitled, "Halloween urban legends can do serious harm, why do we still believe them?"

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And I thought, well, that's a really interesting headline, hopefully the article is just as good, I'm gonna dig into it, maybe it'll have some stuff I can cover on Dead Rabbit Radio.

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 So I started reading this article, and it was a real piece of work, and that's not saying that as a conglomance, sarcasm, fully in charge there.

97
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 It basically stated that it went, it was, basically the gist of it was, starts off by saying, you know, urban legends, spooky stories that everyone shares at Halloween, you know, the type, the things that your uncles are telling, the little kids, or the older brothers are telling their siblings, and these stories just carry on and on throughout generations.

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 We've talked a lot about how urban legends are formed on this show, it's one of, I really love studying urban legends and how they develop.

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And then, the editorial board, they're the ones who are writing this opinion piece, they go off on this super weird tangent, and they go, you speaking of, speaking of which, you wanna hear a wacky urban legend, guys?

100
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Did you know that some people believe child molesters molest more people during Halloween? Well, let me tell you, dear reader of the LA Times, that's not true, child molesters don't molest more people on Halloween, that's an urban legend, and I'm reading this and I'm like...

101
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 What are you talking, I thought this was gonna be about, like, why do we believe stories about the man with the hook in the hand and the lover's lane and the...

102
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 No, it goes on this weird segue saying that child molesters do not molest more children in Halloween, that's an urban legend according to the...

103
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And I've never heard that urban legend, by the way, I've never heard anyone go, sit around and you wanna hear a creepy story for Halloween?

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 One day I was walking down the street and a man grabbed me and pulled me in and I was like, what? I've never heard that urban legend.

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 I know that it happens, right? That's a horrible crime and it happens, but they're saying in this article about urban legends, they say, we need to stop spending so much time, this is true, this is what the LA Times was saying, we need to stop spending so much time and money monitoring child molesters on Halloween,

106
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 because statistically, child molesters do not molest on Halloween.

107
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And then it says that time and money should be used towards... No joke, filling potholes and streetlights, that would be a better use of the city's time than monitoring child molesters on Halloween night.

108
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And I read that and I go, wait, wait, okay.

109
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Let's say that they're correct in child molesters molest less kids. Again, this is, I told you guys, this is a rough one and we have not even started with the story.

110
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Let's take LA Times, 'cause I did, and I was like, that what? So I actually read the study the LA Times was talking about.

111
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 They're saying that child molestations actually go down on Halloween.

112
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 My answer to that, call this crazy, but it doesn't matter when they molest them, they may meet them on Halloween and go, you know, Alexa, save the date, like remind me in a week, because I met all these kids tonight.

113
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So the fact that they're, they're probably not molesting a lot of kids on Halloween, because they're busy making contacts.

114
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So why don't we just continue to spend the law enforcement money? What they do is they, it's called Operation Boo. A lot of cities do this. LA does it.

115
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And they have parole officers show up, they drive through neighborhoods and they look at the houses of child molesters, they can't have their lights on.

116
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Well, maybe they can't have their light, they're like one candle, sir. I think they can have their lights on, but they can't have candy outside, they can't make their house look welcoming.

117
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And the LA Times goes, oh, that's just an urban legend, they're not molesting kids on Halloween. I like how they, they had to get prefacing, not on Halloween.

118
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Like the other 364 days a year, sure, they're total freaks, but not on Halloween.

119
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And then, and then it goes into this segue and it's like, you know what, sometimes these urban legends can get out of control and when things get out of control, what happens if people just rise up and start enacting violence on the people who these urban legends are about?

120
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And I go, yeah, there are a lot of people who want to openly kill child molesters. That's not a secret at all.

121
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And they're not waiting for Halloween and they're not doing it simply because they heard an urban legend that they molest more people on Halloween.

122
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Super bizarre article. Super, super bizarre article and a crazy hot take.

123
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But then it went into another point, this is why we're getting to baby X, it got into this point, after defending the fact that we shouldn't be harassing child molesters on Halloween.

124
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 You're right, maybe we should just harass them every day.

125
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 It said this, hey guys, remember that crazy thing about the Satanic Panic in the 80s and what a bunch of goofballs those weirdos were.

126
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I mean, we knew that was all fake. Who's to say the Satanic Panic won't happen again today?

127
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And I remember, I was reading that article and I thought, you know what, this is interesting because we've mentioned it once or twice on the show.

128
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It's a topic that I've never really delved into because it is so mainstream.

129
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 But when I read that topic, I go, that is not settled history.

130
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 A lot of people like to go, you know, Satanic Panic, it was a bunch of fundamentalists, just crazy people.

131
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And that is not settled history. There is law enforcement, there is psychologists, there are victims and some people who come forward and say they actually took part in these rituals.

132
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 That's not settled science. Some of it, you're right, some of it was outrage and fake outrage and things like that.

133
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 But those are the ones they point to, see? They see these things and they go, look, see, that was totally disproven.

134
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 So it was all fake. It was all made up.

135
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 But then we have stories like the story of Baby X.

136
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 I got most of, ironically, I got most of my information for this story from an amazing article in the Los Angeles Times on May 17th, 1992.

137
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So this is very contemporaries to when the event took place. This article is written by Barry Siegel.

138
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Very, very well written, well researched article. So thank you, Barry.

139
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Your newspaper has taken a slide a bit if they are now advocating for fixing potholes instead of policing child molesters.

140
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 But he wrote this and I wanted to thank him for that.

141
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Let's hop in that carbon helicopter. We're leaving behind Columbia. We're headed all the way out to Rupert, Ohio.

142
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 It's November 17th, 1989 and Rupert, Ohio at the time was one of those highly religious towns.

143
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And when I say highly religious, the town had a population of 13,000 people.

144
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 It had 50 churches and one third of the population of the town was practicing Mormon.

145
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So it's a very, very religious town. And in the 80s, there was this thing called Satanic Panic.

146
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 It's perfect because it rhymes. It makes sense because it rhymes. Don't ask questions, right? It was just a panic.

147
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I remember this stuff in 1989. I don't remember this case specifically, but in 1989, I was 13 and I remember hearing about the Satanic Panic.

148
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 My dad was a Southern minister at the time. It was definitely the forefront of our thoughts that there were saying worshipers trying to take over the country.

149
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And I want to say this too. I'm using the word Satan worshiper and Satanist and stuff like that.

150
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 It's a pejorative and it's a catch-all. I'm not talking about there are, there is the Church of Satan.

151
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And that is an organization and they always go on the record and say we don't condone any of this.

152
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I'm not talking about when I'm saying Satanist and Satan worshiper. I'm not talking about the Church of Satan type of thing.

153
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 But I'm talking about what you picture as a Satanist, as the weirdos in the woods type of thing that engage in child abuse and human sacrifice and things like that.

154
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And that's what the Satanic Panic was all about, was these Satan worshippers.

155
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But on November 17th, 1989, in Rupert, Ohio, in the Minidoka County landfill, there's a metal barrel sitting there.

156
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 In this landfill, people were constantly driving their ATVs by and people would see this barrel, weren't gonna think anything of it.

157
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 One person thought it was like a dryer can left there. One person did stop by looking and it looked like there was a monkey, a little monkey in it.

158
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 A little burned out monkey, but he didn't think anything of it. I mean, I would be super curious if I found a monkey burned or not.

159
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 But eventually, someone did stumble across it and realize that it was worth notifying the authorities, it was the body of a three-week-old infant.

160
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Her body had been burned, but there was still a little fragment of cloth draped over her shoulder.

161
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 When they're doing the autopsy, they could tell that she had been dead before she had been set on fire, which was a small blessing.

162
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Because the other things that happened to her while she was still alive was horrific.

163
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 She had been disemboweled before she died.

164
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Most of her organs were removed, all that was left was her lungs and a piece of her heart.

165
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Both her feet were missing and her left arm appeared to have been torn off.

166
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 The missing body parts were never found.

167
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And to this day, the baby has never been identified. It has gone by the name "Baby X".

168
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So you have this in the height of the satanic panic, you have this burned baby with missing body parts and it's been disemboweled, and the locals absolutely lose it.

169
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 First off, you're not even thinking of the satanic thing. You're thinking, did this baby go missing from somewhere or was it kidnapped?

170
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 With the police, check the missing people reports, there's no missing babies.

171
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 They're visiting local hospitals, they're trying to find mothers who had recently given birth and they're not able to get any leads on who Baby X is and who did this to her.

172
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And the panic is moving through the town. Truly a panic, right? You would be afraid that that would happen to your child or even just anyone's child, the fact that it happened at all.

173
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Now, as they're doing the autopsy, they also can tell this child had pneumonia when she died.

174
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So some people are going, well maybe she just died of pneumonia and there was a mother who freaked out about the whole thing and she wanted to get rid of the baby.

175
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And the mother, not knowing what to do, takes the baby out to this landfill, puts it in a barrel and lights it on fire.

176
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Townspeople go, yeah, maybe, but maybe it's something darker than that. Shortly after the body is found in the entire town, really the entire state is up in arms and this becomes a national news story,

177
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 but shortly after the body is found, there's a letter that's postmarked from Eastern Idaho.

178
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 The police get this letter and they never release it. They decide to go, you know what, we're not going to say, it's probably just a crank, right?

179
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 There are just some weirdo wrote this letter. People were still trying to figure out what was going on. Mostly they were thinking serial killer.

180
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 That was kind of the general consensus, but she did have a contingent of people going, maybe there's something darker going on.

181
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Maybe this is this satanic worshiping conspiracy we've been hearing so much about.

182
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 In 19, a couple months after it happened, there's a boy named Timothy, he's a nine year old boy, and he's currently being treated as a sexual child abuse victim by a psychologist.

183
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And this is when the story takes an incredibly sinister turn.

184
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He begins to talk about ritualistic satanic abuse.

185
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Let me read you some of these quotes here.

186
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 "You put me on a table with a Bible. The devil is there. They pray to the devil. The devil makes these people hurt me. They hurt me so bad. They hurt me in the private parts. They sacrifice all animals. They even sacrifice babies."

187
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Timothy is making these allegations and he actually names his own mother and father in being complicit in these satanic ceremonies.

188
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 The family that Timothy is a part of, even though they don't give Timothy's name, they do give the name of his parents. They keep talking about his dad.

189
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 They are from a very backward part of Rupert, very, very impoverished family.

190
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And so the dad's like saying, "I don't know where my son's getting this. I'm definitely not a saint worshiper." And the town is terrified.

191
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Now child services, they don't know what to make of this. They actually are trying to get Timothy removed from the home because they go,

192
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 "They may be involved in a murderous cult we don't know." And they were stymied at every corner.

193
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 They were not allowed to remove the son from the household. So that's going on. And now the satanic panic is in full swing in Rupert.

194
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Everyone's going around believing that the saint worshippers are controlling everything because they can't get this kid removed.

195
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 That's one of the allegations going on that it's not just some saint worshippers in the middle of nowhere.

196
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 These people have infested the highest levers of Rupert society.

197
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 They've been led to the police to open any sort of investigation.

198
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You of course had officers that were like, "Yeah, we think baby X may have been a murder."

199
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 But to get stuff officially done, everyone was dragging their feet.

200
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Everyone was going out. It was probably just pneumonia and then wolves, natural predators, got the hold of the rest of it.

201
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Just investigate. And well, you know, it's probably just pneumonia. It's probably just in a barrel if it was really some saint thing.

202
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 You think they put it in a barrel? And so they were really dragging their feet and that was making people even more suspicious.

203
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And then on September 13th, 1991, the letter that the police got shortly after the baby was found is printed in the South Idaho Press.

204
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 This letter is written by an anonymous person and it is the first real theory that this...

205
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Because remember, they got this letter shortly after the baby was found and this was putting it clearly in.

206
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 This was a satanic ritual and I know because I've been a member of satanic rituals.

207
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And it said, "Back in the year 1975, I actually took part in similar rituals."

208
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 I will not tell you my name because it will probably lose my job and I'll probably get my head chopped off and my family will be in danger as well.

209
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Many goes on to say, "Listen, I know you're scouring the hospitals looking for the mother. Stop. You're not going to find the mother in a hospital."

210
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 That's not how this operation works. And then the letter goes on to say, "Know that in many cases women were used as breeders for the seed of Satan."

211
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 "Many times, due to the amount of drugs used to keep them in line, the babies are born severely mentally disabled."

212
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 "Many made only mewing sounds."

213
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 "Babies were born in the compound and no records were ever kept."

214
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 "Many times the mothers only lived in a nightmare world and cannot tell you about their child or believe it was all dreams."

215
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Unquote.

216
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And the police sat on that. They got that letter and it's sensational, obviously, right?

217
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And they go, "That's probably just some crackpot thing." But then two years later in 1991, it gets published, which just throws more fuel on the fire.

218
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And it feels more fuel on the fire that they're covering it up.

219
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Because at this point, remember, this crime happened back, what was it, November 1989.

220
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 We're now, September 13, 1991. There's been no progress made on the case.

221
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 You can't identify the baby. You can't identify the mother.

222
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Like, if they had found something in the meantime, it would have made everything, oh, maybe it wasn't the money we were able to find the mother.

223
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 She was a grieving mom, da-da-da-da. No, there's been no movement on the case.

224
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 People are digging their heels in and not wanting to investigate the case.

225
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And then it turns out shortly after the body was found, some, and again, is the letter true? We don't know.

226
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 But it doesn't help that people were thinking it was saying worshiping, and the police were saying it's not.

227
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And then it turns out that they did get a letter saying that it may be.

228
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And they sat on it.

229
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 In the end, after years of investigations and people like, "Yeah, maybe we should kind of have an official thing."

230
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 No one was ever charged with anything.

231
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 The mother was never identified. The baby was never identified.

232
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 They did name her Christina Angelica James, and they gave her a little tombstone.

233
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Like, I mean, that is... I mean, if you're gonna get that, that's the least they could do, right?

234
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But it's not enough. Who did this? The official answer?

235
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 pneumonia? That was the official answer that the city went with.

236
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Police investigators said, "This is what happened. They have no proof of this."

237
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But they'll say this is what happened. The baby got pneumonia and died.

238
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And the mother didn't know what to do. It was really the explanation they were peddling early on in the investigation.

239
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 They go, "The baby got pneumonia and died. Mother didn't know what to do."

240
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Dumped the baby. Every other injury was predator related.

241
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Who burned it? The mom, right? Sometimes they go, "Maybe she... he wasn't burned. Maybe he just had some skin missing and looked like it was burned."

242
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 So that was their official conclusion. Maybe it wasn't even burned.

243
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Maybe it was just all predators. Predators all the way down.

244
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And you could look at that and you could go, "Well, Jason, that is rational."

245
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And that's something you talk about on this show. Sometimes you have to take the rational answer, even if it's not the cool answer or the creepy answer or whatever.

246
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And that's true. That's true.

247
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And so is this just another case of satanic panic?

248
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Is this case actually show that maybe it is settled, Jason?

249
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Maybe that this story shows that it is settled history. You had a town that believed it was satanic.

250
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 They started to see saint worshipers on all level of society. They just needed to trust the facts.

251
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 They had trust the facts they would have known early on that it was pneumonia.

252
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 But they let satanic panic take hold of the town. Doesn't this kind of show your point that sometimes these things get out of hand?

253
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 October 25th, 2018.

254
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 We're in Vigia del Furete. That's in Antioquia, Colombia.

255
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 A five-month-old child is snatched out of his house.

256
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Middle of the night. Truly a mother's nightmare. Any parent's nightmare. An uncle's nightmare.

257
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Horrifying somebody comes into your house and takes a child.

258
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 The next day, though, a little baby's found.

259
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 He's found in the forest surrounding this little town. He's found. This little boy is okay.

260
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Now, how he got out of the house, they don't know how he ended up so far away, you know?

261
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 But it's a miracle, you're not asking questions.

262
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 October 26th, 2018. One day later.

263
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 The boy is snatched out of his house. Again.

264
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And this time when they find him, this five-year-old child was beheaded and disemboweled.

265
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 This little boy's heart and intestines were ripped out of his body.

266
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And one of his arms was torn off as well.

267
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Everyone in town is outraged at this inhuman act.

268
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And some of them believe that this is the work of a madman.

269
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 I mean, who else but an insane person could do this to a child or to anybody?

270
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Some of the townspeople believe it's something darker than that. It was a supernatural force.

271
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Maybe working with a human, maybe working alone.

272
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 But this savagery goes beyond humans. This has to be something far more evil.

273
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Local law enforcement says, oh, this was the work of a predator.

274
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Obviously what happened to this child after its head had been removed,

275
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 it's been disemboweled and its arm is missing and it was snatched out of the same house twice.

276
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 This was clearly the work of some sort of predator in the jungle, some sort of beast.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Make sure to lock your doors and windows.

278
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 But be well aware that the local police department here in town will keep looking for the answer.

279
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And that's actually how the article ends, this article from 2018.

280
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 The investigation is ongoing and no arrests are believed to have been made.

281
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 That is how an article in 2018 ends.

282
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 As far as the government's concerned, case closed.

283
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Panther got in to the house twice.

284
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 One time didn't kill the baby. One time did.

285
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Stopped its head off, it's kind of hard for a panther or a jaguar to do.

286
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 But don't worry people, just the predator.

287
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Now I could point out the similarities between the death of this child in Columbia and the death of baby X.

288
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 They will continue to tell us not to worry that everything is under control.

289
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 The question we have is who's control.

290
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 I do think they exist. I do think they exist and I do think they wield a lot of power.

291
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And I think they especially wield a lot of power in small towns.

292
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Where you can easily take control of a city council with four votes, four to three, everything you want gets passed.

293
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 To run a town, you have a city council, usually like seven people.

294
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 If you got three people in a city council in your pocket, you're already going to have a really good time.

295
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 But if you can get all four, everything you want is passed.

296
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And I'm not saying they're going to start passing baby burning ordinances.

297
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Not everything the same worshipers do has to be super evil, but they're just consolidating their power.

298
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Really all you would need is at least one officer, one police officer, preferably like the chief of police.

299
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 But there are towns where the Chamber of Commerce runs the town.

300
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And the police just do what the Chamber of Commerce says.

301
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 And the mayor just kind of, you know, they run the town.

302
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Now no one thinks about that when they're electing who's going to be in the Chamber of Commerce.

303
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 You elect this person, you're elected, no, no, they don't run the Chamber of Commerce runs the town.

304
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 That's very common in small towns in America.

305
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 So you don't need everyone.

306
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 If you had the mayor and you had the chief of police and you had the coroner and you had, yeah, that's even better if you're taking notes saying worshipers are trying to conquer the world.

307
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 But you don't need everyone.

308
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And I'm going to tell you right now, because I've done a lot of research into Satanism.

309
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 To me it's such a basic topic. I don't talk about it much on this show.

310
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I've done a ton of research on Satanism and Satan worshipers.

311
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 What's interesting is I can tell you, and this is probably almost to be a bonus segment, we're going to go long in this episode,

312
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I can tell you how people get sucked into these things.

313
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Because you hear, here's the thing, if someone walked up to you and said, "Would you like to burn a baby today?"

314
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I hope that I see you in the news.

315
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Because you beat that guy up, right? I just think that I would hope that would happen.

316
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Maybe push him at least. Give him a good shove. You don't want to go to jail.

317
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 But I mean, if you're in Yellowstone Park and you happen to shove him into a geyser that is fine with me.

318
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 So, but what you do is you seek people who want power.

319
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 You're not going to go to the local elementary school teacher and ask,

320
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 "How would you like to join a satanic coven?" You're going to look for people who are power driven and are sick.

321
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Because again, you may have someone who's a local politician who just wants to be a state senator and stuff like that.

322
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 But if they have a certain moral compass, they will eventually go,

323
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 "No, I'm not comfortable doing that." Because it doesn't start with the burning baby.

324
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 That's the thing. It's always, it's an escalation.

325
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And you go, "Jason, how in the world do you escalate from not burning babies to burning them?"

326
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 It's a matter of degrees. That's not a joke. That wasn't a temperature joke. It's a matter of degrees.

327
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 When someone comes to you and talks about their religion, any religion, they don't start off with the goofiest stuff.

328
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 They don't start off with the weirdest stuff. If I walk up to someone and want to start talking about the message of Jesus Christ,

329
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I'm not going to tell them the story of Madshack, Madshack and Bindigo or whatever those dudes were,

330
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 who were like, throwing into a cage full of lions or they were set on fire or both, and they didn't get killed.

331
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 You want to know more about Jesus? People are like, "What? That's weird."

332
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 I was like, "Oh yeah, there's that time Jesus walked on water." And they're like, "Huh?"

333
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 That guy got swallowed by that fish and they're like, "Are you sure you're just not telling the Vlad of Anarchy?"

334
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I was like, "No, no." And then Jesus told a thousand lies and his nose grew all the way up to heaven.

335
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Now, you start off with the important stuff, right? The good stuff. Jesus died for your sins.

336
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 That's pretty... He comes back to life saying that it all makes sense, right? I believe it.

337
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 It doesn't all make sense. People can be skeptical about it, but you don't start up...

338
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 There's even weirder things in the Bible, so when you're trying to incorporate someone into your Satanic coven,

339
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 you probably don't even use the word "Satanic Coven."

340
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 This guy's just hanging out with you. You find someone who wants power. You can sense it in them.

341
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 You can really sense people who are driven. You sense it in them and he has something you want.

342
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 He may have a position you want or he may have access to the funds you want.

343
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Any cult worth their salt does this. You can find cults all over the world.

344
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 The first thing they do is they take all the money from people, but you can't take money from poor people.

345
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 That's why a lot of cults don't recruit poor people. They want that cash.

346
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 So a Satan worshiping group, this type of group, would do the same thing, but for power.

347
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 They're looking for people with power. They have access to the money.

348
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 They already have a guy working in the bank. They already have a guy working in this loan company.

349
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Right now, they're trying to take over this town and they see you.

350
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 And they want you to join their organization.

351
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 You're like, "Jason, I never would do that. This is a horrific story. I never want to be at something that happens like Baby X.

352
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 This is awful." But again, they don't start off there.

353
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 They'll first make sure that you're just kind of a good person.

354
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 Again, when I say good, when I say good in this context, bad.

355
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 They want somebody super disgusting, but they may start off by just slowly seeing what your comfort level is.

356
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 With making disgusting off-color jokes, which I mean everybody does that.

357
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But saying worshipers would be particularly disgusting.

358
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 And they're constantly playing this game with you. They're seeing what your limits are and how much you're willing to do for power.

359
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 We see this a lot in Hollywood too, but instead of satanic abuse, it's sex abuse.

360
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 Where you get these young men and women who want to be pop superstars,

361
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 where the agent or manager, whoever it will be, will be like, "Hey, you have a meeting. You have a meeting.

362
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 You've got to meet with this guy and you go in there and the manager puts his hand on your knee."

363
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 And do you pull away your 16-year-old girl guy? This happened to Backstreet Boys, actually.

364
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 It was a huge story. The Backstreet Boys were all sexually molested by their manager.

365
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 What was it? Lou Pearlman? Ron Pearlman? It was not Ron Pearlman. He did not do that.

366
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 That's another thing. I think it was Lou Pearlman. Again, you don't walk in and Lou Pearlman is naked.

367
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 If you put your hand on the knee, you test it. And if the kid gets up and be like, "I don't want this," then that kid's career is over.

368
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Nobody ever starts the career off with a dick in their mouth, basically.

369
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And if you asked any of those kids, "Hey, you can be a big pop superstar, but you've got to blow this dude, this big, ugly dude."

370
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 It wouldn't have mattered if he was hot, I guess. Probably not. But would you do it?

371
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And a person would go, "No, I wouldn't do that." But by the time the dick's in your mouth, you've made so many deals with the devil.

372
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And that's why when musicians, and you'll see entertainment people go like Katy Perry, goes, "I made a deal with the devil."

373
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 And people go, "Oh, she's admitting that she made a deal with the devil." That's not literally what she's saying.

374
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 She sold out so many times. She was a Christian singer when she started.

375
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I'll do pop music and sing the song about kissing girls and stuff like that."

376
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 And you sell your soul for fame, right? She became a sex symbol. And maybe she didn't want to become a sex symbol.

377
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Maybe she just wanted to play the piano and sing beautiful songs, but she wanted that fame.

378
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 So you never start your career with a dick in your mouth.

379
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 And in the sane worshiping thing, you never start by burning the baby. It's a matter of degrees.

380
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 I remember once a long time, I can't find it again. I can't find it again.

381
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And part of me is probably thankful for that. I found this document written by...

382
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 It was like this Satanist was on his deathbed.

383
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 And he was based out... I think it was based out of Australia. And he wrote this long...

384
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 You know, it's interesting with sane worshipers when they do believe that they sold their soul to Satan,

385
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 and they are in constant fear of going to hell, and, you know, eternal damnation.

386
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 And they say to them, "We'll talk about trying to gain God's trust again, and try to regain their soul."

387
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 And they always talk about these horrible nightmares they suffer when they're in that process.

388
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 And the nightmares are God telling them, "You've already done so much evil stuff. I'll never forgive you for what you did."

389
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And that was kind of the gist of this guy's letter, was saying, like, "I'm trying to talk to God, and God won't talk to me."

390
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 That's a Satanic illusion, right? That's a Satanic illusion. Obviously God's going to forgive this dude, but...

391
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 He's just full of fear. But I remember, I remember in this letter he wrote.

392
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 He wrote a line of "Never Forgotten It," which is ironic because of what the line's about.

393
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 He was talking about this how you slowly get indoctrinated into this lifestyle,

394
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 where you just become more and more powerful, and you keep doing more and more brutal things,

395
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 and you get more and more powerful. He said he was at the ceremony once, and he saw...

396
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 He'd already... This guy was at the top level of his profession, according to him, right?

397
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 The whole thing could be fake, but according to him, he was at the top level of his profession.

398
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 He was incredibly wealthy. He had done and seen horrible things through this rise of power.

399
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 He's part of the Satanic cult, and he remembers this out of everything.

400
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 He said that he saw a infant crucified, a little cross and a little baby crucified on it,

401
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 and then he was instructed to kill the baby.

402
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 To kill this baby strapped to this cross, and he said...

403
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 I haven't read this article in probably 15, 20 years, but I remember this quote,

404
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 "You will never, ever forget kicking a baby to death."

405
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 I do believe these groups exist, and I do believe that there are monsters out there.

406
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Who would join these groups to become more powerful?

407
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 They don't know in the beginning that they're going to be standing around a barrel

408
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 as an infant's body is burning. They don't know that in the beginning,

409
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 but they know it now.

410
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 And all the townspeople who were standing around watching that child burn,

411
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 they knew that night.

412
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 This was not the end.

413
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 This was only just another grisly sacrifice they were making to a dark god.

414
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 For us, the story of Baby X ends inconclusively,

415
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 but for the members of this cult, they're still in power.

416
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 They're still protected, and they're still out there.

417
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Or is this all just an urban legend?
