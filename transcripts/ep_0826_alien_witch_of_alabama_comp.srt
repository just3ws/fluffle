1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 When a young man wakes up to get ready for work one day, he has no idea he's about to

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,000
 leave his house and step into an alternate reality.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,760
 And then we travel to Alabama in the 1930s to take a look at a group of FBI agents who

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,240
 had a showdown with an alien witch today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,960
 Hope you guys had a really, really fun weekend.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
 What is it?

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,520
 It's Super Bowl Sunday.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
 So there's that.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
 Valentine's Day is coming up.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
 So that's...

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,680
 You're like Jason will listen to this episode in August of the year 2025.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,520
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,320
 But for those of you who listen to it, most of you guys listen to it as the episode's

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
 coming out.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,000
 For those of you guys who are listening to these episodes coming out, I have a Valentine

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,400
 Day recommendation for you.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,280
 Do not watch the movie Death on the Nile.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
 I watched it like I went on a date last night.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,880
 The movie is about a man who catches a grenade in the face and blows his face off and then

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,520
 he throws a mustache to cover up this hideously scarred face of his.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
 And then he solves mysteries.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,560
 Now you're like Jason that sounds like the best day movie ever.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
 What do you mean?

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
 It was so dumb.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
 How often do I actually review bad movies on this podcast?

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
 I never do.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,040
 So when I'm saying it's bad, when I'm actively saying stay away from Death on the Nile, it's

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,600
 the origin story of a man's mustache.

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 It's so bizarre.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
 The special effects are really bad.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,560
 You're like Jason, this is about a heck of a Christie.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
 What are you talking about?

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
 Special effects?

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
 Grenades?

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
 Awful.

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
 Do not watch Death on the Nile.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,400
 Dead Rabbit recommends saving your money and not watching that, but someone I always

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,600
 recommend hanging out with coming into Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,560
 It's one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,120
 Give it up for Cindy Perrera.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
 Woo!

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
 Yeah, come on in.

47
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,040
 She has tickets for Death on the Nile.

48
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,560
 We're pushing her back out.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,760
 Cindy, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,160
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

51
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,880
 Just help spread the word about the show.

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,480
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

53
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,720
 Now, Cindy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,360
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,800
 We are driving all the way out to the state of Illinois.

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,520
 If you ever want to watch a movie where Gal Gadot is not sexy, watch Death on the Nile.

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,720
 Nobody was sexy in the movie.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
 It was super weird.

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,760
 At one point, they're standing on this Egyptian monument.

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,040
 It's like King Tut's Tomb.

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,000
 And she's like, "Ride me like a horse.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Ride me like a horse."

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
 And she's like rubbing her butt up against some dude.

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,000
 The movie is incomprehensible.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,360
 You're like, "Jason, you're clearly making this stuff up.

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
 Is this some sort of bit?"

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
 No!

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,840
 Okay, Cindy, let's go ahead and stop the car here in Illinois.

69
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,320
 It's October 2021.

70
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,680
 This guy, you know, it's so funny because we cover these stories.

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
 They're all spectacular.

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
 Like, I try to go out of my way to find the best stories.

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,960
 But sometimes the authors can kind of shoot themselves in the foot.

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,920
 In this case, this is a really interesting story.

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 I love this one.

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,440
 But the guy who posted this goes by the name "Chief To Balls."

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,360
 And it's really hard to take this story seriously knowing that it's written by a guy named "Chief

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
 To Balls."

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,440
 But that actually does play a part in how the story ends.

80
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 You'll see.

81
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,120
 It'll be weird how we finish the story out.

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,840
 The story itself is quite bizarre.

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,320
 October 2021, we're in the state of Illinois.

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,640
 And "Chief To Balls," let's call him "Chucky."

85
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,000
 No, let's not do that.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Let's call him "Charles."

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,800
 "Charles is 26 years old.

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
 He wakes up and he does the regular regal maroll.

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
 We all do.

90
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 Ooh!

91
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
 Regain consciousness.

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
 Walk around.

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
 Time for breakfast."

94
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,400
 Now, like a man after my own heart, this guy, he eats his breakfast.

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
 He goes to get breakfast.

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,460
 He's all walking past his kitchen.

97
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
 Not today.

98
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
 Food.

99
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,040
 Before he drives to the local gas station and his breakfast, what he eats all the time

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,080
 is donuts and Pepsi.

101
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
 That's awesome, right?

102
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,000
 First off, I can totally relate to this dude.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I was like, "Yep.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Yep."

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 That's his goal.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 He's going to go to the gas station, get donuts and Pepsi like he does every morning.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,920
 And he's sitting in his car and he puts on his mask and he walks into the gas station

108
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,120
 and he stops.

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 And he realizes he's standing in this gas station with his mask on due to the COVID

110
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,940
 mandates.

111
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,700
 Everyone else in the gas station is not wearing a mask.

112
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
 What?

113
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,780
 It's kind of weird.

114
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,820
 He's just kind of walking through the aisles to get his donuts and his Pepsi.

115
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,940
 Now when he's writing this report, again, this is kind of a throwaway line.

116
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,700
 I actually had to go back and look for it, but it'll come into play later.

117
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,580
 As he's walking through the store, as he's writing this narrative, he says, "Listen,

118
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,400
 I don't think masks work personally, but I just wear a mask to avoid confrontation just

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,040
 so I'm not getting stopped by clerks or having someone yell at me.

120
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,400
 I don't believe they work though."

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
 That's what he's saying.

122
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,360
 But now as he's walking through the store, people are looking at him like, "He's the

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
 weirdo.

124
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,600
 No one else in this gas station is wearing a mask."

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 And he is.

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,000
 So he's trying to avoid confrontation and now he looks like, at the very least, he hasn't

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,360
 heard that the mandate was lifted or something like that, but he thinks it's really weird.

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,140
 No one else is wearing a mask.

129
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:43,340
 He gets his donuts and his Pepsi and he goes to work, walks into his place of employment,

130
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,460
 nobody is wearing a mask at work.

131
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,340
 We're so used to seeing people with masks indoors and outdoors.

132
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,300
 So when he walked into the gas station, that was unnerving.

133
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,140
 When he walked into his work and they weren't wearing masks, super unnerving.

134
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,860
 And you would figure if the mandates were coming down, you would have known about it

135
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,760
 on the news, your coworkers, your boss would have been saying on this day we're going to

136
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,360
 stop wearing masks.

137
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
 But that's not the case.

138
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,440
 He just walks into these places, no one's wearing masks and he figures, "I might be

139
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,160
 in an alternate dimension."

140
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,400
 Not that I haven't been following the news and my state or my area lifted the mask mandate.

141
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,920
 Something even more bizarre is going on.

142
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,840
 He excuses himself to go to the bathroom and he pulls out his phone and he types in COVID-19.

143
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,300
 No search results.

144
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,100
 He's scrolling through Google, nothing.

145
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,500
 He found himself waking up into a world where COVID did not exist.

146
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,020
 It rattles his brain.

147
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,020
 Cannot figure this out.

148
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,860
 He comes out of the bathroom and he walks up to a friend of his at work and he goes,

149
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,580
 "Hey, why isn't everyone wearing their masks?"

150
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,180
 And his coworkers looking at him.

151
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,280
 "Charles, wearing a face mask at work."

152
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,720
 And the friend goes, "What in the world are you talking about, dude?"

153
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,000
 He's like, "Why aren't you wearing a mask?

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 What about the COVID-19?"

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,200
 He's like, "I have no idea what you're talking about."

156
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,520
 And at that point Charles goes, "You know what?

157
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
 I'm not feeling good.

158
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
 I'm headed on out.

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
 I'm going to take an early day."

160
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
 People are like, "Yeah, leave.

161
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
 Why do you have a mask?

162
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,480
 You're obviously sick."

163
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,720
 So he goes home and he thinks he's going insane.

164
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
 He's like, "I know for a fact."

165
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,380
 But for the past two years there's been a virus known as COVID-19 and we've all had

166
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,340
 to wear these masks.

167
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
 But no one else.

168
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,580
 He's all driving by playgrounds and kids don't have masks on.

169
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,180
 People are two feet apart just breathing into each other's faces.

170
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,500
 He's like, "No masks.

171
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 No masks."

172
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,700
 He drives home and the bed, this is the most obvious cure for insanity, right?

173
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,260
 He takes a nap.

174
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,340
 If you ever think you're going insane, just sleep it off.

175
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
 Just sleep it off.

176
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,940
 He wakes up from his nap.

177
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,700
 COVID exists again.

178
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,120
 He knows immediately because the world's a lot more depressing.

179
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
 He wakes up.

180
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,560
 He's like, "Oh, everything's grayscale.

181
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
 Great.

182
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
 COVID's still here."

183
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 He realizes then when he goes out people are wearing masks and stuff like that.

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,400
 Like a day or two later he returns back to work.

185
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,600
 This is such an interesting thing.

186
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,120
 So let me stop here for a second because right now we have a typical alternate universe story.

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,480
 We've covered stuff like this before on the show and I love these type of things where

188
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,360
 this guy shifts into another reality.

189
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,140
 I'll try to find some of those other episodes, but we cover it quite a lot.

190
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,380
 And then he comes back to our reality reports his tale.

191
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,860
 So obviously the story could be completely made up, whatever.

192
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
 We're a paranormal podcast.

193
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,180
 We're going to look at it on other factors.

194
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,580
 He shifts to this other reality and comes back and he posts this story.

195
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,500
 And where we're about to go with this is really, really interesting because we get some follow-up.

196
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,980
 When he posts this story, two things happen.

197
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,000
 First off it becomes a huge debate about whether or not masks are effective.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,920
 So I mean that was most of the comments was people going back and forth about all that.

199
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,400
 This guy teleported to another reality and he's posting this in a paranormal forum and

200
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,520
 people are like "Boo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."

201
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,240
 Guys keep your eye on the prize, right?

202
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
 Keep your eye on the prize.

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,120
 But other people, other people realize this guy may have shifted realities and they started

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,840
 asking follow-up questions and they said, "I would not have thought about this.

205
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,300
 This is so interesting."

206
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,740
 People go, "Well, eventually you went back to work, right?

207
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,980
 What happened then?"

208
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,420
 This is really, really cool.

209
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,420
 So Charles goes back to work like a day or two later.

210
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:44,700
 He's at work and he talks to the same coworker he met in the alternate reality.

211
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,420
 And he walks up to his coworker and goes, "Hey, the other day, remember when I went home

212
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,300
 early and the coworker goes, "Yeah, I remember that."

213
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,040
 The coworker goes, "Yeah, you came into work and you looked really confused and you were

214
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,680
 like really pale.

215
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
 You looked sick.

216
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,400
 You honestly looked sick."

217
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,800
 And you walked up to me and you started asking me about COVID-19 and masks and I was like,

218
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,560
 "What in the world are you talking about?"

219
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,880
 And then you just kind of stuttered a bit and said you didn't feel well and you left.

220
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,280
 And I was like, "What in the world?"

221
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,520
 But in this reality, that conversation took place, the coworker was wearing a mask.

222
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,860
 So the reality is so fascinating.

223
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:35,340
 The realities were so close to each other that the same conversation took place in both realities.

224
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,740
 But in the one reality, if someone walked up to you today and said, "Hey, have you heard

225
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
 of a thing called COVID-19?"

226
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
 You'd be like, "What?

227
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
 What are you talking about?

228
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
 You're idiot.

229
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,240
 Yes, I've heard of that."

230
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,880
 You want to be like, "Is that some obscure band, Pitchfork, as reviewed in their latest

231
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
 issue?"

232
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
 You would know.

233
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,960
 So if someone was like, "Hey, buddy, if someone was trying to start a conversation with you

234
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,720
 like that," you'd be like, "Yeah, I totally know that stuff.

235
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,400
 Why are you even asking me this question?

236
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 Oh, I'm sick.

237
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
 I'm just going to go home."

238
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,320
 Yeah, you should go home if you just asked me what's COVID-19 and you look like you have

239
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,720
 COVID-19.

240
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,480
 The conversation took place in both realities.

241
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,600
 So really there's two ways you can look at this.

242
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,680
 One, that when you go to an alternate reality, you may affect both realities.

243
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:23,560
 If this story is true, that's an amazing find in the world of multiple worlds, right?

244
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,080
 That's crazy if this story is true.

245
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,440
 Again, it could totally be made up.

246
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,440
 There's also the chance that Charles is going insane and he was in our reality, but he was

247
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,880
 hallucinating people without masks and he went to work and he's looking at a guy and

248
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,640
 he's hallucinating and he doesn't have a mask.

249
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,080
 That is very troubling, right?

250
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
 If that's the case, Charles, go to a doctor.

251
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,440
 Go to a doctor in this reality and get checked out.

252
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,460
 But if it is an alternate reality story, that's groundbreaking.

253
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:02,480
 The membrane between the two is so thin you can have a conversation in two realities when

254
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,760
 you only are in one.

255
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,880
 So much stuff.

256
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,920
 So much stuff you could go, "Wow, when you're in one alternate reality, it's affecting your

257
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
 home alternate reality."

258
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,400
 And maybe that's the reason why you can't find your keys, because in an alternate reality,

259
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,200
 you put your keys somewhere else that day.

260
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,560
 And then when you find them and you go, "I looked all over the place and here they are

261
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,600
 in plain sight because the other you in another reality is moving those keys."

262
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,640
 Jaw-dropping, right?

263
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,720
 This could be totally fake.

264
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,040
 I got to say that yet again.

265
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,120
 But if this is true, massive repercussions for the world of the paranormal and the world

266
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,320
 of alternate realities, you can affect both.

267
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,640
 And I wanted to say too, like at the beginning, he goes by the name Chief Two Bowls.

268
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,720
 And I like to look through people's post histories to kind of get an idea of what they're talking

269
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 about.

270
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,240
 This is a guy who all he does is talk about cars in Battlefield 2042.

271
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,760
 And then you have all of this stuff.

272
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
 He's like, "What?

273
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
 This game totally sucks.

274
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
 What?"

275
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,000
 And then, "Oh, look at this nice car."

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
 And then in the middle of that, he has this story that he responded to a couple of comments

277
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
 on and then he goes on talking about Battlefield 2042 again.

278
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,720
 So on the one hand, I think a "paranaut" - that's a word I just made up - a paranormal researcher,

279
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
 a "paranaut".

280
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,520
 You don't have to use that word.

281
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,800
 But anyways, if you do, I copyright.

282
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,520
 We I think would go head first into trying to figure out what happened to us.

283
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,640
 But someone who isn't necessarily interested in the paranormal could have this event and

284
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,000
 being like, "Oh, that was weird."

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,800
 And then just go on with their - go on and start playing Battlefield 2042.

286
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,880
 I think other people would constantly just start trying to absorb stuff about alternate

287
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,680
 realities and things like that.

288
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,640
 So that to me adds a little bit of credence to it.

289
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,400
 So I just thought there was an interesting tidbit to that.

290
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,720
 This is a guy who doesn't seem to have a real interest in the paranormal, at least according

291
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,920
 to his post-history.

292
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,960
 And then this happened to him and he'll continue on his life and maybe throughout the years

293
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
 ago.

294
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,760
 That was so weird that that happened.

295
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,400
 And if you thought that story was weird, which I hope you do because I talked about it for

296
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,160
 15 minutes, tomorrow - here's a little teaser for tomorrow's episode - tomorrow, tomorrow

297
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,080
 we're going to meet a man who also came to our reality, but he didn't start here.

298
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,720
 He came to us from a reality far darker than the one we live in now.

299
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,280
 But we'll save that episode for tomorrow and hopefully you guys will listen to it.

300
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,560
 Hopefully you won't slip into an alternate reality.

301
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
 Between now and then.

302
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,000
 Cindy, let me go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbon helicopter.

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
 We're leaving behind Illinois.

304
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,280
 We're headed all the way out to rural Alabama.

305
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:44,480
 Rural as in - I don't know why so many of my stories take place in the countryside.

306
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,200
 I have to say that word rural as in like country, outdoorsy type of stuff.

307
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
 R-U-R-A-L.

308
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,440
 That's one of those words like I can't even pretend to think that I know how to pronounce.

309
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,760
 Rural Alabama.

310
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,000
 It's July 1939.

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,520
 And we are sitting out in the bushes and we see a black car driving down a dusty road.

312
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,000
 And they're headed towards a house in particular and there's this lady, she's sitting on the

313
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,320
 porch, sitting in a rocking chair and the sedan is driving up, kicking up dust as it's pulling

314
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,520
 up into this old woman's driveway.

315
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,960
 Then out of this black sedan steps three federal agents.

316
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,680
 They are members of the FBI and they've been sent here on a mission just to talk to this

317
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,720
 old lady because there's rumors that have been going around in the area.

318
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,280
 This woman, we'll call her Meredith, can apparently tell the future.

319
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,480
 Now these stories must have been passed around locally for a long time and there must have

320
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,920
 been enough truth to them for them to actually be reported to the police and then the police

321
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,880
 to do some investigation and eventually the FBI gets ahold of this thing.

322
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,040
 But she's just sitting on this porch without a care in the world and as these three FBI

323
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,560
 agents get out of the sedan and they're walking towards her, they have no idea what they're

324
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
 about to encounter.

325
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,680
 Probably they were just asked go talk to this old lady, she says she's a fortune teller,

326
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,600
 it's the 1930s, she's probably ripping people off.

327
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,000
 She's probably running some sort of scam, go figure it out.

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,320
 And that's probably what the FBI agents were thinking.

329
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,000
 The head FBI agent, we don't have names for any of these guys but we're going to call

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,880
 the head FBI agent of this group, there's three of them, we're going to call him Joseph

331
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,320
 and they all walk up to the front of the house.

332
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,640
 And Joseph goes hey man, we have some questions for you.

333
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,800
 And the lady, she just looks at them and smiles.

334
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,960
 Sure, sure I'll answer your questions but I am no fortune teller.

335
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,080
 The agents kind of look at each other, dust swirling on the ground.

336
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,680
 I know you're going to ask me if I'm a fortune teller but I'm not a fortune teller.

337
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,400
 I can read minds though.

338
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:04,480
 I know why you're here and yes, yes I have had this ability for a long, long time.

339
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,200
 She's just sitting on the porch there and I mean the FBI agents, this is their job,

340
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,280
 asking questions but how do you ask questions if someone knows all the answers and not in

341
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,640
 some sort of alibi ways and although they already figured it out, she's answering the

342
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
 first questions they were going to ask.

343
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,720
 Are you a fortune teller?

344
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,840
 How long have you had this ability?

345
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,080
 Joseph goes where are you from?

346
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,680
 And she answers another world.

347
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,160
 Why are you here?

348
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,840
 Well, I'm guarding something really.

349
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,960
 I mean if you have to ask, I'm guarding something but what I'm guarding is of no concern to

350
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,720
 humans.

351
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,600
 Obviously, you don't get far in the FBI.

352
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,360
 You don't get far in the FBI believing in witchcraft, believing in aliens which even

353
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,320
 like in 1939, aliens were 100% a product of science fiction.

354
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,640
 I don't even know how much the word alien was in the vernacular other than people coming

355
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,840
 from other countries.

356
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,520
 I think back then when people used the word alien, you would assume immigrant.

357
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,600
 Obviously though, you're standing on this woman's front porch.

358
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,560
 She's in the middle of rural Alabama.

359
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,960
 If you were from another world, if you did have magical powers, why would you be here?

360
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,680
 But she has the answers to all the questions.

361
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,880
 And so finally Joseph is like, okay, you know what, we can stand out here all day long,

362
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
 get dust in our hair.

363
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,480
 Or you know what, let's go back to the bureau.

364
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,640
 We have some questions to ask you and she says no.

365
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,840
 No, I'm not going anywhere with you.

366
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 We're going to be sitting right here.

367
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,560
 I'll answer your questions before you even ask them.

368
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,880
 And Joseph orders one of his men, let's escort the misses back to the car.

369
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,600
 And as one of these FBI agents begins walking up the short staircase to her porch, he has

370
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,920
 an epileptic fit.

371
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,720
 He begins trembling uncontrollably and falls on the ground.

372
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,680
 In a moment or two, it passes and he slowly getting to his feet.

373
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:11,560
 And Meredith says, if you try that again, none of you will leave here alive.

374
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,240
 Okay, maybe we should go back and get some reinforcements.

375
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,880
 And Joseph does bid Meredith a goodbye.

376
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,800
 But as they're walking back to the car, Joseph turns around and says, listen, my superiors,

377
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,680
 people who sense us out here are going to want proof of any of these claims you've made.

378
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,960
 Obviously, we're not going to be able to go back and say we went to her house.

379
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,080
 She is from another world, whatever that means in 1939.

380
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,000
 We're going to want some proof that you can read minds and stuff like that or that you

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,840
 are who you say you are.

382
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,880
 Meredith is sitting on the porch and she goes, tell you what, at random, have your superiors

383
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,160
 pick an area of 100 square miles anywhere that you want.

384
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,080
 Like 100 square miles and put markers around that area.

385
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,520
 And make sure that no airplane is flying over that patch of land.

386
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,000
 Then they will have proof.

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,960
 So that would have had to have been a long car drive back leaving this woman's house

388
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,800
 back to bureau headquarters.

389
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 First off, you'd be like, dude, are you okay?

390
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
 You were walking up the steps and you started freaking out.

391
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,240
 It's like, I don't know what happened.

392
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 I don't know what hit me.

393
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,680
 I just felt that I needed to twitch out and fall down.

394
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,880
 So they go back to the bureau though and they say, hey, listen, that woman, people say she's

395
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
 a fortune teller.

396
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,560
 She says she's a mind reader.

397
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,560
 She didn't make this dude freak out.

398
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,920
 But trickery, right?

399
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,080
 You can do all sorts of trickery.

400
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,120
 Why would FBI agents be there to ask questions?

401
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,800
 You could just start throwing out random answers.

402
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,000
 However, she did say that she could prove who she was if we checked out a 100 mile area,

403
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,440
 square miles and put markers up and made sure nothing was flying overhead.

404
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,600
 But you're not going to do that, obviously.

405
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
 It's just some kook, right?

406
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,200
 This was just some sort of trick.

407
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,480
 And the bureau says, you know what?

408
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,560
 Just to be safe, let's find 100 square miles that no airplane flies over and set those

409
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,600
 markers up.

410
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,960
 A short time after that, the FBI does deploy a team of agents.

411
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,600
 They did pick a area and the agents went and they put up the flags.

412
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,640
 They marked the area completely at random.

413
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,200
 And then some time passed and then the agents went back there.

414
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:41,320
 And when they walked into this 100 square mile patch of land, the entire area was completely

415
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,000
 devoid of life.

416
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,640
 No birds, no squirrels, no rabbits, no insects, no plants.

417
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,040
 Nothing.

418
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,480
 Now, obviously, if they marked it off in the middle of Death Valley, that wouldn't be...

419
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,120
 They don't say exactly where this patch of land was.

420
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,960
 I would assume it was somewhere in Alabama since this was like a local bureau thing.

421
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,600
 But who knows, right?

422
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,720
 You wouldn't want to mark off a place that did have those things in it.

423
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,360
 But again, they didn't know what was going to happen.

424
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,120
 They were just told to mark off this area and keep planes out of it.

425
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
 Keep planes out of the area.

426
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,040
 Which back in 1939, I don't think there was a ton of planes flying around.

427
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,440
 But there were enough.

428
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,400
 You wouldn't want to have devoid of life.

429
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
 And then after that point, the agents who had started this whole thing, who had investigated

430
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,040
 the woman in the first place, and they may have even been part of the team to go out

431
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:41,080
 to this area, they were told by their superiors, "Just forget the whole thing."

432
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,280
 You know that whole mind-reading alien witch who could wipe out all life in a hundred square

433
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,200
 miles just for a given that ever happened.

434
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:57,440
 And then according to sources, even the FBI never investigated this woman again.

435
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,040
 Or at least not officially.

436
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:06,320
 After this point, the Federal Bureau of Investigation decided to leave well enough alone and never

437
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:15,640
 again made contact with the alien witch of Alabama.

438
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,760
 This is a story that I got from Albert Rosales, Humanoid Sighting Reports.

439
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
 He has this huge...

440
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,080
 He's one of those guys who basically has created a compendium of every humanoid sighting.

441
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,200
 It's a massive resource.

442
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
 It's a lot like, think about it, docs.com.

443
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,200
 They actually crib each other's notes, it seems like a lot.

444
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,760
 And he got it from a book called UFOs in New Mexico and the World, because this story definitely

445
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,680
 didn't take place in New Mexico.

446
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,080
 Those are our sources, right?

447
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,000
 Which again, I've never been able to find actual FBI documents on this.

448
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,480
 There hasn't been freedom of information act request for the alien witch of Alabama.

449
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
 But what an amazing story.

450
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,000
 And what I like about it is it confirms a lot of our priors.

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,720
 We won, I've always felt, even before X-Files, but it definitely skyrocketed after X-Files,

452
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,480
 that law enforcement would have an interest in the paranormal.

453
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,240
 It's super weird because if you are a police officer and you start talking about going

454
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,120
 to unpatriolized haunted houses, you're going to get laughed out of the precinct.

455
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,760
 People are going to make fun of you.

456
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,640
 If you're a pilot, and this is the reason why a lot of UFOs don't get reported, because

457
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,880
 if you're a pilot, you're in the air all the time and you see UFO, you're going to be called,

458
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
 you're going to be made fun of, you're going to be called a kook.

459
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,520
 And that's how it was for decades.

460
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,320
 And really today, if you're a cop and you go, "Oh, I don't like that beat.

461
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,560
 I don't like going walking the streets because I think there's a bunch of ghost school urchin

462
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
 kids."

463
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,320
 People, and this is the reason why when you're a police officer, when you're a pilot, when

464
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,680
 you're in the military, and anything, your mental acuity is key.

465
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:58,520
 And your safety is dependent on the person who's sitting next to you being not insane,

466
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
 right?

467
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,280
 And if you're a cab driver, and there's a couple other cab drivers who are a little

468
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,440
 nutty, that doesn't affect you.

469
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,760
 But you don't want your co-pilot reading UFO books and looking out the window with binoculars

470
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
 and being like, "I saw another one.

471
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
 I saw another one.

472
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
 Quick, turn this way here."

473
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
 You don't want that.

474
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,280
 So that's part of it.

475
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,600
 You want the people who your life depends on to be rational people.

476
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,720
 But on the other hand, like that example, I'm not saying everyone who loves you, if O's

477
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,680
 is crazy, and gonna try to jackknife a 747, that's the stereotype, right?

478
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,080
 The government and the media has done a really good job creating the tinfoil hat wearing

479
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,440
 weirdo to make people not want to talk about this stuff, because you will get treated like

480
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,360
 a weirdo.

481
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,280
 So they have that.

482
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,720
 When you are a police officer, you can't be talking about ghosts and stuff like that.

483
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,360
 You will get made fun of.

484
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,320
 Max Molder's name in X-Files was Spooky Molder.

485
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,160
 Everyone called him Spooky Molder except for his partner.

486
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,120
 And she did not want to work with him.

487
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,440
 She knew right from the gig.

488
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,360
 Okay, first of all, X-Files is a true story, right?

489
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,000
 It's not integral that I'm talking about this, but even in that show, he was Spooky Molder.

490
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,040
 He was put down for believing this stuff.

491
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 So you have that.

492
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,880
 And on the other hand, you would have, that's basically on the bottom level, right?

493
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,760
 That's the day-to-day officers.

494
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,560
 But on the highest level, you would have people in FBI, in CIA, in local police departments,

495
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,200
 maybe not so much local police departments, but definitely like FBI and CIA, you would

496
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,920
 have groups dedicated to the paranormal.

497
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,020
 We know that for a fact.

498
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,280
 We can talk, X-Files is fake, but we have the story of the men who stare at goats and

499
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,840
 all this stuff, or the CIA was trying to practice mind control, MK ultra-type programs.

500
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,360
 They were trying to do remote viewing.

501
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,240
 The standard CIA agent, if he starts going, "Hmm, I wonder what that terrorist is up to."

502
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,640
 And then he closes his eyes and started going, "Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm."

503
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,360
 Oh, he built a bomb.

504
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,840
 That guy is getting fired the next day.

505
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,960
 But what's funny is eight levels above him, there's a dedicated office and they have remote

506
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,800
 viewers in there in the CIA.

507
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,480
 Such a weird dichotomy.

508
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,280
 If you're a FBI agent on the field and you're talking about the paranormal, people are going

509
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,760
 to think you're a cuckoo, but there are off the record, on the record, who knows, they're

510
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,920
 investigating that stuff.

511
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,440
 And this would make sense that you would send out agents who were super skeptical.

512
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
 You wouldn't send me out.

513
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,200
 I'd be like, "Oh my gosh, you're a spooky witch.

514
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,400
 Tell me all your powers."

515
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,240
 You would send people out there who didn't believe in that stuff.

516
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,160
 And then when they saw it and they came back and they were scared or, you know, pretending

517
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,040
 not to be scared to cover enough of the stains in their slacks, you would know something was

518
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
 right about it.

519
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,040
 You would test this and then that would be the end of it.

520
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,200
 And you definitely wouldn't send those agents back out to talk to her.

521
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 You know why?

522
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,280
 Because now they believe her.

523
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,440
 Now that they've seen this patch of land.

524
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,800
 Super interesting story.

525
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,080
 Really, really interesting story.

526
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,480
 I do believe the highest levels of government law enforcement are investigating these things.

527
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 We know they're investigating, and this is the key, we know they're investigating UFOs

528
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,640
 because Congress is now passing things about UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomenon, trying

529
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,760
 to figure this out.

530
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,480
 When I'm talking about this, I'm talking about even things even more esoteric, ghosts, demons,

531
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,720
 powerful wizards, magicians, whatever this woman was capable of that could win a war.

532
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,080
 But the first goal, it wouldn't just be for pure curiosity, right?

533
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
 It wouldn't just be like, oh, that's cool magic.

534
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,440
 What are we going to do next?

535
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
 To control it.

536
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
 To own it.

537
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
 To use it.

538
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,400
 That's why they would be investigating this stuff.

539
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,920
 Does magic work is the first question.

540
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,240
 The second question is how do we use it?

541
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,560
 And when you have groups like the FBI, the FBI is an arm of the federal government.

542
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,680
 And you have the head FBI leader, agent, director of FBI, whatever, yeah, the FBI director

543
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,800
 is what it's called.

544
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,160
 That guy has a boss that you don't know, that I don't know, that I doubt many people know.

545
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,720
 The people who truly run these agencies, they're not newspapers, they're not in government

546
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,320
 records, they're not the president.

547
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,040
 But the true people in power, you don't know them.

548
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,560
 You've never heard their names spoken.

549
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,040
 They're the ones figuring this stuff out.

550
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,800
 Does magic work?

551
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,360
 And how do we use it?

552
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,880
 Are ghosts real?

553
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,000
 And can we communicate with them?

554
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,640
 Are demons real?

555
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,120
 And how do we stop them from destroying the world?

556
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,240
 Or how do we make alliances with them?

557
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,200
 To stop our enemies from destroying the world?

558
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,160
 These are all questions in the realm of science fiction.

559
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,000
 There's been dozens of books written about this stuff.

560
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,360
 But I believe that these agencies and these shadow men, not literally shadow men, so you're

561
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,040
 talking about that a lot on the show, but these hidden hands within the government are

562
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,840
 accumulating this knowledge, this esoteric knowledge.

563
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,360
 I highly doubt that the FBI stopped investigating this woman after she destroyed 100 square

564
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,240
 miles of landscape.

565
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
 Did they have a friendly conversation with her after the fact?

566
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,840
 Did they try to capture her and put her in some sort of laboratory?

567
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,440
 Is she still here, free, sitting in rural Alabama?

568
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,720
 No agent could possibly stop her.

569
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,560
 She's still continuing to guard what is no concern to humans.

570
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,520
 Who knows?

571
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:46,600
 But I don't believe that the government didn't try to get at her again.

572
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,160
 And again.

573
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,200
 And again.

574
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,400
 They're visiting her in July of 1939, months before World War II broke out.

575
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,840
 I don't find that a coincidence.

576
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:08,040
 I also don't find it to be a coincidence that she just happened to have the same level of

577
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,320
 power wiping out all life in a given area.

578
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:23,040
 A few years before the first atomic bomb was dropped, there are agencies that are investigating

579
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
 this stuff.

580
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,040
 This is not just the realm of tinfoil hat wearing people.

581
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,760
 It's not just the realm of podcasters recording in a haunted closet.

582
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,000
 It's not just the realm of someone enjoying these stories while they're studying, driving

583
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,920
 their car, or doing their dishes.

584
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:46,960
 This serious thought is being put into obtaining these powers, controlling these powers, using

585
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,280
 these powers.

586
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:56,360
 There are people, there are groups who take this stuff so seriously they've learned the

587
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,600
 secrets.

588
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,320
 Which is fine, which is great.

589
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,640
 It would be the advancement of humanity if they shared these secrets with us, the ability

590
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,240
 to communicate with the dead, the ability to control matter, to have these craft that

591
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,120
 can break the laws of physics, but they don't share them with anybody, not even their own

592
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,240
 countrymen.

593
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,720
 But these secrets are being kept.

594
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,240
 These secrets are being learned.

595
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,080
 These secrets are being mastered and used.

596
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:39,120
 And we don't even know the names of the people who wield such power.

597
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:49,560
 And yet these bureaucrats hold our world in the palm of their hand.

598
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,440
 Could we fight back against them?

599
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,600
 Could there ever be an overthrow of this shadow government?

600
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:05,560
 If three FBI agents couldn't bring in a woman sitting on her porch rocking in her chair

601
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:15,320
 on a fine summer day in Alabama, could all the armies of the world take on a group of

602
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:25,600
 people who have mastered alien technology, occult studies, and paranormal forces?

603
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,440
 I'm afraid one day we'll find out the answer.

604
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,840
 And the reason why I'm afraid is because the answer will be humanity will lose to these

605
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,280
 magic-wielding madmen.

606
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,080
