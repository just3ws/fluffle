1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
 What fights on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:18,320
 And then we take a look at the story of Martin Guerrero, a man who stole some grain and then ran out of town to avoid

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
 prosecution. And then he came back.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,660
 Or did he? Today on Dead Reverie.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:33,340
 [Music]

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Reverie.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,380
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,820
 That introduction sounded so lackluster. Or did he? It's a really interesting story though.

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,340
 I thought it was really, really interesting. Otherwise, I want to cover it. We actually have a

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,500
 lot of stuff to cover today. Firstly, October 31st, the River City Saloon here in Hood River.

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,500
 My boy, my boy's band, Sundivers, having their album release party. I've talked about it a couple

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,820
 times. I've talked about their band a couple times on the show. So if you are in the area,

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,540
 October 31st, River City Saloon, I think it starts at 10 p.m. Sundiver official album release party.

14
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,060
 After all this time, they got their album out and their music is great. I will be there and maybe

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,180
 you'll see me. I'm sure you will. The question will be, will you know who I am in the audience?

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,780
 You will, because it'll be the most awesome person in the audience.

17
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,300
 So October 31st, River City Saloon. That's a little plug for you guys. Let's go ahead and get started

18
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,020
 with the episode. So we're going to take a trip around America. America, the most fight-ness

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,380
 country ever. We're just punching people all the time. A country does something we don't like. We

20
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,580
 just walk up. We punch the country in the stomach. Take that, Germany. And it falls over. We're like,

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:56,940
 USA. America beats people up. And unfortunately, sometimes we beat ourselves up. Not in a

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,340
 emotional way when we step on the scale and we're like, "Oh man, I can't believe I ate all those

23
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,420
 burritos." Sometimes we beat up fellow Americans. And it's a tragedy. St. Louis, Missouri. It's

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,180
 December 2016, right? And you have this 10-year-old boy walking through a daycare center. He's probably

25
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,700
 just picking up his little brother or something like that. Bored. I don't know. I don't know why

26
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,180
 he was there. That's not the point of the story. It's not a mystery as to why a 10-year-old boy

27
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:31,180
 is at a daycare center. But he hears something in another room. Smash. And he's like, "What is

28
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,060
 going on in there?" He's like, "It sounds like someone's trying to clear their throat constantly.

29
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,460
 I don't know what that sound effect is." 10-year-old opens up the door and sees two little preschoolers,

30
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:56,060
 right? Boxing. Boxing. In the most adorable fashion ever. They're wearing giant, oversized,

31
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,260
 incredible Hulk hands. If you've ever had those when you punch hard enough, it goes, "Hulk smash!"

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,780
 or "Pshh!" Sounds like windows breaking. But these two preschoolers have both have a pair of

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,140
 these incredible Hulk hands and they're throwing punches. Now, that's adorable. But there's two

34
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,620
 daycare workers watching them and directing the fight. So it's not like these kids are just kind

35
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,740
 of goofing off. There's two adults being like, "No, get them! Get them! Get them!" And the kid's like,

36
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,220
 "Whip and sweat off his brow with his giant hand. Stoo-k-stoo! Boom, boom, boom!" Just punch,

37
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,100
 punch in each other, right? And according to the complaint, according to the news articles,

38
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,700
 there's video footage of this. There's surveillance footage of two adults. One of them is jumping

39
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,980
 up and down because she's really excited. It's two young women. One of them is jumping up and

40
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,860
 down because she's really excited about how the fight's turning out. And then the other set of

41
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,340
 footage is from the 10-year-old boy. He pulled out his cell phone. So we have two different angles

42
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,180
 on this. We see these two preschoolers just boxing with these gloves on. And the only person to

43
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,180
 interrupt the fight, at some point in the video, another preschool kid walks up and starts separating

44
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,260
 the... "Oh, come on guys, you've had enough. Yeah, yeah, both Hulk smash, Hulk smash. Come on guys,

45
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,420
 just break it up. It's over." So it took another preschooler to come and break the fight up.

46
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,140
 Now this footage ended up getting uploaded and reported to the police. I like how the article

47
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:26,860
 I was reading made a fact to say that one of the boys... this fight took place on one of the boys'

48
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,100
 birthday and he got a black eye. And that's sad, but that's a little... I mean, who really cares at

49
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,820
 that point? First off, how do you get a black eye from a giant Hulk hand? I guess when you're a preschooler,

50
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,380
 everything kind of bruises you up. But two, like, I don't really care about... I don't think that

51
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,260
 kid's going to be like 18 years old. I'd be like, "Do you have any regrets?" And he's like, "Yeah,

52
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,260
 we shouldn't get that black eye when I was four." Like, I don't understand why that sentence is even

53
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,300
 in the... It doesn't make it any more or less tragic. What does make it tragic was these girls

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:06,780
 were fired and arrested and then all charges were dropped. So they're suffering nothing. They're

55
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,620
 not suffering any penalties for this. Prosecutors said there was lack of evidence, even though there

56
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:19,260
 was two sources of the recording showing this. So that is our first fight. That's our first little

57
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,820
 fight club. And really, I guess I kind of botched the intro on this. These are all fight clubs. These

58
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,780
 are all fight club stories that have been initiated in America. And you're like, "That's a weird topic

59
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,660
 for dead rapper, Eddie." I know, but I find it hilarious. So let's go ahead and we are leaving

60
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,860
 behind the kids of the daycare center. They're like, "Oh, please, it's my birthday. Don't want to get

61
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,820
 a present." You're like, "Yeah, here's an ice pack here. You're gonna have this." He's like, "Yay,

62
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,100
 that's what I always wanted since this afternoon when I got a black eye." We're leaving... That was

63
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,420
 in St. Louis, Missouri. I don't know if I said that. Anyways, we're leaving there. We're leaving the

64
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:01,980
 place that I just mentioned. We're going to Hartford, Connecticut. And this one... What was...

65
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,980
 What were we in the first one? Oh, we were... There's 10-Year-Old Boy was our narrator. And this

66
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:12,460
 one, the narrator will be a intrepid high school journalist. And he's like walking through the

67
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,140
 halls of the school all alone. He's like, "There must be a story around here somewhere. There better

68
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,580
 be. Otherwise, I'm going to fail my journalism class." So as he's thinking about maybe just

69
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,860
 making a story up, he hears us. And he's like, "That's weird. Is there like some

70
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,020
 black and gospel church group in there practicing? And they're clapping and they're not singing?

71
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,620
 I just heard the clapping part of their song. I'm going to go check it out."

72
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,580
 So he looks in the door and what he sees is two dudes just slapping each other really,

73
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,340
 really hard. That's the other guy getting slapped. It's not the same guy getting hit twice.

74
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,500
 I'll do two different sound effects. And he sees substitute teacher Ryan Avery Fish

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:07,820
 standing there watching this all go down. Now, that is what we legally know. There's a lot.

76
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,700
 Everything else I'm going to say is going to be alleged, right? So allegedly, this is what happened.

77
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:20,620
 Ryan Albert... No, not Ryan Albert. Albert Fish is a brutal cannibal serial killer. Ryan Avery Fish

78
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,260
 was a substitute teacher. That part's not alleged. And there are these kids... It's also... Okay, so this

79
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,020
 is... Okay, this is where it gets dicey because different versions. Anyways, I'm going to tell

80
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,940
 Aversion and it's all alleged. So the kids wanted to have a slap fight and Ryan wanted to be a cool

81
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,620
 teacher who was like friends with the kids. So he like mediated it or like moderated it or

82
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,900
 refted it, I guess would be a better term. And they were slapping each other and he'd be like,

83
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,620
 "Oh yeah, man. It's a good slap, bro. Good slap." And then one guy got slapped so hard he started

84
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,860
 to throw up, which makes me think that guy is also one of the preschoolers from the first story.

85
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,060
 Because you have to get slapped pretty hard to throw up. I don't even know that's possible.

86
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,740
 I've walked out of violent car crashes and full-on fights, full-on getting punched in the head

87
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:21,020
 multiple times and never throwing up. So unless this guy was like made of ego, I can't imagine

88
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,420
 any human so frail surviving to high school that can get slapped and then vomit from it. But anyways,

89
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,580
 the teacher said, "Take a break, man. Take a break." And then once the kid like stopped

90
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,980
 vomiting in the corner, he's like, "Okay, go back in there." So they're slapping each other. So it

91
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:41,260
 wasn't a full-on fight. It wasn't... The least the preschoolers were like fist to fist. Like,

92
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,980
 yes, they had gloves on, but the gloves were incredible. Whole cans. And you know how strong

93
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,780
 he is. These high schoolers were just slapping each other. There were, I think, six of them

94
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,380
 between the ages of 14 and 16. So this gets videotaped as well. I tried finding the videotape,

95
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,900
 because I wanted to see it. I couldn't find it, but I'm sure it's out there. And honestly,

96
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:06,860
 I didn't try super hard. I mean, I just was looking for it. He ends up getting reported to

97
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,580
 the principal at the school. And Ryan's response was, "Ah, boys will be boys. This is what people..."

98
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,180
 Which is, yes, but when you're in a position of watching them, you can't really use that.

99
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:25,500
 So the school fires him, but they never report any of this. And then eventually, the authorities did

100
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,820
 find out about this. And then, like, the principal and stuff was sued as well.

101
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,420
 This is one of the stories. This all happened back in 2017. And then it was all discovered in 2018.

102
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,460
 And I kind of mentioned this yesterday. After a story, like, pops, you can almost never find

103
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,180
 follow-up on it nowadays. So I don't know if this guy's doing jail. I don't know if he got, like,

104
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,940
 a ticket. There's no follow-up. We just know that these people got fired and arrested.

105
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:55,980
 Most importantly, did these kids, did that kid ever stop throwing up? Or is he to this very day

106
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,740
 throwing up? You go to Hartford, Connecticut, and you're, like, at Target, and you're like,

107
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,460
 "Hey, do you know where the soap is?" And the guy turns around. He's wearing, like, a Target uniform.

108
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,260
 He's like, "Yeah, it's over." And then you realize he has, like, a red mark on his face. And you're,

109
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,620
 like, "The legends are true. He's still throwing up." Let's go ahead and move on to our last

110
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,900
 fight club here before I run out of time to talk about Martin Carrera again. Let's go to our last

111
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,300
 fight club. There's not a lot of information on this, but I think it might be the best fight club

112
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:35,100
 ever. Who are in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It's 2019. And these three women, this is currently

113
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:45,500
 ongoing trial, case Marilyn McKay, Tonakia, or Tonisha Tyson, and Tonisha Jordan, are being tried

114
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:57,100
 for running a fight club. This one to be fair, fight club might be a bit of a stretch.

115
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:04,380
 But for organizing fights, or for encouraging fights between people with dementia at an

116
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:13,100
 assisted care living center, which before you go, Jason, Jason, really? Listen, listen, hear me out.

117
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,700
 Here we go. So, a fight club at an assisted living home. The idea itself is kind of funny.

118
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,900
 It would be better suited for a plot of movie. They're actually, though, facing criminal trials,

119
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,980
 criminal charges for, like, assaulting an elderly person or disabled people, or both.

120
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,540
 I think at a certain point, he becomes so elderly, they're just like, "Ah, that guy's disabled."

121
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,620
 You're like, "What? No, look, I can lift all these whites." They're like, "Yeah, you're just disabled

122
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,940
 now. Go lay down." And they're like, "But I'm super strong." So, I don't know. Anyways, the point is

123
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,700
 fight clubs through all age groups. If I had to fight any of those age groups, I would probably be

124
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,460
 the dementia boxer. Because I would just have to, like, part of boxing is out thinking your

125
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,900
 opponent. And if your opponent forgets everything five seconds after it happens, you got it.

126
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,100
 Like, being the little kid hit with the whole cans, that's cool, but that one dude got a black eye.

127
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,020
 And then the slap fighting, that sounded kind of dumb, actually, because if you slap a dude,

128
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,420
 he starts throwing up. I'd feel bad. But if I'm boxing some elderly person, I'm like, "Duck

129
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,900
 and weave, duck." Think about it this way. Think about it this way. If you were in a movie where

130
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,300
 you were boxing little kids, that is just, that's just like kindergarten cop three, right? They

131
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,780
 actually should make that. They should make kindergarten cop three where they have to break up

132
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,700
 a child fighting ring. The slap fighting and throwing up those kids are made of tissue paper,

133
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,180
 and I would just tear through them. But think about a movie based on a dude who is in a old folks

134
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,420
 home. He has dementia. The people he's fighting have dementia. Think about all of the training

135
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,060
 montages you would be able to have in that movie. Because every scene would be like a guy getting

136
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,900
 beat up and he's like, "I gotta learn a special move. I gotta learn a crane kick type move to beat

137
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,460
 this guy." And then you do this whole musical montage where he learns to move. And then the

138
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,100
 fight comes up. He totally forgets to move and gets beat up. He's like, "I gotta learn a move.

139
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,580
 The whole movie would be musical montages." So there's that. You could have the love interest

140
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,940
 be like the sexy nerd. You can't have a love interest in the other two versions because that's

141
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:29,180
 gross. But in the dementia one, you can have like the sexy nurse be the love interest. And you're like

142
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,820
 the old weathered boxer and you like meet the sexy nurse. And you're like, "Oh, I wonder if she'll

143
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,740
 go out with me." And she's like, "Dude, we've been dating for six weeks. You're just training."

144
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,900
 "What? I wonder if she likes me." She's like, "Dude, I just had your baby." He's like,

145
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,900
 "Going at it." That would be a movie I would watch. That would be a movie I'd live. Boxing. I'd

146
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,980
 have dementia. I'd be boxing people with dementia. And then the end of the movie, it turns out it

147
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,860
 was all just the delusion. But then it turns into double twist ending. It wasn't just the delusion.

148
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:08,060
 It all happened. You just forgot it happened and then remembered it as a delusion. But then you

149
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:15,500
 forgot that delusions exist. And then it's just the last 20 minutes is just a white screen while the

150
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,820
 audience contemplates what went on. And then the final second is a punch hitting you. And it turns

151
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,180
 that it was all real. And you were just getting punched a lot during the last 20 minutes of the

152
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,340
 movie to the point where you saw white and threw up. But let's go ahead and leave our fighting

153
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:42,780
 days behind us. We are going now to France. Birthplace of the Franck. Birthplace of French rolls.

154
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:48,060
 I don't think those existed anywhere. They just had rolls and they weren't as delicious.

155
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,420
 Birthplace of French girls. Lots of great stuff comes from French. What's the other thing?

156
00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:00,300
 French kissing? So anyways, before that, everyone just rubbed their lips together. The years 1527

157
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,420
 were in France. And we're going to meet a guy named Martin Guerrero. Now this guy wasn't getting

158
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,900
 in boxing matches when he was a teenager. He might have been. But he was, this sucks, getting married.

159
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:21,340
 He's 14 years old and he gets married. That is hellish. That's awful. I can't imagine being

160
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,980
 married now. And I've had a lot of really cool experiences. I can't imagine being married when

161
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,700
 I was 14 and not having none of that stuff. So anyways, this kid's married when he's 14 years

162
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,660
 old. But it's kind of soft in the blow. He marries a rich chick. So there you go. I could be married

163
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,060
 since I was 14 to somebody who was rich. I'll do that. But anyways, he's married some rich

164
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,900
 chick named Bertrand. It's like, just when you think things are on the up, she has a bad name.

165
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,140
 Martin marries Bertrand at the age of 14. They have a son in 1540s. Everything's going pretty

166
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,620
 good. His dad's kind of well off. Her dad's very rich. They have a little baby. In the year 1548,

167
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:09,020
 he gets accused of stealing grain from his dad. So yes, she is rich, but we're in like provincial

168
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:16,060
 France. So rich means you have less cooties than your neighbors. Like yes, she had money, but he

169
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,820
 still had to steal grain from people for whatever reason. So Martin is like, oh man, I really need

170
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,300
 him. I really want some bread. I want to make some French rolls, but I don't have enough grain.

171
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,660
 So he goes and he steals grain from his dad. Now, if I stole grain from my dad, my dad would be like,

172
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,220
 where did I get all these grain from? And Jason, why'd you steal it? I think most people, if they

173
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,860
 stole grain, they'd be like, yeah, I'm sorry, dude, I just really want to make bread. And the other

174
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,460
 people would be like, I didn't even know I had grain to steal. But back then, that was a big,

175
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:55,740
 big deal. Martin runs away. He's so petrified that his dad is mad that he leaves town for eight years.

176
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:03,500
 Eight years over grain. Martin comes back to town and everyone's like, oh, where were you? And he's

177
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:10,780
 like, when join the army, I did some stuff. And I didn't want to face my dad over the whole grain

178
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,620
 incident. And people are like, that's fair. Your father was quite the lunatic. And he thought he

179
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,260
 talked about you at his grave. He said how badly he wanted to bash your head. And he's like, oh,

180
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:28,380
 dad, because at this point, father's passed away. And his father did leave him an inheritance. So,

181
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:35,020
 you know, let bygones be bygones, let grain be grain. And he comes back, he gets his inheritance

182
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,380
 from his father's estate. And he has a son with Bertrands. And they have a son and the daughter.

183
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,020
 Now, his uncle also gets part of the father's inheritance because he was gone. So the dad was

184
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,980
 like, I don't know if I'm going to give him all this stuff. Like I'm going to give some of it to

185
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,020
 the uncle, because I don't know if I'll ever see Martin again. But anyways, Martin does come back

186
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,420
 and the inheritance is split between Martin and the uncle. And Martin sues the uncle because he

187
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:07,980
 wants all the inheritance. Now, during this time of disappearance, the uncle, his name was Uncle

188
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:16,140
 Pierre, married Bertrands mom, who is now a widow. So basically, his uncle is now his father-in-law

189
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,660
 as well. And the uncle is sitting there and now he's being sued by his nephew slash son-in-law.

190
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:28,540
 And he's going, I don't think this is Martin. Like, something's off about this. And people are like,

191
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:35,500
 well, it's Martin. He's like, listen, I don't think it's the real Martin Guerrero. I think it's

192
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,860
 somebody else. I think it's an imposter. Now, people go, he did come back into town after a long

193
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:48,700
 absence. But his wife recognized him, his daughter recognized him, his sisters, he has four sisters,

194
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,380
 they're like Martin, they absolutely recognize them. People in town go, that's Martin. And even you,

195
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,140
 Uncle Pierre, you recognize him. And he's like, yes, yes, I did recognize him when he came back

196
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,260
 into town. But I don't think that's really Martin Guerrero. So he starts pushing for an

197
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,300
 investigation into this guy. The townspeople are like, you just don't want to be sued. And he's

198
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,380
 like, you're right, I don't want to be sued. But I don't think that's Martin. I don't think that's him.

199
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:19,340
 Now, Uncle Pierre starts going on this investigation, right? And he ends up running into this soldier

200
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,540
 who's like walking through town at some point. It's not like he was just like, I'm going to figure

201
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,260
 out the truth. And at that point, a soldier walked by like, as he was doing legwork, he talked to

202
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,460
 the soldier. And he goes, Hey, you're in the army, you know Martin Guerrero. And the soldier was like,

203
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,860
 yeah, yeah, actually, I do know Martin Guerrero. He's from around here, right? Uncle Pierre is like,

204
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:45,740
 yeah, yeah, he's from this town. Soldiers like, Oh, is he, how's he doing? How's his leg doing?

205
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,220
 Okay. And Pierre is like, what? Because yeah, he got his leg chopped off. He doesn't have a leg.

206
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,380
 No, he doesn't. He's missing a leg. Like that should be the first thing. Hey, Pierre, how are you

207
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,460
 doing? What happened to your leg? That'd be the first thing you noticed. Uncle Pierre is like, no,

208
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,220
 not this version of him at least. And the soldier goes, Listen, man, before you get like two

209
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,380
 suspicious, I'm not entirely for sure that we're talking about the same dude. And I could be wrong

210
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,300
 about Martin getting his leg cut off. Like it was a big army. There's a lot of stuff going on. But

211
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,980
 from what I remember, Martin Guerrero had his leg chopped off during the war. And then soldier

212
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,980
 goes about his business. Now, at this point, the uncle is super suspicious. He goes, that's 100%

213
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,060
 not the right Martin. He gets his boys. The uncle gets a bunch of rounds up a bunch of dudes,

214
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,700
 they get baseball bats, they break into Martin's house and begin beating him with bats, being like,

215
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,020
 confess, you're not the real guy, or we're going to beat you to death. And he's like, I just like

216
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,620
 sleeping. They're like, keep hitting them in the leg. They're like, do you feel that? He's like,

217
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,260
 Yeah, it's bone and flesh. They're like, aha, they're hitting his leg to hear if it sounds like

218
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,980
 wouldn't hitting on wood instead, his bones are just breaking. He's like, No, the wife runs in and

219
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,060
 says, Hey, guys, knock it off. Like, why are you attacking my husband? It's not your husband. This

220
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:04,940
 huge fight breaks out. But they stopped beating him with bats. So that's a plus 1559 people in the

221
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:12,380
 village say Martin is not the real guy. He's accused of identity theft. And he also burned

222
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,340
 down a barn or something like that. So he gets arrested for arson slash identity theft. The

223
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,660
 wife goes to trial and says this 100% is my husband. All of this stuff is being stoked up by

224
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:31,900
 my uncle who doesn't want to lose his part of the money. That's all this is. The charges get totally

225
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:40,380
 dropped. The next year, the uncle and his wife Bertrand's mom both sit down Bertrand and said,

226
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:47,340
 Listen, he is not your husband. He's not your husband at all. At this point, it had been four

227
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,900
 years since he'd come back to town. They had a kid. And they're still saying this isn't your

228
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:58,060
 husband. This is not your original husband. He is not your og husband. They go, you have to

229
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,580
 leave him. And you have to make sure he gets convicted and not being your husband. So he

230
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,940
 doesn't get my part of inheritance. And they lean on her so much. She finally says Bertrand finally

231
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,420
 says, fine, I will testify in court that he is not my husband. And this will all be over with

232
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,700
 because only she can charge him with this particular crime. Like the people charged him

233
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,900
 with identity theft and arson. But that case was dismissed. Now there was a like a deception

234
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:32,460
 type thing or adultery type crime that only the wife could accuse him of. So she does. And they

235
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,700
 hold this massive trial and the town is basically split into you have people who go, that's Martin.

236
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:45,180
 I grew up with him. I knew him. That's him. And then other people go, and I don't think so.

237
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:51,180
 There was no definite proof that he wasn't. So it was kind of like this. No, I don't think that's

238
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,900
 him. The other people are like, I'm 100% for sure. This is Martin. At one point in the

239
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,140
 trial, like the judge or the lawyers talked to Bertrand and they asked her about an intimate

240
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:08,700
 event that happened prior to 1548, prior to him leaving in the first place. And she tells this

241
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,060
 story, whatever, we don't know exactly what it was. And then they asked Martin the same thing. And

242
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:20,780
 he told the same story. So they go, it has to be the same guy. Like how could he have known this

243
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,140
 event that happened before he left in the first place if it wasn't the same guy? They bring out

244
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:34,620
 150 witnesses, people on both sides coming forward to either say it is the real Martin or I don't

245
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:42,220
 think it is. His own four sisters again come up onto the stand and say, it's him. It's him. It's

246
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:49,180
 him. And then Martin on the stand says, if he says to his wife, if you will swear right now that I'm

247
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,460
 not your husband, I will happily go to the gallows and get my head chopped off. If you will swear

248
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,980
 that you know for a fact I am not Martin, they can execute me right now. And she was dead silent

249
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:06,220
 because she didn't know or she was being pressured by the uncle. But whatever the case is, the trial

250
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:13,820
 ends. He's found guilty and sentenced to be beheaded. And he's like, great. That gambit didn't work

251
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:20,060
 out. He appeals it though. And he takes it to basically the Supreme Court of France or a higher

252
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,260
 court in France, right? So they're leaving behind this little provincial town and they go to this

253
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,100
 beautiful, like French play, I don't know, it could have been a shack in the middle of the woods.

254
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,860
 The Blair Witch could have been the presiding judge, I don't know. But I imagine they leave

255
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,420
 behind this village and they go to like a place with actual like brick buildings and mortar and

256
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:46,700
 stuff like that. So they're there now. And he appeals it and he wins. And not only does he

257
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:54,860
 win the appeal, but then Bertrand and Pierre are arrested for perjury and false accusation.

258
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:01,980
 And so now the tables have completely turned. And he argues, listen, my wife is being manipulated

259
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,180
 for greed. I don't think she was actually trying to say anything bad about me. I think she was

260
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,940
 being manipulated by her stepfather, my uncle. I don't think she had anything to do with it.

261
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,420
 But the court is like, listen, they sat here, they told us these stories, they almost got you

262
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:24,300
 executed. We now have to have a trial for perjury for them. While all this is going on, this new

263
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:35,180
 trial is being set up. A man walks into town. Wooden leg hitting the pavement.

264
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:43,500
 Walks up to a crowd, I'm assuming a group of people. And he's like, hey, excuse me, excuse me,

265
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,540
 people. I heard there's a trial being held here for my wife and my uncle and like someone saying

266
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:55,500
 they're me, but I'm not, I'm me. I'm Martin Guerrero. And I was just kind of hanging out in

267
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,460
 the countryside doing my own thing. But what's this about? And basically the entire crowd turns

268
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:09,180
 around at once. All of his sisters, the uncle, Bertrand, his wife, everyone who sees him immediately

269
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:17,020
 goes, now that's Martin. That is Martin Guerrero. 100%. That's what happened to your leg. And he's

270
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,100
 like, oh yeah, I was wondering, you're going to ask me about that? Got chopped off, it got shot,

271
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,780
 or stabbed or something, and they had to operate and they cut the leg up. Now at this point, you have

272
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,540
 the new, the Martin Guerrero that we've been following this whole story, tried to like sneak

273
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,740
 a leak. Like he's dressing up, he's on top of a kid in a trench coat trying to sneak out of the

274
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:46,460
 crowd. He gets arrested. He was the imposter the entire time. And so they charge him with adultery?

275
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,140
 And fraud. They build the gallows outside of Martin and Bertrand's house back in the little village

276
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:01,900
 and they hang them. Now I get justice, but I don't want justice in my front yard.

277
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,380
 Martin goes off, he did run away because he was embarrassed about stealing the grain. He joined

278
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,380
 the military, got shot, leg got amputated. He ends up joining a monastery and they go, we don't

279
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,820
 really know why he went to a monastery, but he went to a monastery for a, for about eight, ten years.

280
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,020
 And then he was coming back to the region anyways and he started hearing about this trial in this

281
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,580
 other town. He was headed back to his hometown. He heard about this trial in this big city that

282
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,300
 actually had buildings and stuff. He walked over there, which it's a good thing he did because

283
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,180
 Bertrand and the uncle were about to be charged with all sorts of stuff. And this guy shows up,

284
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,100
 bangs your wife while you're in, while you're in the military, you're in monastery, you're missing

285
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,340
 a leg. Some guy shows up, bangs your wife, all that stuff. I get it, you want justice. I don't

286
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,020
 want it in my front yard. I don't want to be like, ah, it's time to have some lemonade. Oh wait,

287
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,420
 forgot the rotting corpse in my front yard. I'm going to go hang out in the back. And it took him

288
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,900
 a long time to forgive his wife because he said she should have known better. She should have known

289
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:04,140
 better. Who was this guy? We do know. His name was Arne de Till. He was a scoundrel. They kept referring

290
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:10,860
 him to us as a scoundrel afterward. Well, I guess being another dude's wife and insisting you're

291
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,380
 him would make you a scoundrel. Anyways, he's a scoundrel from another nearby town. He was in

292
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,620
 the military. He learned about Martin from a couple of friends and he learned enough details

293
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,540
 about him that he figured I can pull this off. I can sneak into his town. It's been eight years.

294
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,420
 I can chalk up a lot of stuff to just eight years passing. Now there had to have been a passing

295
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,740
 resemblance. I don't think he was like four feet taller than the dude. But I mean, if he had a

296
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,260
 mustache, people are like, you didn't have a mustache when you left. He's like, I know,

297
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,660
 but I can grow those. That's something I can do. That's something I can do. So anyways,

298
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,900
 he does get found guilty for this. And look at it from his point of view. At a certain point,

299
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:56,460
 he had to really start to believe that he was Martin Guerrero. Obviously, he wasn't going crazy.

300
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,820
 He's like, I am myself. But he had to start to believe this is actually going to work.

301
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,620
 And he woke up every morning playing with his newborn son, talking to his wife.

302
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,060
 And as he's sitting out on his porch drinking his lemonade, he's just looking at this field

303
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,980
 that he owns. And he's like, everything, my scam is going perfect. This everything is going exactly

304
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,260
 the way I want it. But what he doesn't realize is just a few years, just a few feet from where he's

305
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:29,660
 sitting, they're going to build a gallows outside of that house. And every morning that he woke up

306
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,020
 and looked out at his property, his ill gotten property, the stuff he came to possess because

307
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,700
 of a lie. Pretty soon, that would be the last thing he would see as that trap door gave way

308
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:49,100
 and the rope snapped his neck. Arna DeTill would look over the land of Martin Guerrero

309
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:56,380
 and wish one more time that he truly was the man he was pretending to be.
