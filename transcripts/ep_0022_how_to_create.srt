1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Oh wait, no. I gotta do the intro first.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 "From the deep seas to conspiracies."

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Kind of makes sense, right?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Welcome to Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Hey everyone, thanks for listening in to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Getting ready for this is our gonna be a Friday episode.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And then I'm gonna kind of take the weekend off.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm doing a little bit better with my sinus infection.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I went to the doctor today. They gave me antibiotics.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Now, I'm always concerned about taking antibiotics.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm always afraid my skin's gonna fall off.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'm not a hypochondriac.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 My uh...

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I have my brother. My little brother's a hypochondriac.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 He used to be. I don't know if he's so bad anymore, but...

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I'm not a hypochondriac. I just have a thing about taking antibiotics and my skin falling off.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I know it's super rare, but every time I take an antibiotic, when I start taking an antibiotic,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I'm always checking myself for rashes and stuff like that.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I'm allergic to penicillin.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 That was when I was a kid, and every doctor the past like five years was like,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 "No, you're not allergic to penicillin here. Take this."

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And I'm like, "Ugh, okay."

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And so, if my skin falls off, you guys know who to blame.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It wasn't because I was doing something stupid.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I was just taking antibiotics, but I'm feeling a little bit better.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 After this podcast, I'm gonna do some more reading.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I actually found some great articles, but we're gonna go ahead and do a story that I've been talking about all week.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's kind of like an instructional video, an instructional podcast,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 and we're gonna talk about two really cool conspiracies that kind of tie into that.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And what we're gonna just kind of gloss to kind of prep this up, it's how to create a good conspiracy theory.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Now, there's conspiracy theories about everything.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 The other day I was out talking with my friend, and we were talking about ticks,

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 and I said, "Have you heard the conspiracy theory that Lyme disease was a bio-weapon?"

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And she's like, "I hadn't heard that."

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And she's from the Midwest, and we talked a bit about that,

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 because it started showing up on the coast of where the Montauk research base was, where they do bio-weapons.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 But anyway, so there's conspiracy theories about everything.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 AIDS was a bio-weapon, so on and so forth.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But then you get these conspiracy theories that the ones that are the most easily disproven

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 are the ones that would require tons and tons of people to be part of the conspiracy.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So when we look at something like chemtrails, you can say that,

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 and we'll kind of be using that as an overall example as we go through these other stories,

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 but chemtrails is one, that you need whole flight crews, and you need airplane manufacturers,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 and you need all these levels of the military up and down to cover up this thing that they're pumping chemicals into our sky

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 to make us dumb, or to make us docile, which the last thing Americans are becoming is more docile.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Or to control the environment or whatever.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 A good conspiracy theory is really going to have three main points.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 It's going to involve a limited amount of people being involved in the conspiracy.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It should involve groups that people are normally suspicious of, and three time plus distance equals conspiracy.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Now, we're going to go over those and we're going to show how that kind of relates to the chemtrail thing.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We'll go into that right now.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 The chemtrail thing is supposedly happening right now, so we don't have the time issue.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's happening right now, so you can easily verify facts.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 It doesn't involve a limited amount of people.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It does have the first one, or it does have the second one, which is groups that are suspicious.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Generally, the government is a group that people are suspicious of, especially the military or any sort of spy group.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Depending on the audience, churches can be very, considered very suspicious.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 You have conspiracy involving a church or a religious group.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 But generally, things like the government.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 The government is the one that most people don't trust.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 The Illuminati stuff kind of plays into a distrust in the media, but you want to have it to be a group that you're initially suspicious of.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Out of those three factors, chemtrails really only involves one, because it involves the US military and the government and things like that.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Now, again, people ask me, "So what conspiracy theories, Jason, do you actually believe?"

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I talked before about the Lady Gaga one, which again, I don't know if she actually killed.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I've been talking to other people about that.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I don't remember what episode that was on. I think it was on Chop Shop.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I've talked to other people about it in real life, and I said, "I don't necessarily think that Lady Gaga..."

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 "I think the most likely thing is that this young woman died and the record company took her songs and took her image and gave it to Stephanie Jamato."

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And says, "Here, you be Lady Gaga." I think that's the most likely thing.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I don't necessarily know if Lady Gaga murdered her, but I think they had invested all of this money into this act, and then they moved it over to Lady Gaga.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And as I've been talking to people about the podcast, I was kind of explaining that to them.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 But anyways, so that's definitely a conspiracy theory that I lead a lot of way to, tend to give a lot of way to.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 There's another one. It's a very, very... It's not a very well-known conspiracy theory.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I remember I read about it when this article was first written, and it really does hit all three of those things that make up a good conspiracy theory.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And it has been one that when I came, the article was written in back in 2012, and it involves something that happened in the early 90s.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I remember reading it, and I go, "That is... I could absolutely believe this happened."

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So what this conspiracy theory is, is back in 90s, it was written from an anonymous record producer.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Back in 1999, down in LA, he was a mover and a shaker. He was like an influencer in the world of music.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 He gets invited to a private party, a private dinner at this mansion in LA.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So he shows up, you know, because why not? It's going to be a big week. He's fairly, you know, well off.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 He's going to hang out with other people or well off. So he goes there, and he goes in this room.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 He recognizes some of the other people. Some of them he doesn't recognize, but they all look like they're in the music industry.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 There's a couple people there who do not look like they're in the music industry.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Two guys in particular look like bodyguards or high-level security, and I believe there was two other people there who did not look like they were part of the music industry.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So all of the guy who's writing this letter is kind of hobnobbing with the other producers. They're kind of doing their thing.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And he said in the small group of the outsiders, they weren't talking to... they were just kind of keeping to themselves.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 They were like a small group of people talking to themselves, and then about... he says about 25 to 30 people were there total.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Most of them were record producers, and they're just kind of talking business.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Well, then the meeting starts. What happens is one of the guys, one of the people that he doesn't recognize,

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 who doesn't look like they're part of the music industry, first made sure everyone had signed a non-disclosure agreement.

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Everyone's like, "Okay, this is a little weird, but you know, whatever.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Probably maybe some new product getting rolled out or something like that." So they all signed a non-disclosure agreement.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And then the stranger says, "Okay, this is what's going on.

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 You work for record companies, and record companies are in business with us.

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Our business is private prisons.

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 We think it'll be financially beneficial for everyone involved to begin to push gangster rap music into the mainstream.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It will be good record sales for you, because rap music is definitely increasing in value.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 This again was back in '91.

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It'll be good for us, because we own prisons.

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 You're the people you work for, have a stake in these private prisons we're building.

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And you will have a choice right now to also buy stock in these private prisons.

103
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So that's the deal. That's what we're going to do here.

104
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Now, it wasn't presented as a "Would you like to join?" This is, "Your boss has money invested in us, and now we're telling you that this is the way we're going to go."

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And what happens is one of the guys asks, "What's a private prison?"

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Because these weren't well known back then.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And the person explains that private prison is a prison that is paid for by private investors,

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 but they get money back from the government, and they get money for the prisoners that they hold.

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And it's basically a private industry where the government's paying you to imprison people.

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And there's just this quiet over the room.

111
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Until one guy finally says, "You gotta be f**king kidding me."

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And he stands up, and two of the security guys that seem like security guards approach him,

113
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 they start scuffling. The guy who's writing this article, this letter, gets up with a couple other people, gets involved in the scuffle,

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 trying to break up the security guard and the record producer, and the security guards pull out guns, and they're escorted off the property.

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And as they're leaving, one of the friends, one of the people that they knew who was there was like, who helped organize it,

116
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 said, "Guys, remember, you signed an agreement. You better not say anything. You better not say anything."

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And the guy who wrote this letter turned to that guy who was kind of the intermediary and said, "Why are you involved in this?"

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And the guy said, "This is way bigger than just money. Just keep your mouth shut. You sign an agreement. Just keep your mouth shut."

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And so this record producer then goes on to say, "I saw that gangster rap did definitely become the most prevalent form of hip-hop,

120
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 and this was before the chronic came out. This was after NWA had already started,

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 but we had the huge boom of gangster rap around this time and afterwards."

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And so he said, "I saw that gangster rap became the biggest form of hip-hop. I saw how it started to overtake the music industry,

123
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 and I felt really bad that I didn't say anything, that this music is getting these young kids excited and they're going out and they're committing crimes

124
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 and they're increasing the incarceration rate, and then the government has to put these people in private prisons."

125
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 The end. That's the story. Now I'm going to post the link obviously, but let's...

126
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And like I've said before, I'm a fan of hip-hop. I read that and I was like, "Wow, I could definitely believe that happening."

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So let's take a look at why. One, it has a limited amount of people. The entire conspiracy involved...

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 There's about 30 people at this party and then you figure some heads of the record labels.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 All that you would need for this conspiracy to actually be plausible is a record label buys stock in private prisons,

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 either through some sort of huge portfolio or personally, they buy stock in a private prison,

131
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 and then the private prison people collude with the record companies to make rap music more violent.

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 That's it. You don't need this huge infrastructure. You just now need...

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 People put in other words like, "Oh yeah, you know, get our A&R reps and let's sign some hip music.

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Let's make this music happen." The harder the better. That's what the kids want.

135
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It doesn't take a lot for this conspiracy to take off.

136
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 A very limited amount of people because it's basically a business transaction.

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 They could have done it with just a record producer buying stock in a private prison and then producing the chronic

138
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 and just having this gangster rap album.

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 But this whole conspiracy at most is like, "There's 30 people in this room who knew about this meeting.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Let's add another five executives on top of it of the actual record companies."

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 One, it involves groups that are suspicious and involves both the government in a sense,

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 but more importantly, it involves corporations, just kind of the blind faceless corporation that's simply motivated by profit,

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 by both the record labels and the private prisons. That's their main goal is profit.

144
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 There's the little thing thrown off at the end that this is bigger than just money, and it's never really answered what it is.

145
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 But the faceless corporation is another key thing that people are just naturally suspicious of.

146
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Time plus distance, it definitely has the time component because the article came out in 2012

147
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 and it's referencing something that happened about 20 years earlier.

148
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 So you can't really verify a lot of facts. All you can do is say, "This guy says this event happened here

149
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 and then we can see rap music becoming more gangsterized after that."

150
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 But it's not like you could be there and you could interview these people or find out where this meeting was held or anything like that.

151
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 All that information is lost to the wind.

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Distance, not so much. Distance for, I think, on a social level because most of us aren't invited to those type of parties.

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So there's a social distance. There's not really a geographical distance, but sometimes just that social distance can help.

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But I think the biggest thing is the time issue.

155
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 If a rapper came out today and said, "Yesterday I went to a meeting and they told me to make more music about doing opioids

156
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 because Pfizer wants to sell more opioids," that stuff would be very easy to back up.

157
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 But you wait 20 years and say, "Yeah, Pfizer came to us and said, 'Hey, will you make more songs about Oxy?'"

158
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 After that point, we really can't verify anything.

159
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 So you take something as simple, and really the fourth component to a conspiracy theory is that it should tell a compelling story.

160
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 That's a compelling story.

161
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I think that people would be so interested in making money that they would ruin the lives of young men.

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 They would ruin the lives of young men just to make money.

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 That's a compelling story. It's kind of like, it's that heart of darkness.

164
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And then we have the heroes in the story, too.

165
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 The people who said, "We're not going to go along with this," and they get kicked out.

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 But the machines of greed continue to crush on.

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 That's an eight story.

168
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 I definitely think it could have happened.

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I wouldn't be shocked if I ever came across any other proof that it did.

170
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So, yeah, that's one of the...

171
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And when people ask me what conspiracies do you believe in, I'll actually say that one before I'll be like, "Oh, I think Lady Gaga was, you know, a compass to a murder."

172
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I'll tell them a hip-hop summit is what I call it.

173
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 The hip-hop story, and I'll go ahead and post that on there.

174
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Now, compared to something like Kim Trails, which involves tons of people in the time and everything like that,

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 so you can craft a really well-written conspiracy theory by just keeping those key things in mind.

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And I'm not asking everyone to go out and to start making up conspiracy theories.

177
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I just think it's something to take into account, because there definitely isn't, I think, an art to crafting a conspiracy theory that catches your attention.

178
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Whether or not it's real, you can have a real conspiracy...

179
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I come across stuff all the time that I can't make heads or tails of because it's poorly written.

180
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 I come across conspiracy theories that I think might be interesting, but they're so poorly worded.

181
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 You can have interesting... It's all about how interesting the story is, whether or not it's true sometimes is irrelevant.

182
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And again, we're going to finish it off with this, because I thought this was an interesting story.

183
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And this will, again, I go to that conspiracy list, the big conspiracy list.

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I may end up just putting that on the website as well, so you can take a look at it, but maybe not, because I kind of like it being surprised.

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I'll go through it. I'll look for ones that look interesting.

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Now, the Hip Hop Summit isn't on there.

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 The one we just covered about the Hip Hop producers making rap music to get people to commit crimes, to go to private prisons, to make money, that's not on this list.

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 But this one is.

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 I didn't get prepared for autonomous pronunciations, because we're going to Russia.

190
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 This is Lake Baikal. B-A-I-K-A-L.

191
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Lake Baikal is on the conspiracy list. It's about a mid-level conspiracy.

192
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And you're like, "Okay, great. This is going to be Sea Monster, right?"

193
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 "Maybe. This is going to be like some Atlantis stuff, right?"

194
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 "Maybe."

195
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 What if I told you that this plays into one of my theories, and it's Aliens from Underwater?

196
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Now, what's interesting is I had never really heard of Lake Baikal until probably about four hours ago, when I was looking for fun stuff on that list of research.

197
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And I see it pop up and there's just the words and I typed it in and I got a ton of articles about this place.

198
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And the reason why is because it has two things going for it.

199
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 One, it is the largest lake in the world.

200
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 It's the largest freshwater... Okay, that's not true. Kind of.

201
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It's the largest freshwater body of water in the world, so definitely it's still, you know, huge.

202
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 They say that the lake, according to this website, is 30 million years old.

203
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I think aren't all lakes like old as the planet?

204
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Aren't all... But anyways, and it has a depth of under.

205
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It has a depth of over 4,900 feet.

206
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

207
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

208
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

209
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

211
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

212
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

213
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

214
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

215
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

216
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

217
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

218
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

219
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

220
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

221
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

222
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

224
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

225
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

226
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

229
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

230
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

231
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

232
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 It has a depth of over 4,000 feet.

233
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 The two men are kind of looking at each other.

234
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 They realize, not only are they humanoids,

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 they're 10 feet long, 10 feet,

236
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 and they're wearing nothing but like tight, shiny suits with a helmet on.

237
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Swimming through the water, very fast.

238
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So the frogman surfaced and they said, they're, you know, freaking out.

239
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I don't know, I'm making that part up. Maybe they weren't freaking out.

240
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Maybe they were like totally calm.

241
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I'm not going to say anything either, so I'm not going to try it.

242
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 So the Russians go, there's some dudes down there in tight, shiny suits.

243
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And I mean, I think there's probably a little more involved in that

244
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 because the next thing you know, the government's like,

245
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 well, let's go down there and see if we can catch them.

246
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 So they start sending more people down there

247
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 and they start chasing them around with nets.

248
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Okay, so now that I'm saying it out loud, it does sound pretty preposterous.

249
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 But hold on.

250
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Well, no, it's preposterous no matter what.

251
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 They're chasing them with nets and before they can catch one of these giant guys,

252
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 there are seven of these frogmen this time chasing the guy with the net.

253
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 They're all throwing up out of the water like 30 feet

254
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 and they depressurize so much because they're so deep

255
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 that they all like get the bends or something.

256
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 They all start to like blow up inside of themselves.

257
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And three of them die and four of them were invalids, according to these articles.

258
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And it was interesting.

259
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 So on the other side, on the civilian side of it,

260
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 the people in town reported that they were,

261
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 or not in town, but they even know locals said,

262
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 this one local said, he saw it happen.

263
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 He saw a bunch of divers fly out of the water about 30 feet up in the air

264
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 and then smash back down.

265
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And he thought, why are they, why and how are they training their divers to do that?

266
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Like, I mean, why would you train them to be thrown out of the water so high and then hit?

267
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So you kind of get that backup story of that.

268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And since then, the military of Russia has said,

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 don't, we're not going to interact with whatever's down there at all.

270
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Now, is that story completely made up?

271
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I mean, I don't know.

272
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I, I, I, would I bet money that it's real?

273
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 No, of course I wouldn't.

274
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Would I like it to be real?

275
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Yeah, sure.

276
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And that plays into my idea that all these you,

277
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 because they've also talked about, they've seen monsters down there

278
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 and they've seen craft down there and things like that.

279
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And if you just had some sort of tunnel system in there, stuff could fly in and out.

280
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Plus, ooh, I just thought of this.

281
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Yesterday's episode, I said, if it's really cold, you can get bigger.

282
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 That might be why these people are 10 feet tall because they're in the cold

283
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 and they can live longer and eat more food.

284
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 But to me, that's a fascinating, it's a fascinating conspiracy.

285
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It meets all the things of a good conspiracy.

286
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It's far away.

287
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It took place a long time ago.

288
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It involves groups who don't trust, which again, this is a military,

289
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 and has a limited amount of people.

290
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You would just have the people on the beach who saw the event

291
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 and the few military personnel who were a part of it.

292
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And it's intriguing.

293
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 It's an intriguing story to think that underneath this lake,

294
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 underneath one of the greatest lakes on the planet Earth, is another civilization.

295
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Just kind of minding their own business doing their own thing

296
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 and you try to catch them in a net.

297
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 They mess you up.

298
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And again, like I've said before, I think that any sort of UFO craft that we see,

299
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 most likely, if it's real, if it's not like, you know, you're not, you're seeing it for real,

300
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 but it's most likely from this planet or from another dimension.

301
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And you may go, well, you know, that's no fun.

302
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Like, I want aliens.

303
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Here's the thing.

304
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 If they're from another dimension, they are the absolute definition of an alien.

305
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 There's something that we cannot comprehend in any way, shape, or form.

306
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I think if you saw something from another dimension, it would be the uncanny valley times of 1,000.

307
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I don't think your brain could even process the idea of something that doesn't, did not come from our reality of time and space.

308
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I don't think that you could even begin to comprehend it.

309
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 It would be like the nothing from the Neverending story.

310
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 You couldn't describe it.

311
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 It would be completely terrifying to you.

312
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Terrifying may be beautiful, but you want to be able to describe it.

313
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Or if they're from this planet and they're from, I don't believe in Hollow Earth, I'm not saying that,

314
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 but if they're from cave systems or from underwater and they share our DNA,

315
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 or they're related to us in some way, that is, I think, to me, that's more terrifying than something coming from outer space.

316
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Because something coming from outer space is going to be so unrelated to us,

317
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 we won't be able to communicate with them in any way, shape, or form.

318
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 They won't be able to communicate with us.

319
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 We'll have no shared values.

320
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 We want to recognize them as life.

321
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 They want to recognize us as life.

322
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 I don't even, but again, the distances are so great they never get here.

323
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 If they're from Earth, they're brutal, they're warriors.

324
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Every species on this planet fights for survival every single day.

325
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 If they're from this planet and they share our DNA, that is not good for us.

326
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So I think people may go, "Well, you know, that's kind of boring.

327
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Oh, they're from underwater."

328
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 To me, no, I think that's more fascinating because if they are us or distant relatives of us,

329
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 we've got to fight on our hands if they ever come up.

330
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 But again, I'm no Alex Jones. I'm not saying that's going to happen.

331
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I think it's an entertaining theory.

332
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And if someone, again, could make the oceans disappear and go,

333
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 "Jason, look, there's no aliens down there."

334
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I'd be like, "Okay."

335
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Or someone just said, "Yeah, no, there's no, you know, here's the proof that nothing..."

336
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I'd be like, "Okay, I'm not married to it."

337
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 My thing is, I just think that's far more plausible than them coming from outer space.

338
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 I think that's completely impossible.

339
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 But I've been proven wrong before, not often.

340
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I mispronounce words more often than I'm proven wrong.

341
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And I get facts wrong more often than I'm proven wrong, but that's different

342
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 because I'm not being proved wrong.

343
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I'm simply not doing my research, which I guess is kind of like being proved wrong.

344
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 But I'm the one with the microphone, so I get to decide when I'm proven wrong.

345
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Hey, guys, thanks for listening to the show.

346
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Again, I know I say this all the time, I'm having a ball doing this.

347
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It means a lot when I see people download the show

348
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 and people talk to me about the show, that's great.

349
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 DeadRabbit.com is the website.

350
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Twitter is @JasonOCarpenter.

351
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And my email is at DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com.

352
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I guess I gotta put that last part in.

353
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So I will be back Monday, as long as I don't get abducted by aliens,

354
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 which I don't believe in, but that may be the way they prove themselves to me tonight when I'm sleeping.

355
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I wake up and they're, "Dude, if I woke up and there was three gray aliens sitting over my bed, dude,

356
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 two of them are going to the hospital.

357
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Two of them are going to end up in Space Hospital.

358
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 They will be, the third one, I probably can't take three little dudes.

359
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 But, dude, those heads are so big.

360
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And think about it, no matter where you punch a gray in the face, you're hitting his eyeball.

361
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 That has to hurt.

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 That has to hurt.

363
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Could you imagine having eyeballs that are one-fourth the size of your face?

364
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Like, no matter, you couldn't box.

365
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 You couldn't box.

366
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 You couldn't even wrestle.

367
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 You could not gauge it.

368
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And, dude, you know what, now that I think about it, that's like this dumbest evolutionary trait.

369
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Though, grays are the weakest alien species ever.

370
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 They're way too vulnerable.

371
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And don't give me that telepath garbage, either.

372
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Oh, yeah, they're telepaths, and they can do that.

373
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 That's bogus, dude.

374
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 That's bogus.

375
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 I feel like when I tell people that I know how to read tarot cards, I'm just really good at reading people.

376
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I have no special skill.

377
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And neither do they.

378
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Grays bring it.

379
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 That's all I gotta say.

380
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 If I'm not back by Monday, it's because I'm covered in purple blood somewhere,

381
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 because I'm in some sort of alien arena, knocking dudes out,

382
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 punching reptilians and tripping tiger people from...

383
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 "Tigeria 7."

384
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I don't know.

385
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 But I think the antibiotics are kicking in.

386
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Have a great day, and I will have a great weekend.

387
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And I will see you Monday.

388
00:27:41,000 --> 00:28:00,000
