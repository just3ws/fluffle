1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
 Two stories that give us an insight into what happens to us after we die

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:12,920
 And then we take a look at the story of a Russian town that captured a bigfoot-like creature and held it prisoner

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,720
 For 40 years today on Dead Rabbit Radio

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:28,960
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,120
 I hope you're having a great day too man this show just in the last week has really taken off

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,500
 I'm getting like 800 downloads a day got an extra

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,360
 110 subscribers on YouTube just over the past five days. It's it's growing and I appreciate that guys

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,480
 And I'm thankful that you guys are all listening to it

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,180
 Recommending it to your friends recommending it to strangers. It's really really taking off and I appreciate that I really do I

10
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:58,440
 Also wanted to say I got some more fan art earlier this week from bin via email

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,440
 We'll post it in the show notes and then it'll be in the YouTube video

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,200
 apparently he's actually making a

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,140
 Power of what he called a PowerPoint level animation of the Thomas Dick episode. So yes, Mungo

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,380
 Mungo is in the episode and so those drawn to there. I appreciate all that fan art. It's amazing guys

15
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,040
 Thank you. I never really thought oh

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,560
 No, no, no, I'll save that till Monday. I'll save that till Monday

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,640
 I got this other weird piece of information that I'll talk about on Monday involving the show

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,380
 But we got a lot of stuff to cover today. So I can't thank you bin

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,120
 But yeah, I just can't keep going on about how awesome you guys are. Sorry

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,520
 Because people do I gotta I gotta do the other thing we got a lot to cover

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
 so the first thing we're gonna look at is

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,840
 Conflicting ideas of what happens after you're dead now, obviously, that's something that religion has you either go to

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,680
 Most religions some of your reincarnated

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,160
 But you go to a paradise or you go to hell a punishment place now recently

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,000
 I found this creepypasta and some of you guys may have already heard about this

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,480
 But I found some interesting details about it and want to give you my own take on it

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,560
 The photo is a naked man holding a nice block and of what appears to be poop and

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,760
 Notably a micro corg keyboard in the upper left hand corner now

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,040
 I can't put the photo on YouTube because they'll just take the video down because the dude's naked

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,320
 But I'll have it in the show notes, but let me read you this creepypasta here real quick

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,440
 This isn't a creepypasta channel

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,280
 But I think it's interesting to dissect to this because there's some weird stuff going on

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,520
 Clifford Hoyt age 31 suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident in 1999

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,720
 After he regained consciousness, he told a terrified nurse that he had died and

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,120
 Visited hell he expounded on the tortures and anguish he experienced in frightening detail

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,640
 He refused psychological treatment and was released several weeks later

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,120
 Hoyt's neighbors complained to their landlord that strange music was playing in his apartment at all hours of the night

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,280
 Upon investigating the building's owner found Clifford in this condition. So the photograph he's naked

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,160
 He's holding a nice block. There's much a poop and there's a micro corg in the background

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 He left and contacted mr. Hoyt's family who contacted authorities Clifford claimed that demons from hell

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,240
 We're still trying to capture him. He explained that his body would burn incessantly unless he played music to scare the demons away

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,040
 He would only leave the house for short periods of time to get minimal supplies

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,240
 Including large blocks of ice to soothe the burning he felt as he tried to sleep

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,700
 Doctors attribute Clifford's actions to brain damage suffered in the accident

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:40,240
 He currently resides in a mental rehabilitation facility in Maryland. So I came across this it's it's kind of older creepypasta

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,400
 But I just came across this pretty recently. I was like, oh, that's creepy, but it's most likely fake

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,880
 So I immediately

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,680
 Started tracking where this came from now. Here's the interesting stuff about this again

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,000
 I don't just want to read creepypasta. I thought that I read that and I was like

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,920
 I've heard people saying that when they die they've had life after death experiences of going to hell

51
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,840
 They're far more rare, but you do see them

52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,320
 But here's the thing the micro so this has apparently happened in 1999 the micro corg was not invented until

53
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,520
 2002 so whether or not the story is true the photo isn't

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,240
 The photo did was not taken in 1999

55
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:27,040
 Secondly, there was really a Clifford Hoyt. His name is actually Gary Clifford Hoyt and he had a car accident in 1999

56
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,920
 But he died in that car accident

57
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,680
 He was the single fatality of that car accident the other two people in the other car survived

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
 So there really was a guy named Clifford Hoyt full name Gary Clifford Hoyt

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
 And he did have a serious car accident, but he died

60
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,040
 This is what this was my take on this that it's most likely just creepypasta that they either they picked that name out at random

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,440
 And it happened to match or more likely somebody knew of that car accident and created this story

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,920
 But here's my little take on this. What if this is almost like a carnival of souls type of thing?

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,440
 Now carnival of souls is that is that movie where spoiler alert

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,640
 It's like 40 50 years old

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,880
 But this woman's ride gets in a car accident and then she gets out of the car and she goes to this town

66
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,240
 And it's super creepy and there's a bunch of ghosts chasing her around and at the ending it turns out that she really died in the car

67
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,040
 Accident all along and but people interacted with her while she was not knowing she was dead

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,640
 So was it all in her head with the people she was interacting where they real?

69
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,920
 Maybe this is a

70
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,940
 Example of that. I know that sounds super far-fetched, but it's just the story is weird to me

71
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,920
 I don't know. I don't know like I read it my when I was doing my research

72
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,680
 I thought I I feel like there's a little bit more to this

73
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,020
 Than just the standard creepypasta did he both die in that car accident?

74
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,440
 continue to live to have these horrible hallucinations and

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,040
 End up in a mental institution, but really he died in the car accident

76
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
 I don't know if I'm making sense

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:08,080
 But yeah, like and would we know like could this possibly be a Mandela effect type situation where reality has splintered

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
 And we have a foot in both realities

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,400
 The one where he died and the one where he's locked up

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,160
 Probably probably not

81
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
 Probably not but I thought I think it's an interesting story and again

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,440
 There's just something still not sitting right with me

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:31,320
 But going for I read that and the next day I read this other article about life after death very very fascinating thing going on

84
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,960
 So now we're going from wherever this dude died because I didn't write that down in my notes

85
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:43,880
 We're going to New York State the Big Apple the state that never sleeps. We're going to a place called hospice

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,640
 Buffalo

87
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,080
 Which that's the name of it hospice buffalo now

88
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,480
 It's not a hospice in the shape of a buffalo which would be where I would want to die

89
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,240
 I think it's just a hospice in the city of Buffalo and they just named stuff really badly over there

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
 There's a guy named dr. Kerr and

91
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
 He sounds like a bad guy

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,760
 He sounds like he is like an old-timey villain for an old-timey Batman, but dr. Kerr is actually a guy running this hospice and

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,520
 One time he was sitting there and he's thinking you know what I think I could have let this patient live longer if I

94
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,600
 Changed the IV like if I gave them a different IV thing and he's thinking about it

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,360
 So he went to get the patient and the nurse was with the patient and he goes hey

96
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,640
 I think I'm gonna set up this new IV thing and the nurse goes let me get her actual quote here

97
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,720
 Because this was a real event dr. Kerr says I walked in and the nurse didn't even look up and she said no no

98
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,200
 He's dying and I said why are you saying that and she said well he's seeing his deceased mother and

99
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:48,680
 Dr. Kerr said he just kind of laughed kind of chuckled like you know and the man died shortly after that and

100
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,720
 He started to notice a pattern his staff because he was running everything

101
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,280
 So he'd see the patients, but he wasn't in that day-to-day scene every patient all the time

102
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,320
 His staff knew when people were going to die not in a creepy final destination sort of way

103
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,600
 But they had gotten used to

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:12,480
 When people start talking about seeing their mom or seeing their sister or seeing people who had passed before them

105
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,520
 The nurses all knew he's they're gonna be dead in a short while a couple weeks a couple days maybe

106
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,680
 And so dr. Kerr said you know what let's start recording these

107
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,200
 Incidents let's see if there's any sort of patterns

108
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,840
 So for ten years at hospice Buffalo, they've started recording these incidents

109
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,280
 14,000 cases

110
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,000
 80% of the people who pass away

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,720
 Have a dream or a vision where a loved one comes back to them

112
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,000
 And they've actually been able to identify certain themes and he said one of the most common themes is travel

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,880
 They'll have dreams where they're packing their bags

114
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:01,120
 So weird and he goes their breath their body is old and broken, but their brains are still very very active

115
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,200
 So they'll start seeing their mom or their brother or their best friend who passed away before them

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,080
 They'll dream about them. They'll see them in the room sometimes with a vision and then they'll start having dreams where they're packing stuff up

117
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,400
 Getting ready for a journey a long journey now these aren't just the people who are having these dreams also say they're incredibly detailed

118
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:28,040
 They're the most incredibly detailed dreams. They've ever had they wake up sobbing because they're seeing someone that they miss and

119
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,840
 The person is bringing a sense of peace to them and it's funny because the reporter asked dr. Kerr

120
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,640
 So what do you think the scientific explanation for this or do you think it's a religious explanation for this and he his response was

121
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,480
 It doesn't really matter like I don't know and it doesn't matter

122
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,320
 He says they should just be respected period as far as like these experiences. They're going through

123
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,200
 Just respect that these people are actually having them the saddest thing in it because it's very heart. It's very

124
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,760
 Heartlifting is that a word? It's very affirming to know that

125
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,600
 That you see those people who left before you

126
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,280
 Helping you on that journey. I thought this was the saddest part of the story

127
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,960
 little kids

128
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,520
 little kids

129
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,380
 Who they're young so they haven't had they haven't had a lot of loss in their life

130
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,300
 You know your six your seven and your parents are still around your best friends are still around your grandparents are still around

131
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,780
 They dream about their pets

132
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,980
 They dream about any pets that they've lost

133
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,900
 little puppies

134
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,220
 That is so

135
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,020
 sad

136
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,020
 But again, it's sad to me

137
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,220
 But again, it's affirming to that little boy or that little girl who's kind of scared

138
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,260
 Because they're passing away, but then they see their little puppy Rover

139
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,980
 And they're just dream that they're petting their puppy that they lost two years ago

140
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,060
 And they're just they had that makes them at peace

141
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,660
 That makes them at peace as their body is failing when they sleep

142
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,380
 They're playing with their puppy that they're soon going to be reunited with

143
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,540
 The the big question is this and so that those studies are going on and they're not being done in any sort of scientific way

144
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,820
 They're just logging these dreams and visions. The big question is this this is what happens to people who are

145
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,380
 Dying in a hospice situation

146
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,540
 what happen is there something similar to this if your head gets chopped off or

147
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:37,740
 You fall off a bridge or you get riddled with bullets and a drug deal gone wrong like is there a correlation between these two things I

148
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,900
 Would think yes, and this is again

149
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:48,700
 Going back to a whole carnival of souls type thing like let's say I'm sitting in my apartment and a bunch of gangbangers raid it and

150
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,860
 Just blow my brains out

151
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,140
 That event is going to take a total of three minutes

152
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,780
 From the point where they knocked down the door to the point that I snapped two of their necks and stab another one in the chest

153
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,740
 Do a witty one-liner throw him out the window and then the shotguns to the back of my head and I'm like damn it

154
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,780
 As that bullet enters my brain, I almost think that the brain runs into a bullet time mode

155
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,660
 And I'm able to have those same affirming experiences

156
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,380
 I think at the moment that you die

157
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,660
 whether it takes three weeks for you to die or

158
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,100
 Three seconds for you to die. I think your brain still

159
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,980
 Processes that and they're my backup for that is when you dream dreams seem like they're hours or months or yeah

160
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
 I've had dreams that have lasted decades

161
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,420
 But it really was only three seconds in my brain that was shooting that spark but to me it felt like 70 years in my dream

162
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,180
 So I do think that's possible

163
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:53,320
 I think that in the moment of death like the horrible torture you go through will probably be I should say will but let's say that you're

164
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,140
 You're you fall into a wheat thresher feet first

165
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,380
 That's awful, but I think at the last moment you do find that piece as fleeting as it may seem

166
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,300
 Physically mentally it is on par of a little girl holding her puppy

167
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,260
 I think at the moment of death you are at peace in your brain. It gives you it gives you a good dream

168
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,860
 I don't think anyone ever really dies horribly

169
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,420
 But now let's go to the world of cryptids

170
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,140
 Yes, yes cryptids because we've talked a lot about cryptids this week

171
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,860
 And we talked about zermatism earlier and he was saying

172
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:33,100
 Stanislaw was not Stanislaw Stanislaw was saying that all over the world

173
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:40,420
 There are stories of bigfoot-esque creatures and he named off a couple of them the woodwows in

174
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:48,340
 Britain and a bunch of other ones now one of the ones he named off was the almas of Mongolia the bigfoot-esque creature

175
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,300
 I started looking around at a couple of them and there is a story

176
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,460
 from the

177
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,060
 1870s of an Alma that was actually captured

178
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,540
 So let's go back in time to the 1870s. Let's get in the carpenter copter

179
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,860
 Actually, no, that'll probably bring too much attention

180
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,420
 Let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy. That'll be a little more

181
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,940
 Bit of subterfuge because we don't want to get captured by these people either

182
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:21,020
 We go into the Jason Jalopy we go back in time we're in the 1870s

183
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,740
 We're in Russia Far East Russia Mongolian area

184
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,740
 So I should have told you to grab your jacket because it's gonna get really cold out here

185
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,820
 But it's too late, so you're probably gonna get frostbite. These are the remote forests of

186
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,940
 Abcazi

187
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,740
 Abcazia Abcazia no it's not a realm from Lord of the Rings. It's actually a real place

188
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:50,180
 Abcazia there's a village there just a normal little Russian village back in time doing villager stuff thatched tuts

189
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,960
 fire with a little pot over it a

190
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,180
 Metal pot and then you know, they're making stew and little kids are running around with little sticks

191
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,060
 hitting each other whatever and so

192
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,660
 These two hunters. I don't know how many hunters, but anyways these hunters come out of the woods and they're like

193
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,460
 We caught one we caught one and everyone's like what's going on?

194
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,260
 hunters start leading a huge

195
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,180
 hairy woman

196
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,620
 into the camp at

197
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,860
 Musket point or arrow point whatever they had

198
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,860
 ranged weapon pointed at her

199
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:31,900
 That's that's actually gonna be really bad taste when I reveal this but

200
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,980
 She comes walking in they have her captured

201
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,220
 She's taller than anyone else there. She's very very strong

202
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,700
 They say but they don't say how they know that I don't know if she was like snapping next in the woods

203
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,140
 Or knocking over trees, but anyways

204
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,520
 these Russian hunters captured an

205
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,380
 Alma a large

206
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,860
 Bigfoot-esque beast of the Mongolian region now

207
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,260
 This is how they're normally listed there can be between five which isn't super tall

208
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,220
 But between five to six and a half feet they actually have a lot of Neanderthal like features

209
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,660
 pronounced brow

210
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,860
 flat nose

211
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,740
 Weak chin this one was covered in hair sometimes they're hairy sometimes they're super hairy sometimes they're just normal hairy

212
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,780
 Sometimes they're just like Italian hairy, but anyways this one comes in

213
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:31,500
 And then you know they got it at ranged weapon point and they're like what do we do with this thing?

214
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,900
 I mean this thing is monstrous. It's one of the almas

215
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:40,060
 We can't really let it go because then it might like just start bashing us in

216
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,940
 But we can't really keep a prisoner here because it's so strong, but the village elders go

217
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,700
 That we can't let it go at least in this town. We know where it's at at all times

218
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,700
 Now there was something about it that they thought

219
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,380
 Maybe we can communicate with it

220
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:03,740
 so they tried speaking to it in whatever language I don't think they were speaking Russian that far out in

221
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,540
 The in the area, but probably they were speaking something

222
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:14,420
 And they tried speaking something to this creature and it wouldn't say anything it wouldn't say anything it was mute

223
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
 It would just make noises

224
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,860
 So they're like okay well we can't tell it not to kill us if it sees us out in the woods

225
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,300
 So our safest bet is to keep it isolated in this village. We'll just keep it prisoner

226
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,460
 Now what's bizarre is this is the story we have we have them capturing the Alma they name it Zana and

227
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,660
 then we have

228
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,620
 40 years later she was prisoner for 40 years and in that time period

229
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,140
 One of the tribe members well, I believe one of the elders, but one of the tribe members

230
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:57,140
 fell in love with Zana this massive hairy beast that they they could they considered it a beast they considered it a beast and

231
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,260
 he fell in love with it and he wooed it and

232
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,140
 Had sex with it. So he's banging this mythical creature

233
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,660
 that they have always been leery of in this area and

234
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,700
 They have four kids

235
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:20,220
 Four kids two of the sons lived long enough to have children of their own and I believe two of them died fairly early

236
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,500
 And after 40 years of captivity now

237
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:30,460
 Married to this dude now raising kids still never said a word the children could talk

238
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,540
 Children could totally talk fine

239
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,180
 But Zana never said anything but after 40 years eventually love conquers all but death and

240
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,580
 Zana passes away

241
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,420
 this story has been very popular in

242
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,100
 Russian

243
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,940
 Mongolian circles

244
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,620
 To the point that scientists said, you know what we really need to figure out what Zana was

245
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,300
 Let's get DNA from her descendants

246
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,940
 Like and then it'll show was she a humanoid?

247
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 Was she something else?

248
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,020
 So a couple years ago

249
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,580
 They did it

250
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:16,100
 They got DNA from her grandson, and I think they actually might have had her tooth. I'm a little iffy on that

251
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,580
 They got DNA from some of her grandchildren, and they look at it and they're like hmm, okay

252
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,860
 Let me let me run these numbers again because this was not a good story if this is true

253
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,820
 And they're looking at the numbers and they're like kind of holding the report upside down and they're like

254
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,140
 This is not what we thought now every so often we'll find bigfoot hair and they run it to a laboratory and

255
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,300
 It's a dog or they'll find a big footprint and they'll start analyzing it

256
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,900
 And it turns out to that like this is obviously a fake

257
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:55,780
 This is the worst example ever ever of you running a test on a bigfoot type creature and it coming back as something else

258
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:02,700
 Because basically the story people have been telling for close to a hundred years about how this Russian town had captured a

259
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,780
 Alma

260
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,140
 Turns out that when they do that when they did the test on

261
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,940
 the grandson and

262
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,700
 They ran all the numbers

263
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:23,460
 That the creature who was described as a large hairy creature who couldn't talk and roamed around and was prisoner for 40 years

264
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,900
 Was a black woman

265
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,900
 That's that's what they caught they caught a black woman in the woods and

266
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,380
 they kept your prisoner for 40 years and

267
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:44,140
 They had a bunch of babies and she never said a word they want to let her do nothing except you know run around and

268
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,100
 Yeah, that's I mean there's

269
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,780
 People generally people who are racist are like yeah, I'm racist. I'm totally cool with it

270
00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,220
 Be an accidentally racist is the worst like at least the person who's who's just like oh, no, I'm totally racist

271
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,740
 I don't like this racist. Okay, but when you're accidentally racist

272
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,020
 It's kind of worse because you don't think you're being racist trapping a

273
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:16,340
 Black person for 40 years because you think they're a monster is the worst example of being accidentally racist

274
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,340
 I've ever seen so

275
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:25,300
 Apparently what happened was they run around the test and they said she would have been 100% sub-saharan African and

276
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,520
 There were a bunch of they had just freed a bunch of slave like slavery ended in Russia. I believe two years prior to this

277
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,180
 So there was a bunch of free slaves running around in the in Russia in general

278
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:47,020
 But in that particular area they figure that she must have just gotten lost from like who she was with or was just wandering around

279
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:54,140
 She ran into these hunters who were probably smaller who probably were physically smaller than her

280
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
 I don't know where the hair thing comes from

281
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,180
 Why they kept describing her as super hairy, but they saw this tall black woman and they're like oh

282
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,620
 You must be a monster and they captured her they captured her and they held her prisoner for 40 years

283
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,640
 And then for decades and a hundred years people are telling the story about this town that caught this bigfoot now

284
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,140
 That story in and of itself accidental racism aside the story of the almas

285
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,460
 Is even more fascinating than that. There's a reason why

286
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:27,500
 They said this must be an Alma. I'm gonna keep going back to Bigfoot literature here in Bigfoot literature

287
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,820
 It is it's the Native American saw it as this spirit creature

288
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,860
 And when the Westerners came here, they've seen it as this one off maybe in a group of three or four

289
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,860
 Type of creatures that are spotted, but there's no proof ever found

290
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:49,060
 There's there's maybe one video clips and blurry photos stuff like that the almas are amazingly

291
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,580
 Documented not in modern times, which is what makes it interesting

292
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,420
 Like I said, it was the description of a Neanderthal pronounced brow flat nose weak chin

293
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,780
 How would somebody in the Middle Ages

294
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:08,220
 Know what a Neanderthal looked like we know what they look like now because we have

295
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,540
 Creations and drawings of them, but they shouldn't have had those back then they didn't have forensic anthropology

296
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:20,260
 They shouldn't have been able to say this creature looks just like this type of human that it used to exist

297
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:27,120
 Unless they were seeing them then there's this book. There's this book. It is a Tibetan

298
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,180
 medicinal book

299
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,180
 There is a drawing of an Alma and a description of the Alma

300
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,100
 everything else in that book is a

301
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,820
 Plant or an animal that lives today and can be verified

302
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:48,060
 That book has no mythological creatures in it at all no dragons no

303
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:54,440
 Groot slangs nothing deer and tigers and berries and bananas and whatever

304
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,440
 Everything in that book is scientifically verifiable. You can see it today

305
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,660
 Except for the Alma so that makes people think why would you write this huge?

306
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,020
 It basically be if you picked up Grey's Anatomy and you flip through it and on page 84 was an elf

307
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,900
 And then you went to the next page and it was a thorax

308
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:19,640
 That's how this book was set up. It was 100 percent everything we can do while 99 percent we can verify exists

309
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,580
 except for this creature and it wasn't the almas warrant a

310
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,380
 solitary small group type of thing in

311
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,220
 1420 there was a guy named Hans

312
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,620
 Schlittberger he was taken prisoners by the Mongols. He's tape brought back being brought back to the con

313
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,540
 Here was his quote. He survived long enough to write a book and talk about his journeys

314
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,700
 But as her imagine you're in a caravan

315
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,660
 coming through a the steps of

316
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:56,020
 Mongolia so your care your your carriage is all bumpy because they can't drive it right it's like one wheels on one step one wheels on the other

317
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,620
 You're coming through this and you're this westerner and you look out the window

318
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:09,220
 And this is what you see on the same mountain. There are savages who are not like other people and they live there

319
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:17,180
 They are covered all over the body with hair except the hands and face and run about like other wild beasts in the mountain and

320
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,460
 Also eat leaves and grass and anything they can find the Lord of the country sent to Eddy

321
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,500
 Gee a man and a woman from among these savages that had been taken in the mountain

322
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:35,900
 So we have another instance of these creatures being captured, but you're he's looking at them

323
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
 He's seen a

324
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:43,660
 basically a herd a tribe of village whatever words you want to use for these beasts these

325
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,660
 Neanderthal like beasts being cited in the year

326
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,420
 1420 when Hans was a captive

327
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,700
 So did these creatures exist?

328
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,580
 I think if anything these probably I mean we don't have photos of them now

329
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,380
 But there's it's in a super remote area. It's one thing to be walking through Oregon and see a big foot

330
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,740
 It's another thing to have to endure the harshness of the Mongolian

331
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:12,660
 Landscape just to get a photograph and they probably just beat you to death. Actually, it's funny. They keep getting captured

332
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,740
 So they're probably really sucky at combat and they eat leaves and grass

333
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,300
 So I don't know like how strong they really could be

334
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,140
 But they also eat like other animals as well

335
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,940
 My main diet wouldn't be leaves and grass if I was a cryptid

336
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,460
 It's kind of a you want to you want to have sharp teeth to eat people but anyway, so these creep

337
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,740
 I mean these creatures are probably the best bet we have for

338
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,700
 Proving that there's some sort of bigfoot-esque creature and one last story to wrap up the Alma mystery

339
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,100
 I think probably they did exist at some point. I think the descriptions too accurate to things

340
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,100
 We do know existed I eat enough in the andre thals

341
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,580
 I do think they existed at some point in very very modern history and at this point

342
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,460
 They could have been completely wiped out or gone underground or something like that

343
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:02,220
 But one last interesting tidbit to this in 1941 when Germany invaded Russia the Red Army captured a spy a

344
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:09,540
 Big Harry spy who wouldn't talk won't say anything and the Russians blew his brains out because what else are you gonna do?

345
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,500
 You're getting invaded you're you read you see someone that you don't

346
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,580
 He's not a local. He's not Russian. He's a big Harry dude

347
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,640
 He's not talking to you so they shoot him and there's always been the idea that that also could have been an Alma

348
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,820
 Because he was a wild man couldn't speak covered in hair

349
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,540
 I know the Germans were pretty savvy on their you know spying, but I don't think they're like hey

350
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:35,820
 Groober over there make sure you don't shave for a while and run around in the woods and maybe you can pick up some intel

351
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
 They probably caught an Alma

352
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,260
 Here's the weird thing really the world is so vast

353
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,980
 That you can have entire

354
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,100
 Tracks of land that are not explored or

355
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,360
 Haven't been visited by humans in a long long time

356
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:01,740
 There are forests and jungles and planes and caves that we know of or might not

357
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:09,040
 But we don't go to them to those to it to those cryptids to the almas

358
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,500
 Who are in hiding still having their civilization?

359
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,620
 Somewhere we are the cryptids

360
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,780
 Every so often they may catch a glimpse of a human or

361
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:28,860
 Look up and see a plane and that's their cryptid. That's their legend. Those are their creatures that keep them up at night us

362
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,680
 This kind of plays into the whole missing 411 thing like

363
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:39,220
 When we go when when humans go into the woods, we are now on their turf when we go into these vast planes

364
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:46,260
 We're now on their turf when we move out of civilization. We are on the turf of the cryptids and

365
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,860
 It makes you wonder how many humans have been kidnapped and

366
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,940
 held prisoner for 40 years in

367
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,820
 these dark hidden remote villages

368
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,780
 We'd never hear their stories

369
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,380
 They would just vanish and in that village

370
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,540
 They would tell their children the time that they caught the small person with weak limbs

371
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,460
 To prove the stories true that we really existed
