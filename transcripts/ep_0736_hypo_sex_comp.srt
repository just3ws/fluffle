1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 A ghost does whatever it takes to ensure it is never forgotten.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,520
 And then we travel to the Ukraine to meet a man who was woken in the middle of the night

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,880
 when a tiny ball-headed man and four hot alien babes enter his bedroom.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:25,120
 I guess you could say he had a close encounter of the "turned-on" kind today on Dead Rabbit Rehearsal.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,320
 "I'm a freak down, actually I'm a walk freak down."

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,400
 Garvin or I'm having a great- I'm actually not having a great day, but I hope you guys are. I hope

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,880
 you guys are having a great day. What is that truth in journalism? I think you guys probably

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,520
 picked up on it yesterday's episode. I record a lot of these episodes back to back now because I

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,640
 have a new job and I don't have as much free time as I used to, but I record a lot of these

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,320
 episodes back to back. Yesterday's episode I think you could tell as it was going on I was getting

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,040
 sicker and sicker. I'm actually battling a bit of an earache right now which if you have human ears

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,520
 you're not an alien. You'll know that ears and throat it's all together so talking sucks, but

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,160
 you know what man? You know what doesn't suck is you guys. So if I have to be in a little bit of

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,160
 pain to do a show for you guys I'm gonna do it. Let's go ahead and introduce one of our let- you

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,440
 know actually I want it because I want to cover you guys too. Let's introduce someone who supported

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,120
 the live stream. This was from the Thanksgiving episode of 2019. It's been a while. I don't even

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,760
 know this person still listens to the show, but there are guests of honor coming into Dead Rabbit

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,280
 Command right now. It's Thought Not. Everyone give a round of applause to Thought Not. He's like,

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,600
 "Dude, what? I don't even listen to this show anymore, but I guess I'm here for this episode."

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,360
 Thought Not, thank you so much for your donation back in 2019. You're gonna be our captain, our

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,360
 pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys don't have a time machine

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,280
 to support that old live stream that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show.

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,640
 Really, really helps out a lot. Thought Not, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys.

25
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,600
 Oh great, I have to make sound effects too. My throat. This is gonna be a tough episode.

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,080
 Thought Not, I wanna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. I put a muffler on it,

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,320
 it's not as loud. I'm gonna toss you the keys to Jason Jalopy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:32,640
 Command. We are headed on out to Helena, Montana. Thought Not's driving us all the way out there.

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,920
 We're at Carroll College. It's the early 1960s and specifically we got rejected by all the girls

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,560
 on the green. Yes, I do smell like a diaper. We walk up and we're walking around the dorm room of

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,920
 St. Charles Hall. And this is where all the students are staying and they have like these communal

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,640
 bathrooms. And it's late at night and this guy comes back from the party. He's like, "Dude, that was

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,120
 such a dope party." And when I say dope, it's the 1960s. I mean we were actually doing heroin.

34
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,800
 And so he's walking around and he's really drunk and he's there to brush his teeth.

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
 And he's drunk, which is a bad combination. And he's like, "Shhh."

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,800
 Brush in his teeth and then he loses his balance, which is what you will do when you're drunk.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,600
 And he slams his head into the bathroom sink and then falls to the ground.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,520
 People find him. He's laying there on the ground. They probably hear it. The sound of a human head

39
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,440
 hitting his sink is unmistakable. Even if you've never heard it before, you've heard it. It's the

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,680
 weirdest thing in the world. I heard a man fall down the stairs once. Did I ever tell that story

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,080
 on the podcast? I saved this dude's life just happened like a year or two ago. He fell down

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,520
 the stairs and I've never heard a human fall down a flight of stairs before. But when I heard it,

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,560
 I knew exactly what it was. I hope that wasn't what it was. I was hoping an air conditioner

44
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,600
 fell out. But you know it's weird. I've never heard a human tumble down the stairs. Human head

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,120
 hits the sink. You've all heard it, even though you haven't heard it. People go in there and he's

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,080
 bleeding out and they take him to the hospital and he has a severe cerebral hemorrhage. They're

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:18,400
 doing surgeries to try to relieve pressure, but nothing works and he passes away. Tragic, tragic

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,320
 story. And it happens. It's one of the big dangers with alcohol abuse. Tragic, absolutely tragic

49
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,560
 story. And it happens. It's not incredibly uncommon for people to have the guy who fell

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
 down the stairs, by the way. He was actually a hardcore alcoholic and he was super drunk

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,080
 and he tumble down the stairs. So, and we had to get the ambulance involved. He was, he would

52
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,520
 have died. The same thing basically. But he luckily survived and I think I've talked about it on the

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,000
 show. But the point is, is that this guy didn't. This guy, this guy, he's not, didn't go on to have a

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,040
 long career. Unfortunately, as I laugh, it didn't go on to have a long career and have kids and

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,520
 family. He died because of alcohol related injuries. Now, that was depressing. That was

56
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,880
 depressing when I put it that way. Let's refocus. At first people just kind of were sad that this

57
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
 had happened to this young man. But over time, people started to notice they'd go into the bathroom

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,880
 and they'd be washing their hands. They'd be brushing their teeth.

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
 They'd be listening to a white noise machine of the ocean.

60
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,360
 At one point they looked down and they see a blood stain on the sink. They go, "Oh, that's

61
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,320
 kind of tasteless. They didn't, they didn't clean this off. They didn't, they didn't wipe off the

62
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,280
 blood." And so they call the janitor. Maybe they try washing it off first, but call the janitor,

63
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,560
 janitor comes, scrubs it down. A couple days later, "Man, you know, I sure need to relax. Where

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,320
 did I leave that white noise machine?" They're in the communal bathroom. You go in, the blood

65
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,160
 stain is on the sink again. So that became a regular thing. You'd wash it off and the blood

66
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,040
 stain would slowly reappear. Creepy. Maybe paranormal. May just be bad janitors. Who knows?

67
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,480
 But then people started to see a blood stain appear on the floor.

68
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
 Try washing it off. They'd scrub it out. It'd be gone a couple days later. Blood stain would reappear.

69
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,880
 So at this point you are starting to think paranormal. And I'm sure a lot of people, I

70
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,680
 would have been thinking it was paranormal with the first blood stain as well. But at this point

71
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,480
 people are probably thinking, "Okay, this has to be weird." But then people would be in the bathroom.

72
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,360
 It's a communal bathroom. It's open all the time. Sometimes it's packed. Sometimes it's empty. Sometimes

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,880
 you're the only one in there. And people would go in there and they'd be washing their hands

74
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
 after going to the bathroom. And they'd hear a...

75
00:06:49,280 --> 00:07:10,320
 The sound of heavy breathing from somewhere in the bathroom. A couple times students were doing

76
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,200
 their business and then turned on the faucet and blood came up. Okay, so this is where I was reading

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,400
 this and I thought those first three things I could totally see happening. Those would basically be,

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,400
 as far as a paranormal researcher goes, I lived in a house that had a blood stain or a stain.

79
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,520
 My parents would never say it was a blood stain. We knew that the previous tenants moved away

80
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,720
 and there was a huge stain in the living room. It was about the size, I don't know, it was probably

81
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,840
 two feet by a foot. And we cleaned it over and over again and it was a reddish brown stain. We all

82
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,680
 knew what blood looked like. But they would never confirm that it was a blood stain or the previous

83
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,280
 tenants were murdered or one of them was murdered. And the other one was in the attic. But yeah,

84
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
 I've had that experience. The stain would wash out and it would be normal. You would look at the

85
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,120
 carpet and it would be totally fine. And over the course of about a month the stain would reappear.

86
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,880
 Actually, we washed it two or three times and we just put a throw rug over it.

87
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,160
 That would be a very low level haunting. Definitely concerning real paranormal activity type stuff,

88
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,720
 but that's to be expected in a haunted place. Unusual sounds,

89
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,320
 stains, those are both pretty normal. Blood coming out of the faucet is creepypasta level.

90
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,720
 You turn on the faucet and blood shooting out of it. Now see at that point,

91
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:41,360
 this is what I would do as a paranormal researcher. Again, it's randomized. So it's not like you could

92
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,960
 prove this, but it's not like there's a chance that you're actually going to be there. But

93
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,200
 the reason why that doesn't work is part of the legend. Just think about it. A blood stain on the

94
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,280
 sink is a stain. Blood stain on the floor is a stain. You could probably record the heavy breathing,

95
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,520
 but if it didn't pick up on the recording you would figure, well, it's because it's spiritual

96
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:09,760
 technology. Blood coming out of a sink could be saved in a vial, could be tested. You could take

97
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,120
 it to the laboratory out of college. And I'm not saying they had the best DNA analysts, and you don't

98
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,520
 even have to tell DNA. You could take the blood. There's so much blood coming out of this thing,

99
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,880
 you could take it, and you could have run a test on it. Is human blood? Is it deer blood? Is it

100
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,080
 bulbariths blood? The arch demon of hell? So I don't really, I think one of two things are the

101
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,960
 pipes are rusty, which is the most likely thing. Because although I believe in ghosts, and I've

102
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,680
 encountered ghosts, and I've seen demons and stuff like that, you still have to be skeptical about

103
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,320
 certain things. You can't believe in everything. So with this particular thing, I like breaking the

104
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,120
 story down like this, the blood in the sink I think was probably either made up, rusty water,

105
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,360
 or it could have been real. But why wouldn't you have saved some of it? It'd be splashing everywhere.

106
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,640
 There'd be more blood on the stain on the sink, even if it was phantasmal blood in the sense that

107
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,760
 it was some sort of illusion, you think you would at least cup your hands full of it and start running

108
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,480
 down the hallway and go, "Look everyone, look everyone, it's that dude's blood." And then they

109
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,640
 look and it's just water. But we don't have anything of that. We just have the blood. You know what I

110
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,200
 mean? That is too much evidence. And I think really any paranormal researcher worth their salt would

111
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:35,120
 be hesitant to put any stake in that. But just reporting that there was blood in the water,

112
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,640
 blood coming out of the sink. And then here we go back to something that I actually believe

113
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,800
 is possible, and it's the most fantastical if you think about it. Blood coming out of the

114
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,320
 sink would be gross if it was real, but there was a student, depending on the article,

115
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
 some people say this happened to multiple students, some articles said this only happened to one.

116
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,000
 This is a very well documented haunting. The college actually does ghost tours in this area now,

117
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,400
 but a student, at least one, one night was all by themselves in the bathroom. They're standing

118
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,720
 there all by themselves, they're washing their hands, and they look up in the mirror and standing

119
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,880
 behind them. This is the most terrifying thing, right? You guys knew where this was coming, right?

120
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:19,040
 We're in a bathroom. Standing behind them is the young kid who died, and he has this huge wound

121
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:27,200
 in his head. His skull is cracked open, and he's covered in blood. Now that would ruin anyone's day.

122
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,760
 The school, after this event, either one person or again, depending on the story, some people say

123
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,400
 multiple people saw this. The school goes, you know what, we're done with this. One, the cleaning

124
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,080
 bills are super high. We have to have our janitors check this place out all the time too. They found

125
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,040
 out about our horrible rust problem in the pipes and how it's slowly poisoning them. They said,

126
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,040
 we're done. After this ghost showed up, they boarded up the bathroom. You can't use it now,

127
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,560
 but they do do ghost tours. In October, you can go and walk around this with a tour guide,

128
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,040
 and they go in there. We always talk about this. Urban legends and cryptids, a lot of those are

129
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,520
 cautionary tales. Don't swim in the river because you might die, but people won't listen to that,

130
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,600
 so you tell them don't swim in the river because a ghost might get you, and that sticks in your

131
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,040
 head longer. By the college saying, hey, there was this ghost who got too drunk, and he fell over

132
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,840
 and banged his head, that's a cautionary tale about getting too drunk and goofing off in a bathroom,

133
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,080
 so it wouldn't make sense that the college would kind of prop that story up. But yeah, I just love

134
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,040
 the idea of urban legends and why they exist and stuff like that. Thought not, let's go ahead and

135
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,680
 leave behind Carol College. I'm going to toss you the keys to the carpenter copter. We are headed on

136
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:53,120
 out to the Ukraine. But while we're headed out there, super quick, take a minute or two,

137
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,880
 a dead rabbit recommends for you. It's not a movie, which I normally recommend. It is a

138
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,440
 short story, it would be the best way to describe it. It would probably take you maybe 10-15 minutes

139
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,520
 to read. You'll be thinking about it for weeks, months, really. I read this thing a couple years

140
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,040
 ago, maybe two or three years ago, and I think about it so often. It's such a really cool piece

141
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:22,560
 of literature. There's a website called scp Secure Contain Protect. I think those are what it

142
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,120
 stands for, and it's basically a collaborative work of fiction. Most of you guys are probably familiar

143
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,880
 with it, where it's all of these objects and all of these creatures and people that are locked up

144
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,880
 in this facility, and then each page is their background. So there's a lot of SCPs, like there's

145
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,120
 this monster that if you look at it, it doesn't get you, but if you turn away, it comes after you.

146
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,920
 There's SCP video games, and the universe has really expanded over and over again, and then they

147
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,960
 had like a breakaway one called RPC or RCP or something like that, which I believe is still

148
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,280
 around. I used to read them. It's really cool. You can just go on a random one, and they're pretty

149
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,680
 short, so if you get a bum one, you're just like, "Ah, whatever. That was only a waste of a couple

150
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,920
 minutes of my time." There's one that's always been stuck in my head. It's probably the one you

151
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:15,360
 guys are thinking about, too. Honestly, it's just a great work of fiction. It's SCP-1733. I put it

152
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:25,520
 in the show notes. It's the story of a DVR recording of a basketball game,

153
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:33,760
 and it's locked up right now. This DVR machine is locked up deep in this underground facility,

154
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:41,440
 along with all these monsters and world-ending events and never-ending staircases and portals,

155
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,520
 all this stuff. There's this DVR that's assigned its own room in this giant facility. It's a DVR

156
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:54,880
 recording of a basketball game, and every time you watch it, it changes. Little changes at first,

157
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:02,720
 right? The score is different. Maybe a ref makes a different call, but it changes,

158
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,480
 and what you do is you can read this article, and it gives you a brief outline of it, and then

159
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,720
 you get to the bottom of it. Because it's easy to miss. It'll have a little link that says "Partial

160
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,280
 Timeline Document 001," and you click on that, and it shows... It's really cool. It's really,

161
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,400
 really cool, because it's written. It's supposed to be real. It's supposed to be these scientists

162
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,760
 who are testing it. They start saying, "Play 007," like the seventh time they've played it,

163
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,640
 the fifteenth time they've played it, the hundredth time they've played it, and it shows that the

164
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,360
 people in the DVR recording start to realize that their day is getting reset

165
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,640
 every time someone hits play. It's really, really cool fiction, and I can't think of anything else

166
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,000
 like it. It's really good. I mean, it's really stuck with me for years. I've gone back and read it

167
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,440
 multiple times. It's just very well written, very creepy story. SCP-1733, if you're looking

168
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,040
 for something cool, I mean literally like a 10-minute read, check it out. And if you've read it before,

169
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,960
 read it again. It is as good as the first time you've read it. Dead Rabbit recommends SCP-1733.

170
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:31,920
 Dot-NOT is bringing the carbonic copter to low over Simferopol. That's in Crimea,

171
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,160
 in the Ukraine. It's April 1982.

172
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:45,920
 And there's a man living at home. His name is Yuri Belostovich Zebroy. He's an electrician by

173
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:54,720
 trade. He lives with his wife. Everything's going okay. Until April 14th, 1982, when his wife develops

174
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:03,440
 these horrible headaches, she can't sleep. She's staying awake all night. Same thing on April 15th.

175
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:11,520
 Can't sleep, just these awful migraines. April 16th now. Three days have passed. She's miserable.

176
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:19,280
 He's miserable. They're both worried. April 17th, 8 p.m. Go!

177
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,320
 All the light bulbs in their house just dim at once. The fuse is blowout.

178
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:34,320
 Yuri, luckily he's an electrician, just goes and replaces the fuse. Is he like, Jason, you don't

179
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,560
 have to be an electrician to replace a fuse. Well, I've never done it. But those fuses blow out as

180
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,400
 well. And he's like, okay, you know what, we'll deal with this tomorrow. It's 8 p.m. Neither of us

181
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
 have had a good night's sleep. I've been worried about you. You're up all night. Let's just go to

182
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,640
 bed. We'll figure it out. So he shuts off all the electricity in the house and they go to sleep.

183
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:06,000
 At one point, Yuri wakes up and he's laying there in bed. He sees Plaster falling off his

184
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,880
 bedroom wall. And a strange spot appears. Gets up and he begins walking over to this spot.

185
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,240
 And as he's reaching towards it, he becomes completely paralyzed. He's frozen there. But

186
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:38,400
 he's reaching his arm out. He's forcing this through. And he touches the spot.

187
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,000
 Immediately there's a bright flash that actually illuminates his hand. It's like coming out of his

188
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:00,480
 hand. And then a flying saucer is flying around his bedroom. Now you go chasing how big is his

189
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,120
 bedroom? Is this Daddy Warbucks? The flying saucer is the size of a walnut. And it flies out of the

190
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:16,560
 strange shape in the wall. Just materializes through it and begins flying through his room.

191
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,120
 You're like, "Jason, are you telling us about a dream?" "Yesterday's episode was about a dream." No.

192
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,440
 This is a dream-like state. And I'll say this right now. Because if you're like, "Jason,

193
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,920
 I don't want to hear about this dream. I'm going to skip to the end real quick just so you know

194
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:37,040
 it's not a dream." Whatever else happens in this dream, it's not a dream. Whatever else happens this

195
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,400
 night, he sees the plaster fall off the wall. He sees that shape. When he wakes up the next morning,

196
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,640
 the plaster has still fallen off the wall and the shape is still there. So it did happen.

197
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,440
 Whatever is going to go on is fantastical as it gets. There is physical proof. I don't want to

198
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,440
 wait till the end to get to this. There is physical proof that at least some of these events happened

199
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:09,120
 the way he believes that they did. So as it's flying around the room, it starts to get larger

200
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,880
 as he's watching this fly around. And then there's a bunch of amoebas in his room.

201
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,080
 There's a bunch of amoebas. Like, "Jason, is this just a dude's dream?" He's in a dream like, "No,

202
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:32,160
 this isn't just a dream. Trust me. Trust in the amoebas." The amoebas, they're kind of like

203
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,200
 floating there. Now they're not the size of amoebas because he can't see them. You couldn't see.

204
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,280
 You're surrounded by amoebas right now. I don't want to scare you. There's a bloody amoeba with

205
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,360
 a head wound standing behind you in the mirror. There's amoebas everywhere. But these are like

206
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,440
 medium-sized amoebas. Jason, they're still super small. Imagine they're amoebas the size of say,

207
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,360
 I don't know, a dog, like a three-foot tall amoeba going, "Boooooo." They're standing on the ground

208
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,480
 and they're just kind of like moving around. And then they start to surround him. And he's paralyzed.

209
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,680
 And as they're moving towards him, this is dope. This made me immediately like this guy, Yuri. I'd

210
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,280
 love to buy this guy a beer. As these healing life forms are coming towards him, he kicks one.

211
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,040
 You already saw their technology. They already were able to paralyze him

212
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,080
 and shoot electricity through his hand when he sees this amoeba coming towards him. He kicks it

213
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:37,600
 across the room. And at that point, there's four, there's five people standing in the room.

214
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,560
 The amoebas are no longer there. Now it's just five people standing in his room. His wife's

215
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,800
 fast asleep, by the way. And you could say it's probably because this is the first good night

216
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,640
 sleep she's had in the past four days. It's also the aliens, most likely the aliens doing that's

217
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,280
 keeping her asleep. Or Jason Orr, he's just dreaming. He's just dreaming. You're telling

218
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,440
 us about another dream. Hold on. Save all your dream-related questions to the end.

219
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:11,840
 There's five people standing in the room. There's this short bald-headed dude. And Yuri can easily

220
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,600
 tell this guy's the leader, just from his presence. And then there's these four bang and super hot alien

221
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,560
 babes standing behind him. Now the bald-headed dude is wearing like a business suit. The four

222
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,680
 alien babes, it doesn't say what they're wearing, but I imagine something tasteful,

223
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:39,360
 yet a little slutty. Something that is built for interstellar travel and something pleasing

224
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,520
 on the male human eye. So imagine what you want. I just imagine them looking super hot.

225
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,320
 So there are these four bang and hot space babes behind this little dude, this little pimp,

226
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,800
 this little business suit. And they start the telepathic communication. And Yuri's like,

227
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,000
 "Let me guess." So first, I'm sorry for kicking the amoeba. Bald-headed guy goes, "That was my

228
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,560
 cousin." No, he goes, "Let me guess you guys are from space." And the alien goes, "Yeah, good. Yeah,

229
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:14,000
 we were from space. You got it." And then the alien guy goes, "Listen, we're here for a very specific

230
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,080
 purpose. See these beautiful space babes behind me? They are going to be the mothers of your children.

231
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:33,360
 We are here to create alien human hybrids." Now Yuri's, I'm going to assume a happily married man,

232
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,280
 right? Maybe things aren't perfect. Are you married? You know, I'm assuming things are good,

233
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,880
 because if I was married and my wife had migraines for three days, I'd bounce, right? I'd be like,

234
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,760
 I'm out of here. But no, he's stuck around. That's a good guy. Yuri is now though, his wife's

235
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:58,320
 sleep in bed, right behind him. And he's looking at these four bangin' space chicks. And he's thinking,

236
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,720
 "Which one am I gonna have sex with first?" He's totally down with this plan.

237
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,520
 Maritual bliss be damned. He's ready to make love on the interstellar highway.

238
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,960
 And the girls start taking our clothes off. And he's like, "Dude, this is so dope. We've got the red

239
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,960
 head. We've got the blonde. We've got the glip-pore. We've got the one with the tentacles coming out

240
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,040
 of her head. There's a hot amoeba in the corner. There's an amoeba wearing a bikini." He's like,

241
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,600
 "Save you for after a couple beers. After I brush my teeth and bang my head,

242
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,400
 then I'll have sex with you, amoeba lady." He's like trying to figure out which one of these chicks

243
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,600
 he's gonna bang first. And they're getting undressed. They're beautiful. They're absolutely

244
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,600
 beautiful. But he starts to realize that they're missing some... How should I put this for a family

245
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:59,120
 related podcast? They're missing some parts. I think the scientific term is genitalia that would

246
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,160
 allow him to have sex with them. And that is when the bald-headed man in the business suit

247
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,800
 pulls out a hypodermic needle and tells Yuri to take off his clothes.

248
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,880
 At this point, I'd be like, "Listen, man, I really thought about it. I really love my wife.

249
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
 You know, I've been here for the past couple days. She's had these migraines. It's kind of

250
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,880
 driving me nuts. I've decided not to have sex with... I mean, I can obviously tell these women

251
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
 are in... That amoeba's looking a lot more attractive over there. Its body's a little more

252
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,720
 malleable, but I can't have sex with any of these women." He goes, "Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

253
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,400
 When we procreate, we're not gonna have sex, but I need you to take your pants off, sir."

254
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,440
 Now, for some reason Yuri does. And maybe the fact that they have alien powers, maybe the fact that

255
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,920
 it has been a while since he's had sex, you know, in "Important Storm."

256
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:59,600
 They... The bald-headed man sticks... It doesn't say where.

257
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:08,880
 Doesn't say where. So use your imagination. I like to imagine the testicles, but you might imagine

258
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,840
 the urethra. You're like, "Damn it, Jason. You just did an episode like two weeks ago that's your

259
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:22,160
 most infamous episode ever." He takes the needle and he sticks it into Yuri's genitals, is what it says,

260
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:29,600
 and begins to remove semen. So I'd say the testicles problem... I mean, listen, it's super...

261
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:37,680
 It's super painful, either way, but you could either stick it anywhere, but whatever. Use...

262
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,120
 Use or don't use your imagination. The point is, is that he thought he was gonna be banging these

263
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:51,840
 hot chicks. He gets this needle stuck in them and he siphons out a bunch of semen, and then he notices

264
00:26:51,840 --> 00:27:00,320
 that the women, instead of having normal female genitalia, it's only... There's a... There's...

265
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,960
 Let's talk about a disappointment, right? There's only a hole big enough for a hyponormic needle,

266
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,440
 and the bald-headed dude sticks it in there and injects them full of semen. One at a time, by the way.

267
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,960
 Then the bald-headed guy has to come back and get more out of poor Yuri's. He's getting pricked

268
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:30,000
 with these needle multiple times. The women have a gauge on their neck, and every time they are

269
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,600
 injected full of semen, it goes up a little bit. And then when they're finally full of human semen,

270
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:46,640
 it lights up. This goes on for quite a while, but as this is going on, super fascinating. I mean,

271
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,800
 the whole story is so bizarre, and you would chalk it up to a dream, except for what's coming up.

272
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:58,960
 No pun intended. Yuri asks, "Is this a dream?" And the bald-headed man... Because he wanted to be a

273
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,080
 dream, right? You're getting stuck in the testicles at best with a needle for the tenth time this

274
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,280
 night, and the bald-headed man goes, "You will think it was a dream. You will remember this as a dream."

275
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:21,040
 And as he's... Yuri's watching this happen, but he is feeling, he feels so fascinating. This is what

276
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:27,840
 I love about researching this stuff. He's watching this happen. He's seen this event go on, but in his

277
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:39,520
 mind, in his soul, he's having sex with these women. Isn't that something that you really only

278
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,680
 see in UFO stories? Because they're so reality-altering. Like, two things can be happened in a once. The

279
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,320
 physical reality is they don't have female genitalia. He's being injected with a cybernormic needle,

280
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,040
 but at the same time, he is sensing it as making a passionate love to four different alien women.

281
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,600
 But that's not what's happening. They're able to craft a new narrative, a more pleasing narrative.

282
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,520
 Fascinating stuff. Alien stories psychologically are so, so fascinating. They're able to erase your

283
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,600
 memory, give you lost time, and then you'll remember, you'll be hypnotized, and you'll see the true horror

284
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,360
 of what went on on that ship, when really, they're doing you a favor by wiping your memory.

285
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,640
 The aliens don't want you to remember, not because of any sort of global conspiracy.

286
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,000
 They know how horrifying it is. So they're doing you, they think they're doing you a favor. You

287
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,840
 continue to investigate the mystery, and then you find out how horrifying it was. And then

288
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:48,160
 you become even more paranoid and more OCD. This one's the same thing. They're giving him memories

289
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,360
 of making love to these women, when really, he's being pressed, he's having a needle pressed into

290
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,200
 his junk over and over and over again. He said, then after the procedure and all of their little

291
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,520
 necks were filled up, the little gauges, he said they all start to become translucent, diffusive.

292
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:15,120
 They started to look like almost like TV lines, like there were some sort of projection that was

293
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:24,000
 being interfered with, and then they disappeared. He wakes up the next morning, and this is where

294
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,240
 you wrap it around to it, not being a dream. He wakes up the next morning, he feels very weird,

295
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,680
 which is what I would imagine if you've had hibernermic needle in your balls over and over

296
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,520
 and over again, again at best. He wakes up, he feels weird, and the first thing he does

297
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,320
 is he walks over to the spot on the wall that he saw at the beginning of this dream-like state.

298
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,880
 Remember the plaster fell off the wall, a spot appeared, and that's where the walnut-shaped UFO

299
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,760
 materialized from. He is wide awake now, he gets up out of bed, the spot is there.

300
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,840
 So there is physical proof

301
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:17,360
 that this happened. I got that from one of my favorite websites of all time now. Think about it

302
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,400
 Docs.com. Not because of that story, I was like, dude, needles and balls, this is the best website

303
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,280
 ever. Move out of the way, other bookmarks. Think about it, Docs.com, I love it, it's one of my

304
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:34,560
 favorite websites. And they got it from the Simphropole UFO Research Group that was by two researchers,

305
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:42,960
 Vladimir Borominsky and Vladimir Belozerov. You know, it's funny because the first three

306
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,040
 episodes we've done this week, and I didn't really even plan it out this way. I have a kind of a

307
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,480
 unique way of how I plan the show, unique in, just kind of throw stories together. Hope they

308
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,440
 sound good on one episode. I don't really connect them throughout the week, but all the first three

309
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,400
 episodes of this week have all been about reality and how we see it. And I didn't really

310
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,800
 plan it out that way, but I think it's interesting to look on that. The first one was can we trust

311
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,960
 our memories? The second one was can we trust reality to be consistent in the future if other

312
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,240
 people are changing things? What reality is? Would we even know it? This one is an interesting

313
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,520
 culmination of that because we have someone's mind being altered in front of us.

314
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,440
 Where new memories are being created, reality is being shifted, and the witness is realizing

315
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,840
 what is going on. I think it's an interesting culmination to that whole thing, that little

316
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,440
 trilogy I guess you can say. I think it's a pretty cool way to wrap that up, but

317
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,720
 he remembered this, and he remembered both versions of it,

318
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,640
 which makes me think about all the times that I don't remember my dreams.

319
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,600
 Because I very rarely do. What happens at night to us?

320
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,240
 Now this had a bit of a prelude, right? The wife was having the migraines that could have

321
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,360
 had something to do with this. The bulbs burning out. You had to use events leading up to it

322
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,640
 that prepared them for something odd to happen. So it was almost like his brain was already in

323
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,840
 a heightened state of anxiety. So when this event came, and I think kind of the idea is that

324
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,600
 the aliens were causing these other events. It didn't seem like it was out of just random

325
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,080
 coincidence that all these things happened, but he was already in a heightened sense,

326
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,920
 a heightened reality. He was worried about his electricity, he was worried about his wife,

327
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:53,040
 and then this happens and he remembers it. And just for an example, the previous story

328
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:59,600
 we told this episode, we had those events leading up to the ghosts in the mirror. If it

329
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,720
 just started off with the ghosts in the mirror, it would be a different story.

330
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,760
 It wouldn't be these weeks and months where people are getting more and more paranoid about this

331
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,880
 bathroom. It's building up the tension. But real life, or I shouldn't say real life,

332
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,040
 because these stories are, I think this second story has a lot of truth to it. Again,

333
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,760
 he could totally be making it up, but the ghost story probably has elements of truth as well.

334
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,840
 So I don't mean real life. I mean, normal life, we don't have that.

335
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:40,560
 So how often do we have dreams that we forget about that are like this, that are us being abducted,

336
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:49,200
 us being experimented on, and us never knowing? I'm not someone who I believe in aliens,

337
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,960
 but I have mixed feelings about aliens on earth. It's so funny because I do believe stories like

338
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,160
 this, but I start to think, you know, where did they come from? Are they multi-dimensional?

339
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,680
 Blah blah blah blah. I don't argue that these stories aren't real. I just don't know if they're

340
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,880
 coming from Alpha Centauri or if they're coming from wherever space. I don't know if they're more

341
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,320
 interdimensional. So that's my quibble, not that aliens don't exist, but I'm not somebody who's

342
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:21,680
 primed mentally that when I wake up and I have a weird mark on my arm, because I do a lot,

343
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,520
 I wake up and I'll have weird markings on my arm, I always go, I must have scratched myself in my sleep,

344
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,720
 I must have laid on it wrong and got some sort of crinkle on it. You know what I mean? Like,

345
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,360
 I'm not primed to be paranoid about gangstalking. My situational awareness is strictly limited to

346
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,280
 people around me. Are they a threat? I don't look at the color of cars or people who scratch their

347
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,840
 belly every time they walk past me or anything like that. I'm not primed for gangstalking. I'm not

348
00:35:51,840 --> 00:36:02,480
 like that. That's a perfect example. I'm going to leave that in whenever the streets are always

349
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,280
 quiet, but when I start recording podcasts, loud vehicles come driving on the road. And if I was

350
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,200
 primed for gangstalk, I've noticed that, but I just think it's people being jerks or it's just a

351
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,440
 weird coincidence or they do drive around loud during the day, but I don't notice them because I'm

352
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:25,760
 not sitting impatiently as they pass to continue my sentence. It doesn't affect me. But a gangstalker

353
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,160
 would think that was targeted harassment. And I think most people aren't primed for gangstalking

354
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,440
 or for UFO activity. I think that this could be happening very, very often. And unless we're in

355
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,920
 a heightened state of awareness, you won't remember the dream. Or if you do remember the dream, you

356
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,040
 just think it's a dream. You see what I'm saying? I feel like I might be rambling. I'm going to wrap

357
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,800
 it up soon because I feel like I'm kind of rambling, but I think you guys get what I'm saying. The

358
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,920
 reason why Yuri remembered this and shared this with the UFO researchers was because of all the

359
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,040
 events preceding it. He was already hyper aware. He's already stressed out. So when it happened,

360
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,680
 he took note of his environment. He started to go, "This happened and this happened and this

361
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,800
 happened," which because he felt in his bones it was leading. All those preceding events was

362
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,200
 leading towards something. If you just went about your day and everything was fine and perfect,

363
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,720
 and maybe not perfect, maybe it was the normal, miserable day that you have because you hate

364
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,920
 your job or you get stuck in traffic, stuff like that, but it's what you're used to.

365
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,080
 When you go to sleep, you're not primed to think something is coming to a head.

366
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:44,080
 So it's on the normal days that the aliens can show up. It's on the days where you fall asleep.

367
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:51,440
 You wake up. You're walking around your house and you go, "What? That's weird. I don't remember

368
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,240
 that little mark on my wall. Damn, this place is such a waste. It's a money pit." You just kind

369
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,520
 of keep going about your day. Even though you had all those events happen to you and you were present

370
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,520
 while they're happening to you, you forgot about them when you woke up. Or maybe you just remember

371
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,080
 bits and pieces of some weird dream you had that night. You just go about your day,

372
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,840
 not knowing you have a bunch of space babies out there now.

373
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:30,800
 It's possible that the paranormal happens to us so often that it's normal.

374
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,640
 We just don't remember it. It happens to us at times where we're unconscious,

375
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:49,120
 so we're not aware that it's happening. It could happen with such frequency to everybody

376
00:38:49,120 --> 00:39:00,640
 that it is the definition of mundane, but it happens at the right time, in the right place.

377
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:15,200
 But we don't even notice it. The world of the paranormal may not be a separate world at all.

378
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,240
 Sure, it's shocking when we see the bloody man standing in the mirror,

379
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,760
 where the four alien babes taken off their clothes.

380
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,440
 But how many times have you walked away from your bathroom mirror,

381
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,880
 shut the bathroom light off and crawled back into bed, and in the darkness of the bathroom,

382
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:44,080
 the bloody figure stands there, unseen but still staring into the mirror.

383
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,600
 We like to think we live in a normal world with occasional slips of reality.

384
00:39:51,600 --> 00:40:00,000
 But if there's anything this weak has taught us, reality is never really.

385
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,760
 That real.
