1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 two mysterious deaths in Antarctica,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 and then we take a look at one of the more intriguing conspiracies on the conspiracy iceberg list,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 the Paleolithic Deep State.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Do cavemen secretly run the world today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm battling a bit of a head cold.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 It's gotten into my throat just a little bit.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 So if I sound a little hoarse or if there's some weird edits, just because I'm sneezing,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 and if there's any really weird edits, it's because I sneezed on my touchscreen laptop

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 and it started clicking a bunch of buttons.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You know, there are certain ailments, certain experiences,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 that only people who were born, say, before the year 2000 will really ever know.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's this interesting thing.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So if a kid stays home from school today, they're just going to plop down in front of the television set

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and put on Netflix and watch Stranger Things or Paw Patrol or whatever, depending on their age range.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 So if a kid today stays home from school or gets stuck in his grandma's house or whatever,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 they can just pull up Netflix and watch whatever they want on their tablet, television, whatever.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 But if you were born before the year of, let's say, 2005, arbitrary number, but you'll get it,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 you didn't have those options.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You might have had some video cassettes that you could throw in every once in a while,

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 but the chances are, and the farther you go back, the higher the chances of this.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It definitely was most of my childhood.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 You were stuck watching whatever was on, and in the middle of the day, it was nothing.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Like during the weekdays, I watched reruns of Green Acres and reruns of Mr. Ed

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 and reruns of Gilligan's Island and the Brady Mudge.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You had to watch those shows.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You watched Sanford and Son.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You watched these shows because there was nothing else on.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And I think this might be the old man saying we had it better,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 but as much as that sucked back then, I would rather have cartoons on demand.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It definitely did open me up to new shows, like sitcoms and things like that.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 If I was just watching Cartoon, if I could choose my cartoons all day long,

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I would have watched Transformers G.I. Joe 8 hours a day,

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 but the fact that I did sit and watched like one day at a time and what was the show with all the chubby chicks?

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Not growing pains. Facts of life.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 You know, you saw all that stuff, and it kind of like broadened your pop culture window.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Like I can, I will make a Sanford and Son reference.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I make them quite often actually in real life.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I don't think I've ever made one on the show, but I might have,

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 because I watch this show all the time and I watch it with my great grandma.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I love my great grandma.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But there's a particular interesting quirk with that.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Where I would sit at home, I would not go to ski.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 It sounds like I played hooky a lot, but I didn't.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I just remember watching a lot of television when I was a kid.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And sometimes you would watch a particular show.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Let's for example say, it's Gilligan's Island. Everyone knows Gilligan's Island.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And you watch it and you're like, oh, that was a pretty funny episode.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And then it never lines up again where you're at home that early during the day to see Gilligan's Island again.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 But maybe three months pass.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 This happens all the time.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And once I see what it is, you're going to be like, oh, that used to happen to me all the time too.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Three months pass, you're never home, say, at 11 in the morning on a Wednesday.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And three months pass, you're at home. It's 11 in the morning on a Wednesday.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 You put on Gilligan's Island. It is the same episode you saw three months ago.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 That was always such a, it took me a while to catch on, but a lot of times when I was a kid,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 if I watched, if I watched a show that I didn't really watch that much,

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 and then a period of time passed and I watched it again, it would be the same episode.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So weird. I also believe that there is a curse involving television.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I'll get off my television right in a second.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 These are kind of paranormal, kind of paranormal/conspiracy.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I believe there is a television curse. I call it the "Buffy Musical Curse."

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And the curse isn't that musical television shows exist.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 The curse is this. It's named after the "Buffy Musical" for a particular reason.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Whenever you, this, with almost without fail, this should actually be considered a scientific law.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Whenever you are talking to a friend and you say,

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 "You should really watch this show. It's a great show."

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 The next episode that will air after that show will be one of the worst episodes of the series.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 It's almost an automatic rule.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I'll be with someone and I'll be like, "Hey man, do you watch Deep Space Nine?"

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And they're like, "No, I've never seen it."

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And you're like totally selling the show. You're like, "Oh dude, it's so great.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It's like this serial and not like serial you eat, but it's like a serial show."

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And each episode leads to the next.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And they're like, "Yes, Jason, I know what a serial is. I'm like, don't interrupt me."

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And you have like the Define, it's the Shifland round, Warfus and then the episode they watch is the episode where like,

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Dax catches like wheat germ allergy.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And it happens all the time.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It's happened to me again so many times, but the "Buffy Musical" I remember exactly because I recommended that.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I was like, "Dude, you gotta watch "Buffy." It's such a great show.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Like, there's a little bit of comedy. It's not that funny, but there's a little bit of comedy, but it's action.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 They have suspense and it has these horror elements.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 People are like, "Yeah, oh yeah, I'll check it out." And then the very next episode was the musical episode,

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 which to a fan of "Buffy" was like, "Oh, this is kind of a cool, but it was super cringy."

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Definitely looking back on it. And I had a friend go, "That show was terrible."

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Because that was the next, and I was like, "Listen, dude, give it another episode."

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I guess it also works with music too, because a lot of times people will say,

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 "Dude, why don't you listen to Primus?" And I'm like, "I did. I didn't like that song."

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And they're like, "No, you gotta listen to like the first three albums."

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And then skip two and then listen. I was like, "Dude, I don't have the time. I don't have the time.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I get that all the time. Hey, dude, what do you think of 50 Cent?"

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 "Well, yeah, it's okay. No, you gotta listen." I was like, "Don't have time to listen to their discography."

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So maybe it applies to music too, I don't know. I've actually, they have no opinion on either 50 Cent or Primus.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I hope I'm not gonna get barraged by fans of theirs, but you know, there's just some bands that you've tried listening to

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 and they just don't connect with you. Let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Now, that might have seemed like it took a little bit, but I'm just trying to get into the groove.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 The first episode of the week is always rough, so I hope you forgive me for that.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And I actually would like to know if you have similar experiences with "Recommendosia."

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That's what we're gonna call it, "Recommendosia." It is the idea that when you recommend something,

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 it will be the worst possible iteration of that thing that that person happens to stumble across.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And I'll have to come up with a term for the "Deja-View." Like, "Deja" and then "View."

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Like your views and the television show, "Jason, dude, you're a genius, bro. You are warmed up."

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 What are you talking about? Not getting warmed up. Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our first story here.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Now, this first story just happened this month. And I'll say that with a caveat, because it could have happened a little bit earlier

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 and we're just finding about it now, and it's a relatively short story,

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 but I think there's some interest and implications to it. So, we'll just say it was in December,

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 because, again, we're not entirely for sure. There was a--we're in Antarctica. It's super, super cold.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I know I said that's a no-snow zone on this show, because I hate snow so much,

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 but we're actually gonna be going to Antarctica a couple times this week, unfortunately,

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 but so this helicopter is flying over this research station in Antarctica, one of the bigger ones, I believe.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It's American, and you see smoke coming out of a building. She's like, "That's not cool."

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And he's like, "No pun intended. Walk, walk, walk, walk on the move anyway."

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 It's gonna be so hard to edit out these coughs.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So, the helicopter--these people die. I don't know why I'm making fun of it, but this helicopter lands and it goes in

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 and they find the bodies--not bodies yet. They find two unconscious workers and they're like, "Ah."

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And so, they started doing CPR. I believe one died at the scene and one died in route for medical care.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And they haven't revealed who they are or how they died.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And they're like, "I just read in a report today," and they're like, "No foul play. We're still investigating how these people died."

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And the article started coming out a couple days ago, and it was on a Drudge Report,

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 because it's kind of an odd thing, like, "Oh, they just found these two unconscious people in Antarctica. That's kind of spooky."

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 There's two things that are interesting about this. One, obviously, I think the first thing that popped into my mind,

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 the first thing that popped into a lot of people's minds was the thing, because it's that same location.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And I think it's interesting--it wasn't the thing, but what's interesting about this story is that if the thing--

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Okay, so, if you don't know, and it's an om--I just saw the thing for the first time last year.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 The thing is the story of, I think, about nine researchers in Antarctica, and they uncover something.

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I won't give it away. And then this creature starts killing them one by one.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 If that had happened in real life, it would have been reported the same way this article was reported.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And I think that's what's interesting, because in the movie, the thing, or any of these horror movies,

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 you have all this stuff blowing up, and you have, like, the creature running through the halls,

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 and they're, like, flamethrowers, and all this stuff, and people, like, begging for their lives and getting ripped open.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But when it was reported to us, it would say, "Fire at McMinley Research Station claimed the lives of nine people.

134
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Investigations are still underway." That would be it. There would be something in the newspaper about it,

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 because what happens is it would be--it's really hard to keep stuff like Super Secret, especially when it's partially civilian.

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 But it would be in the newspaper, and it would be a blurb.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 It would be, like, the halls creaked with the sounds of the dead as the thing took out nine researchers.

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Humanity beware. It would just say, there was an unexplained fire--they probably wouldn't even say unexplained.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They'd be like, "There was a fire at a research station. Government officials are still trying to check for survivors and casualties,

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and then you would never hear from it again." So that's why these stories, as small as they are,

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 it reminds you that if those big Camp Crystal Lake--it wouldn't be like, "Slash your smashes, young coeds brains in."

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Well, that might actually be, because that's in the United States, but it would still be something like a teenage group goes--

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 if they had an interest in covering up the truth, which they would if the thing was running around or Jason Voorhees was an immortal killer,

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 they would give you the least amount of information possible, and that'd be it.

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So it'd be like, "Well, I think you get the point. I'm not gonna keep making up things--"

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Kids in Elm Street! Don't wake up! I mean, like, you get it. You get it.

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 What if all these weird diseases that pop up every once in a while actually just covers for horror movie villains?

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 But I mean, what if Ebola was actually like this chaos demon that someone summoned, and every so often he goes on a rampage?

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Actually, there actually is a conspiracy theory about that.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 We'll look into that some other time. I shouldn't have just brought that up to throw it away like that, but--

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 But another interesting side note, something that's not being reported regarding this story is--I think there's spooks.

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I think that the two guys who died were never gonna know who they are, because like I was saying, when it's civilian-related,

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 it's hard to keep stuff under wraps, but I don't think we're gonna know who these two people are.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 As I was looking at the story, they said that they worked for a civilian contractor based out of Virginia,

155
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 which right away, I thought, yeah, they're working for the CIA.

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 They're either CIA or ex-CIA.

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 CIA is based in Virginia, and they work for a company called PAE, which is a--it's a subcontractor,

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 but when you look at their website, they do a lot of stuff like security.

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They build bomb-detecting kits and bomb-diffusal kits, and they're all over the globe working with U.S. partners and allied governments and stuff like that.

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And so, with a company, an international company like that, that did assist troops and stuff like mapping,

161
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 and they're basically an engineering group.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It would make sense that these guys would be at this place working on a fire suppression system.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 The most likely--I don't even know why they're pussy-footing around.

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 The most likely suggestion is they were working on the fire suppression system,

165
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and generally, you suppress fires by reducing the amount of oxygen in the area.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 They probably reduced the amount of oxygen in their area and fell unconscious.

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I don't know why the articles are being so vague about that.

168
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 They should just say they were working on the system, they messed up, and they died.

169
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 They were--they fell unconscious.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 No--no articles even really kind of putting that out there.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 That's my opinion. That's--but that's the most likely thing.

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 But--and I think the fact that they are--they're possible ex-CIA or current CIA operatives

173
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 doesn't really mean anything of the story.

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 It doesn't mean they were there to fight aliens or they were there to spy on someone.

175
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I think they worked for a company that hires ex-CIA people.

176
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Probably. I don't have any proof of that, but that's just a hunch I have.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 But I think that's the reason why we won't know who they are.

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Because then people can link it back to their families and stuff like that.

179
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 They go, "Oh, this person worked for this company and this person was over here," and da-da-da.

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So it's an interesting story. It's gonna be--it's layer upon layer upon layer,

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 and it's almost like just a two-paragraph article.

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 If it had happened in Milwaukee, it probably wouldn't even be on the news.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 But because it happened in such a spooky, desolate area, it adds that layer of mystery to it.

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Plus, you know, they were probably killed by the thing.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 But anyways. Okay, so the next story we're gonna talk about is a story that I said I was going to put out on Friday,

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 but I came across some new information.

187
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Now, when I say new information, I mean just another wacky--wacky theory,

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 but I wanted to watch some videos on it to see if there--I was like,

189
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 "Well, let's check if there's any merit to it."

190
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 This is the story of the Paleolithic Deep State.

191
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Now, we've talked before about the conspiracy theory iceberg, and it's a quick overview.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It's just a picture of an iceberg, and it lists conspiracy theories from the most well-known to the most obscure.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Doesn't mean the ones at the bottom are more true.

194
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It doesn't even mean the ones at the bottom are more interesting.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It just means they're lesser known.

196
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 A very common one people ask about is the plane of jars.

197
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 It's like halfway down the chart. It's boring.

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 I looked it up, I was like, "Pfft, that's it? That's lame."

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 So, I mean, just because it's low on the chart doesn't necessarily mean that it's spooky.

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Plane of jars is just a big field full of jars that some people built.

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 That's it. I was like, "That was a waste of my time researching that."

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 But deep down on the list is the Paleolithic Deep State, and then in parentheses, it says,

203
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 "The caveman theory."

204
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I'm not gonna bore you with a bunch of facts about Paleolithic people.

205
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It's not as much as I need to, but I'll need to give you some to set this up.

206
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And that's code word for saying I didn't write any of this stuff down when I was doing my research.

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 But I read a bunch of articles about Paleolithic people, and you science nerds can tell me how right or wrong I am.

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 The Paleolithic era was basically the time when humans were hunter-gatherers.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 We were banding up in large groups.

210
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So, as humanity was leaving Africa, they were starting to form bigger groups,

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 and you would have basically family groups.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 You'd have your family, and then that would be part of a band sort of thing.

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So you'd have maybe 20 families together, and then those 20 families may also be connected to an even bigger group,

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 which would be the equivalent of a city or a nation.

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 This is when people, they started doing cave paintings.

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 This is when they started communicating with each other.

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 This is when you started to see the beginning of a society.

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It was a hunter-gatherer society, so they would basically go into an area,

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 exploit it, and then move on.

220
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But as the Paleolithic era continued, they started thinking, "Let's not exploit this area. This is a good area.

221
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Let's only fish so much."

222
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 But anyway, so a little history lesson.

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I'm going to get off this real quick, because, but the Paleolithic era, you saw the start of religion.

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 You saw the start of communication.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 You saw the start of art.

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 There's still a lot of debate over whether the art is some sort of symbol, or if it was just people being bored and saying,

227
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 "I want to draw a picture of an ox."

228
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 That's the Paleolithic era.

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 It was about 50,000 years ago.

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Now, there was a couple obstacles to what was going on there, because you saw people coming out of Africa,

231
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 and they were like, "Okay, you know, this world's huge. Let's do all this stuff."

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 A bunch of stuff. There's chickens and berries everywhere over here.

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 They started to run into other groups, and that's where you had the Neanderthals come in.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 So the Neanderthals were basically stronger.

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 They've always been considered kind of stupider than humans, but they actually, like, we found burial sites for them as well.

236
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So we believe that the Neanderthals believed in life after death.

237
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 We believe that the Neanderthals had some sort of social system, but basically the Homo sapiens were able to outthink the Neanderthals.

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 But as Homo sapiens were leaving Africa, they started to populate parts of Asia and parts of other...

239
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Well, that's kind of all that was there right then, but when they went into Europe, they got held back.

240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Like, we can see Homo sapiens development up to a certain point in one area,

241
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 and then it takes a while before we can see evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe.

242
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And one of the theories, it's because the Neanderthals held them at bay for like 10,000 years.

243
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Like, they weren't able to press past the Neanderthals for whatever reason.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Either they were just stronger or they were way smarter than we thought they were.

245
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 One of the theories is they were just better suited for the cold weather.

246
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 So when the Homo sapiens got there, they're like, "What? Is this white stuff falling on me? This totally sucks!"

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And the Neanderthals are like, "Ho ho ho ho ho!"

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And then eventually, the Homo sapiens did go up there.

249
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So that was kind of the end of the Neanderthals, and the Homo sapiens conquered the planet.

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And then we moved from Paleolithic Era to, you know, Stone Age.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And I think Paleolithic Era and Stone Age are kind of together, but again, so it was,

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 we weren't just like drooling idiots as a species, but we weren't as awesome as we are today.

253
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 That's Paleolithic Era in a nutshell.

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 So here's the theories. Here's the theories that go along with that.

255
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Now, two of the theories are pretty racist, and I want to say that right off the bat,

256
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 because I've talked about it before on my show. I don't subscribe to any sort of, I think that the notion,

257
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 you know, you can agree with me or disagree with me. It doesn't matter to me.

258
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But I don't subscribe to ideas of racial superiority or racial inferiority.

259
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 But I just wanted to get into that because the next two theories we're going to talk about,

260
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I have a theory of what the phrase actually means.

261
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I have a theory of what it actually means, but we're going to go into the two other theories of what it means.

262
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And so the first theory is this. It's that Homo sapiens pressed into Europe, the Neanderthals stopped them.

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Eventually, though, the Homo sapiens started to make great inroads.

264
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 We're wiping out the Neanderthals. The Neanderthals said, "We have to go underground."

265
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Not literally, even though we live in caves. Don't do that, Krog. Come back here.

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 He's like walking back out of the cave. We have to go underground.

267
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 We're going to interbreed with these people. We're going to look like them.

268
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And we're secretly going to control them from behind the scenes.

269
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And here's the racist part. Those Neanderthals are modern-day Jewish people.

270
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Now, to state the obvious, I personally do not believe that Jewish people are Neanderthals.

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 However, some people do.

272
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 What I don't understand, one of the things I don't understand about racism is that Neanderthals, like the previous description,

273
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 they're way stronger than normal humans and super immense monkey strength is not something that is generally a stereotype of a Jewish person.

274
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 So the thing with race, they'll be like, a racist will be reading something like this and say, "Oh my God,

275
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 "an other species fought for dominance and possibly went underground just like the Jews control us from behind the scenes."

276
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And they forget every other possible fact that could dispute that.

277
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So they forget every other fact. But anyway, so that's one of the conspiracy theories that I stumbled across.

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And I was like, "Okay, that's just not true. It doesn't make any sense."

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But again, as a stereotype, even Jewish people in Northern Europe are not known for being massively strong.

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 So that was a racist theory. And you go, "Well, Jason, you said there's two of them."

281
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Well, yep, here's the second one. So this was the series of videos I found the other day.

282
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 This one has a little bit more credibility than the last one, which is to say almost still no credibility.

283
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 The only reason why I think it has a tiny shred of credibility is because you can't find any information on it.

284
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And there's a YouTube series that only every other episode is up.

285
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 It's constantly being deleted and the channels that it's on has like 19 views, no subscribers.

286
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 It's really bizarre. But it is a stupid theory, so it kind of makes sense.

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Humanity did start in Africa. Neanderthals were up north.

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 As the humans started to leave Africa, they ran into the Neanderthals and were assaulted and forced to interbreed and faced huge troubles.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And the humans said, "You know what? We're just going to kind of stick around here, here, where we're at."

290
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And the Neanderthals were like, "Ho, ho, ho, ho, we won."

291
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And then over the next 10,000 years, the Neanderthals became white people.

292
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And so this is a racist conspiracy theory as well.

293
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 There is within a subset of the African-American community, you will hear the term "caveman" uses a derogatory term for a white person,

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 that white people generally, a lot of people on the planet have at least 4% Neanderthal DNA in them, between 1 and 4%.

295
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 However, we don't see those numbers very much in Africa or in native populations in South America and North America and things like that.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 The Neanderthal blood is predominantly in Europe and parts of Asia, which would make sense because you had this huge empire of Neanderthals interbreeding over thousands of years.

297
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So the people who have no Neanderthal blood in them are the only pure bred humans.

298
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 They are 100% homo sapien.

299
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Everyone else is partially a beast, is subhuman. Only the native people and the Africans are true humans.

300
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And the problem is that white people run the world and they're subjugating the true humans to put them down because they're human,

301
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 because they're not these monstrous creatures, and that is the caveman theory.

302
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I'll have a couple links in my show notes of a couple of these videos because they're very hard to find.

303
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 It's just nonsense. It's a lot of Illuminati, Rantines, and a lot of racism against white people, a little bit towards Asians.

304
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 But yeah, I mean, again, it's one of those things that I think that that theory is probably the reason why it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg,

305
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 because it's super, super obscure.

306
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 The theory about the Neanderthals having Jewish lineage, I've been hearing that for a long time.

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Because, listen, racists are going to use any tool in their handbook to disparage the people they don't like,

308
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 whether it's white people are Neanderthals or Jewish people are Neanderthals, whatever.

309
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 They'll grab on any piece of information they can to throw it in someone's face.

310
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 But I think the reason why it's on the iceberg is because of the theory that only Africans and natives are true humans,

311
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 because it's such a deep cut conspiracy. I've never heard that before.

312
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And all you can really do is track down a couple of these videos, and it kind of states that case.

313
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 So it is a low-level conspiracy theory. However, I have a theory of what it actually is.

314
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So I've been doing all this research, and this is going to get weird, but it explains a lot.

315
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And again, I'll say this, I have no proof to back this up. Nothing. Just a hunch.

316
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 So when I was doing all this research on the Paleolithic era, and I always thought Paleolithic era was even farther back cavemen stuff,

317
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and this was, like I said, this is where societies were being created.

318
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 That you started having, like I said, you started having these family units band up with these other family units,

319
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 and then you started having bigger tribes comparable to a less civilized version of like a Native American tribe.

320
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 They weren't so much into rituals and stuff like that, but they did have their rituals, they did have their societies.

321
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 They had rules, it was around 40,000, 50,000 years ago where we believe people started to develop the idea of moral outrage,

322
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 of not just getting mad because, you know, my food's gone, but getting mad because someone did something that they thought was wrong,

323
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 praying to the wrong God or whatever. This is my theory, and it actually would explain a lot.

324
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 My theory is this. As humanity was starting to band up into these groups,

325
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 you would start to have people in these groups survey the land and survey the people and say,

326
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 "This can get better or this can get worse?" And they're thinking on a high level.

327
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 They're like, "This way of life can be maintained, we can make it better," or "It could get worse," through other things.

328
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You had communication between these tribes, and especially as they poured out into the rest of the world,

329
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 and you would have a one leader to another leader say, "This can get better or this can get worse?"

330
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Like, we can go to war over these resources, we can work together, but we lose our identity as tribes and our different practices and things like that.

331
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 This can get better or this can get worse. And as these groups of Homo sapiens continued moving out through the world,

332
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 and they do encounter Neanderthals, and they do encounter these new elements that they've never ever really conceived of.

333
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I mean, who would have thought that you'd run into another human, another species?

334
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 These select leaders say, "If we want, if we don't want to do anything, this will get worse."

335
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 There's a whole world out here, there's all these gods, there's all this crazy stuff going on, and we can do nothing and just see what happens,

336
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 or we can direct the development of our species.

337
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Now you say, "Well Jason, that's kind of a high thought level for a bunch of cavemen."

338
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But they were basically human, they had self-awareness.

339
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 They were making art for creative reasons, they were falling in love and getting mad and stuff like that.

340
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 They were humans at this point. And so you have these select leaders of these tribes get together and say,

341
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 "These are the stories that we are going to tell, these are the legends we are going to promote,

342
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 these are the moral systems we are going to instill in our people, we are going to make this world a better place."

343
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 The first Illuminati, the caveman Illuminati, the idea of a group of people, the deep state.

344
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 You have everything running on top and you'd have your, not elected, but you'd have your shaman and stuff like that in your individual tribes,

345
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 and underneath it all you'd have a secret ruling class who would say, "Incest is wrong."

346
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Who would say, "Don't defy the gods." Because the gods would be the official messengers of their edicts.

347
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 You would have them say, "These are the rules."

348
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And I think that might actually explain why certain myths carry across cultures.

349
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 We see stories like creation stories being very similar across cultures.

350
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 We see dragons across cultures of the great flood. That myth has come across different cultures and people go,

351
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 "Well, maybe there was dragons, maybe there was a flood."

352
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 But stuff like the creation myth, we know the world wasn't cracked like an egg or eight dragons came out or stuff like that,

353
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 but when we look at creation myths across the world, there's a lot of similarities between them.

354
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And it would make sense that if a group of people said, "Whether or not you're with this band here and what will someday become Britain,

355
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 or you're with that group there that will someday become Syria, we will communicate with each other.

356
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 We will set up how we want our society, how our race to grow."

357
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I think that's possible. I have no proof of it, but when it popped in my head I thought,

358
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 "That is just a thing's kind of fall into place that way."

359
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 That's the Paleolithic deep state. It was a group of people making decisions for everybody else because they said,

360
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 "This is what we need to do to keep our society going so we don't get mashed out by the Neanderthals,

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 or some horrible curse doesn't befall our people, which would be a plague or something like that.

362
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Let's set up these rules and let's deliver these messages and these moral stories across the board."

363
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 I think it's weird that there are even stuff like, I understand incest because your babies could get all weird,

364
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 but there are certain honor your elders. I mean, find a culture that hates their elderly people.

365
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 So you could say those are just basic human values, but what if those human values were just so ingrained on

366
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 when we were first starting off as a species that yes, they are human values now?

367
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Because if you didn't follow those values, you got shunned from the tribe.

368
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 You weren't able to pass along your elderly, hating genes.

369
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And I get like not murdering people is the same pretty much across all cultures.

370
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 There are some cultures that don't really care about it, but like gangs, but stuff like respecting your elders

371
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 is not something that has no benefit whatsoever really in the development of a species.

372
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 You could go, "Well, the elderly people can teach us stuff." Well, yeah, so can a book, but I'll still throw a book in the garbage.

373
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Respect to your elders is almost a universal thing. It's weird.

374
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Even stuff like cannibalism, which is very, very frowned upon in most cultures.

375
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 So was there a group, a select group of Paleolithic hunter and gatherer tribal leaders

376
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 who communicated and created the rules and the laws and the mores for humanity way back then?

377
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Did they tell those stories that we see mirrored over and over and over again in different cultures

378
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 that for the longest time we go, "We don't know why people in South America have the same legend of people in Wales?"

379
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Like it doesn't make sense. But maybe it's because of this Paleolithic deep state.

380
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 They saw the world and said, "We can get better or we can get worse," and they did their damnedest to make sure that humanity survived

381
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 and that it got better. And if that theory is true, and again, last time I'm going to say it, I have no proof of it, just a hunch.

382
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Did they ever go away? Are the stories of the Illuminati, you know, "Oh, it's 1775," and Adam Weistop did it?

383
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 That's just all like total retcon. That since the first hut was built, since the first spear was thrown,

384
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 there was a group of people silently directing the development of human life. Who knows?

385
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 I know that if I had that power, I wouldn't necessarily give it up.

386
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Whether or not it was passed on to their next of kin or passed on to the wisest of the tribal leaders,

387
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 we could never tell because it's probably just a fantasy of mine.

388
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 But I think it fills in a lot of the blanks that I've had as far as culture, world culture goes.

389
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 But again, that being said, I'm sure anyone who actually knows anthropology could sit me down and say,

390
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 "This was wrong, this was wrong, this was wrong, this was wrong," and I'm fully open to being educated on the subject.

391
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 But I just wanted to present to you the theory of Paleolithic deep state, and instead of just showing you two horrible looks at how racist people can be,

392
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 I wanted to present a theory that I have an idea about that's more about hope and the fascinating aspects of history and human development.

393
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 So let's get past all that racist nonsense. I know it's a little, I know it's easier said than done,

394
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 but we have to look at the world and say, "Do we want it to be better or do we want it to be worse?"

395
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 You know, "Worse smarter than cavemen."

396
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Hey everyone, Jason from The Future here. I was just editing the episode, and I realized that I left something important out of this story.

397
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 This was a topic that a lot of people have been asking for. However, on YouTube, I had one specific user recommend it.

398
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I wanted to make sure I give them a shout out.

399
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Holly Coerris. I hope I'm pronouncing your tag right or your name, your avatar, however it is.

400
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Holly Coerris hit me up on YouTube a while back and specifically asked for me to cover that story, and I just wanted to make sure that they got the credit for it,

401
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 because I love you guys recommending stuff. It really gives me a good angle to go on.

402
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 So thank you for the recommendation. Now we're going back to the episode.
