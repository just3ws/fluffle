1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 When the world needed a hero, fate sent two heroes.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,600
 Are the stories of a bizarrely dressed man walking around the streets of Chile looking like a supervillain?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,600
 True, that might actually be true, but in this particular story, does he also play a flute?

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,600
 And then we travel to Pennsylvania to meet a family that lives on the outskirts of town way up on a mountaintop.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,200
 They're just having a normal American life until the aliens invaded.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 [Demonic music]

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Hope you guys had a lot of fun in between listening to the last episode and listening to this episode.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I happen to be binging them. I hope you had a really fun minute as you waited for the new episode to start.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Speaking of fun minutes, he's really good at telling time apparently according to the segue.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Reese's Pieces.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Everyone give him a round of applause. He's back. He used to support the Patreon a long time ago and he's back just as delicious as ever.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Now also holding a bunch of clocks because that's his thing now to make the original joke make sense.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 He walks in, he's juggling clocks, he's riding a tricycle, all the wheels are clocks.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Reese's Pieces and he's made of candy.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Reese's Pieces, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon or you guys aren't as delicious. It's fine too.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Just helps rid the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Reese's Pieces, let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to Jakarta, Indonesia.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 [Demonic music]

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 This story is fascinating to me that we're about to cover because it's one of those things recently I did a story and I go,

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 "Hey, it was about the Army Hammer thing. If you didn't know, Army Hammer, famous celebrity.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 He's also a cannibal? Allegedly? He denies it, but his DMs seem to make it look like he's a cannibal."

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And apparently his ex-husband come forward and said, "Don't look in the basement."

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Because apparently, allegedly, he would buy mannequins. This toy is just so weird.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 He'd buy mannequins so he could practice tying them up. Allegedly, still. That's weird.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But anyways, so, and my thing about that story was, why is no one in the conspiracy community talking about a Hollywood dude who wants to eat people?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And I could have figured out. I said maybe it was the election.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 We have this other story that should be huge news in the COVID conspiracy group.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 This should actually be, they should make flags of these people. They should hire a Renaissance painter go back in time,

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 kidnapped Leonardo. They should hire a guy to draw a mural dedicated to these two people.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 This event that I'm about to tell you shatters the mainstream media's view on the coronavirus that also gets this channel demonetized

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 and this video removed, but I totally believe in the coronavirus. I believe it's real, COVID-19. I'll get my vaccine.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But I know there's a lot of people out there who don't feel that way. A lot of people out there think it's overblown, it's a hoax,

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 and I don't understand why this story is on all of their websites. All of them.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Let me read you this headline from The Sun. You know you're gonna get a good headline when I'm reading it from The Sun.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Rona Romp.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Nurse suspended. Army Hammer's Life from Rope? Isn't the nurse suspended from Rope? No, no, no, no. Suspended from the job.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Nurse suspended after stripping off PPE, which is the personal protective gear.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I have to stop and keep cracking jokes and defining words. Nurse suspended after stripping off PPE to have sex with COVID infected patient in hospital toilet.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So what happened was there's a nurse walks in to take care of this patient in Jakarta, Indonesia. This was at the Wisma Atlet Emergency Hospital.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I'm sure they love this story getting out there. They have a COVID ward and then they have the rest of the hospital.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And you have this nurse, we don't know his name, we'll call him Jerry. He's walking through the ward.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 He's wearing all of his PPEs like the headline said. You kind of know where this story is going. I don't know why I'm building it up.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I don't know why I'm building up the dramatic tension. I'm all willy?

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 The end of the story is he bangs this dude who is a patient at the COVID facility and the guy that he's having sex with takes photos of it.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 What doesn't take photos of the act itself, but takes, for lack of a better term, evidence.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Takes photos of like their clothes on the ground, like the PPE gear on the ground and I imagine he's like putting a Motee Collins being like, "Sexy! Cough, cough a little coffee!"

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Happy face. They have sex in the hospital toilet. Now this guy, this nurse, knows that the patient has COVID-19.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 He's in the COVID ward. It's not like he was there for a car accident and then got diagnosed later.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 But apparently, I don't know if they matched up on Grindr or something like that in the location thing. It's all "bing, bing!"

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And he turns and he looks and it's the COVID ward. He bangs this dude. Now, there's two parts to this story.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I mean, other than that, other than the COVID sex. One, in Indonesia, they have these really strict anti-pornography laws.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So because the guy was taking photos and being like, "Ula, la, la!" and me had sexy time in the hospital, they're both facing 10 years in prison.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It's like decency laws. So now there's an emoticon of a sad smiley face behind jail bars.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Like, I don't understand. If you're in that country, you should know the laws. But they're both facing 10 years in prison for this.

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And that's just a human tragedy. That's an overblown thing. That's an overblown sentence for that.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 But this is what the real kick in the pants is. This is what the real pull on the catheter is.

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 The guy has COVID. The nurse goes in. They have sex. The nurse who was tested was not COVID positive.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 The guy who was in the ward still had COVID after the sex. That didn't cure it. That wasn't a cure that was being promoted on some health site.

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 DarkOutPost.com is like, "If you have man-on-man sex, your COVID will go away."

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 No, they didn't say that. That was just a joke, 'cause I don't know how litigious they are. But it wasn't that.

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 The guy who had COVID still has COVID. But the guy who had hot, sweaty hospital toilet sex with him did not catch COVID.

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So, guys, I don't understand why this is not a rally cry. Again, I know that COVID's far more complicated than that.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And I do believe it's real. However, there are a lot of people who don't. Why aren't they talking about this story?

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Why aren't they saying, "Hey, man, what are you gonna wear my mask at Walmart?"

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Two dudes had put sex in Indonesia and they didn't get it. Well, one of them did, but he already had it.

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 But I can't buy grapes. I can't buy grapes at Walmart. What is this?

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 I'm not saying that's a valid argument. I want to be very, very clear to the person who's going to delete this video.

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 I'm not saying that's a valid argument. What I don't understand is why they're not making that argument.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Why is it that I can't eat inside a Taco Bell, but these two dudes can roll around on a dirty hospital floor,

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 and one of them gets up and just goes home? He's totally fine.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So, I don't understand it. I actually-- This was one of those stories that I sat on for a while.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 No pun intended, and I thought-- Someone's gonna start talking about this.

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 This is gonna be big in the conspiracy theory community because all of those reasons I gave.

80
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But nope. So, hopefully these guys don't do 10 years. That's super stiff. Again, no pun intended.

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And they didn't even take photos of the sex act. It was just photos of-- Apparently, the guy was tweeting about how big their genitals were.

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 He was like, "Mine was definitely bigger." He was bragging. There was no, like, actual sex stuff shown, but that was enough.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Indonesia said, "No, 10-year prison sentence for both of you." It was gross to have sex with a COVID-infected person inside of a hospital,

84
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 but I don't think that's-- I don't think being gross should get you 10 years in prison.

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Reese Speces is already taking off the dead rabbit dirgeable. He's like, "No, get your own ride."

86
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I'm sorry, it was disgusting. I'm sorry I joined the Vagina again. We coax him back.

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 We have a giant Flava Flave clock that we're gonna put around his neck.

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Reese's pieces-- Let's put you at the helm of the dead rabbit dreadnought, our massive battleship.

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 We're leaving behind the island nation of Indonesia. We are headed out to Chile.

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 [Pfft]

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 [Pfft]

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 That's the boat going over the waves. Did you guys see that trailer for that new movie? God's Illiverse Kong.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So as Reese's pieces is piloting the dead rabbit dreadnought, he is taking us out to the country of Chile. Specifically, we're going to the city of Vina del Mar.

94
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 It's a coastal city, so the dead rabbit dreadnought pulls right up to the port. We all jump off. We're magically wearing tourist clothes.

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And we're going to Valtparcio. That's the commercial section of the city. So everyone get your cameras ready. Click, click.

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 We're like, "Oh, look at Macy's. Click, click. Look at McDonald's running in their meat and food." We're having a good time at Valtparcio.

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But then we hear a [singing]

98
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 We all kind of turn around at the same time. [singing]

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 I think he's a scat man. But we hear a song being played on a recorder. [singing]

100
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 We turn around and we're looking for the sound of a recorder. And we see it.

101
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It's a man playing a recorder. Like, it's not a mystery at all. Usually there's people playing the recorders. Ah-ha! But hold on.

102
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 This man looks like a super villain. Really, really low budget super villain. [singing]

103
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 He's dressed in rags. Now, not like Tom Sawyer rags, like jeans that are a little roughed up and he's patches. No.

104
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 He's wearing a rag over his head. And then he's wearing like a rag jacket. Just rags. And then rag gloves.

105
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And then, like, he's just, he's just a big old rag. It's hard to describe. It looks like somebody threw a bunch of dirty rags out of a window and they just landed on someone.

106
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 You really have to look at a picture of him and it's kind of hard to do a podcast where you talk about pictures.

107
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 There's more to the narrative than just what he looks like. But he looks like a villain. He looks like a henchman in, like, some 80s cartoon or something like that.

108
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 He just looks like a villain. He looks like a terrible person to hang out with.

109
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 There's nobody like singing out with a ragman, right? [singing]

110
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 He has rag shoes. How do you even have, are those even shoes at that point? They're just rags wrapped around your feet. He's all rags all the time.

111
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But he has three holes cut in his mask. And he, for his eyes and his mouth, obviously, how else is he supposed to play the recorder?

112
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Now, you may think, "Jason, is this some creepypasta that you found?" There's no guy walking around who's made of rags and chile.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 There is. There's actually photographs of this, dude. And not like blurry photographs that someone took just a pile of rags laying on the ground.

114
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 "Hey, Jason, love your show. Here's a pile of rags in my bathroom." I think it's a dude. He puts a recorder next to the pile of rags.

115
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 No, this guy's been hanging out in Chile for the longest time. He's there almost every day. And he sits there and he plays as a recorder.

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Now, he does talk, but apparently there's no audio footage of him talking. But he does speak to people.

117
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Usually, when dogs show up, he hisses at them. He doesn't like dogs. The dogs run away. He does that. And sometimes he'll just walk around following people.

118
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Very, very unsettling man to be followed by. Anyone playing a recorder obviously has some sort of mental issues.

119
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And he's also all dressed in rags, so it makes it even creepier. And sometimes he just isn't playing music. He'll just stand on the street corner staring into space.

120
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Now, it's interesting because he's real. This is a real guy there's photos of. He'd be similar to the Catman of Grenok, who we... it's like kind of a local legend, but he's real.

121
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 It'd be similar to Aki in Britain, who was climbing on top of muscle people. You're like, "What? That's the only bizarre out of context. I'll put those in the show notes."

122
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But just kind of weird local people. So, of course, people make up origin stories for this guy. Because even though he talks, he doesn't really explain things.

123
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So, some people say that it's a fictional character, not that he doesn't exist. You're like, "Damn Jason!" No, no, no, no.

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Not that he doesn't exist, but it's a gimmick the homeless people have come up with. Some people say it's a homel-- it's like a group of homeless people who are switching--

125
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Because he's not playing the recorder good. Let's just get that out of the way. Don't go down there if you want to hear a concert.

126
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 He sucks at it. He's playing a children's instrument. Sorry, professional recorder players, but it's a children's instrument. It's made of plastic, okay?

127
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I don't even know if there are professional recorder players, but I'm sure there is one. At least one. This guy, this guy.

128
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 So they think it may be different hobos in disguise. "Hey, Larry, let me wear the rags today." What? No, these rags, these are my rags. Go get your own rags. They're free.

129
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I mean, they're just rags. You don't need any special rags. Some people say that's that. Some people say it's a guy who's hideously deformed.

130
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And what better way to take attention away from your deformity than to cover yourself in filthy rags? Right?

131
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Just wear a business suit. Everyone will be like, "Hey, you look really good, 'cause you're wearing a business suit."

132
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Some people say it's just a street artist looking for some street cred. It's like a Banksy but smellier and playing a recorder.

133
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 But there are other origin stories involving him. This is the most colorful one. A long time ago.

134
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Not like no location times. This guy is in some sort of vengeful recorder spirit. He's like, "Uh, call my instrument a child's thing, will you?

135
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 "I'll last a thousand years on the streets of Chile." No. A long time ago, you know, 30 years ago, there was a man. We'll call him Johnny Rags.

136
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Johnny Rags had two beautiful children. Oh, a little boy and a little girl. And then one day, Johnny Rags was just working at the Rags Factory.

137
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 He fell in love with Vatterags. He's like, "No, that'd be a better story." He's working at the Rags Factory and his daughter is murdered.

138
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Oh! And he just can't console himself. He's like, "Oh, no." And this sounds like, "Sorry, Daddy." He's like, "I don't like you as much."

139
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 My daughter was my favorite. So in his rage and misery, I'm reading this quote here. In his rage and misery, he set his house on fire with him and his son inside.

140
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I told you, I didn't like the sound I told you. He's like, "Oh, I wish my daughter was here." He sets the fire with him and his son inside.

141
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 It says, "For some reason, he was the only survivor. So now he roams the streets playing the flute his daughter used to own."

142
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 [howling]

143
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So, I mean, to be fair, I didn't look up structure fires in that city in Chile from 1972 to 2012.

144
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I didn't verify that. I'm sure some houses burned down and I'm sure people were burnt up in them.

145
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And people go, "You're like this and you're just cracking all these jokes and you're saying now it might be true."

146
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I'm sure that chain of events happened, but we don't know if this guy is actually that dude.

147
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 We don't know. It's probably not true. Now, to be fair, they do say that the recorder is a popular instrument in Chile for kids to play and also in America.

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 It's possible, but again, there's no verification for that. That really sounds so overly dramatic.

149
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 First off, he'd be in jail. You can't set your house on fire because you're boohoo-ing it and you kill your son and then you get horribly burned.

150
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Actually, he doesn't even say that in there. It just says he set the house on fire with him and his son inside and then he was the only survivor.

151
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Did his just clothes get burned? And he's like, "Ooh, slightly singed pants. I'm going to become a crazy homeless person."

152
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Whereas the implication, he got horribly burned. But anyways, he'd be in jail. He'd be in jail for that.

153
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So I think that's made up. The guy's real, but I think we see so often on this show they'll have a real phenomenon and then people make up a backstory for it.

154
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I like the suggestion that the hobos are using this as a gimmick and they're alternating it.

155
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Because that's pretty snazzy, right? They just have one suit of rags. Do you know how smelly that would be?

156
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Multiple hobos wearing the same clothes? I think that's the most likely scenario.

157
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 But if you live in Chile, you are allowed to--you are allowed, I'm giving you permission, to find this guy.

158
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 He's still doing it, apparently. I don't know if he's doing it this minute, but when I researched this story a couple months ago, he was still out there playing the recorder.

159
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So if you're ever in Chile and you hear the sound of a recorder and you look around and there's no kids to be found, keep looking.

160
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Keep looking. If anyone asks, "Say I'm looking for kids," I'm looking for kids and they're like, "What?" You lunatic?

161
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But if you don't find any kids, you might run into a man wearing rags. And if so, just ask him.

162
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Did you murder your son? And he'll either beat you to death or, dude, what if he bites you?

163
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 You're like, "No, no!" And then you--your skin becomes rags.

164
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And then he gives you a recorder too. He has a brand new one he bought from Walmart.

165
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 You're like, "Aw, man." And then you have to stand on the street corner and go, "Koo."

166
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And then he makes you find your own corner, 'cause that's his city. He gets that money.

167
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Don't get bit by the ragman of Chile.

168
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Reese's Pieces is like--I wasn't even planning on going there to get bitten by the ragman of Chile.

169
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Reese's Pieces, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter. We're leaving behind this town.

170
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 We've lost a couple of loyal DeRabba listeners. They've never had people who were not letting back on the copter.

171
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 They're like, "Ugh, ugh, trying to grab on. Take up. Go, go, go, go."

172
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Get the Carbentercopter out of here. We're leaving behind our loyal listeners.

173
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 But by the time we make it to our new destination, they're cured.

174
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And I sent them tickets. They can just fly coach on an airplane. They've come to join us.

175
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I'm not gonna leave no rag left behind. But you can fly with me. You can't fly with me.

176
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 We're now in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. It's June 22nd, 1972.

177
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Land that Carbentercopter. We're in--we're on a mountaintop.

178
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 So apparently there's a mountaintop on the outskirts of Williamsport. And there lives a family of four.

179
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 You got a mom and a dad and two boys.

180
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The youngest kid, we're gonna call him Billy. He's the narrator of this story.

181
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 He's sitting there. It's 1972, so he's probably playing with Howdy Doody or something stupid.

182
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And his older brother, Nick, is outside with the shotgun.

183
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 "I got one, dad," Nick says. "Two more for the kitchen."

184
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 He's like, "What? What's going on in there?"

185
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Nick is out there--this is dope. I wish I could do this.

186
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Nick is out there with the shotgun shooting bats, dude.

187
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 You know how hard it would be to shoot a bat?

188
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Like, those dudes must be hell of a heart to hit because their wings are so tiny.

189
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Plus, they suck your blood and turn into Dracula. You'd have to use wooden bullets.

190
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 It'd be an adventure to have to go out--and to be fair, I don't think they were eating them.

191
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I don't know where the two for the kitchen came from.

192
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 They're not hillbillies. They live on a mountaintop, so they're mountainbillies.

193
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 But he's shooting bats.

194
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And then the family goes, "What is he doing? He's eating bats again?"

195
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 "That lunatic, what's he thinking?"

196
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 "We don't eat bats. He keeps saying, 'Two more for the kitchen.'"

197
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 "We have food. We have a Kroger nearby."

198
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 "We go to the supermarket." Then they hear Nick screaming for help.

199
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 "Ah! Ah! Guys, get out here! Get out here!"

200
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 They think Dracula has come back.

201
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 The family runs outside and they see Nick standing there with the shotgun.

202
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And they see a cigar-shaped object flying through the clouds.

203
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Now, it's moving very slow for a UFO. They estimate it's between 5 to 10 miles per hour.

204
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 It's 30 to 40 feet long, but only 8 feet in diameter.

205
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And, you know, they just kind of go and kind of shrug their shoulders.

206
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Like, that was weird, right?

207
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Now, they are all heavily armed. At any point, they probably could have went out there.

208
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 But I think the dad was probably like, "Now kids, this is probably not a good idea.

209
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 It's probably some sort of extraterrestrial intelligence. Let's not go out there."

210
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 "Let's just... let's not. Let's pick up these bats and feed them to the dog."

211
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And Nick's like, "Aw, man!"

212
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 A couple days later, dad goes to use the outhouse.

213
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Now, I originally said they weren't ill-billies, but they do have an outhouse.

214
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Their toilet is not built into their house.

215
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 So he's walking out there with a newspaper and an old corn cob to wipe his butt.

216
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 He's walking out to the outhouse. And then he walks back in.

217
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And everyone's like, "That's weird. Dad usually takes way longer to defecate in the outhouse."

218
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 He's normally reading the paper.

219
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 He walks back in and he goes, "Nick, grab your shotgun."

220
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Nick's like, "What? We're gonna get more bats?"

221
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Nick grabs the shotgun.

222
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Dad walks over and he grabs a .50 caliber flintlock rifle.

223
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 He's like, "Let's go."

224
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 They walk outside. Now, at this point, the mother, who I assume is armed with like dual pistols,

225
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 and then the little brother Billy, they walk out on the porch as well.

226
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And as the dad and Nick are standing there, in the woods, about 100 yards away, there's a forest.

227
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 They're looking into the forest and they see hundreds of sets of glowing green eyes staring back at them.

228
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Now, no shots are fired. They just watch these eyes from 100 yards away.

229
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 There's no movement on that side as well.

230
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 The family fitfully sleeps that night.

231
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Next night, dad is watching a little bit of television.

232
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Brand new episode of MASH. He doesn't know what's gonna happen.

233
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It is not in reruns in 1972.

234
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 He's watching MASH. His rest of his family is asleep.

235
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And then he goes, "Oh, man, you know what I really have to do right now?

236
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 I have to go use that outhouse I did get to use yesterday?

237
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 It was all the green eyes, but I gotta use it now."

238
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 So he gets up, he can't pause it. He actually has to get up during a commercial break.

239
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 That's how it was when I was a kid.

240
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So if you're gonna be able to poop quick enough to come back and watch the rest of MASH, he walks outside.

241
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And then the family is woken up by him yelling, "Get the guns! Get the guns!"

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So Nick runs, grabs his shotgun. The rest of the family comes out.

243
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 The mom gets her rocket launcher.

244
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 They come out onto the porch 50 yards away from the house.

245
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 There's a little grove of peach trees, a little shed.

246
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 There's a stone wall closer to the house, so they're looking over this stone wall

247
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 to see this grove of peach trees, to see this shed.

248
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But what they see standing in the peach trees is three sets of glowing eyes.

249
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Now these eyes are actually bigger than the ones they saw before, and they're not bigger because they're closer.

250
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 They're actually physically bigger.

251
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 They could tell that even in the distance those were small creatures, whatever they were.

252
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 These are very big creatures. There's only three of them now, and they said the eyes are all sitting about three feet off of the ground.

253
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And they're watching these eyes. They're watching back.

254
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Now at this point, Dad's like, "Listen, okay, the last time was kind of spooky.

255
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 We should have done something with the cigar shape. We should have moved out of the area."

256
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 But he wants to know what these things are, so he actually goes around the wall and he gets to his pickup truck.

257
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And he drives his truck towards the peach grove. Now his intent isn't to run him over.

258
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 His intent is to see what they are. So he turns on his high beams, and you still can't see anything.

259
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 You can see the eyes, but he can't make out what these figures are.

260
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Nick's ready with his shotgun. He's standing by the stone wall with his shotgun.

261
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Billy and the mom are still on the patio.

262
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And the dad gets out of the truck, has his .50 caliber flintlock rifle, and begins walking towards the eyes.

263
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And at that point, the mother screams, "Don't. Stop where you are. Don't get near him."

264
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And the dad looks over at the mom. He nods.

265
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Mother knows best, right? That's what the show is, right? Mother knows best.

266
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 He looks at her. He nods.

267
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And then he aims, takes it with his rifle, and opens fire on these eyes.

268
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 [imitates fire]

269
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Without any order needed, Nick also begins just letting loose with his shotgun from over the stone wall,

270
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 [imitates fire]

271
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 shooting at these eyes.

272
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 They're hitting these three sets of eyes from two different angles.

273
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 The eyes don't move. They just continue to stare from the darkness.

274
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 At some point the family, I don't know, runs out of ammo, and they just get bored,

275
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 where the commercial breaks over on mash.

276
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 The eyes don't give, but they eventually just kind of pack it up, and they go, "Well, let's go inside."

277
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 That's an interesting point, because on one hand you would think,

278
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 "Would you stay out there all night looking at the eyes, or at a certain point, would you go back inside?"

279
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Because if you get cold or bored, or you think, "Maybe I'm just seeing something,"

280
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 like you would think the eyes would disappear first, but there's no note in the story like they shot him and the eyes vanished.

281
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 The eyes were still there. But they do end up back inside the house.

282
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 The next night, it's not time to use the outhouse.

283
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I'm sure at this point, Dad is pooping during the day, but he does look out the window, and the eyes are back.

284
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 This time there's three sets of eyes, and they're three feet off of the top of the stone wall.

285
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 They're now maybe 15 yards from the house.

286
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Dad and son, they probably have their guns, they're ready, they probably didn't even put them away from the night before.

287
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 They grab their weapons, they step out on the porch, they just begin unloading into these eyes.

288
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 These unmoving sets of eyes that are standing on top of this stone wall.

289
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 The Dad actually walks up and places the rifle right between the eyes, and pulls the trigger.

290
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 The eyes don't move.

291
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But they never returned after that night.

292
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 After they emptied all their ammo into these things, after these point blank shots, the eyes never got closer to the house.

293
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 I got that story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com. They got it from New Fork, which is the National UFO Reporting Center.

294
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 It's an interesting story because you have humans engaged in a firefight with eyes.

295
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Not just eyes, not just eyes that are rolling around on the ground eyeballs, but alien.

296
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 The fact that we see the UFO in the beginning makes us think these are aliens.

297
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 The fact that they're three feet off the ground makes you think it's some sort of gray alien.

298
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 As I was telling the story and reading the story, I imagined them as the typical big teardrop eyes that gray aliens have, but glowing.

299
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 There's a lot of interesting stuff that we can really dissect with this one.

300
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 What happened to the hundreds of eyes in the forest? What was that?

301
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And then of course we have the skeptical thing too. I got to throw this in there.

302
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That it was not that the story was made up, but that they were seeing some sort of phenomenon.

303
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 The guy is shooting at a bunch of fireflies that are floating around and they all happen to form a fist and they're shaking.

304
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 It could have been a natural phenomenon and that would explain why the bullets were having no effect on them.

305
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 That's why they weren't changing when they were being fired upon because it's just this natural event.

306
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But looking at it from a paranormal event, I do like to put the skeptical answers in here as well.

307
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Looking at a paranormal event, why were there hundreds of eyes to begin with and then just the three?

308
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 What happened to those other sets of eyes? Did they go out to investigate other homes in the area?

309
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Why did the aliens only get so close to the house and retreat and they were never seen again?

310
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Did they eventually, was it that they weren't seen again?

311
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 It was that the next time they were looking out their windows and they go, "We haven't seen those eyes in a couple days."

312
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 But they don't realize these creatures are in the house underneath the stairs, underneath the bed.

313
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 They're basically the boogeyman. Every alien just wants to come down and be the boogeyman in your house.

314
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Grab your ankles as you're walking down the stairs in your basement.

315
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 But I think it's a fascinating story because it gives us an insight to something.

316
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 We'll wrap it up like this.

317
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 All that Dad really wanted to do was protect his family and protect his land.

318
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 This was a place that him and his family called their own. It should be a safe spot.

319
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And when this intruder shows up, they do what you would do to protect your place.

320
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 You attack them.

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But the bullets had no effect. These aliens were completely undaunted.

322
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Really, the fact that they were getting shot at didn't affect them.

323
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 They simply got closer and closer and closer. They didn't care.

324
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 All these weapons that we used to shoot bats and dogs and bear.

325
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I don't know who's shooting a dog, but these weapons that are used to kill animals and men had no effect on these creatures.

326
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And as I finished that story, I kind of sat back and thought, this could be a parallel to what humanity is facing.

327
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 This family in Pennsylvania saw a phenomenon that was sets of glowing eyes staring at them from the darkness of the forest.

328
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 But humanity may soon experience a different phenomenon.

329
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 We may see the lights of a thousand starships staring back at us from deep space.

330
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And as the governments of the world try to figure out a way to protect us, to protect this planet,

331
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 they'll turn to the one thing humans know best, weapons.

332
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And as we stand there and watch the world's militaries fire their missiles,

333
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 watch these advanced weapon platforms shoot out of silos across the planet

334
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 and streak through the night sky towards the alien invaders,

335
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 will we see them impact these starships and tear through them and fire and flame,

336
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 or will all of our weapons be as useless as an old man's rifle and his son's shotgun?

337
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 When the aliens show up, do we stand a chance?

338
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 That's a question we won't know until it's too late to change the answer.

339
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
