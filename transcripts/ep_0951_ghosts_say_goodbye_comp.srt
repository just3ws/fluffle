1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
 was half a billion dollars recently spent by the US government to train the army to fight

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,880
 reptilian super soldiers?

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
 Huh?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,440
 Probably not, but let's take a look at it anyway so who knows, it could be wrong.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,780
 And then we travel to Colorado to take a look at a haunting deep within Dead Man's Canyon.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,400
 Is there really a chopped up bloody ghost hiding in the bushes?

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,040
 And when he leaps out of the bushes, hands wrapped around our throat were forced to ask

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,160
 the question, is he trying to murder us or does he really just want to hug?

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:54,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,280
 I'm Coach Jason Carpenter, I'm having a good day, I hope you guys are having a good day

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,080
 too, I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,120
 I'm gonna go see Smile, that'll take up about two hours of my weekend and the rest of the

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,480
 time I'm just gonna walk around in a circle, hoping for the best.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,440
 But someone who always gets the best walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,400
 of our Christmas livestream contributors from way back in 2022's Christmas special.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:33,400
 Come on in, come on in, he's dressed up in his little uniform, he has on the military

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,840
 uniform, he's dressed up as the Nutcracker, that's your military uniform, a 19th century

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
 Cossack walking in.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,560
 St. James, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode, if you guys can't support

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,640
 the Patreon or the livestream or whatever he did to get on the show, that's fine too,

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,720
 this helps spread the word about the show that really really really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 Now St. James when he donated to the Christmas livestream, he put in a request and that's

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,560
 why it's taken so long to get to you, he specifically requested he wanted to be part of a military

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,600
 episode so St. James I hope you got that musket loaded, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,280
 Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy, we're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, take us deep into

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,760
 these tunnels leading underground.

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,480
 I have a theory, I think most people enjoy war as a concept, I don't think they love

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,920
 it personally, I think like if you could have all of the cool stuff about war, people getting

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,000
 blown up, buildings collapsing up, people running from it and stuff like that, you could have

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,080
 all of that cool stuff, people would be like more pro war, you'd have to be protest being

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,840
 like more war, more war, I think, maybe I'm wrong on that, Jason yeah you're completely

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,920
 wrong on that, I find war fascinating, I find the idea of two groups of people smashing

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,120
 into each other and then fighting over contested territory and things like that and I also

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,200
 find the politics behind war very very interesting, but when you look at the human cost, that's

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,480
 what I'm saying, you got all that stuff that is a little more boring and a little more

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,680
 tugging at your heart strings, you got refugees and then you got people buried in the rubble

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,280
 and their hands sticking out and papa papa let me get you out of the rubble and they're

39
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,120
 like no you can't do that, there's like three tons of rubble on your dead, that hand hasn't

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,840
 been moving for a while bro, I don't think your dad's still here, nobody likes that

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,680
 part of war, nobody likes that part of war but in theory, I think that's why we can

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,720
 watch war movies and play war video games and buy war toys, but when a real war breaks

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,600
 out you're like come on guys, can't you resolve your differences in another way, does that

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,560
 make sense, I think people enjoy war in theory and I'm one of those guys, I'm one of those

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,320
 guys Jason yesterday, the only guy on earth who you could possibly think that you can

46
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,600
 separate the two, I can watch war movies all the time, I can't tell anyone apart cause

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,320
 I have facial blindness the whole movie, I'm like which one's Ryan, they all look the same,

48
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,580
 but I can watch them, I just you know someone has to go that one, the guy who's clearly

49
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,080
 Matt Damon was even in the movie, that guy right there, that's the guy, I can't tell

50
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,800
 anyone apart if they're wearing a helmet or they all have a bus cut, I really can't, I

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,760
 like those movies, I can play video games or I'm running around blowing people's brains

52
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,920
 out, but if someone gave me a rifle in real life and said see that guy over there, he

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,080
 did something wrong to your ancestors you gotta go blow his brains out, I'd be like

54
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,880
 I don't know this isn't so fun anymore, does he have a gun too, they're like yeah and it's

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
 like okay now it's definitely not fun, cause there's a chance my brains get blown up, in

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,000
 theory war is pretty cool, so I do read articles about like the military and stuff like that,

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,680
 I find the whole theory of it fascinating, well recently this article came out, not

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,680
 only is it a cool look at the future of warfare, it actually, I'm surprised the conspiracy

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,600
 theory community isn't eating this up, before I started recording this episode I went to

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,120
 darkoutpost.com that weirdo conspiracy website I go to, that guy's in love, David Dobrik actually

61
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,160
 that's not his name, what's his name, Dave something or another, he has this show called

62
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,040
 darkoutpost, Dave Zublik and he's like in love with this woman, he keeps, I almost wanna

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,560
 do a story on it, he keeps Photoshop in this picture of this woman, into all of his videos,

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,920
 she gets interviewed, but like he Photoshop, like he, there's a photo of her just standing

65
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,640
 here like with her arms crossed, and at first he would just have that in his thumbnail,

66
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,240
 and then like a photo of him, and now he's actually like copying her pose, so it makes

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,240
 it look like it's, they're in the same photograph, it's super weird, I mean this guy's talking

68
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,520
 about all sorts of stuff, but he's not talking about the story we're about to discuss, right

69
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,600
 now he's doing a thing about who's causing the reoccurring date of the Mexican earthquakes,

70
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,480
 he says that monkeypox is caused by the COVID vaccine, which is a whole other ball of wax,

71
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,800
 right, he has that, no one else is talking about this story and it's insane because we're

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,080
 underneath the earth, St. James is on point, he's walking rifle ready because we're about

73
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:37,480
 to engage with the reptilian empire, not really, okay, that might have been a bit of an exaggeration,

74
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,760
 let's get to the story, but this is fascinating, I'm surprised no one else is covering this,

75
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,480
 I read this really cool article written by Matthew Cox for military.com, and just recently

76
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:57,040
 it has been revealed that the army, the US army has spent a half a billion dollars to

77
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,420
 train the majority of its battalions, I think it's like 28 out of 32 or 28 out of 34 battalions

78
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,720
 have been trained or are training right now in underground warfare, and the idea is this,

79
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,840
 the US military says the next wars are going to be fought in the mega cities, we're all

80
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,240
 going to go to judge dreads reality after the dimensional merge, these military basically

81
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,240
 they're saying listen the next war is going to take place in the mega cities, you're going

82
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,240
 to have just block by block warfare, now a lot of it's going to be leveled by tanks,

83
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,580
 a lot of it's going to be leveled by airstrikes or drone strikes, things like that, every

84
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,820
 war ends with the infantry moving into an area to be able to security, you have to be

85
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,620
 able to walk through the city and look in the pantries and be like nope no one there,

86
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,620
 probably you should check the closets in the basement first before you're looking for some

87
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,140
 crustables to eat because there's obviously not a gunman hiding in the cupboard, you're

88
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,700
 just really really hungry, they said this is really where the next war is going to be

89
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,480
 fought, but the other thing is they go we also have to be able to fight underneath those

90
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,560
 cities, we have to go underground into these massive structures and they said some of these

91
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,400
 structures are underground, they're talking about sewers and subways, they're also specifically

92
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,760
 talking about Russia which has a massive underground complex that was built up during

93
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,560
 the cold war so they could pretty much hide most of their population or at least the

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,460
 ones they deemed worthy, underneath the ground, you have whole cities down there that you

95
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,380
 can move stuff around, they go we're going to have to put troops into places like that

96
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,860
 and for the longest time we've trained our special forces to fight underground because

97
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,660
 we're going after groups like Al Qaeda, we're going after groups like ISIS, things like

98
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,340
 that, but they go once we start fighting what the term is called peer warfare right, you're

99
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,900
 fighting people who have the same level of technology or maybe better, the same level

100
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,960
 of troop training or maybe better, you can't count on having these small groups in there,

101
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,160
 this is fascinating, they were talking about one of the countries they were really looking

102
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,080
 at was North Korea and they said North Korea has, this is crazy, they have 4,800 underground

103
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,560
 facilities in the country of North Korea, this is a new manual that came out according

104
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,680
 to the army's subterranean manual, I mean that just sounds dope right, they said quote

105
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:32,420
 North Korea could accommodate the transfer of 30,000 heavily armed troops per hour and

106
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,100
 they said that these complexes just crisscrossed throughout the country, so you could move

107
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,220
 30,000 troops and no air photos are going to pick it up, thermal scanners aren't going

108
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,900
 to pick it up, nothing and they would just pop out of these areas, they would be determined

109
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,620
 that these are like the 5 main exit points, but even if you put a couple of people together

110
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,840
 to watch, there's 30,000 people per hour jumping out of there, just be like this huge swarm

111
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:07,360
 and they also reference they go North Korea, they have an air base inside a mountain, that's

112
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,360
 like over commander level stuff, that's the things we see on 80's cartoons, I don't know

113
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,340
 if they have a really cool thick metal door that goes up and like jets fly out, as Kim

114
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,820
 Jong Il stands here with his hands on his hips, they'll never stop me now, he should,

115
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,560
 I don't see why not, he already has an airport built inside of a mountain, they said we got

116
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,300
 to train, not just our special forces, we got to train everybody to fight underground,

117
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,220
 this is so crazy and they showed in this article by Matthew Cox, they showed like a diagram,

118
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,280
 they showed like a drawing from the military manual and they were showing a bunch of troops,

119
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,400
 like they showed like all this, it was like inside of a tunnel and they showed like a

120
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,800
 bunch of troops standing around and then they kind of like outlined the other things you

121
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,520
 would need to worry about in a tunnel as opposed to really anywhere else and it was obviously

122
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,480
 there'd be no lights, there'd be zero visibility, everyone would have to have a flashlight,

123
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,460
 which is basically a shoot me here sign to someone standing at the other end of the tunnel,

124
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,500
 right, you see a bunch of flashlights, you see a bunch of headlights, you see a bunch

125
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,140
 of head lamps and you're just like, you stand in the darkness, you know, they're coming

126
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:26,100
 in and you just shoot at anything that's lit up, you just have this big bull down, oxygen

127
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:33,620
 monitors, you could totally wipe out a whole battalion of people by just shutting off the

128
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,680
 airflow, like how would you even be able to measure that without an oxygen monitor obviously,

129
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,480
 like you don't think about that, you're never outdoors running around shooting people out

130
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,760
 of trees and you're like, Joey, Joey, stop, can you breathe, can you breathe there, they're

131
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,480
 like, of course I can breathe there, I'm in the jungle, there's oxygen everywhere, underground,

132
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,360
 I mean you could have gone underground and walked a mile in with a bunch of troops and

133
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,600
 then everyone just drops dead, when you have like a soldier run has to carry a canary,

134
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,060
 so they have to have oxygen monitors with them and I can't even imagine the chaos of

135
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,420
 a firefight, I mean there's whole first person shooter levels where you're in like a subway,

136
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,780
 what's that thing called, I think it's just called the subway but you know like a terminal,

137
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,380
 subway terminal, you have whole maps based on that, you're beneath the terminal though

138
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:28,380
 sometimes, you may be in access tunnels underneath that, crawling doing the little crouch crawl,

139
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,380
 in real life you don't get to just hold down the C button, you're like, oh my legs hurt

140
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:40,120
 and you're like crawling down, how insane is that, how insane is that, but just as a

141
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,360
 interesting thing I wanted to tell you about but also like this plays 100% into the conspiracy

142
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,840
 theory that reptilians have massive facilities underneath the earth, I am shocked no one

143
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,000
 else in the conspiracy theory community is really talking about this, what's, this is

144
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,200
 my conspiracy theory, earlier this week there was a big article in the conspiracy theory

145
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:09,180
 community or a big story about that badge, about that group, I think it was the national

146
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,180
 intelligence, let me pull up the exact name of it, yeah they recently had a patch that

147
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:22,060
 was really or a seal for the NIM aviation group and on it you saw a picture of like

148
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,580
 a plane, a newer plane, a supersonic plane, a drone and then there was a little UFO in

149
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,960
 the corner and that's been all over the blogosphere, they're like, oh dude look at this, they're

150
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,200
 finally revealing that they have a UFO, they have access to the UFO clipart, out of the

151
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,200
 military you get this, that's been going around, it's kind of a fun story for some people,

152
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,320
 I guess it was a mock up, because people have really gone into the designs of those other

153
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,400
 planes and they said those are actually foreign planes, most of those planes are enemy aircraft,

154
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,660
 so it looks like someone was just taking clipart and putting it on, it was like a mock up

155
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,340
 and then someone goes hey you know what would be fun if they tried to UFO in it and then

156
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,700
 it got posted to an official website, it's a fun story, it's a fun story but my conspiracy

157
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,420
 theory is that popped up to kind of cover up this other story coming out, that yeah we

158
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:24,340
 spent half a billion dollars to train our troops underground because they didn't want

159
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:31,000
 to know about the reptilians, it's still a UFO related right, misdirection right maybe,

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,720
 are they actually getting ready to fight these alien overlords underground, would they be

161
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,360
 under lords at that point, who knows, probably not, they're probably actually training to

162
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,200
 fight other humans, which the reason why I like stories like humans fighting aliens

163
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,000
 and underground stuff, because again I like fighting, I like war, but I don't want to kill

164
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,020
 other people, I remember when I walked out of Starship Troopers, I'm old enough to have

165
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,660
 seen it in the theater in 1997, I walked out of the movie and I said I would totally join

166
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,540
 the military if I didn't have to kill other people, like even if it risked, even if it

167
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,340
 felt like my limbs might get blown off and I might have sex, I might end up having sex

168
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,900
 with Dizzy, I would totally do it, I would take that risk because I'd be fighting bugs,

169
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,260
 I'd be fighting stuff that actually now the thing about the whole point of the movie was

170
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,600
 that bugs are people too, they also have feelings and things like that, they get scared, but

171
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,560
 yeah I'd go I'd do it, I would totally throw grenades at stuff if they weren't other humans.

172
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,000
 So I would love the idea that week would be fighting underground, they put all the guys,

173
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,200
 actually here's a crazy conspiracy theory for you that I just came up with, what if you

174
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:50,580
 had, what if you dosed your soldiers so the enemy looked like aliens, they looked like

175
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,540
 cheap, cheap Halloween outfits from Spirit Halloween store, that's all I ask for, all

176
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,940
 I ask for is for an intergalactic war so I can blow things up and not be other humans,

177
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,860
 I'll be like hey brother, we're both on the same side now right and he's like yep and

178
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,220
 we're just like shooting some people from another planet, they're totally innocent,

179
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,200
 they came to bring us all the gears and we're like you're not one of us bro, we're blowing

180
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,840
 them up, ships taking over other planets and we're like yeah, yeah this is what I've

181
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,360
 waited my entire life for to conquer another world, St. James, let's go ahead and toss you

182
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,280
 the keys of the carbon or copper, we're leaving behind the battle-scarred planet known as

183
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,400
 Elysium I, not very peaceful anymore is it aliens, take us all the way back to Earth,

184
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:45,580
 we're headed to Colorado Springs, Colorado, Colorado Springs Colorado, Colorado Springs

185
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:53,180
 Colorado, we were actually in Colorado earlier this week, we took a look at a haunting, took

186
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,620
 a look at a haunting within the city of Denver, we're gonna go farther out from there, don't

187
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,140
 ask me which direction I didn't look at a map, but in Colorado Springs, Colorado, there's

188
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,360
 a place known as Dead Man's Canyon, or is there?

189
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,840
 I didn't look at a map, I can easily verify it if it's still called that.

190
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,840
 Back in 1863, there's this little place called Little Fountain Creek, doesn't that sound

191
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,480
 inviting right?

192
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,960
 Little Fountain Creek and there's this cabin there and there's a man named William Henry

193
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:34,920
 Harkins and he wakes up in the morning, he's like oh what a lovely day, the sun's rising,

194
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,980
 beautiful fresh mountain air, I don't have a machete embedded in my head, this is just

195
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,940
 a lovely day, what could possibly go wrong?

196
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,260
 Well maybe he shouldn't have been bragging about having the brains inside of his skull

197
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,420
 because a short while away there was a group called the Espinoza's Brothers, the Espinoza's

198
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,940
 Brothers, it's kind of a mouthful, there was five of them and these guys were religious

199
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,420
 fanatics, doesn't say what religion, but I'm gonna guess Catholic right?

200
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,640
 I don't think they were like Sufi or anything like that.

201
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,120
 The Espinoza Brothers, they were these religious fanatics that were running around the area,

202
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,280
 they're also really angry with America and Americans because Spain lost the Spanish American

203
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
 War.

204
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,400
 I start from side to side, it's like I probably shouldn't have done research on that as well.

205
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,640
 I'm pretty sure they won because most of America is still America, all of America is still

206
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
 America and Spain's a tiny little country.

207
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:38,420
 I'm looking at that, I didn't know America and Spain fought, I know we had wars in Mexico,

208
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,300
 there was the Mexican American War, America went to war with Spain, I was like really

209
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,620
 I don't remember this, I don't remember ever learning about this, we learned about the

210
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,500
 Mexican American War and the French Indian War, but what?

211
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,340
 I mean that kind of sounds like a corp stop honestly like Spain so far away and they

212
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,760
 got like their giant galleons, they're floating in America just like shooting camera, like

213
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,240
 how did they even, did they deploy troops there?

214
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,600
 I don't know, I don't know I probably should have looked at some of this information up,

215
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,240
 anyways you know me, I'm all about the ghosts, I'm all about the ghosts.

216
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,880
 The Espinoza Brothers were ready to get revenge and they began moving throughout the area

217
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,080
 and they were killing minors, they were the job and not the child, they were killing minors

218
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,700
 and they were killing ranchers, people would be out there being like run little doggies

219
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,100
 run and they're riding their horses and they're rustling up cattle and stuff like that through

220
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,660
 own lassoes and then all of a sudden the Espinoza Brothers would jump out of the bushes.

221
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,460
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

222
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,420
 you'd be sitting there with a pickaxe being like I finally found me gold, Leprechaun got

223
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:57,660
 a job as a 49er, he's like I got it and the Espinoza Brothers would block off the tunnel

224
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,920
 and you'd just see these silhouettes of five people and you're like no, no, not the Espinoza

225
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:09,080
 Brothers, no, and what's interesting about these guys is that the way they killed people

226
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
 seems inefficient.

227
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:18,000
 I mean I guess they are serial murderers who are destroying people just because they belong

228
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,680
 in the wrong country according to them but they would, I had to double check my notes

229
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,260
 so I was like really did I type this in wrong or something?

230
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:32,220
 They would chop you up and then shoot you.

231
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,580
 It sounds like inefficient right because everyone had guns back then so like as these five dudes

232
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,020
 are coming towards you you're like and I imagine you'd be shooting at them and they'd like

233
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,540
 they were just chopping you up and it's like shouldn't it be the other way around?

234
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,620
 You figure you'd shoot them in the gut first and then you'd like fall to the ground and

235
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,160
 then they would chop you up, not they'd be like coming at you with machetes and stuff

236
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
 like that hatches.

237
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,280
 I don't know maybe it was a torture thing, I don't know maybe it was a religious thing,

238
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
 they were religious extremists, who knows?

239
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,040
 They would chop you up and then shoot you.

240
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,360
 Well one night William Harkins is at his little cabin here in Little Fountain Creek

241
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,120
 and who shows up?

242
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:21,400
 The Espinoza Brothers and they embed a cleaver right into his head, stack and as this

243
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,740
 as they do like you're like oh okay guys oh you guys got me, you guys got me real good,

244
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,660
 I got this cleaver in my head, I guess we're even now, you know I didn't do anything wrong,

245
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
 okay you guys can leave.

246
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:40,100
 Then they shot him, they shot him and then they robbed him which at that point I mean

247
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,740
 whatever they're gonna do whatever right, you got a cleaver embedded in your head, you

248
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,260
 shot a couple times, you're not like oh no my precious moment figurines as they're putting

249
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,140
 them in a bag, you're already going to die, you're not dead already.

250
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,280
 Well, law enforcement was obviously on these guys tail for a while, they were trying to

251
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,960
 put an end to these brutal murderers and after the murder of William Henry Harkins they corner

252
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,520
 the Espinoza Brothers, they do it right, this is how things are normally done in America,

253
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,640
 they shoot them first, they did this one by one, they're whittling down the Espinoza

254
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,760
 Brothers numbers, they would shoot them first and then decapitate them.

255
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:26,900
 After all five brothers were killed, the posse showed up at this party, I guess it was a different

256
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,300
 time, they showed up at a party and threw the Espinoza Brothers heads into the middle

257
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,040
 of the party, that sounds like the best Van Wilder movie, they should do a Van Wilder

258
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,660
 1863, basically the entire movie, a bunch of people get horribly murdered and then

259
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,640
 Ryan Reynolds shows up and starts throwing heads around the party and then someone eats

260
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,840
 a donut full of dog semen, that's still the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in a movie

261
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,440
 at movie theaters watching that, Ryan Reynolds tricks a man into eating a donut full of dog

262
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,880
 semen, I was like what?

263
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,840
 What world am I living in?

264
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,640
 People fun died during the Spanish American War, so I gotta watch this movie, what is

265
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
 going on?

266
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,100
 Anyways, fast forward, let's fast forward a bit in time, but not too far, these ghost

267
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:21,060
 sightings we don't have a date on them, but they do seem to be around the time period,

268
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:27,660
 people started seeing the ghosts of William Henry Hawkins in the area and when he appeared,

269
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:34,060
 he would jump out of the bushes and he would have a cleaver stuck in his own head and he

270
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,140
 would jump out of the bushes and he would pursue you down the canyon, that's his home

271
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:47,400
 turf, he knows every crook and crevice, he knows where the stream is a little more streamy,

272
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,680
 you gotta make that jump, he knows all that stuff, you're just walking through, maybe

273
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,640
 you're on like a wagon train, you're like riding your horse and then some dude jumps

274
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,640
 out with a cleaver and he's like this is the last thing you expected, right?

275
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,480
 I mean this guy is chasing you and people would shoot at him constantly and bullets

276
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,040
 would go right through him obviously because he was a ghost and then they would go oh,

277
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,040
 maybe I shouldn't have wasted my bullets because I'm out in the middle of nowhere and I can

278
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,500
 get a bunch more bullets, maybe I shouldn't be shooting at this phantom, but you know

279
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,400
 the first couple of bullets obviously, you would think that it was a man with a cleaver

280
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,520
 in his head and he was going to put the cleaver in your head, what's interesting about this

281
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,600
 is that the fact that the dead have come back to life, we have proof of the immortal soul,

282
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,060
 that type of stuff, is that we have this story from 1884, so yeah all of those stories would

283
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,120
 have really taken place between his murder in 1884, so we're talking about what a 19

284
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,560
 year period, there was a woman named Grandma Wyatt and she was riding through the area

285
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,120
 with her grandson, she was taking him home and all of a sudden out of the bushes jumps

286
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,760
 William Henry Harkins cleaver deep inside of his brain and he grabs her skirt, so right

287
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:10,000
 there we have the idea of whatever this phantom is, it can manipulate physical matter, it's

288
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,600
 super rare, despite what you see in horror movies, it's actually really rare that a phantom

289
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,300
 can grab onto you, this thing grabs onto her skirt, now this guy William Henry Harkins

290
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:30,260
 looked so lifelike, everyone assumed he was real, including Grandma Wyatt, when this burly

291
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:36,840
 man with bloody face and cracked open skull jumps out of the bushes and grabs her skirt,

292
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,760
 she beats him up, she starts punching this guy and she says we have a quote from this

293
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,680
 woman, she goes quote you old buzzard how dare you scare a baby like that, she's referring

294
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,820
 to her grandson obviously, and then she says this is weird, maybe she's turned on by men

295
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,540
 who have after brains missing, she says you old buzzard how dare you scare a baby like

296
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,500
 that, I'll be back here later though, she actually does say that, I'll be back here

297
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,420
 though later, and if you bother me I'll give you a what for again, now get from here, like

298
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,940
 why would you be telling a guy who jumps out of the bushes instead of an ambush being like

299
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,200
 you know you scared that baby but don't worry I'll be back I'll be alone, maybe she was

300
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:31,120
 looking for some lovin, we don't know but anyways as she's punching this dude, he disappears,

301
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,680
 and that's when she realizes he's a ghost, so obviously if this story from 1884 about

302
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,640
 a punching grandma is true, her punches were landing, they were actually hitting some sort

303
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,540
 of physical object, it was able to grab her clothes and interact with her, super rare

304
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,700
 in the world of paranormal, super super rare, fascinating, jump to future times there's

305
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,820
 a group called a paranormal group called enam paranormal, and they decide to go and do

306
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,500
 on the ground investigation of this area, they go out, and listen I've done a lot of

307
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,100
 on the ground ghost hunting type of things, you do have to bring protection with you,

308
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,120
 whether that's pepper spray, I mean obviously you know like your religious icons, spirit

309
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,280
 box whatever device you're using but you also have to have like real world protection, pepper

310
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:33,120
 spray, knives, crowbars, bats, nunchucks whatever you have available, they, and I get it right

311
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,800
 you're out in this canyon, worried about bobcats maybe, or a ghost jumping out of the bushes,

312
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,100
 they bring a machete with them, they're walking through the darkness of dead man's canyon,

313
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:51,740
 and they have this machete with them, and apparently they start to feel that the ghost

314
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,440
 is angry, they can actually say that they can feel the essence of William Henry Harkin,

315
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,020
 so they go maybe it's not a good idea to bring an, bring an edged weapon around a man who

316
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,540
 was killed by an edged weapon, so they actually get a blunt weapon instead, like I don't know

317
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,800
 both staff maybe, and they go back walking through this area and they said they're able

318
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:16,200
 to register a temperature drop in the area, they get EVPs, and they said that after they

319
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,640
 replaced their edged weapon with a blunt weapon, the ghost seemed friendly, actually seemed

320
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:31,400
 welcoming to this group called a NAM paranormal, which leads us into a bigger topic, really

321
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,820
 two bigger topics, first off is, I had this story prepped to go a long time ago, I had

322
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,900
 it ready to go, but just for whatever reason it never fit into a particular episode, so

323
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:49,780
 when I was pulling it back up, I was checking my links again, a NAM paranormal is gone,

324
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,980
 it was a ghost research group, their website's completely gone, the link I'll put in the

325
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,820
 show notes but it's dead, there's no archive that I could find either, that's so disappointing

326
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,800
 and sad, because we have these groups doing these on the ground investigations, paranormal

327
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,360
 investigation it's a labor of love, and there's a lot of money attached to it, and I think

328
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,160
 a lot of people get into it, hoping they can make enough money to even just pay web hosting

329
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22,600
 fees, but over time, maybe they can't, maybe they can't afford to keep the website up,

330
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,080
 maybe all the members are ghosts themselves, maybe they're all dead and there was no one

331
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,660
 left to pay the bills, and so the website's down, which means all of their investigations

332
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,140
 are gone, all of their notes, everything is gone, their EVPs, and that sucks, it really

333
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,900
 is when you look at the world of the paranormal, the world of the paranormal investigators

334
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,980
 to be specific, UFO investigators, big foot investigators, they just disappear, I've

335
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,340
 been going through a thing where I'm trying to archive these big sites, I've downloaded

336
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,100
 the entire site of thinkaboutadocs.com, I mean the process of downloading the entire

337
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,080
 website of the shadowlands.net, not to repost, but if those websites ever do go down for

338
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,640
 good, we do have a record of all the research they've done, because it does suck when this

339
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:17,480
 stuff completely disappears, but also I wanted to take a look at it, because I think when

340
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,980
 you look at the phenomenon as a whole, we can take, this is definitely an anomaly, it's

341
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,780
 a ghost that can interact with living people, it can grab them, it can be hit by them, it

342
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,460
 appears lifelike enough that people are completely shocked when they shoot at it and it doesn't

343
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,720
 stop it when they're punching it, they don't realize it's not human until it disappears,

344
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,660
 so it's not a wisp, it's not just some vapor, it's not someone with Casper legs floating

345
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,960
 through the bushes, it looks like a real person who suffered a severe injury, that's interesting

346
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,600
 in and of itself, it can interact with the real world, super interesting, but I'm thinking

347
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,480
 about this and I go, you have a ghost that is attacking people, and then when we have

348
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,240
 this group of NAMM paranormal that shows up later on, it does seem to be helpful, or not

349
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:19,740
 necessarily helpful but friendly, what happens to ghosts when they stop being visited?

350
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,180
 Now we know some ghosts just dissipate over time, that seems to be kind of the accepted

351
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,780
 wisdom in the paranormal community, that's why we don't have caveman ghosts, that's

352
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,820
 why we don't have ghosts of Centurions from Rome, that's why when you go to Turkey you

353
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,920
 don't run into some dude from 600 AD, you don't run into these ghosts that are super

354
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:47,920
 old, most of the ghosts we see in the modern world are around 1800s and forward, you don't

355
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:56,000
 get a lot of ghosts from even the 1100s, definitely nothing from biblical time, where's St. Peter's

356
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,340
 ghost floating around, there goes all of my Catholic listeners, they're like, he's not

357
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,140
 a ghost, he's not a ghost, he wouldn't be floating around, he wouldn't be haunting, Bethlehem

358
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,540
 or something dude, he's in heaven, anyways to my remaining non-Catholic listeners, that

359
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,260
 was just an example, where are these ghosts?

360
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,660
 And I started to think, okay so he's in that timeline, 1800s, these ghosts are still around,

361
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:27,480
 or do they ever get bored? Do ghosts ever get lonely? Because this haunting isn't attached

362
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,280
 to a particular domicile, it's not like he was in a house and the house was burned down

363
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,680
 like we covered in the Denver episode earlier this week, and so the ghosts as far as we

364
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,200
 know have left, this is a man who was killed in the outdoors and he's hanging out in the

365
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:48,040
 bushes and there was a time where a lot of people were moving through this area, but

366
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:55,220
 now in our modern age, how many people are really walking through Dead Man's Canyon?

367
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,740
 And does he stay in the bushes? Is he standing out there and he's kind of like looking for

368
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:07,900
 someone? Like I think about how lonely it can be sometimes to be human, and yet we're

369
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,260
 still surrounded by people that if we ever feel like we can, we can reach out to other

370
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,920
 people, even if it's just talking to other people online, people in your social circle

371
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,680
 meeting new friends or hanging out with old friends or whatever, you have these different

372
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:30,760
 options. But if you're a ghost, you're sitting in the bushes and there's a time period where

373
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,760
 you're jumping out and scaring people all the time, but then there's less and less people,

374
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,600
 you probably stop jumping out of the bushes and scaring them, but eventually you're just

375
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,400
 in the bushes and then 10 years pass and you maybe see five people in that time period,

376
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,300
 and then another 30 years pass and you see one or two people. And then 50 years pass,

377
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:57,140
 there's nobody, you know, and you're just kind of sitting in the bushes watching them.

378
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,340
 Like that's your whole reality, you can't be like, well, I've waited six in the morning,

379
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,180
 I've haunted this area all night, it's time to go hit up that sushi restaurant downtown

380
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:13,560
 Denver, like that's your existence, you're trapped in this valley. If you can't even

381
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,040
 say you've watched the world go by, you haven't seen cities rise and all this technology being

382
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,000
 invented, you're in a canyon, you're just this ghost hiding in the bushes of a canyon.

383
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,080
 Like do you feel that loneliness? Do you feel that isolation has the dead still walking the

384
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:40,140
 earth? How sad is it? Like I wonder if William Henry Harkins is like, man, sure did suck

385
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,580
 me and murdered, but I could have at least been murdered in a hotel where there'd be

386
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:51,300
 a bunch of people to hang out with. Or maybe like I got killed in a horrible fire at a

387
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,060
 clothing factory. He's all looking at all these disasters, he's like, oh man, I kind

388
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:03,160
 of have gotten killed in that. Who know? Like I wonder how lonely it is to be a ghost. And

389
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,560
 you know, I've told this story before in the podcast, we'll wrap it up like this. When

390
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,280
 I first moved into this apartment, I sensed the ghost of an old man, an old emaciated

391
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,760
 man in my closet, which is where I record my podcast. And it didn't feel like I felt

392
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,980
 like it, I wouldn't necessarily say menacing, but it just wasn't a entity I didn't want

393
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:34,580
 to have around. And I remember buying, I bought sage at one point to sage my house and I kept

394
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,500
 putting it off, put it off for a long period of time. And then I finally, and I had done

395
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,460
 this before, I was like, I should sage the house this week, and I should sage the house.

396
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:49,020
 Then I remember finally one day I was resolute, I was like, I'm going to sage the apartment,

397
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,720
 I'm going to definitely do it this week. And then that night when I was sleeping on the

398
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,880
 couch, it was like a half dream state type of thing. So you know, skeptics totally, I

399
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,600
 totally accept skeptics being like a, I remember seeing him standing in my kitchen. And he

400
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,520
 said, Hey, sorry, man, I didn't make you mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I didn't,

401
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:22,100
 you know, that wasn't my intent, but please don't sage the place. I never did. And I wonder

402
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:27,380
 if he was like, he wasn't trying to be menacing, he was just kind of lonely. And I wonder how

403
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,980
 many people he appeared to and they couldn't sense him, or maybe they just sense something

404
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:37,940
 was off. Who knows, like I imagine it could, I don't imagine all ghosts are lonely, but

405
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:46,440
 I imagine some of them are. So how lonely would it be to be trapped in that canyon? Just standing

406
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,080
 behind the bushes. There was a time period where a bunch of people were walking by. You

407
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,560
 jumped out with a big, big, giant cleaver in your brain. It was great. Less and less people

408
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:05,820
 started coming through. Until finally, you know, 100 years later or so, a paranormal

409
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:15,440
 group comes through and you're just happy to be noticed. You're just happy to be visited.

410
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,280
 This is a super obscure ghost story. An am paranormal is one of the few places you could

411
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,280
 find it. I got it from my favorite book, The National Directory of Haunted Places, which

412
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,840
 again is, I think it's out of print at this point. I think most copies are used. I have

413
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,260
 three copies just in case you can't find another one, but yeah, it's an obscure ghost

414
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:43,740
 story that should be more well known. It exhibits a lot of things that most ghosts can't do.

415
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:51,420
 Even this absolutely fascinating, even this super rare ghost story is quickly being forgotten.

416
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,500
 The ghost of William Henry Harkins is being forgotten as well. Is he still waiting in

417
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:03,520
 those bushes, eager to see another human? It's a sad story of a murder victim turned into

418
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:14,440
 a lonely spirit who still hides in those bushes, hoping that another person will walk by. Not

419
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,600
 to chase him through the dark, twisted turns of the cabin, but maybe just to say hello.

420
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:27,480
 I don't know, he does have a big record of chasing people around and grabbing their clothes,

421
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,820
 so I don't know, maybe pay him a visit, maybe go down to this possibly treacherous area.

422
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,580
 I don't know exactly what it's like, but if you're in the area, maybe go say hello to

423
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,380
 this ghost. You may think he's chasing you and that he's going to kill you when he catches

424
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:47,060
 up, but maybe, just maybe, if you turned around as you're running in terror, running through

425
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,700
 this unfamiliar territory, if you turned around, you would see the face of Henry Harkin with

426
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:59,880
 the biggest smile he's ever had, because once again, he has a friend. Again, he also does

427
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,520
 have a cleaver in his head and he might kill you. We're a little unsure on that, so be

428
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,200
 careful.

429
