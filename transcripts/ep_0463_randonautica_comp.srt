1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
 How do you stop a man made of stone?

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,600
 And then we take a look at possibly one of the most powerful stories we've ever covered.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,000
 Is it possible to hack the universe today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,700
 I hope you guys have a great weekend coming up.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,200
 I hope this is the prelude to an awesome, awesome weekend.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,600
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,000
 So we're gonna get started.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,800
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Newcom.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,000
 Newcom, thank you so much for supporting this show.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
 Really, really helps out a lot.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,000
 Newcom actually just graduated from high school.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,300
 Class of Newcom High!

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,100
 [BURP]

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,500
 I don't know, he's probably too young to remember that reference.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,400
 But Newcom, thank you so much for supporting the show.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,500
 You are going to be our captain, our dude, this episode.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,800
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine as well.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,800
 Really, really helps the show grow.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,000
 It's totally awesome.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
 And also we have a merch store, and that is in the links.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,700
 We also have a Minecraft server.

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,400
 So if you guys want to play some Minecraft with me and other fans of the show,

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,600
 Minecraft server in the notes as well.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,300
 So Newcom, I want you to snap, get ready to snap your fingers,

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,400
 because you're going to have a magical power.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
 We're actually going to just go back to the end of the last episode.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
 So you ready?

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
 You ready to snap your fingers?

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,200
 Now, previously on Dead Rabbit, everyone of the Cherokee Nation get together.

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,000
 Hey everyone, hey listen, this dude he's talking.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,600
 Yes, yes, there's this woman called Spearfinger.

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,900
 Ah, stack!

37
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,600
 Ah, I've been stabbed!

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,300
 I've been stabbed in my liver!

39
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,000
 Dramatic quick cuts of a bunch of people, people laying around, no livers on.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
 There's a whole bunch of them.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,100
 How do we defeat Spearfinger?

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,200
 And then the medicine man is like throwing dust and stuff.

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,900
 And he goes, "I explained it on the last episode, but here's a quick overview.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,900
 Spearfinger can be killed if you chop her hand off, because her heart is in her hand."

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,100
 And everyone's like, "Oh, that's pretty cool."

46
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,000
 Except for Spearfinger, she didn't like that.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,700
 She's all, "Shh, I thought that was a secret."

48
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,500
 But Spearfinger had a mortal enemy, then like cuts, quick cuts of this man in a cave.

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,400
 [Groans]

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
 His name was Stone Man.

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,000
 And he also like ate people's livers and stuff, so it's more quick cuts, more bodies.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
 [Groans]

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,500
 Everyone's starting to get motion sickness from this flashback.

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,200
 This auditory flashback.

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,500
 [Groans]

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,900
 And so anyway, make a long story short.

57
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,200
 The last episode, now the medicine man is just totally like, "Whatever, I'm giving up the gimmick."

58
00:02:48,200 --> 00:03:00,100
 The last episode was about this woman, this cryptid, this monster that preyed on people of the Cherokee Nation in Northern Carolina and Tennessee way way back in the day.

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,800
 And she was stabbing people and eating their livers.

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,700
 Now, she had the weakness.

61
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,600
 Now, I'm doing a recap of the recap.

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
 She had a weakness of the heart in her hand.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,300
 They chopped her hand off, but she also had a mortal enemy named Stone Man.

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,400
 And when Stone Man saw that Spearfinger had been killed, they both traveled in the same territories.

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,700
 They both eat human livers.

66
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,500
 And they both have the power of Stone.

67
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,900
 The Stone Man sees this happen.

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,600
 It probably better off if you just listened to yesterday's episode at this point.

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,100
 Stone Man sees that Spearfinger was killed and he whistles to himself.

70
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,600
 "Woo! Woo! He can't call himself!"

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,400
 And he goes, "Oh, well finally my only source of competition for food has been killed and no one will ever guess my weakness."

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 And so he walked off into the night seeing in a song about eating human livers.

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,700
 And now the next episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

74
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,900
 So, it's funny because Stone Man's story isn't super long and it's actually when I was reading about Spearfinger,

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,400
 every version of the Spearfinger legend ended with, "And no one knew how to defeat Stone Man."

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,600
 So he simply walked away into the night.

77
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,700
 And I was like, "Oh, that's kind of a weird ending."

78
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,700
 And then I found another one and they're like, "And little do they know that Stone Man was watching them from afar going,

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,400
 'No one will ever guess my weakness.'"

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,900
 And he walked in and I'm like, "What is this dude's..."

81
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,600
 I didn't know that the medicine men of the Cherokee Nation were building a shared universe.

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,500
 Like they were having these several...

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,000
 Oh, if you want to know the rest of the legend, you got to come back next summer

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,700
 and then eventually all of their legends form together to make one.

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
 I guess that's actually what mythology is, really.

86
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,900
 It's a shared universe. Some guy makes up Zeus.

87
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,400
 And a couple years later, someone made up Artemis and then got, "Whoa, what if they're related?"

88
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,200
 And eventually everyone sat down and Socrates and Herodotus were sitting there and talking about like this shit.

89
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,900
 They're basically the Kevin Feige and Zack Snyder of the ancient world.

90
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
 So, here's the thing.

91
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,200
 So, I'm going to make a long story short because to be honest, I recorded a 20 minute version of this and went on and on and on.

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,000
 So, we have this. We have Spearfinger. We talked about her.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 We have Stone Man who says nobody knows his weakness.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,800
 And he continued his reign of terror. He would just go into villages.

95
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,100
 He'd eat people's livers.

96
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
 Now, as far as I can tell, he wasn't a shapeshifter.

97
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
 He had to be more slick, but he was an old man.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
 He looked like an old man.

99
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,500
 He looked totally normal until you tried bashing his brains in with the club.

100
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,200
 Club would break. He'd turn around.

101
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,700
 And then your liver would be gone.

102
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,200
 So, he had the same power set, basically, except for shapeshifting.

103
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,900
 He ate at your liver. He was indestructible.

104
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,400
 Once his main nemesis was gone, he could eat all the livers he wanted, as long as he could catch them on his old man legs.

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,700
 He also had this stick that was capable of doing two things.

106
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,400
 One, far more badass than the other.

107
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,400
 First off, you could take the stick and he could throw it and it would turn into any form of rock.

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,900
 You're like, "Jason, that's actually... He throws it and he's like, "Oh, no! I threw it in a geology museum place."

109
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,900
 Whatever they're called, probably just geology museum.

110
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,400
 "Where's my wand?" And it's like mixing with a bunch of rocks.

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 No, he could throw it and make rock structures.

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,900
 So, "Oh, no, there's this chasm I have to cross."

113
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,900
 "Woo-woo-woo giant, like bridge, right?"

114
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,400
 Or...

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 I don't know.

116
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
 I can think of another reason why you'd want a big rock in front of you.

117
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
 Oh, no!

118
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
 Um, it's really hot and I want some shade.

119
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
 "Woo-woo-woo-woo!"

120
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,400
 But he could do that.

121
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,900
 And he could, like, I could think, wave it and, like, rocks would fly around and stuff like that.

122
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,900
 I don't know. I could be just red conning. I could just be making that part up.

123
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,400
 There's not a lot of information on Stone Man.

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,900
 But his other ability that the stick would allow him to do is he could smell people with it.

125
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,400
 So there's a story I was able to find.

126
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,400
 This hunter was out in the woods hunting.

127
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,900
 He sees this old man walking around with his stick.

128
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,400
 And he's, like, smelling the stick.

129
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 He was pointing in different directions and then smelling it,

130
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
 pointing in another direction, smell it, pointing in another direction, smell it.

131
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
 And then eventually he pointed in a direction.

132
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 I know that this Vincent's killing you, right?

133
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,900
 Will he ever smell a human?

134
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,900
 He points it in a certain direction, smells it.

135
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
 Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the stuff.

136
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,400
 That's a good old homo-sapien.

137
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,900
 And he then starts walking in the direction and throws the stick and makes a big bridge.

138
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
 And a hunter's watching all this stuff.

139
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,900
 Now, the hunter knows the direction he's headed in is where his tribe is in.

140
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
 So a hunter beats feet back to his tribe and he's like, "Dude, you guys...

141
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,900
 Three guesses to what I just saw."

142
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,400
 So the hunter's telling the story.

143
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,900
 The medicine man in the village hops out of his house and he goes...

144
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
 Stop you right there, dude.

145
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
 Like, I heard what you were saying.

146
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
 I wasn't supposed to be.

147
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
 He's dropping his rude.

148
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,900
 But I need you to find seven women who are menstruating right now.

149
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
 And they're like, "Wait, what?

150
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
 We're talking about smell..."

151
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,900
 The medicine man goes, "I need seven menstruating women right now."

152
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,400
 And this isn't for my sicko hobby that I have.

153
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
 And everyone's like, doing the side eye.

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,900
 They're like, "He does have that weird thing for menstruating women."

155
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
 I know I normally do.

156
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,400
 I need seven menstruating women and maybe an extra two for me, you know?

157
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
 And people are getting grossed out.

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,900
 He's like, "Okay, just the seven.

159
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
 Just the seven.

160
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,400
 Don't take them to my hut.

161
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 Put them on the road leading into town."

162
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
 So everyone's a little skewed out by what's going on.

163
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
 Medicine man's like, "Maybe I will get an extra two."

164
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,400
 Long story short, I'm not joking.

165
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
 The segment is now taking me 30 minutes to record.

166
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
 I have to keep editing stuff out.

167
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
 Seven menstruating women are now standing on the road.

168
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
 I could have just jumped to that part, right?

169
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,900
 I could have just said, "Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Wrap Radio."

170
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,900
 Seven menstruating women standing on a road.

171
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,400
 And a stone man cannot walk past the menstruating woman.

172
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,900
 I don't know how they figured this out.

173
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,900
 I don't know what the medicine man was doing to be like,

174
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
 "You know what?

175
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,400
 We've tried stabbing it, shooting arrows at it, and clubbing it on the brain, but a menstruating woman."

176
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,900
 So, stone man's walking into the village and he's seeing...

177
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,400
 The women were completely naked and he walks past...

178
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 Imagine this, you're walking into town.

179
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
 Whether or not you want to eat people's liver,

180
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 you're just going to go buy a Domino's Pizza.

181
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,900
 You're walking into town, you see a naked menstruating woman

182
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,400
 and standing by the side of the street.

183
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:14,400
 Now, he walks by and he goes, "Oh, no, dear, you're sick."

184
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,900
 And he walks by her.

185
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,400
 And then he sees the next naked menstruating woman and he's like,

186
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,900
 "Oh, no, oh, that's so..."

187
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,400
 And he begins throwing up blood.

188
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,900
 Now, I'm hoping that they've...

189
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,900
 Now that I'm thinking about it, I hope they told menstruating women,

190
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,400
 "Hey, by the way, some monster's going to walk by, so if he starts acting weird, just be normal."

191
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,900
 Because if someone just said, "Hey, stand out, they're naked on your period."

192
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,900
 And didn't explain to you why, and you see an old man walking down the street and he goes,

193
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
 "Oh, my dear, you're so sick."

194
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
 [BURP]

195
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
 What?

196
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,900
 You might have to do a little bit of therapy sessions after that.

197
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,900
 Anyway, so by the time he gets to the seventh woman,

198
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,900
 he's done. He just falls over and, "Ugh!"

199
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,400
 And blood is pouring out of his mouth and at that point, the warriors come out of the village

200
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,400
 and the medicine man shows up and they stake him with seven steaks into the ground.

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
 Stick, stick, ah! Stick, stick, stick.

202
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,400
 And then they built this giant funeral pyre on him, like just threw a bunch of

203
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
 wood and stuff on him, and then...

204
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
 [BURP]

205
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
 ...lit him on fire. He's like, "Ugh!"

206
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,900
 And then he lived for like 12 hours after that. He slowly burned.

207
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,900
 And what was interesting, I mean, what? It's all interesting.

208
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,900
 A man was killed by walking past seven menstruating women.

209
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,900
 As he's burning, he goes, "Medicine, medicine man, come here.

210
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,400
 Uhhh, uhhh."

211
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,900
 And medicine man gets close and the stone man goes,

212
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,900
 [BURP]

213
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,400
 But instead of that, he was actually saying real words and he taught the medicine man

214
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 all the secrets to like the universe and stuff.

215
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,400
 Isn't that eloquent? He's telling the old man the stuff and then eventually after 12 hours,

216
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
 he just turns to dust. He burns up.

217
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,400
 And then there was two things laying in there. There was a magical rock,

218
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,400
 like a red magical rock and a pile of red, like, goo,

219
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,400
 which tends to come out of ten bodies. Not the magical rock thing.

220
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,400
 And it was funny because the medicine man picks up the rock and they're like,

221
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,900
 "Oh, is that a new, like, gem for our village?"

222
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
 And he goes, "No, this is for me." And he puts it in his pocket.

223
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,400
 He does not give anyone else the access to the magical rock, but there's a pile of goo there,

224
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,900
 red goo, and the medicine man goes, "I'mma keep the rock, like, for payment,

225
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,400
 for coming up with this plan. And then if you can get seven ladies to stop by my place later

226
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,900
 and the warriors are like shaking their head, he's like, "Fine, fine. I'll just keep the rock."

227
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,400
 And he takes the red goo and he draws on the villagers' faces and he goes,

228
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,900
 "Tell me what you wish for." And they'd be like, "I wish to be a great hunter."

229
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,900
 And he'd go, "Done." And then the guy would become a great hunter.

230
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,900
 And a couple of people wished for, like, long life or something like that.

231
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,400
 And then, so yeah, and then everyone lived happily ever after, I guess.

232
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,900
 The Liberating Monster was destroyed and everyone got their wish granted.

233
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,900
 Everyone got their wish granted. Now, I don't think you could have said it.

234
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,900
 I would have wished I would have been like, "Old man, sorry, that's disrespectful.

235
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,400
 Medicine man, put this ink on my face. I wish for your magical gem."

236
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,400
 And then it appears in my hand. I don't actually think-- I don't actually think about it.

237
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,400
 I don't think he became the genie. I just think it was a way of blessing them.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,900
 And maybe the liver dude, Stone Man, I guess, was his technical name.

239
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,900
 Maybe that was his way of giving back to all the people.

240
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,900
 It turns out that he wasn't eating our livers. We were eating his.

241
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
 Maybe it's like a lesson like that or something like that.

242
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,900
 He was giving back to the community. His sacrifice will not be in vain.

243
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:48,900
 Anyways, it doesn't matter. I actually-- I don't know how long this is going to be edited,

244
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,400
 but that honestly took me around 40 minutes to record.

245
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,900
 So, I look over, throw my arm around.

246
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
 "Nukum," I'm like, "You ready to get out of here, kid?"

247
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,900
 "Nukum just looks-- suddenly gives me a nod."

248
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,900
 He's throwing up blood. He's like, "My weakness is menstruating women too."

249
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,900
 Run, run, run! Throw them the keys of the carbonicopter.

250
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,900
 Let's get inside, guys. We are headed out.

251
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,400
 We're leaving behind old, timey America.

252
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,900
 We are headed out to...

253
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,900
 the center of the universe.

254
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,900
 It's an ambitious place to be flying the carbonicopter, but Nukum can do it.

255
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:53,900
 "Nununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununun

256
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,900
 I have to navigate event horizons. Yeah, yeah. Quit whining. Helicopter's flying around.

257
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,900
 Now, first off, I want to do a little exercise with you guys.

258
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,900
 There's this thing. You know me, I'm not a big-- I'm not really big into like channeling and like aliens,

259
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,900
 talking to people's brains and stuff like that. I'm usually pretty skeptical of that,

260
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,900
 but I came across this thing that came from an alien.

261
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,900
 All that being said, I came across this thing online,

262
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,900
 supposedly from some sort of alien angel something called Abraham.

263
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,900
 So there's this woman named Esther Hicks, and some of you guys are like, "Oh, great."

264
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,900
 Some of you guys are shutting the vodka, so now--

265
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
 Now, I don't know a lot about Esther Hicks.

266
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,900
 I do know that she believes she's channeling some sort of being called Abraham Hicks,

267
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,900
 and she was also one of the-- this is how she perked my attention up.

268
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
 She's one of the original people who was involved in The Secret.

269
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,900
 You know that book by what was it? Rhonda Bynes or something? Brynes or something?

270
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,900
 And you guys know I'm a big law of attraction visualization, guys.

271
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
 So this kind of popped up on my radar.

272
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,900
 Now, I'm going to-- I don't know much about Esther Hicks,

273
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
 so I'm not really going to talk about her much.

274
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,900
 I know that she was originally involved in The Secret,

275
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
 and then there was some sort of falling out between the two people,

276
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,900
 and I always think it's weird when-- you see this a lot.

277
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
 You see this a lot. People believe that they have connections to the universe,

278
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
 or connected to these higher powers, or know all these secrets,

279
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,900
 and they get involved in lawsuits. Isn't that weird?

280
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,900
 This isn't abnormal. A lot of times when you look at these self-help groups,

281
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
 there's a lot of lawsuits involved.

282
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
 So, I mean, everyone's bogged down by mortal concerns, right?

283
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,900
 But anyway, she doesn't work with The Secret like they took her out of the documentary,

284
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,900
 but apparently it was kind of like a-- just a schism over long-term rights.

285
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,900
 It's just weird. And you guys hold the keys to reality,

286
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
 but you need to have this percentage of royalties. Whatever.

287
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,900
 I'm not knocking Esther Hicks. I don't know enough about Esther Hicks.

288
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,900
 But I did see this. I thought this was-- and maybe we'll go back and look at Esther Hicks

289
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,900
 if it turns out to be interesting, but I came across this.

290
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,900
 Now, again, it came from a space alien from 10,000 years ago,

291
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 but let's try it out. Let's try it out, because there are some interesting things in this.

292
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
 We're going to try to hack the universe right now.

293
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,900
 I want you for 17 seconds. Don't worry, I'll time it.

294
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,900
 If you don't pull out your-- well, stop watching. I'll time it.

295
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:22,900
 For 17 seconds, I want you to think of something only positive. Only positive.

296
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,900
 So say you want more money, or you want to be more successful at your job,

297
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
 or have more free time, or whatever.

298
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
 I want you to think of something for 17 seconds.

299
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,900
 So we're going to start right now.

300
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:50,900
 [no audio]

301
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,900
 Now, it's incredibly difficult. And you may think, "Jason, no, it's not. I did it."

302
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:02,900
 We have a tendency within the first 10 seconds to think negatively.

303
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,900
 I don't want to have more money, but I have so many bills to pay.

304
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,900
 I would love to have that new car go on that cruise, but how am I going to afford it?

305
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
 I don't have any time.

306
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,900
 It's very, very hard to think positively for 17 seconds.

307
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,900
 But according to Abraham, the space alien I've done absolutely no research on,

308
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,900
 if you can think about something for 17 seconds, it's the--

309
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,900
 if you think of a purely positive thought with no contradictions or no negativity in it,

310
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
 it's equal to 2,000 hours of work.

311
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,900
 And you're just like, "Jason, do you actually believe that?"

312
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
 I don't know. I don't know.

313
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:44,900
 I do think it's interesting that it's very, very hard to think of something positively for 17 seconds.

314
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,900
 You have to train yourself to focus, focus, focus.

315
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,900
 And what's interesting is I was looking at this thing that Abraham Hicks was channeling.

316
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,900
 Ridiculous. I'm even considering this a legit source.

317
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,900
 But to start off as an exercise, don't think of "I want more money."

318
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,900
 Just think of "happy." "Happy." "Happy."

319
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,900
 Just keep thinking how happy you are.

320
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,900
 Start off a little base levels. Don't try to go for like the mega-millions thing.

321
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,900
 Just start off thinking, "I'm in a good mood. I'm in a really, really good mood.

322
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
 Today's a really, really good day."

323
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,900
 And it's funny because even as I'm saying that, I can feel the doubt creep in.

324
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,900
 It's very hard to think of a positive thought, especially about yourself for 17 seconds.

325
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:32,900
 But the goal isn't to just do it 17 seconds. You're supposed to do it for 68 seconds in four 17-second intervals.

326
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,900
 So you think of a positive thought for 17 seconds.

327
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,900
 And then you do it for another 17 seconds. And then you do it for another 17 seconds.

328
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
 So you kind of have to train your way up.

329
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,900
 Now, why 17 seconds, 68 seconds? You get into this weird, again, space numerology stuff.

330
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,900
 And I know I'm probably giving mixed messages because I'm like, "Hey guys, let's do this exercise."

331
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,900
 It might be super powerful, but I don't trust anything about where it came from.

332
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,900
 To be honest, I've done no research. Fair enough.

333
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,900
 But I think the fact that it's so difficult to do is what makes me think there might be something to it.

334
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,900
 So I want you guys to do that. I'm going to be doing that this weekend.

335
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,900
 I'm going to be setting aside 68 seconds a day. I know it's a long time.

336
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:25,900
 Let's set aside some time and really focus on something positive about yourself for 17 seconds.

337
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,900
 And then do it for another 17 seconds. And seeing how it is very, very difficult.

338
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,900
 Now, I won't be here to time you the whole time. You will eventually have to pull out a stopwatch.

339
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,900
 But I think that's an interesting exercise. And I think that is one way that you can...

340
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,900
 The big thing about law of attraction is it doesn't work.

341
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,900
 I ask so much to get this hot chick, but she doesn't know the time of day.

342
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,900
 It's really hard to use the law of attraction where it is affecting someone specific because their visual...

343
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,900
 They may be thinking for 17 seconds, "Oh my God, I hope they never call me again."

344
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,900
 So it's easier to do it with just kind of elemental forces.

345
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
 But so that's a little homework for this week.

346
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,900
 And I want you guys to do that. And I want you guys to try that out.

347
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,900
 But that is just a little taste of what I want to talk about when we're talking about hacking the universe.

348
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,900
 Let's go ahead, Newcombe. Let's fly into one of those black holes.

349
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
 We're actually headed back to Earth.

350
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 The helicopter is now flying over beautiful Hood River organ.

351
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
 Let's whip out our cell phones.

352
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,900
 So there's a new app out called Rando Nautica.

353
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,900
 And what's interesting... There's a couple of different interesting things about it.

354
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,900
 But I think one of the most interesting things, and again, this is part of the mystery that can be solved right away.

355
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
 I just need one person's help.

356
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,900
 I got a request to cover this story not too long ago.

357
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,900
 And I actually did a series of live streams where I was testing it.

358
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:53,900
 And then I went to do the story, and I couldn't find out who recommended this story.

359
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,900
 I looked all over Twitter, all through my email, all through YouTube, all through Instagram.

360
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
 Could not find who recommended me this story.

361
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
 And I was like, "I know someone, bro."

362
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:09,900
 I actually remembered seeing the logo of the app in my DMs, but I didn't know where it was at.

363
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,900
 And then I was calling me through all the stuff.

364
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
 I kept putting the story off. I was supposed to do the story last week.

365
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,900
 And then I came across a note I had written myself that said "Insta Nick 44."

366
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,900
 Which means Instagram. Someone on Instagram named Nick 44.

367
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,900
 I went to my DMs, wasn't there. I'm not friends with anyone named Nick 44.

368
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,900
 The account's gone. Q. Zarafin Music, whatever that thing's called.

369
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:40,900
 Now obviously Nick 44, if you listen to the show, you can go, "Oh, my account got deleted.

370
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,900
 I was doing this, that, or the other thing, or it got hacked or something like that."

371
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,900
 But as far as I can tell, Nick 44, I don't follow them. They don't follow me.

372
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
 I couldn't even find the account when I searched for it.

373
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:57,900
 Again, I am not in any way shape or form saying that Nick 44 sent me this from an alternate reality.

374
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,900
 And since I've used the Rando Nautica app in real life, I've shifted into one where Nick 44 doesn't exist.

375
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,900
 I am in no way saying that. I'm slightly implying it.

376
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,900
 But if Nick 44 gets back to me, and I can see the DM they sent me,

377
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
 because anyone can make up a fake Nick 44 account at this point.

378
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,900
 But maybe it was just an error on my part.

379
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,900
 But I am slightly implying that Nick 44 never existed in the first place.

380
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,900
 Nick 44, if you do exist in this reality, thank you for recommending this story.

381
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
 Also, John from Scar Group. We were talking about this as well.

382
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
 So I want to give him a shout out.

383
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
 But Rando Nautica. Let's take a look at this.

384
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,900
 This is an app where you pull it up on your phone and you go,

385
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,900
 "Bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits, beep!"

386
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,900
 And then you hit a button and it will give you a random location in your area.

387
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,900
 And the theory is you go there and you will see a bunny rabbit.

388
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,900
 Or an outline of a rabbit.

389
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
 Or a rabbit foot.

390
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
 Or a Volkswagen rabbit.

391
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,900
 Or a copy of 8 Mile on DVD.

392
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,900
 This is the theory behind Rando Nautica.

393
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,900
 And it gives you truly random places to go, because it uses quantum mechanics.

394
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,900
 It's not--or a quantum number generator, I think is the exact term.

395
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
 A quantum random number generator.

396
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,900
 They said a normal number generator does have some sort of pattern to it.

397
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,900
 But a quantum random number generator can truly take you to a completely random place.

398
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,900
 You can also do the opposite. You can go, "Bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits, bunny rabbits."

399
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,900
 And then it will send you to a place where there is likely no bunny rabbits, say Elmer Fudd's house.

400
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,900
 So it has an attractor setting. It has a void setting.

401
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 And it's become a hot new toy among millennials in Generation Z and Podcast hosts.

402
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
 And really anyone who has a smartphone.

403
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
 There's been a couple articles written about this.

404
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
 What's interesting was I said this earlier.

405
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,900
 I had come across this story months ago before Nick 44 slipped into our reality and told me about it.

406
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,900
 But what I had heard it described as is something totally different than what it is now.

407
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
 Which I find another odd thing.

408
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,900
 But let's look at what it is now.

409
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
 Let's look at what it supposedly is now.

410
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,900
 You think about something, you go to the location on the app, you'll see it.

411
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,900
 You have a whole subreddit dedicated to these people.

412
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,900
 They'll say, "I was thinking of something unexplainable."

413
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
 They go out to the location, there's a chair in the middle of a field.

414
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,900
 What a super unexplainable bunch of upvotes.

415
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,900
 I thought of the Illuminati. This is actually a real one.

416
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,900
 I thought of the Illuminati and I went out in the field.

417
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
 This has to be a joke, but he got the upvotes.

418
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
 People thought it was real.

419
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,900
 Or I assumed that humanity is not as insane as it is.

420
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
 This guy was thinking about the Illuminati.

421
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:47,900
 He went out in the field and he took videotape of a smashed watermelon and a slice of pizza.

422
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
 And I go, "What is a watermelon?"

423
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
 "What do either of these things have to do with the Illuminati?"

424
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,900
 "Ahh, I'm not... Apparently I haven't taken enough red pills."

425
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,900
 "A slice of pizza looks like a what?"

426
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,900
 Triangle. I don't know what the watermelon has to do with anything, but...

427
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
 "Got a bunch of upvotes."

428
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,900
 So, I don't want to knock the people who invented randonautica too much.

429
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,900
 Obviously they can make this app. It's really cool. It's free.

430
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
 It'll allow you to have a nice walk.

431
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,900
 You'll see the reddit. It's just stuff like that.

432
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,900
 One guy goes, "I was out with my sister. I hadn't even opened the app yet."

433
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
 And an owl flew out of a tree.

434
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,900
 And then I walked by another tree and there was a photo of a baby in it.

435
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,900
 I'm like, "That's... That's...

436
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,900
 First off, where do you expect owls to fly from?"

437
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
 Right?

438
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
 That's not super weird.

439
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,900
 And then, yeah, he took a picture of like a birch tree.

440
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,900
 And in the birch tree is a photo of a newborn baby.

441
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,900
 Now, to be fair, that is weird. That is weird.

442
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
 But it doesn't... I mean, think...

443
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
 He hasn't even used the app yet.

444
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
 He's just walking on the street and he sees all this stuff.

445
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,900
 Again, the owl flying out of the tree, that's totally normal.

446
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,900
 I've seen that if you keep it vague, if you think of sunshine

447
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,900
 and you go outside and the sun's in the sky, or if you think of beauty or hope,

448
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
 but those are all too vague, right?

449
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,900
 You can walk anywhere. You can think of hope and walk into a Walmart and be like,

450
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
 "I hope my car doesn't get broken into..."

451
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
 And ta-da! There you go.

452
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
 So, you have all this different stuff.

453
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
 What's weird about this? What's super weird about this,

454
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,900
 other than the fact that people are taking photographs of slices of pizza in the woods?

455
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
 Is that this is not the app.

456
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,900
 This is not what I was originally told it was for.

457
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
 Now, again, when I was doing the research for this story,

458
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,900
 I could not find where I had originally found my sources.

459
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
 So it could be, one, sloppy note keeping.

460
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
 It's very likely that.

461
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,900
 Two, I slipped into an alternate dimension.

462
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,900
 Three, the reason for the program changed, because the technology changed.

463
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,900
 Or four, the reason for the program changed, because it's supposed to truly be hidden.

464
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,900
 Now, out of those four, it's most likely bad note taking, right?

465
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,900
 We gotta be honest.

466
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,900
 I probably found the information first and then didn't write down my source,

467
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
 and here we are.

468
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,900
 What's interesting is none of the current stuff involving Rando Nautica,

469
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
 I could not find this replicated.

470
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,900
 This is how I was originally told this program was supposed to work.

471
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,900
 Before Nick 44 got ahold of me, this was months ago.

472
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,900
 There is nothing random in life.

473
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,900
 Let's say you go out for a walk. You're walking on the street.

474
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,900
 Your goal is to walk to Burrito Barn.

475
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,900
 And as you're walking to Burrito Barn, you go,

476
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
 "You know what? I'm gonna take a left here."

477
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
 I never really take a left, but I'm gonna take a left here.

478
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
 It's a longer walk, but it's really nice.

479
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,900
 Maybe you find a shiny nickel on the ground.

480
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,900
 Next time you're going to Burrito Barn, you decide,

481
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
 "You know what? I'm gonna take a left."

482
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,900
 No, no, I'm gonna keep going straight, and that little bit of a divergence there

483
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
 may have changed something.

484
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,900
 But none of that is random, right?

485
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
 Those are you still making decisions.

486
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,900
 That's still the universe wanting you to find that nickel that day,

487
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
 or to hesitate on your decision the next day.

488
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,900
 That's the universe setting things out for you.

489
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,900
 The way that I was told Randonautica originally worked,

490
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,900
 and it actually wasn't even being called Randonautica at that point.

491
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
 The app didn't exist, or it wasn't available to the public

492
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
 when I first started looking into this,

493
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,900
 was this was a way to hack the universe.

494
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
 The universe has a plan for all of us,

495
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,900
 and all of those little decisions you make during the day

496
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
 are part of the plan.

497
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,900
 I tried recording this episode about 9 o'clock this morning,

498
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
 but there was a bunch of noise in the neighborhood,

499
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,900
 and I put it aside and played Minecraft and ate lunch,

500
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,900
 and played some more Minecraft, and here I am!

501
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,900
 But that was the universe's plan for me to be recording the episode right now,

502
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,900
 when it's 80 degrees and I'm dripping with sweat.

503
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,900
 But none of those events were random, it was all planned out that way.

504
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,900
 The way that I originally came across Randonautica was this.

505
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
 Because you were using true randomness,

506
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,900
 because you were using a quantum random number generator,

507
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,900
 you were doing something that the universe could not expect.

508
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,900
 The universe could predict you to download the app,

509
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
 and the universe could predict you to hit that button,

510
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,900
 but the universe could not predict the quantum numbers

511
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,900
 that assigned you to go to a location.

512
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,900
 It gave you--the first time I saw it, I did not come across anything with--

513
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
 you think about something and it takes you there,

514
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,900
 the goal was you would go someplace completely random,

515
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,900
 the universe did not expect you in that moment there.

516
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
 It was a way to hack the universe,

517
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,900
 it was a way to basically glitch out the universe.

518
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,900
 If you could outthink, outsmart, outlast reality,

519
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,900
 what would happen?

520
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,900
 But it's weird because I can't find--

521
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
 I'm not saying that people still aren't saying that today,

522
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,900
 but when I'm looking at the main sources for Randonautica and Randonauts,

523
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,900
 they're talking about finding slices of pizza and owls flying around.

524
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,900
 I'm not seeing anyone saying, at least the popular ones,

525
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
 again these things could be out there,

526
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:15,900
 but they're not, that using this app can break reality.

527
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
 Because reality has a plan for you

528
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:23,900
 and you're throwing in quantum mechanics to that plan.

529
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,900
 Now I will admit, after I did the livestream experience

530
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,900
 and I was doing these going on this random walk,

531
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,900
 it was assigning me to these random locations, places that I don't go normally at all.

532
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,900
 And then, what, like a day or two later, there was supposed to be a riot in Hood River?

533
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
 Which is completely out of character for Hood River,

534
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,900
 it's kind of in character for me, but it's completely weird for this town.

535
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,900
 I remember thinking, did I crack reality?

536
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,900
 No, no, no, and I would tell myself, no, no.

537
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,900
 This is just something that's happening right now.

538
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,900
 I mean, let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

539
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,900
 Let's talk about that this is what the app can actually do.

540
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,900
 It can actually send you to a location that the universe did not expect you there at that time.

541
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,900
 It has no preloaded assets for you to do or experience.

542
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
 So it's basically doing stuff on the fly.

543
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:32,900
 The idea is that the universe rewards you for your exploration.

544
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,900
 You're basically clipping through the walls of reality and it's rewarding you with that.

545
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,900
 It's the law of attraction in a sense, but you're not necessarily attracting anything.

546
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,900
 In particular, you're attracting new experiences.

547
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,900
 You're letting the universe know, hey man, I'm ready to push the bounds, what you got, what you got from me.

548
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,900
 And when I was looking at the early reports of this a couple months ago,

549
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,900
 people were saying their lives had changed for the better.

550
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,900
 Again, that could be completely anecdotal.

551
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,900
 It's definitely anecdotal, that could be completely confirmation bias is what I mean to say.

552
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,900
 If you do something in your life gets better, you may always think of the machine when I did it,

553
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,900
 and all of a sudden there was armed men in the city.

554
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
 And I was like, what in the world is going on?

555
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,900
 Because I did this is that why this threat happened here on this particular day.

556
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,900
 Now, it could obviously be confirmation bias.

557
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,900
 Some people though, occasionally you would see a report online where people would say, don't do this, don't do this.

558
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,900
 Ever since I did this, my life has been terrible.

559
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,900
 And to be honest, that kind of made me hesitate on running the program when I first got it.

560
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,900
 First off, I had just done an episode about a guy who had an Uber, an app on his device,

561
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,900
 and ended up causing a mass shooting because he got possessed by a devil.

562
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,900
 And I think two days later I was like, hey, I'm going to try this new app. Boop.

563
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,900
 But it did make me concerned because you would occasionally very rarely get a report of someone saying,

564
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,900
 don't use this app. It made my life worse.

565
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,900
 What's interesting is that if you hack the universe there's no guarantee that your hack will be beneficial.

566
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,900
 Just like if you're hacking a video game, you could hack a video game, put an aimbot,

567
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,900
 put an x-ray vision and all this stuff.

568
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:19,900
 But it's also no guarantee that you do the hack wrong and it crashes the game and makes it unplayable.

569
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,900
 You are seeing lots of people tell these reports of them doing it and having these great experiences afterwards.

570
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,900
 They're getting jobs. I mean, that was what was weird about it.

571
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,900
 That was the overwhelming amount of resources I saw back then.

572
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,900
 And again, they may still exist now, but they're not talking about it on the reddit.

573
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,900
 They're talking about mirrors and slices of pizza and chairs in the middle of nowhere.

574
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:46,900
 So with our conspiracy caps fully on our head, you have to wonder is this app designed to hack reality?

575
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,900
 And when it was being used by a select group of people and their lives were benefiting from it,

576
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,900
 did people go, this is great. This could be really helpful.

577
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:02,900
 But then as it got released to the masses, weird things started happening, bad things started happening.

578
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,900
 Reality began to crack.

579
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,900
 Now it's just an app so you can find bunny rabbits or pictures of babies in trees.

580
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:16,900
 If the app was designed to hack reality and it was hacking reality,

581
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,900
 you think you would still want to--that would be a selling point, right?

582
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,900
 Everyone could be a god. Everyone's lives could be better.

583
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:30,900
 But if it turns out that on average, it's not everyone's lives better and there's a small group of people who kind of mess things up.

584
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:37,900
 Because here's the thing. There's little hacks you can do for the universe where you sit and you concentrate for 17 seconds or 68 seconds

585
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:46,900
 or do visualization like Wallace Waddles, follow the secret, things like that, little hacks that you can do to make your life better.

586
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:54,900
 That's one thing, but to actually try to defeat the universe at its own game is something far more dangerous.

587
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:02,900
 Because whether or not you like it, the universe has a plan for you. It figured it out and it figured out your piece, your little tiny piece,

588
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:09,900
 and how it relates to supernovas on the edge of the universe. Like everything is interconnected like that.

589
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,900
 And if you can figure out a way to upset that plan, who knows what you're doing.

590
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,900
 One, the plan the universe has set out for you may have a great ending, not just for you but for the people around you.

591
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:28,900
 And you've all of a sudden thrown a wrench into that. And that may mess up the plan for you and for the people around you.

592
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:36,900
 But if millions of people start throwing wrenches into the machinery over the course of a few months, who knows what will happen to reality?

593
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:43,900
 The universe has a plan. It might not be the most fun plan for you, but it has a plan.

594
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,900
 It has a plan that was crafted before reality even began.

595
00:35:50,900 --> 00:36:02,900
 And if you can corrupt that plan with an app that you download from the Google Store, things are going to get really weird, really fast.

596
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:13,900
 Is Randall Nautica a harmless app? Or is it the last app that humanity will ever download?
