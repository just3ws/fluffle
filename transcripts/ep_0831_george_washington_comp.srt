00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 It's Presidents Day, the day where you don't have to work if you work at a bank, and we're going to take a look at a story where is it possible that ghosts actually built this nation?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And then we fast forward 245 years to take a look at America today, where we take a look at some absolutely bizarre, disgusting, true crimes.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And we'll make you rethink the first story, should America exist at all, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Garviner. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's Presidents Day. Everyone, stop what you're doing right now and salute a flag, preferably an American one.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 But if you're not around an American one, you can just salute a dude named Flag.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 But someone who we should always salute for their duty to this country. I don't even know where this person lives.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 A long time Patreon supporter, a long time listener of the show, one of our legacy Patreon guys.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Come on in and give a salute and a round of applause to T-Mad.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 [Applause]

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Salute and clap. That's a feat of engineering.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 T-Mad, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Now T-Mad, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We're going to drive all the way out to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 [Burps]

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Driving this old-timey car out there.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And it's July 2nd, 1863. This is in the height of the Battle of Gettysburg.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 You just thought we were going to walk around like gravesites and like throw old rusty bullets at each other? No.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 We are in the trenches. I don't think they had trenches back then. I think they just kind of walked into bullets.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Did they build trenches back then? I'm sure they did. I'm sure somebody did. I'm sure trenches were invented by 1863.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 This is July 2nd, 1863. The Battle of Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Over 50,000 Americans were killed in this battle.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And that number seems high. It's possible that I wrote that number down wrong because that seems insane.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 But anyways, 50,000 Americans died during this battle. It went on for a couple days.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 If you don't know American history, the Union, the North was like, "No more slaves."

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And you can't do all this crazy stuff. And the South is like, "More slaves, more slaves."

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But it's July 2nd, 1863.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And what happens is there's this Union general and they're watching this big battle.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 People are getting shot. Some guys trying to dig a trench real quick.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 They're like, "What are you doing?" He's like, "I don't know. I don't know. Let's just try this."

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 People are getting shot. Cannonballs are like rolling across the field, like crushing people's legs.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And then like doctors were doing amputation super fast and like throwing limbs or either juggling them.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 You know what would have been cool if like doctors went undercover?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Like you had a Union doctor and he's like, "Oh dude, I'm going to dress up as a Confederate."

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And I'm going to run across the battlefield really, really quick. Hopefully I don't get shot by my own people.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And now I'm a Confederate doctor and when they're bringing people into the tent and they're like,

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 "Oh, my left leg got blown up. I would cut off their right leg instead."

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And you would do that. You just do that all day long. No one even notices what's going on.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 They're like, "That's weird. His left leg is clearly mangled by a cannonball. Why'd you remove the right leg?"

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 You're like, "I don't know."

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 What's really going on in my Civil War fan fiction is you have this Union general dude and he's like,

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 "Okay, so we're watching this battle happening here at Gettysburg, but there are these hills nearby called the round tops."

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And this guy's looking at this map, like topographical map thingy, and he goes,

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 "Dude, we need to get those hills."

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Like I realize now those hills are like covered in trees, so it's great cover.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And they overlook the entire battlefield.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Whoever takes the round tops are really going to win this battle and possibly the war.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 We don't have any troops left.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 So the 20th main division under the command of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain is ordered to go take the round tops.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 They're like, "Okay." So they're like walking through the dirt and stuff like that.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And then the sun goes down and it's super dark.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So the moon is out though and they can barely see and I'm sure there's still like bullets.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Like you can still hear battle and people dying.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You hear some guy going, "No, no, not my right leg. It's my left leg that's wounded."

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 The 20th main division's walking through the dark and they realize their maps are outdated.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And they come to a fork in the road and they're like, "Ugh, which way do we go?"

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 It's almost as if the outcome of this battle, no, the outcome of this war depends on whether or not we go right or left.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But luckily another Union soldier shows up on horseback.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 [laughs]

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And he's like, "Go this way. This is the way to the round tops."

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And they're like, "Oh, okay. We'll totally trust you."

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And they notice something odd about him. He was wearing a tricorner hat, which that was like old school at that point.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 That was like a Revolutionary War hat, but they're like, "Okay. I mean, if he's giving us the right instructions, who cares what type of hat he has?"

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So they go the way that this dude's like, "Go this way." And he's like walking on his horse and they're like, "Oh, thanks."

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And they get to the round tops. It actually was the correct place.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 But then the Confederates, I guess they finally checked their maps and realized that the round tops were essential to winning this battle.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So they're like, "Go take your min and take that hill. Go up. Go, go, go, go."

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So all these Confederates are running up to the round tops and the 20th main are shooting at them.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 There's like smoke everywhere, gunpowder, super-smelling stuff. People are like, "Ah, getting shot in the stomach."

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And this goes on for quite a while. It goes on for so long.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 The 20th main division, they're running out of ammo.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 So they're like, "Oh, no. Like this totally sucks, but we can't let them take this hill."

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Even if it means that all of us die now, we can't let them take this hill.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So Colonel Joshua Chamberlain says, "Fix bayonets, boys. We're gonna run down this hill into Confederate gunfire and we're just gonna stab them to death."

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 The chances of them actually being able to pull this off successfully is pretty low.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 But what else are you gonna do? You're running out of ammo. They're coming up the hill. Maybe you can psych them out.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And at that point, the Union dude who showed up, who told them which way to go, he comes back on his horse.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And they're like, "Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah."

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And what happened was when they got up to Round Top, they really stopped paying attention to this guy on the horse.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 They didn't really think much of it. They got to where they're supposed to go. These are battle-hardened veterans.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 They're not wondering who was that magnificent stranger. They're like, "That was nice. Let's dig in and shoot at people."

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But he's back at their darkest moment. Like, they're literally putting the bayonets, tighten them on the end of the gun,

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 and they're like, "Ah, they're like, twicking out little old pictures of their family and kissing it and putting it back in their pocket,

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and some guys like smoking his last cigar. Ah, I'll be with you soon, pop pop."

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And this dude shows up on this horse and he rallies them in.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 You have this general with this funny-looking hat.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And, if that's not enough, if you ever need to do something, if you're ever feeling down and going, "I don't know if this will be successful."

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Imagine a dude showing up in a funny-looking hat, a tricorner hat. It wasn't just that that got the spirit moving in them.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 He pulled out his sword, his little saber, and it was on fire.

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And as the Union soldiers are watching this man on the horse with the flaming sword, they realize this isn't a Union general.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 This is George Washington's ghost.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 So, they're like, "Okay, whatever happens now is going to be totally awesome, right?"

95
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 George Washington, first president in the United States, hero of the Revolutionary War, the man with the wooden teeth.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 They're all inspecting his ghost mouth. They're like, "Do you really have wooden teeth? Are your wooden teeth also part of being a ghost?"

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Or, "Did you get back your regular teeth?" He's like, "Get out of here."

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 We are ready to fight. Apparently, he said something like bayonets, fixed charge.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And that's... we'll dissect that in a second, but what we know for sure, well, George Washington's ghost showed up on the round top, on his horse with the flaming sword,

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 and leads the men into battle. And at this point, the 20th main division, they're like, "Worse case scenario, I die next to George Washington's ghost."

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And I'm sure he knows all the coolest places in heaven to hang out.

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Best case scenario, George Washington's ghost smashes the Confederate line and the Union wins. The war, everything the United States has saved.

103
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And those young men with their bayonets fixed ran down that hill and it was so terrifying to the Confederates, they retreated. They're like, "We're out of here."

104
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Because again, the cops took a while to reload. If you shot at a dude coming at you with a bayonet and you missed, you're dead.

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And it wasn't just one dude, it was a whole army of guys coming down.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 The Union held the round tops, the Union won the battle of Gettysburg, the Union, spoiler alert, won the Civil War.

107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And this story is interesting, this story is real, it's not an urban legend.

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 This actually happened, the question is what phenomenon actually happened. There's no doubt.

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 This isn't one of those things where I found this story online in some old newspaper.

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 No, this actually was a story that was going around at the time.

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 The Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, the Secretary of War for Abraham Lincoln, opened an investigation into this.

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 After the war, you're all hearing these stories about George Washington's ghost show up.

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 They investigated this and one of the people that they talked to was Colonel Joshua Chamberlain. He was there.

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Hundreds of people saw this apparition.

115
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The stories where he gave the orders to fix bayonets in charge, that I could not find an official version of.

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I saw that mentioned on a couple of websites. The order to fix bayonets was actually before he showed up.

117
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So I don't think he actually said anything. Maybe he winked or gave a little finger guns, little finger muskets.

118
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 There's this quote going around that Colonel Joshua Chamberlain said, quote, "We know not what mystic power may be possessed by those who are now bio-vacking with the dead."

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I tried to look that up, that it's like a temporary place you hang out with.

120
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We know not what mystic power may be possessed by those who are now bio-vacking with the dead.

121
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I only know the effect, but I dare not explain or deny the cause.

122
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Who shall say that Washington was not among the number of those who aided the country that he founded?

123
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Official statement from the Colonel who was there, but you'll see that quote a lot of places.

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 However, he did say that, but it is out of context. I thought this was really, really interesting.

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 I found out about this story from my favorite book, Haunted Places, the National Directory.

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I always recommend you guys buy a copy. It's not a referral link. You can check in the show notes and buy it.

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 I make nothing from it. It's just such a good book.

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 That quote is in there. "We know not what mystic power may be possessed."

129
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 He did actually say that, however, he said something right ahead of it.

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 A couple sentences before to give a context. He didn't believe it. He didn't believe it.

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 It's very interesting. He said yes. That report circulated through our lines,

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 and I have no doubt that it inspired the men. Doubtless, it was a superstition.

133
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And then he kind of goes, "But, you know, we know not what mystic power..."

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 So he didn't believe that it happened.

135
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 He did say he heard something. He goes, "Whether it's earthly or unearthly, he didn't really know."

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 He's just heard these stories and he kind of, like, halfway believes it.

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 But at the end of the day, it was a superstition, a very helpful superstition, because it rallied the men.

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 But they really did investigate this. This was a rumor that was going on for a long, long time.

139
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 What's interesting is this is hard to find. I read it in the book, and I really, really had to look.

140
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Like, you have to. All the links are in the show notes.

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 But when you type in "George Washington's Ghost," Gettysburg, a lot of it is just like,

142
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 "Oh, here's George Washington's Ghost walking around his family cabin. Here's George Washington's Ghost doing this, doing that."

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 This story was kind of hard to find, and I started to think, "Well, maybe it is an urban legend."

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 So a fascinating story, and what it makes me wonder is how often do ghosts involve themselves in global affairs?

145
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Like, yeah, we get it. Ghosts are knocking over chairs in your bedroom or standing behind you when you get out of the shower

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 and you look in the mirror, there's just some, like, mutilated woman going, "Uhhh..."

147
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 You know, that's all well and good, right?

148
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 But does Bloody Mary ever vote?

149
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Like, do ghosts ever find themselves embroiled in world affairs?

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Like, are there...we have the United Nations, and then there's like, the United Nations of ghosts.

151
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Because they couldn't come up with a better name, and there's a bunch of like, ghost leaders floating around,

152
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 and they're like, "Maybe we should do, like, more of what George Washington did. Maybe we should go fight battles for people,"

153
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 and stuff like that. I don't know. Like, I would imagine not.

154
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I would imagine not. Otherwise, all of our wars would be ghost-related. We keep, like, fighting over cemeteries.

155
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 We're like, "Why have we fought for so long over who gets to hold this cemetery? There's, like, oil reserves that are needed."

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But this ghost showed up, right? If this story is true, and it does seem like it, and this is a paranormal podcast, we believe in ghosts, but...

157
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 If George Washington showed up to this battle, weren't there, like, dead southern generals?

158
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 They probably died, and they were like, "Oh, man, I probably picked the wrong sign on this one."

159
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 As they're, like, floating away, they're like, "Uh... Probably shouldn't have been part of the South."

160
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 They're probably immediately, like, regretted. They're walking through Heaven, and people are like, "Oh, man, did you see that guy?

161
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 He was trying to uphold slavery." And you're like, "Oh, come on, man."

162
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Anyways, that probably played a part in it, but yeah, it's interesting. Do ghosts. How many other war stories have been won because of a ghost?

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And then you think, I think even a more interesting question, have there ever been wars lost by a ghost?

164
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Like, everyone's doing really well, and a ghost shows up, and it's like, Vaughn Wilheim II or something like that, and he's like,

165
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 "I was the ghost of the leader during World War I, and I will help you out during World War II."

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 His eyes are shifting from side to side, the Germans are like, "Yay! The ghost is on our side!"

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And then he makes them lose. He's like, "Yeah, maybe if you invade Russia... Maybe if you invade Russia during winter, everything will work out."

168
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 A-okay. Because yeah, would the ghosts be like, "Uh, we're headed down the wrong path."

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Very, very interesting. Very, very interesting story. How often do ghosts interfere in world affairs?

170
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I guess the only way we'll know is by starting massive wars over graveyards.

171
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 T-Mad, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind the Battle of Gettysburg.

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 We are headed all the way out to Louisiana.

173
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 If you currently have like, your kids sitting next to you and you're like, "Hey, Jason's telling a historical story about how the nation was saved by George Washington's ghost."

174
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Come over here, kids. Let's all sit in front of... Let's all sit in front of my MP3 player with a little ball speaker on top of it, and listen to this uplifting tale.

175
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 If that has happened, get him out of the room now. Push him out of the room. Ah! Get him away.

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Because these next stories, plural, they're short. They're insanely weird.

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Originally, these are stories that I was going to talk about on my TikTok, but my TikTok would get shut down.

178
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 TikTok has a very, very, very strict policy about content, which I've run afoul of a couple times.

179
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Stuff that I've talked about on this show, I put it on TikTok and they're like, "We're blocking your account for seven days, dude."

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So they want to let me run this stuff, but it's so bizarre. And it makes you think like George Washington saved the day,

181
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 but then you look at these stories and you're like, "What is wrong with the people here in America?"

182
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Livingston, Parish, Louisiana. There's a husband and a wife living there. We have Cynthia Perkins and Dennis Perkins.

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 What a couple. These people, upstanding pillars of the community. Cynthia's a schoolteacher and Dennis is a sheriff's deputy.

184
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And you go, "That's cool, right? I mean, you wouldn't want to live next to these guys. They'd probably be a total nightmare to live next to these two."

185
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You got a cop and a teacher living together. I couldn't find exactly what grade she taught.

186
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 What happened was these two people recently got arrested for pedophilia stuff, right? And it was like manufacturing it.

187
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And I guess Dennis was sleeping with some 13-year-old girl or something like that. So that's super gr-- That alone, right?

188
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Lock them up, get rid of them. But what makes the story even more bizarre is that I don't know how they figured this out.

189
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I'm assuming she confessed to it. But Cynthia, she pled guilty to these charges. She's facing 41 years in prison for all of this stuff that they've done.

190
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 But one of the things that she mentioned, or one of the things the cops figured out, was Cynthia made cupcakes.

191
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And that's not against the law right of bakers listening to this episode. They're like, "Oh no, am I going to get arrested?"

192
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Cynthia one day made cupcakes, but she had her husband ejaculate into the-- I know that went from 0 to 60 real quick.

193
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 She had her husband ejaculate into the batter making the cupcakes. And then she served them to her students.

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 That's so weird to me. I don't understand how someone could get off-- Like, were they doing it as a prank? I assume it was sexual, right?

195
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 How would you get off on that? Who knows? I remember a long time ago, I came across this story. It wasn't just me. It was national news.

196
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Some dude, he was like a music teacher in California. I'm just going off my memory. I haven't pulled up the article recently, but I'll put it in the show notes.

197
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I'm like, "Shay, great. Thank you. Something else for me to avoid." In your show notes, there was a music teacher in California who was masturbating on flutes and then giving them to his students.

198
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Crazy, right? People are nuts. People are nuts. But you have George Washington going, "That's gross, but the justice system is taking care of those sickos."

199
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And we'll take care of that. Jason, of course I want America to still be here. Well, hold on to your dry cornered hat, George Washington.

200
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Because, T-Mad, let's get back in that carbonic cocktail war headed out to Van Buren County, Michigan.

201
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Van Buren County, Michigan. This just happened last year. But then there was a new wrinkle to this case. Van Buren County, Michigan were in the Hamilton Township.

202
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And that's the near the Oak Shores campground. September 20th, 2021. Melody Rower, 64 year old woman. She's jogging down the street.

203
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 She loves jogging. They didn't say that in the article, but I don't think anyone jogs if they hate it.

204
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But, like, a lot of tragic stories. It starts off with her not coming home when she's supposed to come home and friends and family are missing her.

205
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Call the authorities. The authorities go and are tracking things, trying to figure out where she might have been.

206
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And they notice that her cell phone is pinging at a local Walmart. Now, at this point it's the next day. It's September 21st, 2021.

207
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 The police go out and they're following the phone and they find it in the possession of one Colby Martin, 29 year old dude.

208
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 This guy, you should look at his photos in the show notes. He basically looks like the Chad meme, like the giga Chad meme.

209
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 He's a good looking dude, which makes the story even weirder. Right? Strong chin, good bone structure.

210
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 He goes, "Yeah, sorry, I have this phone of this woman who's been missing." Why did he take the phone? This story's so nuts.

211
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 "Yeah, I know I have this phone and I left it on and you were able to ping it." I answered it a couple of times. I answered it and I go, "Hello."

212
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, this is the police. Who's this?" And I hung up.

213
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And the cops go, "Hey, so what happened? We got this missing woman." He goes, "Oh, okay. I'll tell you what happened."

214
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 You see, I'm standing right next to my F-150 truck and you notice that it is completely dented up.

215
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, we did notice that." He goes, "Yeah, so what happened was yesterday I was driving on the road and I accidentally hit this woman.

216
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And it freaked me out, right? You should never, ever, ever leave the scene of an accident.

217
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Ever, ever, ever leave the scene of an accident. It always makes it worse.

218
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Unless you think you can get away with it." No, I'm just joking. Never, ever, ever leave the scene of an accident.

219
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I had, he was an acquaintance who did that. Not good. No, the sentence became way worse.

220
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 I think it was a friend of a friend, but he was also visiting. He was also visiting Los Angeles and ended up in LA County Jail.

221
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And he was terrified. Terrified. He had never been in trouble in his life and the very first time he's in jail is in LA County Jail.

222
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Anyways, I don't know how that story ended. I just know that he really got messed up because he kept driving.

223
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Never leave the scene of a crime. He said, "I was driving down the road and I hit this woman and I totally freaked out.

224
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 I didn't know what to do. So I dragged her body off into the bushes and got back in my car and drove away."

225
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So the police go, "Do you remember where the body's at?" He's, "Yeah, yeah, totally. I remember where the body's at."

226
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And he takes the cops back out there and they go through the bushes a bit and he goes, "Here she is."

227
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And there, of course, was the body, the dead body of Melody Rower.

228
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So he gets charged with hit and run, vehicular manslaughter, leaving the scene of a crime. I guess that was a hit and run.

229
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 No, I think that is actually two different charges. And concealment of a corpse, concealment of a dead body.

230
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 So he's facing all these charges and the judge says you can have bail.

231
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Bail said it's $300,000 and he's able to pay bail.

232
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 So probably got a bail. Bondsman paid 10%. Came up with $30,000 somehow and walks.

233
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Cops are investigating all this stuff. This all happened back in September, right?

234
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I don't know what led the cops to look even more into this because, again, it's a hit and run, right?

235
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It's a case closed. Like, he paid bail but they know this guy's gonna get some time.

236
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 The car was damaged. He had her phone. He showed them where the body was. Cut and dry case.

237
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 But the police, something must have cued him off on the autopsy because the police started investigating him more.

238
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 They're getting these warrants and apparently they're able to check his internet search history.

239
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And they go, "Hmm, okay, maybe we should just stop investigating this now and just pretend we didn't see what was on the internet."

240
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 What they found was the day she was hit by the car, which they know is September 20th,

241
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 a couple hours after he said the accident happened, he went home.

242
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Actually, he was living with his girlfriend at the time. He goes to his girlfriend's house and he is searching for and watching necrophiliac pornography.

243
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Cops are like, "Oh, man, which is the rest of the people who made this website as well."

244
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 A couple hours after this car accident, he's searching up porn where they're having sex with dead women or women who are unconscious pretending to be dead.

245
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 That is a weird fetish that people have. I remember I was reading this book a long time ago. It was about the serial killer.

246
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 He would have his girlfriends take really, really cold baths and then they'd get in bed and would be emotionalists and he would have sex with them.

247
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I remember the one girlfriend was saying, "I knew what he was trying to do. I knew he was pretending I was dead."

248
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That was his fetish. Totally creeped her out. I think she stayed with him for a couple years, but yeah, she knew what he was trying to emulate, the cold feel of a dead body.

249
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I don't remember who that serial killer was. I read that years ago.

250
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 He's watching necrophiliac porn and then the police are like, "Okay, so now we might have a motive. Maybe this was an accidental."

251
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Or maybe he hit this woman accidentally and dragged her body into the bushes and goes, "Well, now I have a new fetish."

252
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And then went home to watch necrophiliac porn.

253
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 The police keep digging into this and they actually go through his trash cans, which is public property.

254
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 I could go digging through your trash right out in the front of your yard.

255
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Once you put it in the trash, it is public property. Anyone can dig through it.

256
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 So they start digging through it and they find used condoms, plural, they find used condoms and they take them back to the lab and eventually they get a search warrant for his car.

257
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And they find used condoms in his car, plural, again, with his DNA in it, obviously, and Melody's DNA on the condoms.

258
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 So they're like, did he rape her and then hit her with the car?

259
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And at this point, the captain walks in and goes, "Please stop talking about this. Please stop talking about this in the middle of my police station."

260
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And here's probably, this is why I'm captain, here's probably what happened. He's a necrophiliac and he hit her on purpose with the car, dragged her off into the bushes and had sex with her dead body.

261
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Go arrest this freak. Please, quit investigating it. We know he's a weirdo. Go arrest him. They did. They just showed up like a week ago.

262
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 He's sitting at his girlfriend's house and a bunch of cops break in and arrest him for murder. This is not a hit and run charge anymore.

263
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It's first degree premeditated murder. They are saying he killed this woman with his car on purpose to the reason why he did this was to have a dead body to have sex with.

264
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 He brought the condoms. He had it planned out whether or not she was a specific target or just a target of opportunity they have not revealed yet.

265
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 But he was driving on that road. He ran over a woman to kill her and then dragged her out in the bushes and had sex with her dead body.

266
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 That might be one of the worst true crime stories I've come across in a long time.

267
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And I read a ton of this stuff. I know I'm always coming at you with the funny ghost stories or the creepy alien stories.

268
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I read more, pound for pound, I read more true crime articles than everything else put together.

269
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 It's a truly, truly terrifying story and it almost feels like it feels like things are accelerating.

270
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 It feels like the true crime is getting worse.

271
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Now yes, there's been necrophiliax serial killers in the past.

272
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 But I don't know, there's just something about, I don't know, I imagine like necrophiliax serial killers like poison people or stab them a bit.

273
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Enough to kill them, but then you're like, "Aha, a dead body to have sex with."

274
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Versus hitting it with a car. There's a lot of damage that's done to a body when he hit it with a car.

275
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Like, ugh, you know what I mean? I'm not saying it's okay to have sex with a hot dead body,

276
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 but hitting someone with a car and then dragging them out into the bushes and having sex multiple times with the corpse.

277
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 In broad daylight, seems like an escalation over like some serial killer from like the 1970s

278
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 who's stabbing people with a long knife right through the heart and they die pretty quickly and then having sex with their body.

279
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I'm sure they're both disgusting. I'm not excusing that dude from the 70s.

280
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Oh, he's just a product of his time. It feels like the true crime is getting worse.

281
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Now is it so bad, like I said in my intro, that America shouldn't be around? No.

282
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 This is a minority of the populace that are making these cupcakes and stabbing people and all this stuff, or not stabbing people, running them over with cars.

283
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 It's a minority of the population, but it's just, it feels like things are getting worse.

284
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 It feels like things are accelerating in the true crime angle and it kind of makes me think, what's next?

285
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Like, what, do not send me suggestions, but what's next? How bad are things going to get? People are becoming more perverse.

286
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 So I ask now, where are you, Mr. George Washington? How come you're not here saving us today?

287
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I'm sure Gettysburg, Pivotal Battle, a bunch of people died and the Union won, but George, imagine how much help you could be when like there's a serial killer walking down an alleyway with a hatchet,

288
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 and then they see like a flaming light behind him and they turn around and it's you on your horse with a flaming sword.

289
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Right? Do you think that guy's going to be a serial killer anymore?

290
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Maybe, maybe he has some deep-seated mental issues, but he's not going to kill someone that night.

291
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Right? Imagine you have like a bunch of kids at the club, they're hanging out, and some guys like, oh dude, let's rob this place.

292
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 It's such a fun club. I want to own it forever. And they go to like rob it and they're going to do like a takeover robbery and shoot all these people, and then George Washington shows up.

293
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Like the music drops and then there's just like George standing there with a flaming sword and they're like, hey, who's that old man?

294
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And they start shooting bullets at you. You're like flipping over him. They just pass through your ghost, but you want to show off and you're like cutting him up with your flaming sword.

295
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 The horse, the horses at the turntables. What, what, what? How come that can't happen?

296
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 If the true world of true crime is accelerating, I want the world of the paranormal to accelerate as well.

297
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 I want to see the world of the paranormal start to just be active in our daily lives.

298
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Because nothing bad, nothing bad ever happens when demons and ghosts get involved.

299
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Right now that I put that out in the universe, I was like, that actually might be worse.

300
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Not only do you have to worry about serial killers and necrophiliacs, you have to also worry about their ghosts floating around as well.

301
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 So I guess really on this President's Day, on President's Day 2022, I think we should salute our presidents and also ask more of them.

302
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 You guys did a bunch of stuff when you were alive. I think President's Day is actually only two of them, right? It's Lincoln and Washington.

303
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 You guys did a bunch of cool stuff when you were alive, but now that you're dead and you have the powers of the afterlife, help us more.

304
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Help us grow as a people. Beat up child molesters and necrophiliacs and child molesters.

305
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Bank robbers, they're cool. But yeah, on this President's Day, let us not forget the sacrifices the President's made.

306
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And let us ask for even more sacrifices they can make in the afterlife.

307
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Because if true crime is going to become more and more crazy, then the world of the paranormal should accelerate as well.

308
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But in good ways and not disturbing ways. I don't want the Scalarri brothers floating around a courtroom.

309
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I want ghosts of good people like cowboys and they're like shooting dudes and then astronauts. Ghosts of astronauts.

310
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 That would be dope, right? They're coming down and they're like, I don't know how they're supposed to stop crime. They're floating in space.

311
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 They're like, no, this is eternal torment. Ghosts are just floating around in space.

312
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 My point is, I want more ghosts, good ghosts, to fight the evil humans.

313
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 It's time to put on that tricornered hat and ride to our rescue. You did it once during Gettysburg. Now do it again.

314
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I'm ordering you, General George Washington, save us. Save the country that you created.

315
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Because in a way, these stories are all your fault.

316
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
