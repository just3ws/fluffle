1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
 I got invited to join the Illuminati.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:09,020
 A couple questions I have about ghosts and demons interacting with humans.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,780
 And I honestly don't know how the show will go on after this episode.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,640
 This might be the dumbest conspiracy I've ever heard.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,560
 World War II never happened.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:31,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
 I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,240
 I wish you guys could see the smile on my face every time I start one of these episodes.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,720
 I'm always super excited.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,920
 The last story though man.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,120
 I really had to steal myself to do this one.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,360
 I came home.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
 Relaxed.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,440
 Watched a couple YouTube videos.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,440
 I really like Mr. Gigi.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,520
 Took a shower.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
 Drank a large glass of Diet Cola.

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,800
 And was like, "Okay, now it's time to talk about this stuff."

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,600
 Because it might honestly be the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever heard of.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,400
 And I was actually denying that anyone in the world would ever think about it.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
 Or believe in it.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,160
 But we'll get to that in a bit.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,800
 I want to talk about our first story.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,160
 So a couple, probably about a month ago on YouTube.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,240
 Now this comment went into, when people leave comments on YouTube, if you provide a link

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,680
 generally or an email address, it goes into my spam folder.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,600
 And then I have to approve it to go to the actual comment page.

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,480
 So a couple people have dropped stories and said, "Hey, have you thought about covering

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 this?"

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,560
 And they'll include like a Wikipedia link.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,120
 That usually starts off in the spam folder.

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
 Have to send it over.

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,640
 About a month ago, I got this, someone commented on one of my videos regarding the Illuminati.

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
 An invitation for myself to join the Illuminati.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,720
 And technically, anyone who reads the YouTube comments.

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,400
 Let's take a look at this.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,040
 Welcome to the Great Brotherhood.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,680
 This is what the comment says.

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,280
 Do you want to be a member of the Illuminati as a brotherhood that will make you rich and

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,320
 famous in the world and have power to control people in the high place in the world wide?

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,000
 I think you're already picking up English is not this person's first language.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,480
 Possibly not even their second language.

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,120
 Are you a businessman or woman?

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,520
 They should know whether or not I'm a man or a woman based on the show.

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,560
 If the Illuminati's inviting me to join them, they should have basic information.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
 Are you a businessman or woman artist, political musician?

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,200
 I should say politician, but political musician, student, do you want to be rich, famous, powerful

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
 in life?

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,840
 Illuminati Brotherhood cult today and get instant rich sum of $2 million in a week

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
 and a free home anywhere you choose to live in this world.

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,000
 Not the next world, but just this one.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 That sounds nice.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 $2 million within a week.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I could use that.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,200
 Benefits given to new members of the Illuminati.

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
 So this is what they're trying to pitch me on to make me join the Illuminati.

60
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,520
 One, a cash reward of $5,000 US.

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,280
 You just gave me $2 million, dude.

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
 And now I get another $500,000.

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
 You should have just said I'll get $250,000.

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,040
 Plus it takes more than a week to get the $500,000.

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,560
 Number two, a new sleek dream car.

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,520
 Car is in all caps.

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,520
 Valued at $300,000 US.

68
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,640
 I could just buy my own with the $2.5 million you've already given me.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
 Plus why is there a cap on the amount for the car?

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,880
 Don't quite get that.

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
 That's the, you're the Illuminati.

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,280
 There should be no spending limit.

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,680
 Three, a dream house bought in the country of your choice.

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
 Oh, that's nice again.

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,760
 I mean, I'd pick America.

76
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,880
 I don't really want to go anywhere else.

77
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,840
 Four, one month holiday fully paid to your dream tourist destination.

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,760
 Why one month?

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,240
 I'm a member of the Illuminati.

80
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,680
 Can you imagine like your 29 days in and they're like, the hotel's like,

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,320
 "Listen, you only paid up till tomorrow.

82
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,640
 I'm in the Illuminati.

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,960
 We control this planet."

84
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,680
 Five, one year golf membership package.

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,360
 Now golf rumors jokes aside, I don't like golf.

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,160
 They should say one year.

87
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,800
 I don't know why I'm trying to tell the Illuminati how to recruit,

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,040
 but it should be like season tickets to your favorite sport

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,920
 or unlimited movie pass or something like that.

90
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,280
 Six, a VIP treatment in all airports around the world.

91
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,400
 Big whoop.

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,000
 I mean, technically I should be taking private planes

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,680
 since I'm in the Illuminati now.

94
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,880
 But I guess now I just get to go to the little like free bar

95
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,560
 up in the like sections, off section.

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,960
 Who care?

97
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,280
 Oh, VIP treatment in any airport in the world.

98
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,400
 Seven, a total lifestyle change.

99
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,160
 I think that's kind of built into becoming a member of the Illuminati

100
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,360
 and getting $2.5 million and a $300,000 car and all that stuff.

101
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,240
 I don't know why that has its own bullet point, but it does.

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,520
 Eight, access to the Bohemian Grove account every month as a member.

103
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,960
 Now, I don't know what the Bohemian Grove account is.

104
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,640
 I know what the Bohemian Grove is.

105
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,800
 It's really only active once.

106
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,160
 I think every year it could be every four years or somewhere in between.

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,680
 Other than that, it's just a state park.

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,560
 It's not actually like a state park that you can go and visit.

109
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
 But yeah, I would just be walking around talking to owls and stuff.

110
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,240
 If no one else was there, what's the point of going to the Bohemian Grove?

111
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,280
 And if I have access to the Bohemian Grove account, I'm taking everyone's money.

112
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,360
 Because I have access to it.

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
 What do I care?

114
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,000
 Nine, one month booked appointment with top five world leaders

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 and top five celebrities in the world.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,640
 Now, here's my thing.

117
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,760
 Do I get to...

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,280
 It says one month booked appointment.

119
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,880
 Does that mean the appointment is booked within a month of me joining?

120
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,280
 Or does that mean I literally get to spend 30 days with these people?

121
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,680
 And they can't go anywhere.

122
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,960
 I'm like, dude, we're having this appointment.

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,120
 It is one month long.

124
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
 Nothing will get done.

125
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,600
 Let's see.

126
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,960
 Top five world leaders.

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,680
 Who?

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,040
 I don't...

129
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,400
 I can't even...

130
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
 Who would I hang out with?

131
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,160
 What world leaders would I want to hang out with for a month?

132
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,240
 Donald Trump would pick on me.

133
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,080
 He'd probably be like, hey, chubby.

134
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,360
 And then he'd be like, I'm just joking.

135
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,440
 I imagine that would go on for a month.

136
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,160
 Hey, you're walking real slow there.

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,600
 Maybe you should lose some weight.

138
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
 Nah, I'm just messing with you.

139
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,280
 I'm just messing with you.

140
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,680
 At 30 days of that.

141
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,840
 What other top world leaders would I want to hang out with?

142
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,000
 I'm trying to think of someone who could teach me something.

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,680
 Like, is Arnold Schwarzenegger our world leader?

144
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
 He could get me in a shape.

145
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,920
 We could spend a month with Donald Trump hazing me for my weight in the morning,

146
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,200
 working out with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the afternoon.

147
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,400
 So then by the 30th day, I can be like, peace out, Donald.

148
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,760
 Not so big anymore, am I?

149
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,880
 Who else is a world leader?

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,760
 Obviously, we're getting really loose with these guys.

151
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,280
 I can't think of any world leader I would want to be trapped with.

152
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,200
 Even those two I don't think I'd want to spend a month with.

153
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,840
 Is there anyone else?

154
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,480
 I'm trying to imagine the planet Earth.

155
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,400
 The Pope.

156
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,520
 Nah.

157
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,440
 He'd be preaching to me all the time.

158
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,160
 Oh, geez.

159
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
 See, now here we are.

160
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,160
 OK, top five celebrities, though.

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
 I can name those.

162
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
 George Lucas.

163
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,240
 I'd love to pick his brain and find out what should have happened in the next episodes

164
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
 of Star Wars.

165
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
 Ice Cube.

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
 I'd hang out with him.

167
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,760
 He wouldn't put up with me, but I'd hang out with him.

168
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,480
 I got to name the other ones real quick here.

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
 I got three more celebrities.

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,920
 The Illuminati wants their answer.

171
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,280
 I will pick Zack Snyder, because I really like the guy.

172
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
 And I think he gets a bum rap.

173
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,440
 And I feel really bad for him.

174
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,560
 He's not like pity-wise, but I'm sure he loves movies.

175
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,920
 And every time you watch a YouTube channel about movies or read anything about movies,

176
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,720
 pop culture, they always talk trash about him.

177
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,640
 So I'd hang out with him and lift his spirits up.

178
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,240
 And we can talk about Don and the Dead, because that's one of my favorite movies.

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,560
 Oh, geez.

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
 Two more celebrities.

181
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
 Two more celebrities.

182
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 Come on, let's go.

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,640
 You guys have already shut the podcast off.

184
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,520
 But the Illuminati needs me to answer this question.

185
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 Who's my favorite actor?

186
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
 Or musician?

187
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
 Oh, man.

188
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,520
 The Illuminati really is putting pressure on me.

189
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
 I don't know.

190
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
 Robocop and Darth Vader.

191
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
 They counted celebrities, right?

192
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
 I would hang out with them.

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
 It's the Illuminati.

194
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
 It's the Illuminati.

195
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,440
 I want Robocop and Darth Vader to show up.

196
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,120
 And then it says, it finishes it off.

197
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,520
 If you are interested of joining-- a bad grammar.

198
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,320
 If you are interested of joining us in the Great Brotherhood of Illuminati, contact Mr.

199
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,280
 Roland or WhatsApp him.

200
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,600
 And then there's a WhatsApp number here, plus 234-814-258-7627 or email.

201
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,080
 This is the best email I've ever seen in my life.

202
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,920
 IlluminatiPower666Brotherhood@gmail.com.

203
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,960
 So the Illuminati uses Gmail apparently.

204
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,800
 Now, of course, when I saw this, I was like, what?

205
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
 And I looked at it.

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
 I did a search for Mr. Roland.

207
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,960
 He posts-- it's a bot.

208
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,680
 Anything that is posted about the Illuminati, this pops up.

209
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,960
 I saw it on a bunch of blogs.

210
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,600
 And I saw it in a other YouTube video related things.

211
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
 Weird thing is, is the amount changes.

212
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,360
 So I get a cash reward of $500,000.

213
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,080
 Some people only get a cash reward of $300,000.

214
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,360
 And others, I start off with two millions in a week.

215
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,520
 Some other people got offered five million in a week.

216
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,800
 I give you the WhatsApp number and email address.

217
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,480
 I'm going to actually approve the message so it will appear.

218
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,600
 I wouldn't-- it's obviously a scam.

219
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,240
 I know what's going to happen is that they're

220
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,400
 going to say, well, if you want this money,

221
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,960
 give us your bank account.

222
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,280
 And we'll transfer it in there and blah, blah, blah.

223
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,800
 Or we'll send you a cashier's check

224
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,960
 and you have to deposit and all that stuff.

225
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,640
 But it's a bot.

226
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,880
 Anytime someone posts something about the Illuminati

227
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,440
 on the internet, this pops up.

228
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,720
 IlluminatiPower666Brotherhood@gmail.com.

229
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,800
 Just sounds ridiculous.

230
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,240
 First off, why would you put 666 in there?

231
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,640
 If you want to trick me into joining you,

232
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,720
 that's a red flag that things are going to go south.

233
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
 Not interested.

234
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,240
 However, $2 million in a week does sound nice.

235
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,760
 And if you can get me meetings with the real Robocop--

236
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,880
 I don't know Peter Weller, actual Robocop and Darth Vader--

237
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,240
 we might have a deal.

238
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,400
 But they can't kill me.

239
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
 It can't be like a genie thing where I go to meet them

240
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,840
 and Darth Vader cuts my head off.

241
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,160
 It has to be legit.

242
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,400
 Like, I meet Darth Vader.

243
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,120
 We shake hands.

244
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
 I warn him.

245
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,440
 I'm like, dude, things are not going to go well for you.

246
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,240
 I want to meet Darth Vader at the beginning of A New Hope.

247
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,400
 So I can be like, hey, this is what's going to happen.

248
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,120
 You're going to become a good guy eventually.

249
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,680
 So just become a good guy now and kill the emperor.

250
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,240
 And then you can prevent all of the sequels.

251
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,440
 You can set up a legit government with your son

252
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,160
 and your daughter.

253
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,800
 Yes, you have a daughter.

254
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,320
 And then you will set up a peaceful government now.

255
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,680
 And we won't have to worry about Princess Leia flying

256
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,240
 through space.

257
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,080
 And he'll be like, what?

258
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
 And I'll be like, peace.

259
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,360
 And I'll just come back to our reality.

260
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,520
 If you can do that for me, we have a deal.

261
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,120
 So now for our second story--

262
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
 our second segment, really.

263
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,280
 I want to talk to you about some questions I

264
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,880
 have regarding ghosts and demons.

265
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,640
 Now, yesterday or a couple days ago when I did the episode

266
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,440
 about the Conjuring 2, I referenced

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,200
 that I had written a review for the Conjuring 1

268
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,480
 on my website, Video Vandals.

269
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,720
 The link will be in below.

270
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,280
 But I was reading my review.

271
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,320
 And it had some questions I had about the movie and ghosts

272
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,240
 in general.

273
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
 And as I was reading it, I thought,

274
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,480
 these are actually really good questions.

275
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,680
 And I think this will make a good segment on the show.

276
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,600
 Because a lot of times when we think of ghosts,

277
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,080
 we don't really think logically.

278
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 Or we don't extend it to the realm of logic.

279
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,280
 And I believe in ghosts--

280
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,000
 I've said this before-- I believe in ghosts and demons

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,840
 and stuff like that.

282
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,000
 I don't believe they're as powerful as people think they

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,500
 are.

284
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,280
 I think that if they exist, they're

285
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,240
 some sort of quasi-paranormal, multidimensional type

286
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,320
 of thing.

287
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,080
 I don't think that they are as powerful as a lot of people

288
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,680
 think they are.

289
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,160
 And here's my questions for that.

290
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,120
 Just ghosts and demons in general.

291
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,000
 Just a couple questions.

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,760
 Just asking questions like people like to say.

293
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,240
 So if a demon can possess a doll and run around the house,

294
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,000
 if a demon can possess objects, which is generally like--

295
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,560
 they're like, this music box is haunted.

296
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,640
 And it wakes me up at night.

297
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,880
 Or this doll is haunted--

298
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,000
 Robert the doll is haunted or Annabelle is haunted.

299
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,640
 It's possessed by the ghost of this person.

300
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,920
 And they're just running around and scaring you.

301
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,560
 Why can't a ghost or a demon possess a predator drone

302
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,200
 and just fly around and blow up churches?

303
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,720
 I mean, why is it they just--

304
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,680
 they use their supernatural powers

305
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,080
 to enter an inanimate object, make it animate,

306
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,360
 and then hide around the corner or little footprints

307
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,920
 that you hear late at night?

308
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,520
 Why don't they step the game up?

309
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,160
 These demons and some of these ghosts

310
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
 are like, get out of my house.

311
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,240
 Type of like, grabbing you by the throat.

312
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,760
 You know, the ghost hunters are in the house

313
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
 with their infrared cams.

314
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,080
 They're like, something just grabbed me.

315
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,200
 Why don't they just make the electrical cables

316
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,280
 wrap around the dude's neck?

317
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,400
 Because it can.

318
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,000
 Why is it just you scary stuff and not deadly stuff?

319
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,640
 If your goal as a ghost or a demon, again,

320
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,400
 is to get people to not move into a house or to leave a house.

321
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,720
 So you'll see stuff like, written on the mirror, get out.

322
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
 Or they'll be walking around to haunted asylum

323
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,000
 and you hear a voice being like, leave now.

324
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
 They're like, I caught it on my EVP.

325
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,040
 I totally heard that.

326
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,480
 Oh, no, something's choking me.

327
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
 If they don't want people there, if they don't

328
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,600
 want to be disturbed, which is a common theme, especially

329
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,720
 in haunted house movies, that was what

330
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,280
 was happening in The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2.

331
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,400
 Why don't they just possess a home inspector

332
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,480
 to show up and be like, yeah, this house has a really bad case

333
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,120
 of black mold.

334
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,200
 No one can live here.

335
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,040
 Yep, the wiring is faulty.

336
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,520
 This place is a fire hazard.

337
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,760
 No one can live here.

338
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,200
 Why not?

339
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,080
 Because they can possess people, right?

340
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,760
 Why don't they do that?

341
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,400
 Are Muslim, atheist, Jewish, ghosts of other religions?

342
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,280
 Are they affected by crucifix or by prayers?

343
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,760
 Latin Catholic prayers.

344
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,680
 Can a Jewish ghost haunt a non-culture kitchen?

345
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,240
 I think those are relevant questions.

346
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,040
 If you believed your entire life, if you were a Muslim,

347
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,240
 and that was the faith you abscribed to, and then you die,

348
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,880
 do you use your ghost to go, oh, no, no, no.

349
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 Now I'm this other religion that's affected by crosses.

350
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,160
 Or would a ghost of a Muslim dude be like,

351
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,000
 you're like, get out by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,280
 and they're just like, whatever, dude.

353
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,080
 They're like, eating halal food.

354
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,720
 You're like, oh, no, where did all my chicken go?

355
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,600
 So I mean, again, that's something

356
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,240
 that I think people who believe in ghosts

357
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
 kind of have to address.

358
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,320
 I think the idea is that there's one true religion,

359
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,880
 and if you're a ghost, then you are bound

360
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,280
 to that true religion or whatever.

361
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,520
 But if you believed all your life, if you were Buddhist

362
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,240
 and you found out you were a ghost and you're like,

363
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,480
 oh, I guess reincarnation isn't true,

364
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,280
 and then someone comes, some priest comes,

365
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,840
 and he starts screaming at you in Latin,

366
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,680
 are you just gonna be like,

367
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,280
 I can't even understand what you're saying.

368
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,880
 I'm trying to meditate.

369
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,080
 Why do ghosts always wear clothes?

370
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,960
 Most people die in their underwear or naked.

371
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,080
 But when we look at ghosts of like Elizabethan times,

372
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,760
 they're in like the full garb women are in the corsets

373
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,880
 and the bustier or the bustier, whatever.

374
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
 They're in like the full gear and they have the,

375
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,680
 can you imagine wearing that stuff?

376
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,540
 I'm an actor, I do stuff in local theater.

377
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,960
 The costumes are so heavy and it's hot as hell.

378
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,360
 I do a lot of Shakespearean stuff.

379
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,200
 If I had to spend eternity dressed like Lord Capulet,

380
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,560
 I would go insane.

381
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
 That wouldn't make me an evil ghost.

382
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,720
 If Marie Antoinette died in her knickers,

383
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,960
 wouldn't her ghost be like topless in knickers?

384
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,900
 Why aren't there more ghosts like wearing like

385
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,900
 stained tank tops or like Frankie says, relax shirts.

386
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,340
 And they're like, oh man, I died in this?

387
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,180
 That's okay.

388
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,060
 Frankie says, relax is a great band.

389
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,380
 And then five years later, they're like,

390
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,280
 oh, you die wearing a matchbox 20 shirt

391
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,480
 and you're like just stuck forever.

392
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
 Okay, so here's another point.

393
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,220
 Does anyone else think it's a coincidence

394
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,720
 that 90% of the things attributed to ghosts

395
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,740
 like door slamming shut, things falling, cold spots,

396
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,600
 et cetera, can also be caused by that mysterious force

397
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,000
 known as wind?

398
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,620
 Why is it always stuff that can happen naturally

399
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,200
 under the right set of circumstances?

400
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,120
 There's so funny.

401
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,840
 So in Conjuring 2, you know,

402
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,520
 Conjuring 2 was supposedly based on a real case.

403
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,080
 And there was a photo of a girl levitating

404
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,400
 in the middle of the room.

405
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,520
 It is a very, very famous photo

406
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,840
 among paranormal investigators.

407
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,600
 Look at this picture of this girl.

408
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,860
 She is floating in the middle of this room.

409
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:53,640
 She has very, very, very clearly just jumped off the bed.

410
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,340
 There is no way she did not just jump.

411
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,840
 And the photo was taken while she was in midair.

412
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,180
 It is the most ridiculous piece of evidence

413
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,100
 that I've seen regarding ghosts.

414
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,020
 And that's saying a lot.

415
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,400
 'Cause I've seen stuff that was out and out like CGI fraud.

416
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,620
 But this has been, look at her.

417
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,460
 She's levitating.

418
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,660
 No, she's jumping in the air.

419
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
 If I take a picture every other second

420
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,240
 of a girl jumping rope, is that proof

421
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,560
 that she is possessed?

422
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,940
 'Cause her feet are off the ground?

423
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,420
 It's insane.

424
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,880
 I mean, and there are a lot of other questions

425
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,160
 about ghosts like, why do you go?

426
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,880
 So the way we see is through light going into our eyeballs

427
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,360
 and it refracting so we can see what's out there.

428
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,480
 Ghosts don't have eyeballs.

429
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,040
 So how can they see anything?

430
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,000
 Technically, they don't have eardrums either.

431
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,880
 I mean, so they can't hear you.

432
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,480
 Ouija boards, they don't make any sense

433
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,880
 because can I talk to a ghost who doesn't know English?

434
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
 Can I talk to a ghost who knows English

435
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,820
 but it's old-timey English?

436
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,060
 And they say like thou a lot.

437
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,900
 It's always like it'll spell out, don't go there,

438
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,900
 not like thou shalt not moveeth from thou place.

439
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,860
 What if you were talking to a Korean ghost?

440
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,860
 Would the Ouija board move to like Korean?

441
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,420
 Would you need to get a board with Korean characters on it?

442
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,580
 And when you become a ghost,

443
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,540
 you automatically become a master linguist.

444
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,460
 Can you speak any language?

445
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,220
 How do they not fall through floors?

446
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,740
 They walk through walls, how do they not?

447
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,340
 And you know, here's my biggest question actually.

448
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,020
 I was thinking about this today.

449
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,500
 Everyone has a cell phone camera on them now

450
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,260
 and we pretty much get the same amount of ghost photos

451
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,020
 that we've gotten over the past 20 years.

452
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,660
 Now you'll see proof of ghosts

453
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,900
 and this is orbs, it's pieces of dust.

454
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,380
 We should, if ghosts were 100% real,

455
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,460
 I'm not saying that all ghosts are fake,

456
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,260
 but if ghosts were 100% real

457
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,420
 and they were as numerous as we thought they were,

458
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,020
 everyone should have a photo of them.

459
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,300
 Also, sometimes there's ghost animals,

460
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,860
 but how come when I'm walking to work,

461
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,540
 I don't see a bunch of ghost squirrels?

462
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,180
 How come the world isn't populated

463
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,140
 by billions of life forms of ghosts,

464
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,460
 like plant ghosts and slug ghosts and squirrel ghosts

465
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,180
 and puppy ghosts and just there should be ghosts everywhere.

466
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,700
 People who are like, I'm a medium and I'm sensitive to ghosts.

467
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,460
 They should be like that dude in Better Call Saul

468
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,780
 that can't leave their house.

469
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,300
 They'd be like, every time I walk out of the house,

470
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,220
 a million ghost J-birds like crash into me

471
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,060
 'cause you would see every ghost possible all the time.

472
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,100
 You can tell I'm stalling for time

473
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,500
 because I really don't wanna talk about this last story

474
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,420
 and that's not fair.

475
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,780
 I do wanna talk about the last story,

476
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,860
 but it's the dumbest conspiracy I've ever heard

477
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,180
 and I just did an episode on mountains or tree stumps.

478
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,860
 So that should tell you how I feel about this.

479
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,220
 Now, it was so ridiculous to me

480
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,460
 that on my YouTube video for TGA Grace Basing,

481
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,780
 someone said, hey, you should take a look

482
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,140
 at this new iceberg and I said,

483
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,940
 no, that new iceberg's full of fake stuff.

484
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,620
 There's something on there that says,

485
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,180
 World War II was full of crisis actors.

486
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,620
 So what a crisis actor is,

487
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,620
 it's somebody who plays a part during a preparedness drill.

488
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,300
 So if they're like, okay, so we're going to run a simulation

489
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,620
 at an earthquake struck San Francisco,

490
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,180
 we wanna see how our preparedness is.

491
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,740
 They'll get people to be like, oh, my arm,

492
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,980
 oh no, my kid's buried underneath that stuff.

493
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,020
 Ah, the crisis actors has also used a lot of time

494
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,700
 when they talk about Sandy Hook was fake

495
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,780
 or the Boston Marathon bombing was fake.

496
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,460
 They're like, oh, they just had crisis actors.

497
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,580
 They just had people out there that pretended

498
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,180
 that their limbs were blowing off.

499
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,320
 That guy didn't have a leg when he showed up to the marathon.

500
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,820
 And then he had a fake leg that fell off

501
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
 and then he laid on the ground

502
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,620
 and goes, ah, my bloody stump.

503
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,860
 People actually believe that conspiracy theory.

504
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,460
 That the victims of the Boston bombing

505
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,140
 during the Boston Marathon,

506
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,780
 they didn't have limbs when they showed up.

507
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,860
 So anyways, that's what a brief overview of crisis actors.

508
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,120
 Now, World War II, it was full of crisis actors.

509
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,620
 I was like, that's ridiculous.

510
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,100
 And then SN, a YouTube user known as SN said,

511
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,620
 you know what, I hate to play devil's advocate,

512
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,220
 but this is actually a legit conspiracy theory.

513
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,820
 He goes, the YouTube video is taken down,

514
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,740
 but click this link.

515
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,400
 And that's when I discovered that people will believe

516
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,780
 or not believe truly anything.

517
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,780
 I thought that I had reached the levels

518
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,420
 of what was possible in conspiracy theory

519
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,540
 until I found this.

520
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,140
 And what's interesting is this whole conspiracy theory

521
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,560
 is hinged, we have, it's almost like fossilized remains.

522
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,740
 It's almost like digging through the dirt

523
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,700
 and finding a tusk, two ribs and a hoof

524
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,940
 and having to try to build a mastodon.

525
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,780
 'Cause this conspiracy theory,

526
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,820
 it has no mainstream appeal, obviously.

527
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,820
 What we have is a YouTube video from a YouTube channel.

528
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,260
 The video has been deleted

529
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,180
 and the YouTube channel has been deleted

530
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,820
 for violating community guidelines.

531
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,540
 We don't have the name of the person

532
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,900
 who put up the YouTube channel.

533
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,940
 All we have is a Reddit thread

534
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,220
 where people who watched the video,

535
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,540
 talked about the video and copied and pasted comments

536
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,080
 from the video.

537
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,060
 And we have a merchandise store,

538
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,220
 but I'll get to that in a second.

539
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,540
 So, World War II never happened.

540
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,180
 A lot of the arguments you'll find with this one

541
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,620
 is the same arguments you find

542
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
 with a lot of conspiracy theories.

543
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,300
 Footages faked, pictures can be photoshopped.

544
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,860
 Eyewitness accounts can be faked as well.

545
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,180
 This theory, and it's not, I wanna be clear,

546
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,620
 it's not if World War II never happened.

547
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,860
 This is what the world would be like,

548
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,980
 like Harry Turdled of.

549
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,300
 It didn't happen at all.

550
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,660
 These are the branches of this conspiracy theory

551
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,620
 from what I've gathered

552
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,340
 from the limited amount of resources

553
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,540
 I've been able to pull up on this.

554
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,260
 One, some people believe that it happened,

555
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,300
 in a sense, where we did send everyone sent over

556
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,940
 their young men to fight in this war,

557
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,780
 and they all were in on it.

558
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,240
 There was no actual war taking place.

559
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,100
 So they all came over to the war zones

560
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,260
 and they were told, "You're gonna go back

561
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,220
 "and tell people these great war stories.

562
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,580
 "We want people to believe

563
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,540
 "that this big, huge war took place.

564
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,580
 "You guys will get medals.

565
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,740
 "You guys will be heroes."

566
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,960
 And it's to keep the status quo.

567
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,300
 The Illuminati, Satanic, banking, merchant system.

568
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,860
 We're just gonna pretend that we fought it,

569
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,460
 and then you go home.

570
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,760
 That's one part of the conspiracy.

571
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,340
 Second part of the conspiracy, or the second option,

572
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,860
 is that the war happened in a sense where

573
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,380
 they shipped all of the young men from America

574
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,980
 over to Europe, and then all of the young German men

575
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,460
 and the Swedish men and stuff like that,

576
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,720
 and then bloom up, killed them all on purpose.

577
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,900
 And then called it a war.

578
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,920
 So the war itself didn't happen.

579
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,240
 It was the genocide of, and here we go,

580
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,040
 young white men.

581
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,600
 That was the point of the war.

582
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,000
 So here's an actual comment that was on the YouTube page.

583
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,440
 That was saved onto Reddit.

584
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,040
 "The purpose of wars, at least since the American Revolution,

585
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,440
 "and in earlier centuries," that doesn't make sense.

586
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,880
 If it's since the American Revolution, but whatever.

587
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,800
 "At least since the American Revolution,

588
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,660
 "and in earlier centuries, was to kill off large numbers

589
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,560
 "of young, healthy, and brave white males,

590
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,920
 "which ostensibly prevented most of them

591
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,280
 "from passing on their genes to the next generation."

592
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,040
 You know, we fought in Japan, too.

593
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,300
 Vietnam, Korea, Middle East, Native Americans.

594
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,200
 America doesn't only fight white people.

595
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,820
 We fought in Mexico.

596
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,200
 So that one's not really washed,

597
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,100
 and none of this washes, none of this washes,

598
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,440
 but that's the theories that they're just like,

599
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
 the purpose of the war was to just

600
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,240
 kill a bunch of white people.

601
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,760
 That's the reason why the war happened in the first place.

602
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,400
 But then, we're also told,

603
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,900
 those who spread the lie of World War II was real.

604
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,120
 Please provide proof.

605
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,720
 I mean, I get that the boy in the striped pajamas

606
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,480
 and saving Private Ryan are not documentaries,

607
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,160
 but there are documentaries,

608
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,940
 thousands and thousands of hours of documentaries

609
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,020
 and books and eyewitness accounts,

610
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,060
 and bombs that didn't go off

611
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,220
 that are still buried all over Europe.

612
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,500
 That's the proof.

613
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,820
 Do they just think cities vaporized on their own?

614
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,820
 I mean, their argument is the cities didn't get vaporized.

615
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,500
 Photos of Dresden were photoshopped.

616
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,180
 They didn't happen.

617
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,620
 Battle of Britain, it never happened.

618
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,160
 Really, the World War II,

619
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,640
 people who believe that World War II never happened

620
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,160
 is no different than most conspiracy theories that say,

621
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,920
 that photo is fake or I'm just asking questions,

622
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,700
 which is a very common thing a conspiracy theorist will say.

623
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,920
 When you start to push back,

624
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,280
 you know, they'll say with whatever pet conspiracy theory

625
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,960
 they have, flat earth or the moon landing was fake,

626
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,520
 they'll say a couple of things and you'll push back

627
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
 and they'll go, hey man, I'm just asking questions.

628
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,280
 And this is the end result of that.

629
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,220
 When you say, you know what,

630
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,980
 I don't think planes crashed in the World Trade Center,

631
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,260
 I think they were holograms

632
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,820
 and I don't think we landed on the moon.

633
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,220
 I think all the photos were fake.

634
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,260
 What's really to say that World War II never happened

635
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,580
 is not that big of a logical step.

636
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,260
 If you already believe that those things

637
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,420
 that we have documented with film were fake

638
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,580
 and you're like, no, there was a sound stage,

639
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,900
 then why couldn't you fake World War II?

640
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,660
 Why couldn't all the newsreels be fake?

641
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,680
 Can you go, well, it's the amount of people involved.

642
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,760
 Maybe you had people shooting blanks at each other.

643
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 I'm old enough that in my lifetime,

644
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,160
 I've met people who were,

645
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,080
 and I'm sure a lot of my listeners too,

646
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,720
 but I've met people who fought in World War II.

647
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,200
 I knew a woman who went to my old church,

648
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,960
 she was German and when the Soviets came in,

649
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,560
 they had to dress the men, the German men as women

650
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,080
 because they were just shooting any man in the street.

651
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,320
 And I knew her, she went to my church

652
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,280
 and she was probably like 60.

653
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,840
 So did she make that story up?

654
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,900
 Did she say that was she like, yes,

655
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,260
 I get my crisis actor money still,

656
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,740
 I'm still perpetuating the lie.

657
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,580
 Just to let you know too,

658
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,740
 US Revolution was faked.

659
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,420
 Britain just set that up.

660
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,860
 They're like, hey, let's pretend we're having a war.

661
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,780
 Civil war was fake as well,

662
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,900
 according to these guys, civil war didn't happen.

663
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,580
 It's just a lie you've been told

664
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,220
 by the history military complex.

665
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,060
 Never happened.

666
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,820
 What's interesting is I wonder if they think

667
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,580
 Vietnam happened or the Gulf War.

668
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,040
 Like at what point do these wars actually start taking place?

669
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,340
 Do any of them take place?

670
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,360
 The one thing I can give them,

671
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,920
 the one thing I can give them

672
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,360
 is when we look at the book 1984,

673
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,200
 how all the wars are completely fictional.

674
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
 And one day you're aligned with one country

675
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,680
 and the next day you're aligned with a different country

676
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,000
 and you have to change your whole history

677
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,760
 and they just kind of launch bombs at each other

678
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,080
 and every so often there's a small version of casualties.

679
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,480
 But the war that they talk about

680
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
 with the raging war machines,

681
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,020
 they don't actually happen in the book 1984.

682
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
 They could be inspired by that.

683
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,200
 But the thing with 1984 was that the news media

684
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,960
 was so controlled that you would see the fake photos

685
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,260
 in the news of these troops like fighting each other

686
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,120
 and we've never had that level of global control

687
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,020
 over our media.

688
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,100
 And I don't wanna hear that,

689
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,540
 oh no, the Illuminati controls Beyonce and Katy Perry.

690
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,240
 No, the level of control where you could actually

691
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,880
 manipulate everybody's version of events at one time

692
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,040
 and nobody disputes it is not even a claim

693
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,320
 that's been made by the most diehard

694
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,720
 Illuminati conspiracy theorists.

695
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,920
 'Cause if that was true, if they had that level of control,

696
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,480
 you wouldn't be able to write about it on the internet.

697
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,840
 I wouldn't be able to read out that Illuminati email.

698
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,840
 So that's again, I could see them being inspired by 1984

699
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,760
 and thinking the war was entirely fake.

700
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,640
 It was just sold to us for propaganda purposes

701
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,740
 to make us feel like we're the best

702
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,800
 and maybe in Germany they think they won the war.

703
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,680
 I don't, oh my God, I don't know.

704
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,440
 I wish I could talk to this guy

705
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,720
 'cause he put up a bunch of YouTube videos,

706
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,960
 the channel that got taken down

707
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,680
 and the other videos they referenced

708
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,000
 where the Civil War never happened,

709
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,640
 the American Revolution never happened.

710
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,520
 I looked all over for more information on this.

711
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
 I couldn't find anything 'cause when you type in,

712
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
 did World War II happen,

713
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,200
 a lot of it is like alternate reality stuff,

714
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,800
 like what if it didn't happen and so on and so forth.

715
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,240
 I'll keep looking around.

716
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,000
 I did find out though,

717
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,520
 that the guy who had the YouTube channel

718
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,360
 has a merch store that you can buy merchandise.

719
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,080
 If the merch store is called You Got Hoaxed,

720
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,960
 not like We Got Hoaxed that it's a fake conspiracy theory,

721
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,200
 but like no, you believe the lies.

722
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,200
 You can buy T-shirts, mugs, magnets, bumper stickers

723
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,760
 and even a jigsaw puzzle.

724
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,120
 Jigsaw puzzle, it's completely white.

725
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,600
 All of the items are the same.

726
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,760
 They just have text on them,

727
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,720
 but you can buy a 30 piece jigsaw puzzle

728
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,120
 and yes, I will buy this puzzle.

729
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,240
 So 30 piece jigsaw puzzle in black lettering

730
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,280
 against the white background,

731
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,440
 the worst jigsaw puzzle image I can think of is just words.

732
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,160
 This is what it says on the jigsaw puzzle.

733
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,120
 No one died and no one got hurt.

734
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,120
 Sandy hoax, Boston hoax, Aurora hoax,

735
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,480
 Chris Dorner hoax, LAX hoax, Navy Yard hoax,

736
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,320
 7-7 hoax, Kenya Mall hoax, 9-11 hoax, et cetera.

737
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,260
 Period, full stop, end communication.

738
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,520
 So this is the guy we're dealing with.

739
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,000
 Everything's a hoax, everything's a lie.

740
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,880
 Every shooting, every bombing, 'cause it's et cetera,

741
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,480
 all of it, it's a lie.

742
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,440
 Period, full stop, end communication.

743
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,280
 There is no other debate to this.

744
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,800
 These things are hoaxes.

745
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,800
 And when you believe that, if you can go Sandy Hook was fake,

746
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:36,120
 Aurora shooting was fake, 9-11 was fake, 7-7 was fake,

747
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,080
 LAX shooting was fake, Navy Yard shooting was fake,

748
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,520
 Chris Dorner, the guy who went around

749
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,280
 and shot a bunch of cops, fake, Boston bombing, fake.

750
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,720
 When you can just go fake, fake, fake, fake,

751
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,220
 why not just say World War II was fake?

752
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,320
 Because at a certain point you go,

753
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,640
 you do have to ask, well, what do you believe in?

754
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,200
 What horrible incidents do you think

755
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
 that has happened in world history that you believe in?

756
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,320
 If you already believe that everything's a hoax,

757
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,960
 and all these tragedies are crisis actors,

758
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,320
 and all evidence presented to you is fate,

759
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,240
 why stop there, why not say World War II was a hoax?

760
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:20,920
 And if you thought that was ridiculous,

761
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,880
 on Monday, we're gonna talk about people

762
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,320
 who believe nuclear bombs.

763
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,960
 Nuclear bombs don't exist, they don't exist.

764
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,320
 (laughs)

765
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,840
 I just wanna talk about ghosts.

766
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,080
 It's October, I don't mind doing the conspiracy stuff

767
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,040
 but for October I just wanted to talk about ghosts,

768
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,640
 and this stuff just falls in my lap.

769
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,000
 Nuclear bombs don't.

770
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,080
 (laughs)

771
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,960
 I just wanna say I love doing this podcast, guys,

772
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,840
 and I do have a lot of fun doing it.

773
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,000
 Like these two stories, World War II doesn't happen,

774
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,280
 and nuclear bombs don't exist.

775
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,840
 It's one of those things that I just look at so logically,

776
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,640
 and I'm like, do I really need to cover this?

777
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,160
 Is this something that really needs to be covered?

778
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,720
 But because we deal with these wacky conspiracy theories

779
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,080
 that no one's heard of, I did wanna cover 'em.

780
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,320
 So I hope you enjoyed the setup,

781
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,840
 World War II did not happen.

782
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,880
 If you ever hear anyone say that it happened,

783
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,280
 pull out your jigsaw puzzle, just tap it slightly

784
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 and go hoax, and then on Monday, when I go in depth

785
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,880
 of why many, many people don't believe

786
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,080
 that nuclear bombs exist and why, you'll remember,

787
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,760
 you're gonna have to pull out that jigsaw puzzle

788
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,000
 if anyone says, hey dude, did you hear North Korea?

789
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,720
 My nuke would be like, mm-mm, nuclear bombs don't exist.

790
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
 (sighs)

791
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,600
 I just wanted to talk about ghosts.

792
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:14,120
