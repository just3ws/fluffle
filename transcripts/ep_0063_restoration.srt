1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 A breakaway religion in Uganda goes bananas.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And what exactly was going on in that compound in New Mexico today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,760
 [Music]

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. I watched that video.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,480
 I watched the video entitled "I Actually Named It Wrong" in my... I left out a key word when on my

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,920
 last episode. The video is "Surrender to the Dark Demon Gay Lust Inside You."

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,880
 So that is the video. It was possibly the ring video of Gainus that if you watched it...

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,480
 The video purports itself that if you watch it, Satan comes into your life and makes you gay.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,520
 I did finally watch it. I actually just got done watching it. It's weird. It starts off with just

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,000
 a bunch of photos of dicks and then it starts showing all this satanic imagery. There's always

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,160
 constantly like this pentagram on screen, but then it starts showing like these like

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,600
 demons like banging dudes. They show a guy banging a ghost. It's all just like drawings after a certain

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,760
 point. And then it's just... and then it goes to footage of people rubbing their dicks together

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,360
 and having sex. And I'm like, "Uh... you know, whatever. I mean, I guess." And the whole time it's like,

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,480
 "Satan, you by watching this, Satan is in your house. Satan wants you to have gay sex. Have gay..."

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,520
 And it's like 12 minutes long. It's 12 minutes long. And then you... and then once the...

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,240
 So first time you have the images and then you have the the satanic voice the whole time,

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,520
 but once the live footage comes up, you also have this... just the sounds of sex.

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,480
 You know, and there are certain like sometimes... like when you see a photo, when I was prepping

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,880
 the story for penis worship, I was again coming across all these photos of like, "Yes, I'm my

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,200
 cock for Satan." I'm looking at the photo and I go, "I can tell that person smells." Like the photo

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,880
 itself smells. That's what these sex videos... I was like, "Ugh, like I get to smell it."

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,440
 The one takeaway... I'm not gay for watching that video. The one takeaway I do have is I feel inadequate.

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
 I feel like my dick is smaller. And that's part of the problem I have with pornography in general.

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,360
 Not that I have a small dick, but that when you watch it, it's completely unrealistic. You know,

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,720
 when you go watch Star Wars and then you get in your Subaru, you're like, "You could pretend it's an

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,520
 X-Wing, but you know everyone else is driving a car. Porn is the opposite of that. Porn is making

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,120
 you think that everyone has a giant dick. Everyone's flying an X-Wing and you're driving your Subaru.

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,480
 It's all camera tricks. It's all lighting. It's all angles and stuff like that. For every one guy

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,160
 who has a massive like, nine, ten inch dick, everyone else doesn't. But through the angles and

33
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,480
 everything like that, they can make big women, you know, make big fat women look skinny. They

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,720
 can make guys with not very impressive dicks look huge. It's all camera tricks. So that's another

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
 reason why I think people should stay away from it because it makes you feel inadequate. At 12

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
 minutes watching that, I'm like, "Those are all huge." It's my mind saying those are all like eight

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,880
 feet long, but in reality, I understand the way the angles and the lighting and the photography

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,160
 works and everything like that. You can take a picture of your own dick and make it look huge.

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,960
 I am not saying I've any experience in that personally, but we'll go ahead and leave it there.

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,400
 So yes, if you have 12 minutes to kill and you really want to see if Satan will come in your

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,800
 life and turn you gay, you can watch it. I mean, again, it was just boring. It's not really my cup

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,280
 of tea, but I did watch it and you know, maybe it's addictive. Oh, another thing. So Joseph,

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,080
 the guy who was in the last episode, who was commenting on this penis worship video, he's like,

44
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,400
 "Yes, I've introduced my wife to Satanism now and I love dick more than her, but we both know

45
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,960
 Christianity sucks." I'm starting to think, okay, so I was like, I wonder what else he's up to. So I

46
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,040
 kind of looked around on him on Pornhub and he gives his home phone number and photos of himself

47
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,240
 like face visible playing with his dick. So I'm thinking this guy's either like,

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,640
 you know, kind of messed up or someone's posting his information out there, but his

49
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:45,680
 he lists his turn ons as having sex with strainers. He goes, "Interest in hobbies. I love to have sex

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,640
 with strainers." Now, with porn, you really have to spell check stuff because I'm assuming he meant

51
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,720
 strangers. I love to have sex with strangers, but when you when you were talking about sex and

52
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,800
 there's so many fetishes for all I know, he just like get jacks off in call-enders all day long,

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,680
 or like, he's like, "Oh, dude, look at those coffee filters. Strain this." I don't know, man.

54
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,800
 You've got to be more specific in pornography because there could be a fetish of people who

55
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:25,040
 like to have sex with strainers, things that strain things. And it's not okay. I just don't

56
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,880
 know anymore. I don't know anymore. But anyways, I have his home phone number. He posted it on

57
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,240
 the website. So who knows? Maybe I'll give him a call or text him and try not to get murdered and

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,320
 find out exactly who he's trying to have sex with and if he's still watching this "Surrender to the

59
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,440
 Dark Team and Gay Lust Inside You" video. Now, we're done with that story for now. I don't

60
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,920
 I feel sorry for people. If this is your first episode, I apologize. I normally don't do a

61
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,800
 five-minute recap of the last one, but we just had so much stuff left over. Let's go ahead and get

62
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:13,280
 started with this episode. So first... Okay. Oh, the penis worship. That was a fun one. Okay, so

63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,480
 this one's interesting too because it's one of those things that I think we've... you kind of

64
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,720
 take for granted. I personally take for granted sometimes that I know a lot about a particular

65
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
 subject. I never think that I know everything about it, but I always figure I know about like the

66
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,960
 big events. So, and it's like you're like school shootings. Like, you know about Columbine and

67
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,120
 you know about Newtown and you know about the Virginia Tech, like the big ones. And then you

68
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,760
 come across the one story that we did with the 2006 shooting where the guy like held the girls

69
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,200
 hostage in the school and raped them. I'm like, how did I not know of this story? Like, it seems

70
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,200
 like something that should be totally out there. That's how I feel about this next story as well.

71
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,880
 It's about a cult back in the 80s and 90s. It was in Uganda. So you could be like, okay, that's

72
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,680
 kind of excusable. You don't live there. It makes sense that you don't really know about this cult.

73
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
 But again, when I was reading about it, I kept going like, well, how have I never heard of this

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,320
 before? There are a group called or was called, spoiler alert, the movement for the restoration

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,360
 of the Ten Commandments of God. It was this... Basically, it was a breakaway from the Roman

76
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,000
 Catholics. So at the time, there are these three different people, they were having visions of

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,160
 Virgin Mary and God coming to them and saying, you know, you need to restore my word. You need to

78
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,960
 restore my faith in your people. They were having, and Uganda, they're having lots of trouble with

79
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,360
 tribal warfare, strife, AIDS was a big issue. And you were having all these scandals with the

80
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,280
 Catholic Church. So people were looking for something else, some way to continue their faith.

81
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,320
 And yet be separate from it. It's an interesting note too. Scientologists, there's a lot of

82
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,800
 breakaways to Scientology. There are people who leave the church and is like, it's completely

83
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,600
 nonsense. And then there are people who say, oh, no, no, no, we believe in everything Scientology

84
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,800
 has to offer. We just don't believe you should pay for it. So they believe in the materials,

85
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,160
 but they don't believe in the power structure of the church. So they're trying to take the

86
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,920
 materials and start their own church. It's kind of interesting how you always have these

87
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,440
 different breakaways. Anyway, so this group, we'll call it the restoration from here on out,

88
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,320
 because it's such a long name, we'll call it the restoration. So anyways, so this group starts to

89
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,360
 form. And one of the guys who forms it, his name was Credonia. And he actually, the reason why

90
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,720
 he kind of popped into my head was that he brewed something called a banana beer. And I was like,

91
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,560
 I never heard of that. So I had to Google that banana beer, what it sounds like. And then there's

92
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,800
 something called banana wine too. You can really make alcohol out of anything, I guess is a more

93
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,520
 of that story. But anyway, so Credonia, he brewed banana beer, there was two other people. There

94
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,760
 was a Joseph, can't pronounce his last name, and then B Tate. So these three people,

95
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,600
 we're all having these visions and they're like, we need to create this restoration. We need to

96
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,800
 bring our people back under the Ten Commandments. So like Colt do, they tend to start off very small

97
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,160
 with a couple of charismatic individuals. And these people begin going preaching this message,

98
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,600
 that we are going back to the core root, the uncorrupted version of God's message, which is

99
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,320
 the Ten Commandments. These are the Ten Rules that God gave Moses. They're ready to go. Like,

100
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,440
 there's not really much room for interpretation in them. We're going to do this. And people started

101
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,680
 following it because people are always looking to fill that void inside of them. And if people are

102
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,000
 already really discouraged by the Catholic Church, and there's this other group saying, well, we're

103
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,360
 going to like the Catholic Church. We believe in a lot of the stuff, but we're going back to the

104
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,960
 grassroots. We're going back to the original stuff. And people were like, well, these people are

105
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,040
 brewing banana beer, and I know them from my neighborhood. And these people are,

106
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,840
 have all these scandals, and they're based in Rome and stuff like that. So they started getting a

107
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:15,440
 very, very good following. Their thing was that you had to follow the commandments to the point that

108
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,000
 just at certain points, talking was discouraged. Because the ninth commandment thou shalt not

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,560
 bear false witness against thy neighbor. And it said on some days, communication was only conducted

110
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,920
 in sign language. People fasted, they had special days where you could only eat one meal. So I think

111
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,440
 at a certain point, these three people, they may have originally thought, hey, we're actually

112
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,080
 getting this communication from God. But then you start to see the tactics that cults use to

113
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,160
 control people. So first, they could have a genuine like we need to help people, but then restricting

114
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,160
 diet, restricting communication, restricting travel, restricting thought. Those are all signs of a

115
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,160
 cult, like a bad cult. Like you can go to a Catholic churcher and they say, well,

116
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
 you can only eat fish on Friday. That's a lot different than saying you can only eat one meal

117
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,720
 a day. When you control what people are eating, when you're controlling, like limiting what they're

118
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,960
 eating, I guess you should say, it helps break people down so you can build them back up. So of

119
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,480
 course, this cult, the restoration starts gathering people from all over Uganda. They're all moving

120
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,160
 out to a communal place, which again, it gets a little risky if you know your cult history.

121
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,040
 They were taught to to read this text and it was apocalyptic text. And the text was saying,

122
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:44,400
 on December 31st, 1999, the world was going to end. So you come out to our banana farm,

123
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,760
 you hang out, you sell all your stuff, donate all your money to the church. Again, these are all

124
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,200
 warning signs that people outside of cult see. But when you're in the cult, you're like, man,

125
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
 no, this is all the all the things I've ever worried about have been answered, like all the

126
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,720
 questions I've ever had have been answered. So I don't need my worldly money anymore. And I don't

127
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,600
 need to eat all day on Friday or whatever. I don't need to talk without using sign language every

128
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,320
 other Tuesday. So it's it's that's how the cult kind of prays on them. And so this goes on and on.

129
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,560
 Now the thing is, is like a lot of times fear is a main motivator, fear and despair are main

130
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,440
 motivators of joining cults, like you're sad, you don't have any friends, cult gets you or

131
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
 you're fearful of the future. So if the future is clear, you don't have to be afraid anymore. If you

132
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,600
 can say for certain that the world is going to end on February 14th, I don't know why I picked

133
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 that. That's Valentine's Day, right? I hope that was just kind of a, whoa, that's kind of creepy.

134
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,600
 If you say the world's going to end on December 31st, then you don't have anything to fear. You

135
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,600
 don't have to fear about getting older, getting cancer, watching your kids die or anything like

136
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,480
 that because the world is going to end. So you take away that fear. But of course, we know as

137
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,320
 rational people, as all of the family members of these people who got involved in this cult,

138
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,520
 and they're still the family members are talking to their priests and their government officials

139
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,840
 saying, "Hey, you know, my cousin went to this banana farm and he's talking about the end of

140
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,720
 the world and stuff like that. They know that this is all fake, but the people in the cult don't."

141
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:28,640
 Of course, they will when December 31st passes and nothing happens. And of course,

142
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,520
 that's what happened. So December 31st, 1999 rolls around, nothing happens. Now, of course,

143
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,680
 people have donated tons of money, people have sold land, people have given deeds over to this

144
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,920
 church, and it's really run by these three people, the Credona, the Joseph, and the B.

145
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,000
 I believe two other people that are kind of involved in it on the after end, but it was mainly

146
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 those three. No, there was five leader yet. By the end, there was five different leaders.

147
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,800
 So you had, they had some additional leaders. I believe they were like defrocked priests because

148
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,720
 you started getting actual priests and nuns leaving the Catholic Church to join this thing. It got

149
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,200
 quite big. About 5,000 people in 1997. But anyway, so they're taking in all this money. They got

150
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,600
 all these people. They're getting land. People are like, "Yay, we know why do I need money. We'll

151
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,400
 just give it to this church because the world's gonna end." Well, 1999 comes and goes and people

152
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,440
 go, "Whoa, whoa, wait a second. I thought the world was supposed to end yesterday." And the leaders

153
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,520
 are like, "Ugh, like, you know, what do you do in that situation?" Well, you set another date.

154
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,080
 And that's generally what you see. You see with Harold Camping, they go, "There are two things

155
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,880
 happened. With 2012, the people who made all their money saying 2012 was the end of the world,

156
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,960
 they said, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I never said it was the end of the world. I said it was

157
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,440
 the start of the end of the world. Just the start. Give it another seven years. That's a common trick."

158
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,760
 The other trick is to go, "Oh, I must have got my math wrong. I must have gotten the vision wrong.

159
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,280
 The date is actually further out." Now, the thing is, is they can't put the date too far out,

160
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,800
 because then you lose followers and then you're going to have this huge lull until you get close.

161
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,960
 It's always just a couple months out. If you said the world's going to end 100 years, nobody cares.

162
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,280
 If you said the world's going to end at the end of the year, people who are fearful are going to

163
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,440
 care. And then the year end of the year comes and you just can't say, "Oh, no, it's going to be 10

164
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,200
 years from now. You have to just move it ahead." So these guys had a plan. They go, "Okay, we got caught.

165
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,560
 Either we were scamming them on purpose or our visions were wrong, but we have to do something."

166
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:48,640
 So they said, "We have a new vision on March 17th, 2000. So only three months later, the world will end.

167
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,000
 The world will end." And you know what? We're going to have a party to celebrate it.

168
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,840
 So they invited all of these people, 530 people showed up to the, the reason why I know the

169
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:11,760
 exact number should tell you what's going to happen. They all show up to this huge party in, in Kanugu,

170
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,960
 Kanugu. They roasted three bowls and drank 70 crates of soft drinks.

171
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,600
 Big party. Now it's not a Jonestown party. Now see, this was one thing about the cult. They never

172
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,760
 talked about mass suicide. It was never this whole like, "The world's going to end and we're all going

173
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,840
 to drink the Kool-Aid or we're going to have this ritual suicide or anything like that." That was

174
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,440
 never spoke about. So the authority is never worried about it. There's, there was complaints about

175
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,760
 people like kids getting kidnapped and stuff like that, but that's generally like, "Wife joins the

176
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,280
 cult, husband doesn't, wife takes the kid." They have a big party. They all go into this giant building,

177
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,160
 530 people, and people in the next town over are just kind of minding their own business,

178
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,960
 not really thinking about it. All of those cult people, they're having that big party. All of a

179
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:06,960
 sudden, massive explosion. All 530 people in the building, dead, burned alive. Investigators,

180
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,040
 when they finally get their fire crews and stuff like that, the windows are boarded up,

181
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:18,000
 the doors are shuttered. 530 people, including dozens of children, burned alive, blown to pieces.

182
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,520
 And the leadership of the church was in there, so they're like, "They're dead." And then the

183
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,680
 investigators were like, "Well, it must have been mass suicide. It must have been, again,

184
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,520
 we didn't know it, but it was some cult." They went out and they started investigating the

185
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,920
 properties of the leaders. They go to the first property. They find six bodies dumped in like,

186
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,960
 the toilet. And they're like, "Well, okay, that's weird. That doesn't seem like a ritual suicide."

187
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,600
 They go to another compound, 153 bodies. They go to another compound, 155 bodies,

188
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,480
 where they had been stabbed and poisoned. Then they go to another compound, 81 bodies. They said

189
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,800
 a total of 924 people died or were discovered dead within that week. Definitely 530 people died.

190
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,040
 The rest of them, they figured they died a short time before. And it wasn't a ritual suicide.

191
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,400
 The leaders murdered them. And now, authorities believe that at least two of the leaders,

192
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,480
 Credonia and Joseph, weren't in the building. There's actually active searches for them.

193
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,360
 They have international warrants for them. They believe the leaders, those two guys who founded

194
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,840
 the church, blew everybody up because they wanted their money and they were complaining that the

195
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,040
 world hadn't ended. And then, first off, murdered a bunch of people that weekend and left their bodies

196
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,040
 at different compounds and then went to the big compound, invited everyone in there, sealed the

197
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,760
 door shut and blew the place. The pieces burned everyone alive. Brutal stuff. That's a huge body

198
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,440
 count for a cult. And that's why I thought I was surprised I never heard of it. I mean,

199
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,560
 there's nearly a thousand people in a weekend and it's not suicide. It was these guys murdered

200
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,640
 these people. Okay, so we're going to move on to our next story here. This was a story that I've

201
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,520
 kind of been hesitant to cover for a couple reasons, but I feel like it's time to cover it

202
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,240
 because we've gotten enough information on it. So, and I really kind of want to cover just

203
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,480
 certain elements of it, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it. So, what's going on in New Mexico

204
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,760
 right now or this year? Was there was a cult? That's the best way to put it. Again, it's like a

205
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,840
 breakaway cult like the Restoration. They, there was this guy, his name, and I'm going to again have

206
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:38,640
 trouble with everyone's names. Siraj Rahaj. Siraj, Siraj Rahaj. We'll call him Rahaj.

207
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,880
 He kidnaps his son, his three-year-old son from Georgia, from the mother of the child,

208
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,000
 and him, his current wife, his two sisters, and 11 other kids all beat feet to New Mexico,

209
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,840
 where he builds a compound in the middle of the desert. And he believes he has quite a few wacky

210
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,280
 beliefs. And this is why people can, people are like, "Oh, you know, it's all about anti-Muslim

211
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,000
 stuff like that." No, these guys are as fringe as the Westboro Baptist Church or the Restoration

212
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,560
 or any sort of breakaway religion. Because what Rahaj believed was that his three-year-old son,

213
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:19,520
 who was severely physically disabled, was possessed by demons, and by exercising the demons from the

214
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,520
 child, he could save him. But what happened was the child died. The three-year-old little boy died.

215
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,560
 And Rahaj's answer was, "Oh, but he's going to, Jesus, now that he's dead, Jesus can use his body

216
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,600
 to resurrect himself, and then he'll come to us as militant Jesus. And he will teach me and my

217
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,000
 sisters and my mom and these 11 other kids we have who we should kill in the upcoming war."

218
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,240
 Now, none of that is mainstream Islam. That is all complete, that, those beliefs are just

219
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,280
 completely as wacky as anything else. Islam does have a more militant version of Jesus,

220
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,960
 who will come back, but not in the form of a three-month-old disabled baby who's exercise.

221
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,240
 Like these, this guy automatically, this guy obviously has some mental issues. And the guy,

222
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,520
 so he picked the kids up and left. He was facing a kidnapping charge, the government's

223
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,480
 men looking for him. And to show that this isn't an issue of prejudice against Islam,

224
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,320
 the person who turned him in was an Imam. He found out through one of his parishioners

225
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,600
 that there was this family in New Mexico that had run out of food and they were trying to get

226
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,360
 food or money from a relative. And that relative went to the Imam and said, "Hey, I know where

227
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,960
 that guy's at who took that kid." And the Imam's like, "Find out where he's at and I'll call the cops."

228
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:53,840
 So this isn't an issue of this Muslim, worldwide conspiracy thing. Where it's gotten to be

229
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,120
 weird. I mean, that's already weird with the little, and you know, people,

230
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,600
 a lot of times I feel like the little boy's death is getting overridden. But anyway,

231
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,480
 so the cops go out there, they go, at first they're just investigating this missing kid.

232
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,960
 And then they go there and they find all these children, they're completely malnourished,

233
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,240
 and the cops are like, "Oh great, this sucks." And then they start finding out stuff about,

234
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,480
 like, what? Your kids are shooting guns, but they don't have enough food to eat.

235
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,520
 And then they're like, "Well, okay, okay, we'll handle the malnourishment thing in a second.

236
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,360
 Where's the kid we're looking for? Where's the kidnapped kid?" And Wajah was like, "I don't know.

237
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,680
 I don't know where he's at." So now they're very, very suspicious. They hold the adults in custody.

238
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,040
 I think the kids go to foster care. They eventually find the remains of the three-year-old boy,

239
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,840
 and that's when it comes out about the botched exorcism. They couldn't get the demons out and

240
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,560
 the baby accidentally died. And so the parents, all the adults were being held there.

241
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,960
 They're going to try to bond out. They were trying to pay, get their bond done. And this is where the

242
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:11,440
 story gets ridiculous. So the defense lawyer goes, "Hey man, the only reason why we're bugging these

243
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,480
 people is because they're black Muslims. If these were white Christians who believed in faith healing

244
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,520
 and things like this, this wouldn't be an issue. America has a second amendment. You know, people

245
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,840
 can shoot guns. People can teach their kids to shoot guns." And that argument worked. They bonded out.

246
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,760
 The judge said, "I don't think there are threats to the community. I only am looking at the evidence

247
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,360
 about mistreating the kids. I'm not looking at the evidence of anything else as far as the shootings

248
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,800
 go. I don't think there are threats to the community." And she lets him walk. The man, Wajj,

249
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 was not able to be let go because he was still being held on a warrant for the Georgia kidnapping.

250
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,000
 But the women, she's like, "I don't see any reason to not let you bail out." Here's the thing. I get

251
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,360
 that argument to a point that you could say, "Well, I think that the reason why you're just picking

252
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,000
 on them because they're black Muslims, you would let any other group shoot guns and do faith healings

253
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,520
 and things like that." That's just on the face, not true. Absolutely not true. And we have the

254
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,760
 perfect example. It's Waco, Texas. We've had multiple, we've had Ruby Ridge. We've had multiple

255
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,280
 groups that have done less. These people had a kidnapping charge against them, that have done

256
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,320
 less and had violent raids put against them. So this argument doesn't fly. But the reason why I

257
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,680
 think this is an important story is that most people don't know about it. Most people heard a

258
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,440
 little bit about the compound in the beginning and then don't really know about the weird details.

259
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,840
 So these people are actually mentally ill and they're mentally hurting children and they were

260
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,680
 planning to shoot up other schools. There should be a trifecta for the media. They should love this

261
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:07,040
 stuff. It involves religious insanity. It involves school shooting. It involves guns. But they're

262
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 just kind of like, "Bah." And I don't necessarily think it's the Muslim angle because the fact

263
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,880
 that they're Muslims, I think, is not even really relevant to the story. They could have been any

264
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,640
 religious group. They could have been absolutely any religious group. The story would have still

265
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,560
 played out the same, I believe, except for the judge letting them out because I don't know what

266
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,120
 she was thinking. Even the governor of New Mexico was like, "I completely disagree with that decision."

267
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,600
 And luckily, the federal government disagreed. They scooped the women back up.

268
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,920
 And they said, "Nope. We're charging. We're pressing charges against you."

269
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,200
 So bizarre. The whole story is weird. It's one of those stories that,

270
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,640
 in fall, again, I always say paranormal, conspiracy, and true crime, they all kind of

271
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:02,080
 meet and this kind of does this. I can't understand why the judge didn't consider these people a

272
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,600
 threat because they were definitely at the very, very least, the very least, even if you don't buy

273
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,360
 into the whole conspiracy of the school shooting, trying to train them to be school shooting, you

274
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,080
 could go, "Well, prosecutors are just making that up." A child died. A child was kidnapped and died.

275
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,080
 So my theory is why, my question is why would the judge go, "No, I'm going to let them go.

276
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,120
 I'm going to let them go." Was race an issue? Did she not want to seem racist? Did she not

277
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,000
 want to seem Islamophobic? Was it something coming down from the government? Did she just

278
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,160
 have access to different information than is being released in the media?

279
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,040
 I don't know. But again, this story, like most of the sources on this story are

280
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,400
 mayor, the Daily Mirror, which is a British paper. I had to use Breitbart, which I'm not a huge fan of

281
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,600
 using Breitbart for my sources because most people brush it off. But I'll use it when that's all I

282
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:06,320
 have access to. U.S. Today did an article on it. Not on the... It's funny. The U.S. Today article was

283
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:15,360
 not so much about the trial itself, but the poor judge who was being threatened. So imagine the

284
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,200
 story I just told you where we had the family whose kidnapped the kid. The kid dies. The kids

285
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,480
 are malnourished. They're raising a small army. They're saying all of this wacky stuff. This is

286
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,920
 the headline for the U.S. Today. And then the judge lets them go. This is the headline for the U.S.

287
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:37,600
 Today article. "Judge in New Mexico compound case threatened after ordering release of Muslim family."

288
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:45,040
 That covers none of the main points. And again, I don't think the fact that they're Muslim is the

289
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,880
 main point. I think the fact that there is a dead kid who they thought was going to be resurrected

290
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,160
 and give them a hit list is the issue, regardless of religion. That's the headline of that article.

291
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:06,720
 Like, that is obviously in a... It's, I guess, technically a factually correct headline.

292
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,080
 So I'll say this. I don't think there's necessarily a conspiracy. I don't believe in these huge mega

293
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,560
 conspiracies as far as like they want them to... They want the Middle East to invade Western cultures

294
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,360
 so they can destroy all us. And it's this concentrated effort to eliminate the white

295
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,680
 people or eliminate Western culture. I don't believe that. I do believe there's a conspiracy to cover

296
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,280
 up for this particular group. Absolutely. Absolutely. I don't know who's doing it.

297
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,600
 I don't know if it's someone in that town. I don't know if it's someone in that state.

298
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,680
 But come on, that's a ridiculous headline. That's a ridiculous headline. Somebody's covering up for

299
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,000
 these people and someone is covering up for this judge because the judge said, you know,

300
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,720
 I was only ruling on the children being malnourished and he didn't show me proof of that. All the cops

301
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,640
 did was talk about all the heavy weapons there. So not the fact that the cops didn't detail they

302
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,800
 had empty cupboards but that they had massive machine guns and you're not concerned about that.

303
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:15,280
 Somebody's covering up for this particular group. I believe, I believe. Luckily the federal government

304
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,240
 stepped in and they took these people. Georgia's attorney general is making sure the guy's not

305
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,840
 getting out because they're filing charges against him. But come on, that's ridiculous.

306
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,280
 You can't say as a judge, oh, you know, I was only seeing if they had food to eat

307
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,360
 and you were talking about terrorism and you and because I was only looking at one thing and you

308
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,160
 were talking about another thing, I'm just going to put ankle bracelets on these people who murdered

309
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:46,800
 a three-year-old. Weird, weird stuff, weird stuff. I think conspiracies, the problem is,

310
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,520
 is people try to make them bigger than they are and sometimes they are small things. Sometimes

311
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,640
 they may be this group here has connections with this group here in the same area and it gets to

312
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,880
 this judge and it gets to the cops or whatever. It doesn't always have to be this grand global

313
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,600
 George Soros, Koch Brothers, Illuminati's webbing. I think the more compelling ones and honestly

314
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,120
 the more truthful ones are the ones that are happening in a particular town because here's

315
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,320
 the thing, if they hadn't asked for food and that a mom hadn't gotten the phone call and called the

316
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,520
 cops, this group still would have been operating out in New Mexico. That kid would have just disappeared,

317
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,760
 10 years would have went by, they still would have been operating in that area. People knew

318
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,360
 that they were there, that they had this compound, that they were shooting off heavy weapons, nobody

319
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,400
 cared because that's kind of how New Mexico is, but neighbors did notice that that kid was missing.

320
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,600
 So why wasn't it investigated then when they go, "Hey, remember that little crippled kid who used

321
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,200
 to hang out over there? He's gone." People recognize him because he was a three-year-old,

322
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,920
 severely disabled and all of a sudden they stopped seeing him. Neighbors thought something was up.

323
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,360
 How come they didn't do anything about it then? Why did they have to have Georgia coming out and

324
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,680
 calling investigators to come out there? I don't know. I don't know, but it's an interesting story
