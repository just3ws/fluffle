00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 The National Holiday Mother's Day has a creepy origin story, and then we take a look at the story of a man who wanted to go hunting.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 He grabbed his rifle, some cans of grub, got his camping supplies, and headed off into the forest.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 But one night he woke up into the arms of Daddy Bigfoot, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover today. A lot of stuff.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon. We got a bunch of new Patreons last week.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Really, really appreciate it.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Cory Oh! It's Cory Oh! Cory, Cory, thank you so much for supporting the show. We really, really appreciate it.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 A lot. You are going to be our captain this episode. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 That's totally fine. Just help get the word out about the show. That helps so, so much.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So Cory, let's fire up that carpenter copter. First off, we are headed back in time to the very first Mother's Day.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 [Music]

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Now as we are flying over the landscape, we are headed out to West Virginia.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 A little town called Webster, West Virginia. There is this little girl being born.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We are not actually watching her birth. That's disgusting.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But I find the miracle of childbirth. I'm sure it's great and all. I just don't want to see babies come out of people.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So we have our backs to this little log cabin. Checking her watch.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 We are like, how long is this going to take? How long does it take for old timey people to give birth?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 We are back in the year 1848. So this isn't like no emergency room stuff. This is straight up like midwives with like ice cream scoops.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And they didn't even have ice cream scoops back then. Big old wooden spoons that your grandma used to spank you with.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 They are just pulling the baby out. Like a pizza coming out of a oven.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And eventually little Anna Jarvis comes out. She is the ninth of 11 children.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So little Anna. Little Anna is raising this really big household.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And over time, you know, she grows up. She leaves a little town of Webster, West Virginia.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 She heads out on her own. She gets a job. She is a professional. She is working in an office.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Her mom gets sick. And she brings her mom up to Philly where Anna is living at now.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And takes care of her mother until she passes away.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Now she always had a very, very strong connection to her mom.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And she felt that there should be a mother's day.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And she also felt that it shouldn't be mothers. Like is all of them. It's mother apostrophe S.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So it's all about your mom. It's the ultimate mom joke, but it's a fun one.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So her mom passes away and she starts this movement to start Mother's Day.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And through the course, like there's a ceremony held in West Virginia.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And the whole thing is white carnations is the symbol of Mother's Day.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And Anna Jarvis sends down 500 white carnations to celebrate her mother and the other moms as well.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Over the course of a couple of this, it's a huge celebration. Like people really, really think it's the bee's knees.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So after a couple of years, the president, Woodrow Wilson says, let's declare a National Mother's Day.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Now her mom died on May 9th. So it really was a lot connected to Anna Jarvis's story.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Her mom died on May 9th. Woodrow Wilson says, the second Sunday in May will be Mother's Day.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 So it's all kind of connected to her. Okay, that's a sweet story. You love your mom.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 You want to celebrate her. You want to celebrate all moms. That's totally awesome.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 But then you have a bunch of fat cat businessmen sitting in a big old boardroom smoking big old Stogies.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 How can we make money off of these broads? How can we make some money off these skirts celebrating there?

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 What do you call them again? Mamas. Now that might sound like a joke, but it's actually not far from the truth.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And it's a little bit of foreshadowing. What happened was the greeting card in the floral industry jumped all over this.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 They go, oh yeah, you're right, dude, mom's rock. Here's a bunch of stuff that we can sell for that day.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Now that's not a shock. Like we see the ultra commercialization of all this stuff.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Back then, at this point, we're like in the year 1920, we're starting to see the floral industry, the greeting card industry, the candy industry really jump all over this thing.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Now you have Anna Jarvis and this was her thing about choosing the white carnation. Here's a quote from her.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 "It's whiteness is to symbolize the truth, purity, and broad charity of mother love. It's fragrance, her memory, and her prayers.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 The carnation does not drop its petals, but hugs them to its heart as it dies. And so too, mothers hug their children to their hearts. Their mother love never dying."

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 That's beautiful, right? And I didn't know, is that biologically true? Is that like the carnation flower dries up, the petals don't fall off, it kind of dries into itself?

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Like a mama saying, I'll never let you go, baby. That's adorable, right?

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 The floral industry goes, you know what, it would be really adorable. More money in her pockets.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Because the white carnation was the symbol of Mother's Day, as Mother's Day got closer, they just jacked the prices up.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And then they go, well, that was good, that was a great idea. But we can also diversify it. Let's start advertising red carnations as well.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It doesn't have to be white. Any color carnation is fine.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That's fine, that's just capitalism, but the story starts to get darker because Anna Jarvis is like, no, what are you guys doing?

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 This isn't about just buying flowers and sending them to your mom. Sure, I did that.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 But it's also about thinking about your mom, being in touch with your mom. It's not about getting these little gifts and sending them to them.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 So we start to see a rift between the person who created Mother's Day and everyone profiting behind it.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 She's the face of it and people still look at her. People still connect her and her mom to the origin of it.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So what she says has a lot of sway. So when she says this quote here, quote, "A printed card means nothing except that you are too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone in the world."

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And candy? You take a box to Mother and then eat most of it yourself. A pretty sentiment, unquote.

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Which is blast, dudes, right? First off, I don't think I've ever done that. I mean, sure, I've sent out a greeting card before,

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 but I don't think I've ever given anyone candy and go like, hey, you mind if I kick it here for a while?

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That's what a drug dealer does, right? Like you go over, you hang out with a drug dealer, just do some of his drugs and be like, get done playing NBA Jam 2003.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And you're like, oh, I gotta go back to work. They're like, what? You just took a four hour lunch break. Yeah, see you later, man.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 You don't normally give someone candy and eat half of it. But apparently that was a huge problem back in the 1920s.

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Leading cause of the Great Depression, actually. So she was putting these dudes on blasts and people were like,

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 okay, this is kind of weird because we really respect you and this is about something you created.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But on the other hand, all of these advertisements and everything is like, making our minds think that this is okay.

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It's okay to just send the carnations or red carnations. It doesn't matter. And it's okay to pay more for this stuff.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Anna Jarvis begins getting arrested for public disturbances because she's protesting these people.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Imagine if you created a holiday and then you're just dreading it every year because you know you're just going to see all the ads and the old-timey newspapers and on the radio and stuff like that.

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 You're going to be pulling your hair out. You know this is coming and everyone's going to look to you and be like, hey, are you going to put up with this again?

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 She starts holding these public demonstrations. The monster she created has become a commercial nightmare.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 The big fat cats in their building, it's much taller now from all that carnation money.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Yo, we got to take care of this problem. This birdie's squeaking too much.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 She gets put into an insane asylum. And the thing about insane asylums, they're not super cheap to be in.

83
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 So who pays the bills to keep her in the asylum until she dies?

84
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 The greeting card in the floral industry.

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 She doesn't pay for all of her bills while she's in there.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 She died three years later after being put in a mental hospital.

87
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 That's a creepy ending, honestly.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 A lot of times people fear the police state, fear the government police state, and that is something to be afraid of, but the corporate police state is sometimes even more chilling.

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 You can vote out politicians. You can have revolutions and overthrow governments. It happens quite a lot.

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But corporations stay. It's not a real way to overthrow them.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And even if you say, "Well, we'll just boycott them," what makes them out of business?

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The board of directors just goes to another company. It's absolutely terrifying.

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 This woman started this day to celebrate her mom, ended up in an insane asylum, and she was put there by the people who are profiting off the day she created to celebrate her mother.

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So while you may not remember the name "Anni Jarvis," remember it this year.

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And you probably remember from now on, because this will be a factoid whenever someone's talking about Mother's Day, you'll walk up to them with a cup of coffee in your workplace and be like, "You want to hear something crazy? You want to hear something crazy?"

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Creepy, creepy story.

97
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Okay, let's go ahead. Corio, I want you to take that carboner copter, and I want you to fly it on out to British Columbia, Canada.

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Flying low over the trees, pine needles getting blown off by the rotors that are sticking in animals' eyes, horses are walking by.

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 "Oh, that's what I get for being in the forest!" Are there horses in the forest? What's a horse's natural habitat?

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Where did the horse evolve? No, it's just going to start talking about evolution again. Where did horses evolve from?

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Here's my guess. Horses evolved from planes and stuff, like Mongolia, where everything was flat, because a horse would totally suck in a forest, right?

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Because it has hooves. You need to have claws and stuff, or little hands for the roots.

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I'm not saying the horses can't walk through forests, because I have seen quite a lot of Disney-animated movies, like Snow White.

104
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 There's always horses running around the forest saving a princess. What's Snow White a princess? That doesn't matter. That's not what we're talking about.

105
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 The point is, I don't think she was. I think she married a prince, so by default, she became a princess, but she wasn't royal blood.

106
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Wasn't she just some old girl? Like, just some chick hanging out with her mom? What story is Snow White?

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Yeah, she's just some villager, right? And then the queen tried... If the queen... Never mind. Well, I'm getting totally distracted.

108
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 My other thing, I'm going to try. I think horses probably came from the planes areas, right?

109
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 But anyways, we asked Coriose flying the helicopter. We're just like circling around. He's like, "Are we going to land somewhere?"

110
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. We'll land right there in that flat spot full of horses."

111
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 We crushed a couple of them, but it's okay. I own a stock and a glue company.

112
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 The year is 1924. Actually, I didn't think about it. That's really close to our last story.

113
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But anyways, we're at the Toba Inlet, British Columbia, Canada, and I got most of this information from an article on UFO Insights,

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 and it was written by Marcus Loth, so I always like to give credit to... When I get a lot of information from one particular site, I like to give him credit.

115
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Let's go ahead and take a walk here. We'll walk through the forest, and we see a man sitting there with his sleeping bag just hanging out,

116
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 watching the sunset over the landscape. His name is Albert Ostman. Now, he's up there because he heard a rumor that there's a lost gold mine up there somewhere.

117
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 So Albert Ostman's out there, but before he left town, a bunch of the natives were like, "Yo, before you go, dude, just let you know, man, there's a Sasquatch up there.

118
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 There's a big old Bigfoot." And he's like, "I'll be fine. I'm not worried about it." And he wasn't worried about it.

119
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Now, he packed up a bunch of supplies. He was up there for the long haul. He knew that if this was a lost mine, it was going to take him a while to find it.

120
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 He grabs a sleeping bag, has 80 pounds of supplies, and his little trusty tin of snuff.

121
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Now, that's not a videotape where someone is murdered for commercial purposes. It's an old, tiny way.

122
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I actually think it was the first Western way to do tobacco. It's a powder, finely ground tobacco that you snort.

123
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But you would put... I've done it before, and it sucks, dude. I mean, like, it will get you high. It will definitely get you high.

124
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 It's extremely painful. One person described it as feeling like he got shot in the face.

125
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 You put a little bit of the... I bought it at Walgreens. Back when I was chewing tobacco all the time, I was always looking for a new way to get nicotine.

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Put a little bit on your... in between your thumb and your finger on that little webbing you have there.

127
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 You snort it up, and it feels like you've taken toothpicks and shoved them up your nose. It's super painful.

128
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It'll light you up. It will make you feel good. I remember once I did it, and I could see my skeleton as I was eating.

129
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Not like sitting across the table from me, I felt my eyeballs recess into my head, and as I ate, I could see my teeth eating the burrito.

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It was super bizarre. Your mileage may vary on that, though. I might just be... you're like, "Jason, what? It's just nicotine. It's not acid."

131
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Whatever. It tripped me out. So anyways, your mileage may vary on that. Don't go out and buy a bunch.

132
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 It's been a week with your buddies. Be like, "What? This sucks!" All it did was give me high blood pressure.

133
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It's a three-day hike. He's walking up. He's walking up through the woods. On the third day, he's sleeping, right?

134
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I mean, not all day, at night. On the third night, he's sleeping. And then... what? Oh, I feel... what? Weird?

135
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Wait, what's going on? And his eyes are slowly opening up, huh?

136
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And he feels a... it's a feeling that I don't think you could place right away, but if you thought about it, you could figure it out, right?

137
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 He could feel, in the pitch-blackness of night, that he was being carried, specifically carried over somebody's shoulder.

138
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Now you're like, "Jason, how would you ever figure that out?" Think about it. That would make your body bounce in a certain way, right?

139
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 If someone was carrying you with both their arms under your... carrying you like a bride over a threshold, you'd be like, "Oh, this is very romantic."

140
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 If you're being lugged around like a sack of potatoes, I think your internal gyroscope would be able to be like, "Oh, this isn't good."

141
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 "This is not romantic." So he's in a sleeping bag and he's being carried by this thing.

142
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 You can tell it's really tall and obviously really strong, because it's carrying him around for hours.

143
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 [gibberish]

144
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Now... okay, this story... I don't want to nitpick every single part of it, because it gets pretty nitpicky here.

145
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 But how long could the strongest man carry you? Like, assuming... first off, I'm 270 pounds.

146
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 So the strongest man carrying me would have to be quite strong to even carry me around the block.

147
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 But I don't mean like his internal strength. I mean like, at a certain point, I'm going to start wiggling, right?

148
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 To get away. I'm like, "No, no. If you carry me over the threshold, that means we're legally married and you like start wiggling around, right?"

149
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 So... come on, dude, for hours. But the point of that is to basically make it so our hero, our possibly lying hero, our unreliable narrator, Albert Ostman, had no idea where he was at.

150
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 If it only carried him five feet and sent him down, then it'd be easy for him to find his way home.

151
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But anyway, so for hours, he's walking around. Maybe at a certain point, this creature put him on top of a washer and dryer machine, did some laundry, and he still felt himself vibrating.

152
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He's like, "Ugh!" And then you picked him back up. But anyways, for hours, he's walking around and then he gets dropped off.

153
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And he's so scared, he has no idea what happened. He's so scared he hides in his sleeping bag.

154
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So the sun comes up. Sun coming back up over the landscape. And that's when he realizes where he's at.

155
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 He's at a place he described as surrounded by cliffs on all sides. So he basically a valley. Wouldn't be another way to say that.

156
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 He's in a valley. And as he's waking up, I don't think he actually fell asleep. I don't think he was like, "Ugh, that was a long walk. Time to take a nap. I hope my kidnapper doesn't do anything horrible to me."

157
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I think he was awake and terrified. But anyways, as the sun comes up, he starts to realize the gravity of his situation. Because he sees, you guessed it, Bigfoot standing there.

158
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And standing there. Standing there and there. What? So what happened was, to be continued, what happened was, he got kidnapped by Bigfoot.

159
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And then Bigfoot dropped him off at his house. Now technically it's not a house. It's just like a clearing in the woods.

160
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 But there he sees an 8 foot tall Bigfoot, who he estimates weighs about 800 pounds. He sees a 7 foot tall Bigfoot, who he says weighs about 600 pounds and he describes as an old lady Bigfoot.

161
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 With bangs. That's weird, right? You can only get bangs by cutting them. But apparently she has access to a really sharp rock. She has bangs. And then we have this great quote.

162
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So he's checking out this female Bigfoot. He's been up in the woods for 3 days. That's a long time, guys. You know? It's been a long time since he's seen a woman.

163
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 He's looking at this 7 foot tall, 600 pound old lady Bigfoot. And we get this quote. She was not built for beauty or speed. Which is funny, because when I have her eye look at a woman, I go, she's not that hot.

164
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 But she's really fast. I bet she can run 100 meter dash like that. That's how I always want to look at women. I'm like, okay, is she beautiful? She fast.

165
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 She was not built for beauty or speed. Some of those lovable braziers. Okay, so. I forgot about this one. So the first thing he goes is, oh yeah, she's not that good looking and she's not that fast.

166
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And that's how I like my women. I like them beautiful and quick. But then he goes on to base. This is his next thought. He's looking at 7 foot tall, 600 pound monster in the woods.

167
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And he's checking out her chest. So here's the rest of this quote. Some of those lovable braziers and uplifts would have been a great improvement on her looks and her figure.

168
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 So basically she had big old droopy boobs. Which, I mean, again, I've just been kidnapped by an 8 foot tall, 800 pound monster. Throwing in front of a 7 foot tall, 600 pound monster. I'm checking out her big old boobs.

169
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Now I'm not saying that I would never check out the boobs, right? Eventually I would first like, you know, do a quick glance and then like pretend I didn't pretend there was like a bumblebee flying and I was trying to dodge it like Neo.

170
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 But eventually I'd be checking out her boobs. That wouldn't be the first thing I'd do though. And I definitely wouldn't think, oh, she could use a giant bra. Giant, get two squirrels, time together.

171
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Now, there's also two other big foots here, but they're tiny guys. Here's a little boy. What he assumed were a little boy and a little girl. I don't know if the little girl had bangs as well, but little boy, little girl one.

172
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Now this is again an interesting, when I say interesting, I mean it's a code word for suspicious part of the story.

173
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So he brought 80 pounds of supplies with him, right? He's sleeping in a sleeping bag. He gets carried a couple miles. So obviously he doesn't have all of his supplies with him.

174
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Now he does have his snuff with him. Now that's fair because I have fallen asleep with chewing tobacco in my pocket or chewing tobacco near me. So I totally get that.

175
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 So he probably did go, oh sweet snuff, you love me. So you were built for beauty and speed. I love you so much. Takes a sleep.

176
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Also in his sleeping bag was his rifle. Is that a hunter's out there? Carson, I know you're a big hunter. Do you ever sleep with your rifle in your sleeping bag?

177
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Is that something hunters do? Because that sounds incredibly dangerous, right? You're like, oh let me put this loaded firearm in the place where I'm going.

178
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Not only that, but I also have night terrors. I mean that sounds extremely dangerous, but in this story, maybe it's an old-timey thing.

179
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Maybe it makes sense so like a bear doesn't pick it up, start shooting people. Or just like a random lunatic. Maybe that's the thing.

180
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 But anyway, so in his sleeping bag that was carried all these miles, he has a few other supplies and he has his rifle.

181
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But he's sitting there now at this point, he's sitting up in his sleeping bag. He's still checking out Mama Bigfoot being like, hmm.

182
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And he asks, he's curious what's going on. Obviously he says, what you fellows want with me? None of the Bigfoot's answer him. They just keep going about their business.

183
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And so now his next thing is, okay, I've been kidnapped. I have my snuff on me, that's cool, I have my rifle.

184
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I don't know what these creatures plan to do with me. I've never even known these things existed. I've only heard them as legend.

185
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I want coffee. So then he goes on this weird quest about how he can brew some coffee.

186
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And he's thinking, okay, I have a little bit of coffee on me. Like again, dude, come on, you...

187
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Again, that's just part of the story. I've never been kidnapped myself.

188
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 But I don't think I'd ever get kidnapped. Be there for five minutes and go, you know what, I could really use a diet Pepsi.

189
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I definitely want to get up and start looking for a diet Pepsi in the kidnappers' layer.

190
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 But he gets up and he grabs his rifle and he's like, I want to get some water because I got to make some coffee at that point.

191
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Basically, he doesn't get caught. You can want it, but you don't have it. Also, you're surrounded by monsters.

192
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So he basically builds up this narrative. So day one, he has a couple tins of food.

193
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Now the baby Bigfoot's are kind of like checking them out from behind a tree. They find him very, very curious.

194
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Mama Bigfoot and Dad Bigfoot just seem to be doing their own thing. Just kind of walking around, just not really interacting with the main character at all at this point.

195
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And at one point he pulls out his snuff, does a little sniff of it, right?

196
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And the boy Bigfoot walks up to him and is kind of like looking at him and he's like, you want to see this can of snuff?

197
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You want to see the can of the little boy Bigfoot will run away.

198
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Come back here, little kid. Come back here. Now it's kind of creepy the way I'm doing it. Come here, little kid.

199
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Baby Bigfoot comes back over. He has the can. He gives the can of snuff to the kid and the kid's looking at it and then he takes it to Papa Bigfoot and he's like, Papa, what is this thing?

200
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Why are you talking like a baby? You're 12. You're 12-year-old Bigfoot. But me not know, other than that, me not know what shiny thing is.

201
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Possibly some sort of alloy. He's scientist Bigfoot. He actually studied at University of Washington.

202
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Appears to be some sort of metallic thing. Appears to be ore from earth manufactured into tin.

203
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Yeah, give it back. That's all that happens in day one, basically. That's all that happens in day one.

204
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 He's making connections with the Bigfoot family. Day two. Now he's looking at his supplies and he goes, I got to get out of here, right?

205
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I don't know. And this is smart. Because I probably would have just kept on messing around. Checking out Mama Bigfoot trying to hit on her.

206
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Hey, yeah, it's really sucky that Daddy Bigfoot makes you do all the dishes, right?

207
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I mean, don't you ever feel like you have a purpose in life? Don't you ever feel like maybe there's something out there just for you?

208
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Oh, really? You think me have purpose? Me always want to write vampire romance novel?

209
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 She would say, and I'd put my arm around her. I'd have to get a step ladder and put my arm around her shoulder and be like,

210
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I think it's just time that you kind of explored the world. I mean, you got married so young. You got married at the age of 420.

211
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I know, I know, but you still have another 2,000 years in front of you.

212
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Yeah, yeah, let's go into that cave and talk more before Daddy Bigfoot shows up.

213
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Oh, me not, no. Strange man. Strange handsome man.

214
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 That's what I would do. So I would be boned. She would be boned too.

215
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But the point is, is like, I wouldn't be thinking far enough ahead. I'd be too busy banging Mama Bigfoot.

216
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 This guy, again, I'm not an outdoorsy person. This guy is an outdoorsy person.

217
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 So he goes, okay, I've eaten some of my food and I have some food left. That's generally how food works.

218
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 But I'm thinking about getting back home now. It took me 3 days to get up to my camping spot. I was carried for hours.

219
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 So I'm farther away than I thought I should be. I'm gonna need enough food.

220
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 I'm gonna need at least 3 days worth of food to get back. Assuming that I can't shoot a squirrel or a horse at some point.

221
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I gotta have enough food to get back. So he starts hatching his, I would just kept eating the food and banging the mom.

222
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Like, that's just that, and I would have ran out of food and been like, uh-oh.

223
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 I've been eating Baby Bigfoot. No, those are my kids. Hey, sorry lady.

224
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Be free. Go find your own purpose in life. No, you're eating my children. Happy Mother's Day.

225
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 But anyways, Albert is very well prepared and he's not a maniac.

226
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 He starts hatching a plan. He goes, I have to get out of here soon.

227
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Cause I can't keep eating his food. I'll need it to get home.

228
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 So he goes, first off, I'm gonna see, you know, Path of Least Resistance.

229
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 He packs his stuff up, grabs his rifle, stands up and starts to walk out of the clearing.

230
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And Papa Bigfoot stops him dead in his tracks. Says, Soka Soka!

231
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 I'm fine. I don't even know what that means. But I'm assuming from your beard fangs and your muscular physique, I mean, sit down.

232
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 So I'm gonna go sit back down. He goes, okay, that's not good. He's telling me to Soka Soka.

233
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 So I'm gonna go sit down. Now he, the timer's still running.

234
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And he says, I had six rounds in my rifle. Six rounds in my rifle.

235
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 But I don't even know if the bullets will kill these things.

236
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 So at this point, actually, he's sizing up. He's like, there's four of them.

237
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I have six bullets. I think specifically he was trying to size up the dad.

238
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I don't think he wanted to kill the kids. I was ready to eat them.

239
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 But again, I'm not well prepared for this adventure.

240
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 He goes, even if I put six rounds into this giant monster, man, it may not even hurt him.

241
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 So he's kind of thinking, well, I probably shoot my way out of here. It's probably not that smart.

242
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 So he starts to think, let's escape. Let's do a sneaky escape.

243
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 So the next day comes. This is day three.

244
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Mama Bigfoot's walking around. She had gone off on some mini mom adventure, some sight story.

245
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 She comes back and is having a affair with me. She comes back holding these roots and these like brushes stuff, like reeds.

246
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And little son Bigfoot's walking over and he's carrying some sweet roots and he actually comes and he gives it to Albert.

247
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 So they are feeding him at this point. The first two days he hadn't been fed other than the food he was eating.

248
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 But now baby Bigfoot's like, oh, he need nourishment. That's what science is. Bigfoot, teach me.

249
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Living things need to eat too. And he brings him some sweet roots.

250
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 But Albert still think I'm going to blast this kid in the face as he's getting the sweet root.

251
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Thank you, young man. He's imagining a bullet going right into his left eyeball.

252
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 But he's like, okay, maybe I can get someone to bang Mama Bigfoot that will distract her.

253
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 This baby Bigfoot seems to have nice interactions with me. His sister is always hiding behind that tree. That's weird.

254
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Pop a Bigfoot. Wait a second. Baby Bigfoot has interactions with me. Maybe I can trick...

255
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Then he hatches a plant after all of the little elements that popped up.

256
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 After he hears the strange moaning coming from the bushes from Mama Bigfoot, now he knows it's time.

257
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He comes up with this plan. He wants to get the boy to get Pop a Bigfoot over here so he can blow snuff into his face.

258
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 This stuff is toxic. Like I said, it is extremely painful to use as appropriate.

259
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It's extremely painful if you use it the way it's designed. Having it blown into your face would not be fun at all.

260
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Be even less fun than actually using the drug the way you're supposed to use the drug. Here's his thought process.

261
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Here's a quote. This whole story's first person. It's an old-timey story. But here's his thought process. Here's this great quote.

262
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 "If only I could get the old man to come over to me, get him to eat a full box of snuff, that would kill him for sure.

263
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And that way kill himself. I wouldn't be guilty of murder." That's not how that works, right?

264
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Like I'm sure the law--I'm sure there are several laws that if you trick someone into eating poison, that is murder.

265
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And also, why is he worried about it? It's not like this guy's gonna go to the cops the next day.

266
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 "Me assaulted. Me want him held under probable cause." No, he's Bigfoot! People don't even know he exists.

267
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 If he walked into town to file charges against you, they're just gonna shoot him or arrest him or be amazed by him.

268
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Which if the last one, if Bigfoot walked into town and pointed you out and be like, "That man murdered my family, you'd probably go to jail without a trial just because Bigfoot accused you."

269
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 But anyways, that's his plan. He's gonna get it all up in him. He's gonna kill him.

270
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 So anyways, he also has this other thought process going into his face.

271
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 He wants to get all of this stuff all over this dude's face. And then he has this--this is bizarre. This is a really creepy quote.

272
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 "Albert, there's a thing called saying the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet."

273
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 This is the perfect example of saying the quiet part loud.

274
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 He's sizing up the family, so now he's thinking about what he's gonna do. Now he has this master plan.

275
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 He's gonna get this stuff all up in this dude's grill. He's gonna bounce, but he's sizing up the family.

276
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 "The old lady was a meek old thing. The young fellow was by this time quite friendly."

277
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Those are nice things. I mean, meek's kinda lame, but pretty nice.

278
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Well, that's not what we're talking about. Here's the rest of this quote.

279
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 "The girl would not hurt anybody. Her chest was flat like a boy's."

280
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 That's--okay, so first off, that's why you're sizing her up like that. That's gross. That's just gross in general.

281
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Why are you even noticing that? And in noticing that, why are you writing that down?

282
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And as you're writing that down for the world to see, if this part was not in your Bigfoot kidnap story,

283
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 if he had never written this down at no point when someone, a Bigfoot researcher or someone else is reading the story,

284
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 it'd be like, "Albert, Albert, stop, stop." Okay, before you go any further--

285
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 "The girl's--little girl's chest--" No one's asking that question and no one's definitely asking what comes up next.

286
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Let me go back to this quote as disturbing as it is to read.

287
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 "Her chest was flat like a boy's. No development like young ladies. I am sure if I could get the old man out of the way,

288
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 I can't even--I can't even read this. I'm thinking of the implications of this."

289
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Oh my God. Because you can think about this guy writing this story as he's in the clutches of a Bigfoot,

290
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 or just the guy writing the story and his name is Humford, or whatever that dude was from Lolita.

291
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Okay, let me fit it. Let me go back to this.

292
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 "I'm sure if I could get the old man out of the way, I could easily have brought this girl out with me to civilization.

293
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 But what good would that have been? I would have to keep her in a cage for public display.

294
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 I don't think we have any right to force our way of life on other people, and I don't think they would like it.

295
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 The noise and racket in a modern city they would not like any more than I do."

296
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 That's the reason why we don't kidnap people, right? Because it's too noisy.

297
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 "Oh dude, I would kidnap you and take you to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, little girl Bigfoot,

298
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 but I don't live in the middle of nowhere. I live in the big city and super loud.

299
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 So for that reason, and that reason alone, I will not kidnap you."

300
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 But there's a lot of reasons. I mean, that's disgusting, right?

301
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I wonder how many kidnappers out there are like, "I would really like to kidnap, but I don't have the space.

302
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 If only I had some sort of dungeon."

303
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 "I mean, that's bizarre. And again, you would have never, if he had not included that part of this Bigfoot story,

304
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 at no point would you have thought, 'You know, if I was there, I'd probably kidnap the girl.'"

305
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And the thing is, is what makes it creepy is, he could have just grabbed the little boy one who's his friend.

306
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Okay, this is creepy as well. This is equally creepy.

307
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 But the little boy one's his buddy. They could have turned it into a Harry and the Henderson thing,

308
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 but the little boy wanted to go back to civilization with him, and he's like, "No, you have to stay here with your own kind."

309
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 That's less creepy than I'm thinking about kidnapping the young girl.

310
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 But it's too noisy. It's too noisy where I live, so I guess I won't.

311
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 But anyway, so that thought process did pass this man's brain.

312
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 It's the next day. And he's ready to hatch his plan. He's ready to hatch his plan.

313
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Papa Bigfoot's walking around, Mama Bigfoot's sitting there smoking a cigarette.

314
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 She's had a really fun roll in the hay.

315
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Little girl Bigfoot, now we know why she's hiding behind the tree the whole time.

316
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 She's on stranger danger. That's why she's hiding behind the tree the whole time.

317
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 The boy Bigfoot's hanging out. Now he's sitting there, Albert's sitting there with a can of snuff.

318
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 He's kind of taunting the baby with it, and he's kind of now taunting the Papa Bigfoot with it, too.

319
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Papa Bigfoot comes over now. He unscrews it, and he takes a little pinch, and he puts it on his hand.

320
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 He does a sniff, and Papa Bigfoot walks over and is kind of looking and seeing what he does.

321
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Now he wants to emulate this behavior. And Albert's like, "Dude, he just needs to get a little bit closer.

322
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 I'm going to just throw this all over him, dude. I'm going to ruin this guy's day."

323
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 But before Albert can throw the snuff at him, Papa Bigfoot grabs the tennis snuff from Albert's tiny little hand

324
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 and pours it all down his throat. There's a second of clarity, right?

325
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 There's a point in life where you ingest something you shouldn't have ingested.

326
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Now usually it's like, "Oh, I'm on a diet, but I ate a piece of pizza."

327
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And then there's Sam and Sam. "Oh, no, I just ate a ghost pepper given to me by this very sexy rabbit in a dress."

328
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 "Oh, that's Bugs Bunny, and now I'm dying." And then smoke's coming out of yours.

329
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 That is the level of Bigfoot overdose we're talking about.

330
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 He finds some coffee grounds that Albert had had. He then begins swallowing the coffee grounds to try to put out the eternal hellfire

331
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 that's attacking his entire esophagus. Papa Bigfoot then runs to the stream, begins drinking water.

332
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Now it's Albert's time. He truly did not have to murder this man. He simply held out poison. The man took it.

333
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 He grabs a shotgun, grabs his backpack, gets up. He's going to leave his sleeping bag there. He's not going to sleep for a couple of days.

334
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Mama Bigfoot flicks her cigarette to the ground, jumps up because now she realizes something is going on.

335
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 And that's when Albert aims the gun right at her, gets ready to put a bullet right through Mama Bigfoot's brain.

336
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 He aimed it just a little bit higher before taking the shot so the bullet flies harmlessly over my girlfriend.

337
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 I mean, Mama Bigfoot's head, they show she panicked. The little baby one, freaking out. The little girl one's like, "I knew it. I knew that guy was a freak."

338
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And Albert takes off into the bushes. He's running. He's running. Pushing stuff away. Get out of my way, horse.

339
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Moving. I should have written that. Oh, I didn't think about it. Running, running, stepping on squirrels. Running.

340
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 He gets to a creek, a river area, a place. Water. Water is there, right? And he's sitting there.

341
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 [breathing heavily]

342
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And he sees a plane. This is just, again, such a bizarre detail, okay?

343
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 This guy just poisoned Bigfoot, took a mercy shot over Mama's head, took off running. Now he's hungry. Which is fine. It's not weird that you can hungry.

344
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 That's what normally happens to humans. But then, do you know what a grouse is? I had to look this up. It's a bird. It's a big old bird, right?

345
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 So anyways, normally this doesn't happen. I've never seen this happen in, say, Mission Impossible or Transformers, where the hero gets away from the villain.

346
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I never saw that part of Transformers 3 or Shia LaBeouf finally outwits Dylan McDermott, is hiding underneath the city of Chicago, sees a bird flying by.

347
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Like, he's the protagonist of the story. Albert's the protagonist of the story. He sees this grouse or roost or whatever it is. God, here's just a quote.

348
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 She, referring to the bird, she was sitting on a windfall, looking right at me, only 100 feet away. So you have this big, he described it as a big blue grouse or gross. Doesn't matter. Just sitting there.

349
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 He just escaped this horrible kidnapping. He'd been trapped for three days, manipulating the little boy to become his friend. Had to shoot at the mom. Had to poison the dad.

350
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And now he's seeing this beautiful bird just sitting there. She was sitting on a windfall, looking right at me, only 100 feet away.

351
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 I shot her neck right off. This bird just falls around and eats the bird. Now, again, just leave that part out. Just leave that part out of your story.

352
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Again, there's not a scene where Ethan hunts like, "Well, I got away from those Russian kidnappers. They wanted those nuclear codes. I sure am hungry." And you see like a duck walking by, snap.

353
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 "Ara! Ethan, what are you doing? They're truly impossible missions. Not killing animals."

354
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 So anyways, as he gets back to civilization, obviously, he gets back to civilization. He did not tell this story for 30 years until eventually he revealed it in the newspaper.

355
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 He said, "Hey, you guys ever hear about that time when I took a shot at a woman, thought about kidnapping a young girl, manipulated the feelings of a young boy and poisoned a man?"

356
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 And they're like, "What?" He's like, "No, no, no, no." But they were bigfoot. So people go, "Oh, okay, that's a little less worrying. Albert, you be weirdo."

357
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 So I mean, obviously we have to look at is the story true. And you know, who knows? It could just be the ramblings of a crazy old man who wanted a little company in his older years.

358
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 But it could be the story about a bigfoot who wanted a little company in the 1920s. He was alone. His kids were driving him nuts. He's pretty sure his wife was cheating on him.

359
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 So he wanted another man to hang out with. So he kidnapped one, brought him back to his house, introduced him to his family. All he had to do was later be poisoned by his visitor.

360
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Maybe it's true. Maybe man is the real monster.

361
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
