1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Breaking news comes out of Wyoming as Navy SEALS lay siege to a nerd's hideout,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,000
 and then we travel to Okinawa, Japan, site of some of the bloodiest battles of World War II.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Nowadays, U.S. military bases dot the island.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 But is it possible that the spirits of slain soldiers still haunt the land today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
 I hope you guys had lots of fun this weekend.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
 For some of us, it's Memorial Day weekend.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,000
 For others of you, it's just Monday.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,500
 I'm not sure you're listening to this episode three years in the future, and then it's like September 4th.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 But, we are listening to it right now, at Memorial Day.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
 Have a burger for me.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,000
 Ready? Have one at your house, 'cause I'm gonna come and eat it.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Speaking of eating, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, eating a big piece of spaghetti.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I'm running out of ways to introduce Fajr Hands of Orders.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 This one, he's just eating spaghetti.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It's fabricated plastic. Everyone give a round of applause to fabricated plastic, our newest Fajr Hands of Order.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Big mouthful of spaghetti.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Has an apron on that says, "Kiss the man eating the spaghetti."

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Fabricated plastic, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I just need you to get the word out about the show.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Talk about it on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, wherever you hang out online.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Spread the word about the show, that's what keeps the show going.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 That's what keeps the show growing.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Little rhyme there.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Fabricated plastic, go ahead and put down that spaghetti.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 He's like, "Is that really my intro? I'm sorry, I'm running out of ideas."

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Fabricated plastic, I'm gonna go and entach you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But fly low, fly quiet.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 We're headed into a war zone.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 [Demonic sound]

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 We're headed out to Wyoming.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Before we get started on this first story, I wanted to do an update to a story we covered last week.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Where I expose, I did an expose on Throwaway Alien.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It was this whole thing, I'm not gonna rehash it, it was Friday's episode actually.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 You made this prediction, aliens were gonna show up on July 18th.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 He made that prediction back seven years ago, and then this US government report came out.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That's supposed to come out in July 2021, and it just happened to coincide, and it was this huge thing.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Like, "Whoa, is this guy right? Well, he came back and wrote this 31, I actually counted, 31 paragraph blog post about him, and this alien named Gina.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And it was just so ridiculous, and he changed the prophecy and all this stuff.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 He has deleted his account.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Throwaway Alien is no more.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 An absolute exposed lark at this point.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 The post is still up.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But he's deleted his account, that account can never be reactivated.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So the story's done.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Anyone now can pop up and say, "Oh, I was Throwaway Alien, and some guy made me eat a bunch of spaghetti until I cancelled my account."

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 But it's done.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's done.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Throwaway Alien thing, larped too hard, the story is over, and anyone at this point can pretend to be Throwaway Alien.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Don't get any clever ideas?

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But yeah, so that's the end of that saga.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 That's it.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 A fitting end to a story that started off fun and ended up super, super lame.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 It has a lame ending.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Fabricated plastic is flying instead of rabbit-durgible out to Wyoming, and that's when I have like these plans.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I just roll them out on the table, and I pick a dagger up and I stick it through the plans.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Super dramatic.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I needed those plans.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I don't know where we're going now.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 So just kind of circle around the area.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I stabbed the map.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 These are plans of the Irma Lake Lodge.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And I'm like pointing and stuff like that.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I'm pointing, I'm like, "Go right here where this dagger is."

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It's May 17th, 2021.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We're flying over Bill Gates private ranch in Wyoming.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Now, I know what you guys are thinking.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 How did I get such a breaking exclusive?

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 How was I able to cover a story involving Bill Gates ranch?

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Because I follow the only news that matters.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 The juiciest news full of worms and salmonella.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Real raw news.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 This is another breaking article from Michael Baxter.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I'm almost thinking about starting my own podcast called Real Rawcast.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And just that podcast only covers this site.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I'm so close to doing that.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 The Real Rawcast.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 It's a pre-dawn raid on Bill Gates compound.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Navy SEALs are getting ready to launch a raid on Bill Gates compound.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And you, a rational human being, a rational person, goes, "What?

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Where is this coming from?

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Well, let's go back in time a little bit here."

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 If you haven't been following the Real Raw saga,

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 here it is in footnotes.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 YouTube Spotify? I do not believe in this.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Spotify wants to take down all of my Bill Gates stuff.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Anyways, we know what site they're on.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 They're on the cooked news site, not the raw news site.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And YouTube is just YouTube.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I don't believe in this, but this is the Real Raw news summary so far.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 One, President Trump is still president.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And Biden is running the White House from a movie set.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Two.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 That's such a shocking revelation to begin with, right?

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 So that's one.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 You have to believe that part before we move on forward.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And that's already so ridiculous.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Donald Trump is still president.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Joe Biden is running it from a movie set.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 The movie set, that looks exactly like the White House,

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 in the location of the White House,

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 surrounded by employees of the White House, but it's all fake.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 So anyways, President Trump and President Trump is like,

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 "You know what? I'm still president,

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 so I can still do all this presidential stuff, like order around the military."

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So he has been arresting the swamp people, the deep state swamp people.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 We covered Hillary Clinton throwing poop in Guantanamo Bay.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 She was executed by Donald Trump.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And then we covered Nancy Pelosi's face was stolen.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 They thought they were getting Nancy Pelosi,

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 but they just stole a Nancy Pelosi look-alike who was wearing a life-like mask.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 That's where we're at in this saga.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So what does Bill Gates have to do with any of this?

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So Melinda Gates, apparently, in this mythology here,

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Melinda Gates apparently goes to the real White House and meets Donald Trump and goes,

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 "Listen, Bill Gates is a horrible, horrible person.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 He actually...

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 This part's true.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 He did hang out a lot with Jeffrey Epstein.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 That part's true."

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Now, not... I've said this before in my episode with Jeffrey Epstein.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I don't think everyone who hung out with Jeffrey Epstein knew what he was up to,

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 but I don't think everyone also didn't.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So Bill Gates did seem to hang out with this guy a lot.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I'm sure the person who was selling art to Jeffrey Epstein wasn't aware of what was going on,

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 especially before the first arrest, because he was arrested twice.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And Melinda Gates hated Jeffrey Epstein.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 At the very least, I thought he was a very crass, boorish man.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Like, there was no... In the articles I read, there was no hint.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And these are legit news articles.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 These are well-medium, well-done articles.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 There was no hint that Melinda knew what Jeffrey Epstein was up to.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 She just didn't like him.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 She did think he hung out with younger women, but in the sense of like,

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 "Oh, he's in his 60s and he's dating 20-year-olds and stuff like that."

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 There was nothing Melinda Gates...

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 But Bill Gates... I can't say for sure whether or not he did hang out with Jeffrey Epstein a lot, though.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 More than... More than you should hang out with someone who's been convicted of child molestation twice.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So anyways, Melinda Gates, that was one of the reasons she was saying like...

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And it's come out. A lot of stuff has come out with Bill Gates.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 This is in the middle of like, real news and raw news. This is kind of rumor, but he was a flanderer.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like, people are saying like, Spotify...

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 The reason why I keep saying Spotify is I did an episode about Bill Gates being...

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Is he the Antichrist? You guys listen to this show, you guys are smart.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 The episode was called "Is Bill Gates the Antichrist?" or something like that.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And it was talking about those conspiracy theories.

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 That's the one episode of this podcast you cannot hear on Spotify. They removed it.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Even though it's exploring those topics and I'm not saying that any of that stuff is true.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I'm not even saying that stuff is true now.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Spotify, that's the one episode out of 681 episodes. It's the one episode you can't listen to on Spotify.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You can listen to it anywhere else. Weird.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 But anyways, where was I?

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Oh, oh, I was slandering Bill Gates.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Now the rumor is, is that he, like, they were covering up sexual misconduct in the workplace

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 and he was like flirting with younger women and stuff like...

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Younger in, like, overage, like 20s, 25, stuff like that. Not like Jeffrey Epstein Young.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So it still was an unbecoming of America's favorite nerd, Bill Gates.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So let's get back. So that stuff is fairly real. I'll put those in the show notes, those rumors, stuff like that.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But anyways, back to this mythology. Melinda Gates goes to Donald Trump and she goes,

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 "Listen, Bill Gates is not just the world's biggest nerd. He's a supervillain.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 He's excavated underneath his ranch in Wyoming and there's these massive tunnels down there where he canaps children."

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Let me be clear again, this is the real, raw news version. There is nothing to back any of this stuff up.

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Melinda Gates is apparently coming clean with this whole thing.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So that would elevate Bill Gates from just being a creep to literally being a supervillain.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 He has an underground layer full of kidnapped children. So Donald Trump goes, "Do it."

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And so he orders, because he's still president, of course, right, he orders these U.S. Navy SEALs to lay siege to Bill Gates' compound.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 So it's May 17th, 2021. Super recent, right? Should have been the news. They should have been the news, but it's not.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 "Go, go, go!" The U.S. Navy SEALs are running through the ranch and then they're just shooting dudes.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 They're just shooting like stable hands. There's some guy cleaning up cow poop. He's like, "Ah!"

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 No, apparently, this kind of grinds my gears, honestly. I never really thought of this before.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I don't mean to keep going off on tangents because I know you guys want to know the end of this story, but apparently,

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Bill Gates has a paramilitary force at this ranch armed with automatic weapons and they're wearing like this paramilitary gear.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And they engage in a firefight with the Navy SEALs.

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 [imitates gunfire]

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 That really kind of grinds my gears because I never thought of a nerd having an army.

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Like, I get it, like, you need a bodyguard. But even then, it's like dudes you know, like the Jonas Brothers,

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 their bodyguard is like this family friend who just happens to be 600 pounds and seven feet tall is just someone they know.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 That's fine. That's cool, right? But to think someone could be like, "Oh, I've invented a microchip!"

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And then he's able to like buy a thousand dudes to walk around with machine guns. It just sounds weird.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 It doesn't sound right. Like, I think you should earn your army, not just pay for it. You should be like a Cobra Commander guy.

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Well, now that I think about it, Bill Gates is a super villain. Kidnapping children. I don't know why I'm being so harsh on him.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 [imitates gunfire]

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 They're having this gunfight with the Navy SEALs. Now, actually, it's good. I am doing this episode for Memorial Day.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Because we're gonna memorialize these fallen imaginary soldiers, these poor imaginary families that are gonna have the mourn of their imaginary loved ones in this firefight.

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Eight of these paramilitary goons working for Bill Gates, traitors, boo! They got killed by the Navy SEALs. They have no Memorial Day for them.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 For all I know, they were decorated veterans before they had to work for Bill Gates. But still, boo!

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And then we lost one US Navy SEAL. Ugh! Till the daughter who was never born, to a wife that doesn't exist, that I love them both. Ugh!

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And then they fade away into back into the imagination of Michael Baxter.

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 You may think I'm making jokes, which I am. If you look at the comments for this article, so many comments. Here, I'll read you a comment, actually, from this article.

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 This is the very first comment on this article. Quote, "Gates didn't leave the gate open."

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 You like that pun there? I didn't come up with that. This guy did.

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 "Gates didn't leave the gate open, but the SEALs busted open."

197
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 "I am sorry one had to pay the ultimate price, though."

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 He doesn't exist. He's the same thing. It's the same thing as someone being like, "Oh no, poor Han Solo! His son murdered him!"

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 That doesn't exist! It doesn't happen! I mean, I guess you can be sad for the character in a narrative story, but he doesn't...

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Don't be sad for this guy. He doesn't exist. He never existed, dude.

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 The comments are almost as funny. Almost as funny as the article, but I could do a whole podcast just on the comments, but anyways, one had to pay the ultimate price.

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 These Navy SEALs, though, do breach the compound. It's a 15-minute firefight. They do blow away eight of these fictional characters.

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And then they go to a... Again, this is straight out of Shakespeare novel. I mean, maybe this exists? I don't know.

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 If you go... Maybe you can visit this place, Irma Lake Lodge, if you know where it's at. Go to the horse stable.

205
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And apparently there's a bale of fake hay there.

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 You lift this up, there's a 300-foot drop. There's an elevator there. You don't have to be Superman to get down there.

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 There's a 300-foot elevator shaft. That's the word, not drop.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And if you go down the elevator, you end up in this giant circle that's 150 feet in diameter.

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I'm gonna read you this passage. This... This concern... This passage really, really concerns me.

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 For several reasons, let's see if you can figure them out. This was written by Michael Baxter for Real Raw News.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Quote, "The SEALs," our source said, "spent hours scouring the tunnels for signs of life, but no children were found.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 However, the operation was not in vain.

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 As they did uncover a facsimile of a young girl's bedroom with a pink-frame platform bed, stuffed animals, and racks of child-sized clothing.

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Moreover, three... I felt gross just reading that passage. Moreover, three DSLRs on tripods have also been aimed to video whoever had lain in the bed.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 At least one camera still had an SD card." That's gross, because it didn't happen. That did not happen.

216
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 The Navy SEALs did not go to Bill Gates' compound and have this firefight and find this chamber and then come across this pink little girl's bedroom with little girl clothes.

217
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 That didn't happen. And it is very, very concerning to... You guys understand why I'm concerned, right?

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Someone is imagining that. It would be one thing if it was true, if it was factual. You could look at it and go, "Oh, that's sick. Bill Gates must pay for his crimes."

219
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 But it's not. Someone... 'Cause what does that imply, right?

220
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 That's someone... Someone has crafted this imaginary world where this is under Bill Gates' house. It doesn't actually matter if it's under Bill Gates' house.

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 It's actually under the local plumber's house. It's creepy and it's gross. And it makes me... It doesn't make me suspicious of Bill Gates.

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I don't know if Michael Baxter is making this up out of whole cloth or if someone is telling him stuff, but whoever is telling him stuff is clearly lying.

223
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Not only are they lying, they're telling disgusting gross lies that are so specific it puts a mental image in your head of something you shouldn't have a mental image of.

224
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 This article could have been just fine without that passage. That passage kicks you in the stomach. And it's too much. It's too much.

225
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 But I think there's a contingent of conspiracy theorists. Not just conspiracy theorists. I think true crime people get it too, but they get...

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 There is some sort of response to that. That's not anger or revulsion. Titillation, I guess. It's completely unnecessary in the narrative. It's completely unnecessary.

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Hillary Clinton throwing her poop? That's important to the plot? I need to know that. But this, they could have totally left that out. That's there to titillate the reader.

228
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Tune in next, guys. Well, we're discussing some other disgusting thing. Yeah, that type of detail really bugs me and it makes me super sus of what the motivations are.

229
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Like, is it to titillate the reader? Is it to just scam people? I don't know. I don't know. Is it just a fun work of... Not fun, but is it just a work of fiction?

230
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Is someone lying to Michael Baxter? Does he know that this isn't real? His readers don't. Some of them do. You read through the comments, but...

231
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 The unnecessarily gross detail. So, yeah. Why'd you share it with us, then, you jerk?

232
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I think it's just a gross detail. It has nothing in the narrative. It titillates a percentage of the readers of people who shouldn't be getting titillated by that stuff. You know what I mean? It's gross.

233
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Michael Baxter, if you listen to this podcast or if you listen to my upcoming podcast, Real Rawcast, tone it down. Tone it down, all that type of stuff.

234
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Because if you're getting hits, if that's causing people to really enjoy your website, it's the wrong kind of people.

235
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Fabricated plastic. I want you to call in that carpenter copter. We're gonna say goodbye to Bill Gates. He's on the run, too, if you didn't know that.

236
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 If you see him on the news, that's fake. He's actually on the run right now. So, if you happen to see him, if you haven't seen him walking around Seattle, it's probably Nancy Pelosi just wearing his face.

237
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 We're leaving behind Wyoming. We're headed out to Okinawa in Japan.

238
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 [imitates Okinawan accent]

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Now, we actually brought some of those US Navy SEALs with us because this is another military theme to story, and I should also introduce the theme for this week.

240
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I hope you like ghosts because I found a bunch of ghost stories. I didn't even announce it in the beginning. I found so many ghost stories this week.

241
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 A lot of really good ones, a lot of ones that I've never heard of. So, I hope you like ghosts because I love ghosts. We don't cover them enough on this show.

242
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's hard to find compelling ghost stories. We got a lot of good ones this week.

243
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Fabricated plastic is bringing that carpenter copter. We're ready for war. We're actually back in the year that World War II was happening.

244
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 What was that? 1939 to 1944? [imitates Okinawan accent]

245
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Carbenter copters flying through time. Okinawa, Japan was actually the site of some of the most violent battles of World War II.

246
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 That movie, "Hack Saw Ridge," if you guys haven't seen that, directed by Mel Gibson starring Spider-Man, that was in Okinawa.

247
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Other battles that they didn't make movies about, starring Spider-Man. Overall, 12,500 US soldiers were killed. 110,000 Japanese soldiers were killed.

248
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 This was really the last major battle of World War II. This was right outside of Japan. European Front was over with.

249
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Russia's advancing on Japan were advancing on Japan. This was really in Okinawa were the last major battles. The Yamato was sunk during these battles.

250
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 So you had 110,000 Japanese soldiers and up to 150,000 civilians were killed in these battles on Okinawa.

251
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Nowadays, it's the home to six US Marine bases and one US Air Force base.

252
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And it is the first and most likely last line of defense against a Pacific Theater war.

253
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So it's a pretty integral part of the United States military strategy in the Pacific.

254
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So it doesn't help thing that these bases seem to be horribly, horribly haunted.

255
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 On Reddit, there's a user named Banana Tsunami and he posted this story that back in 2015, he worked as an emergency technician at Camp Hanson, which was one of the Marine bases.

256
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 He said that his team included a local ambulance service, so Japanese ambulance service and then local firefighters as well.

257
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And he goes at 2 AM, we got a call that a Marine had suffered a head injury. So we all go down there, we go down to the barracks and the dude is acting possessed or having a grand mal seizure.

258
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I mean, you kind of, there's kind of different ways to treat the two.

259
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 At first glance, we're going to call him Chuck. Chuck goes, the guy's flipping around.

260
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 He has 10 people on him trying to hold him down. His head is actually being held to the ground because he keeps banging the back of his head on the floor.

261
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And he's there to render aid. He's not there to start throwing holy water on the dude, but there's something super awful about this guy.

262
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 He says that he had a couple goose eggs on his face.

263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 You don't know, you don't know. That's a turn of phrase. That just means giant lumps. It doesn't actually mean that as they're holding him down, a goose walked up and was like, the perfect chance.

264
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 His mouth is opening and closing. His eyes are rolling in the back of his head.

265
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And he's screaming, make it stop, make it stop.

266
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 They're treating this guy. And one of the things you got to do is figure out what it is this guy.

267
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I guess they have a problem with spice over there, the, you know, synthetic marijuana.

268
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And you can buy pain pills over the counter. So the first thing, the thing is some sort of drug overdose.

269
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Like what happened? Because that will be different. Was he playing with the Ouija board at 3 a.m.?

270
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Chuck asks the guy's friend. He goes, what happened? He goes, dude, I have no idea. We're standing there. We're drinking beer. It is two in the morning.

271
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 So it's not super spooky yet. We're drinking beer. And then in the middle of conversation, he just changed his demeanor.

272
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 He walked away from me, walked over to the stairwell where there's a wall there and sort of banging his head into the wall.

273
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And that's how he got all those goose eggs. Don't suspect that goose that walked away wearing the trench coat and the little hat.

274
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 He gave him to himself. So he goes, that's weird. And as they're treating this guy, they eventually had to get like one of those backboards and...

275
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 ...strap him down to it. Some of the local ambulance crew goes, yeah, this happens.

276
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I'm like, what do you mean it happens? They're like, it happens.

277
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 So they take him to the hospital and they figure out, like he said the official diagnosis was some medical thing.

278
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 They said like his hemoglobin was breaking down in his liver or something like that.

279
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And it can cause like dehydration and confusion. He goes, but that tends to take time. Like I'm not that dumb.

280
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Like that wouldn't happen instantly. And Chuck was thinking there was another case that he had heard not too long ago in the same barracks of another US Marine just flipping out.

281
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Just being totally normal and then, ah, and then started screaming, get it out! Get it out!

282
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So he did not immediately retire from the service. He did not request a transfer. Apparently Chuck just continued to work there and thought, well, isn't that odd?

283
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Now I read that and I go, that is odd. But you know, it's a Reddit story. Who knows how real it is. There's stuff like No Sleep out there that gets confusing.

284
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 This wasn't from No Sleep, but you know, you always want to check this stuff out as much as you can. You're not always able to.

285
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 So I started looking up Okinawa ghosts. Okinawa is actually considered one of the most haunted military locations, like all the bases in the world.

286
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 The ghosts of Okinawa military bases are so well known, the militaries had to knock buildings down and just be like, it's not worth it.

287
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 This Chuck Banana Tsunami, I'll go by that name now, led me down this crazy rabbit hole. It is so haunted there and the military is like, we don't know what to do.

288
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 This is in terror to our defenses, but it's also super super spooky. Also at Camp Hansen, this military base, there's Gate 3.

289
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 There's multiple ways to get into this base and Gate 3, just like any other gate. You have a couple guards sitting there and they're guarding it. That's why their name is called guards.

290
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 They're on the lookout for that malicious goose. But at 3am, you'd be sitting there reading some girly magazine. This isn't a current story.

291
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 You wouldn't be able to get away with that today. It's 1952, you're reading some issue of Playboy and you hear footsteps walking up to the gate.

292
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 You're like, oh, dang it, better do my job. I better actually guard up this facility instead of looking at pictures of Marilyn Monroe and you look up and there is a World War II era marine standing there.

293
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 You know the uniform? You know exactly that this man seemed to have stepped out of time, but he's drenched in blood.

294
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And he looks up at you and goes, "Got a light."

295
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Now, I don't know if he actually said "Got a light." I just like that because he reminds me of Twin Peaks. He would though say, "Okay, he didn't say 'Got a light.' Fine."

296
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 He goes, "Fine, you caught me. I just want Twin Peaks to be real. This bloody marine would walk up to me. I don't know. It's a bloody ghost.

297
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I don't know why I'm trying to say that he's saying some catchphrase from Twin Peaks. It's a bloody ghost.

298
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 This bloody ghost walks up and he goes, "Got a match." That's not as clever.

299
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 It sounds like he's playing Goldfish. "Got a match." And the guard would freak out.

300
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Would freak out, obviously. There's an apparition. You would know this was a ghost. If not, it goes to just a man who's cosplaying really, really seriously.

301
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 So people were like, "I don't want to work there anymore." And they're like, "Oh, come on, Billy. This is your job. You're in the military. You can't really determine where you want to go. You've been assigned this."

302
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, but it happens so regularly. It was almost every Saturday you'd be sitting at the guard booth and this blood-covered marine, you, right, this one of your countrymen, walks up to you and goes, "Got a match."

303
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 But you figure... Yeah, that's creepy and everything like that, but he's not super spooky if you're afraid of people covered in blood. It's quite terrifying, but it's like one of your countrymen.

304
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Again, it's not like he's like, "Aha, now I'm back for revenge." If anything, he's going to want to look at your girly magazine.

305
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But there was another problem at Gate 3. It wasn't just the bloody marine that was seen there. Sometimes you'd be at the gate. It'd be around 3 a.m.

306
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 But you see other specters appear out of the wilderness. Dead Japanese soldiers lurking just outside of the lights.

307
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 You see three, six, nine dead soldiers watching you from the darkness.

308
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 So the US, this is true. The United States military, we're getting all these reports from Gate 3 and they go, "Listen, we have guns. We can make people do stuff.

309
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 If you don't do your assignment, we throw you in the brig and people are still refusing to work Gate 3."

310
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 So they shut it down. Gate 3 is no longer in operation. You cannot... I guess it's not good to announce on a podcast.

311
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 A bunch of terrorists are like, "Woohoo!" They're like, "Run through Gate 3." They're like, "Yes!" They shut down Gate 3 because it was too spooky to work out.

312
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 But then let's go to Kadena Air Base, also in Okinawa. This one I had a little... I saw multiple sources talking about this story,

313
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 but I wasn't able to verify a key component. It does make me think it's a bit of urban legend, but I'm getting this information from military.com.

314
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 This isn't just... I did see these stories on a bunch of other ghost websites, but my main source for these stories were military.com.

315
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 So it's not like they're sitting around really making this stuff up, but it doesn't mean that the story itself is true.

316
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 It just means that the story has been told over time. And we covered this on the story about the boy in the dishwasher.

317
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 It's not unheard of, and I'll put that in the show notes. It's a really creepy episode.

318
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 It's not unheard of for military to cover up crimes, especially crimes on their bases, crimes involving their servicemen, for moral reasons,

319
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 or to avoid a scandal, or because they had something to do with it. But anyways, Building 2283 was base housing on Kadena Air Base.

320
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Some say, this is military.com saying this, by the way, some say that this house is the most haunted building in the entire U.S. military base establishment.

321
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 So this is where I don't know how accurate this is, but apparently in the 1970s there was an Air Force officer who annihilated his family,

322
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 killed everyone in the house, and then killed himself.

323
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 But military, if it's anything, it's efficient. They have this building, and they need to put people in it.

324
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 So they clean it up, and they just house another officer and his family in this base housing.

325
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And over time, the dad starts to go crazy. He's like, "Ugh, ugh, he's seeing Gooses, he's seeing geese everywhere. Ugh, he's so crazy, he's calling them Gooses."

326
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 He starts to feel paranoid, he starts to feel unwell, his family kind of starts to feel off, and then this guy also murders his family.

327
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 So at that point, huge military goes, "Uh, let's not put any more families in here."

328
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Now I don't know if that's true. I saw that reported a couple places online, military.com, being one of them.

329
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 I couldn't verify this took place. It wouldn't have been in the news, really, because they would have covered it up.

330
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 So the mill--I don't know if that story is true. It sounds like an urban legend, but the military does say we're not putting the generals here in the story.

331
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 They're like, "Oh, I didn't sleep last night, so spooky." They no longer let people live in building 2283. They turn it into a storage facility.

332
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 But it's still in the middle of this base housing, and there's a chain link fence, and on the other side of the chain link fence is the base day care.

333
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Kids are like, "Weee!" They're like running around, but the teachers at the play school realized that they would have less toys.

334
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 The kids kept losing their toys, and the teachers were like, "What's going on with all their toys?"

335
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 And one day they saw the kids were throwing their toys over the chain link fence to the yard of the storage shed.

336
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 They're throwing their toys over the fence, and one of the teacher goes, "Hey, why do you guys keep throwing your toys over the fence?"

337
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And the kids tell the teacher, "The little kids on the other side of the fence want our toys."

338
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 They say, "Give them to us." They're very, very greedy, very greedy, translucent children.

339
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 They want our toys, and we want to share. Should we throw them over the fence?

340
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 That's pretty good arm actually, another thing about it for a preschooler to be able to throw something over a six-foot chain fence.

341
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Who was the shack, the little shack baby. In 2009, the military was like, "Okay, we're done with these spooky stories.

342
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 No one wants to join the Air Force anymore. They're afraid they're going to get sent to this base."

343
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 They ended up tearing down the building. Supposedly, again, rumor, or who knows, the military tried tearing this building down multiple times before,

344
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 but whenever workers would start working on the building, they would suffer hallucinations, headaches, and have on-site injuries.

345
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 I think they're just super lazy workers, and they're like, "Hey, dude, we can get the day off if we tell them that every time we're trying to tear this house down,

346
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 we think about murdering people, and then the military won't make us tear the house down."

347
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And then the coworker goes, "Oh, they'll put you in a mental asylum, but then I won't have to work for like a week or a month. It'll be awesome."

348
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 So that's an easy thing to fake. "Oh, the ghosts are giving me a headache. Can I have the day off, sir?"

349
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 But anyways, they did tear it down in 2009. The most haunted building out of every U.S. military base on the planet is now destroyed.

350
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Interesting story. Interesting ghost story. It's a good way to kick off. I hope you like Ghost Week, because I got a lot of good ones.

351
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And we're going to end it like this. Let's go ahead and put on our conspiracy caps here.

352
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Sure, they're knocking down the buildings and they're closing gate three, and it could be because the military knows that ghosts exist. Apparently they do know these ghosts exist.

353
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Military.com is reporting about it. I don't think there's a general who's surprised by this news if they're based in Okinawa.

354
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 They've at least heard the stories. Whether or not they believe it, they've heard the stories.

355
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 But with our conspiracy caps fully on, when we think of ghosts and possession and banging our heads and all the sorts of stuff that's bad, you know, killing your entire family is bad in general.

356
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I don't think everyone agrees with that. But what if, conspiracy caps fully on, you have military commanders who are looking at a peanut butter and jelly situation.

357
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 They go, one, we need soldiers who can fight war without hesitation. Two, we have an island full of spirits. Some are mournful, some are lost, but some are vengeful and ready to kill again.

358
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 What if Okinawa wasn't selected just because it's a perfect... What if it wasn't selected just because it was right next to Japan, had all of this great landscape for us to build these bases on, and will help us prevent aggression in the theater?

359
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 What if that's all secondary? What if it was some sort of mystical, spiritual, layline type of land where the veil between the living and the dead is so thin, seeing ghosts are commonplace.

360
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 For local EMTs. It just happens. This happens all the time. So you have a division hidden within the military that is trying to fuse living man with a damned soul.

361
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Turning them into the ultimate weapon. Now it goes wrong a lot. People turn the aggression against their allies, their family. People turn the aggression against themselves.

362
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 But what if over time they perfected? They're able to perfect that synthesis between man and the damned.

363
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 It's funny, we're always talking about building the super soldier and they have these high tech suits and these exoskeletons and these smart weapons and we're marching forward in time.

364
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 But what if the real answer is going backwards, building super soldiers using things that most people would consider superstition or forbidden knowledge?

365
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 So a popular science magazine and wired magazine are having these articles about these high tech weapons.

366
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 They've already figured out the formula for the super soldier. There is a platoon of Marines based out of Okinawa.

367
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Right now in the middle of some godforsaken patch of land on this planet. Laying waste to everything in front of them.

368
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 A black ops unit with no morals, no compunction about killing, no hesitation, no regret.

369
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Because these soldiers are not just US special forces. They have the souls of long dead warriors inside their body.

370
00:36:46,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And even if you kill them, their spirit will just find another host. Their war will never end. And that's just the way they like it.

371
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 DeadRabbitRadio.com is going to be our email address. You can also just have it at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio.
