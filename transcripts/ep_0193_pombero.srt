1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
 A rapper is shot dead and within hours the conspiracy theories already start.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,560
 And then we take a look at the story of Jerry Williams, a man who went missing for 18 years

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,680
 and his mother's quest to find the killer.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,200
 And then we take a look at the Pombaro, a small, disgusting, gremlin type creature kind

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,640
 of like a gnome that place tricks on people, moves their car keys, knocks over potted plants.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,560
 If this one has an especially sinister side, it's also a serial rapist today on Dead Rabbit

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
 Radio.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
 We're gonna just jump right in on this because we got a lot of stuff to cover today.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,800
 Nipsey Hussle, rapper, shot dead in the street along with three of his associates.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
 Now I had never heard of Nipsey Hussle.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,520
 I actually may refer to him several times as Nipsey Russell because I'm a little more

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
 familiar with him.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,000
 That's who he got his name after.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,560
 Nipsey Russell was a comedian on game shows when I was growing up and Nipsey Hussle is

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,760
 a rapper, but I'll constantly confuse their names.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,400
 I'm constantly talking about Nipsey Hussle, I think one of the times, it's getting confused

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
 and it's getting confused.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,240
 He got shot down in the street.

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,200
 That happened on Sunday within hours, within hours.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,880
 Let me read you the headline of this article that popped up maybe like 5 hours after he

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
 died.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,200
 All these numbers are part of the headline by the way.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:49,440
 3-3-4-6-4-7-5-8-6-2-6-7-7-4-1-1-8-1-3-7-1-8-7-2-2-8.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,800
 The author of Nipsey Hussle, March 31, 2019 at his store, that's in quotes for some reason,

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,040
 at his store, plus Nipsey Russell, Lauren London, and Dr. Sebi.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,760
 This website is chock full of numerical codes showing that Nipsey Hussle was sacrificed

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
 by the Illuminati.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,440
 Yes, the world controlling organization that controls everything from the World Bank to

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,200
 the militaries all around the world, the global elite, they are responsible for shooting down

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,960
 a 33 year old black man at his place of business.

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,880
 They said, you know what, we've already talked to Kissinger today, let's see Soros, we'll

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,040
 see him tomorrow, what else do we have on the docket?

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,720
 Oh yeah, let's kill this rapper who has one album out.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Ah, that's perfect.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
 Why are we doing it?

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:46,000
 Well, he's 33 years old and today is March 31st and if you add up 3 and the 3 of the

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
 March and the other Illuminati members, like yeah, dude, we know our own code, you don't

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,600
 have to explain it, I was just wondering.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,680
 I'm like, well, yes.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,760
 So the Illuminati goes out and kills this man and others outside of his store, quote

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,200
 unquote store, according to this guy, probably it was assuming it was a drug front or something

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 like that.

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,760
 Within hours, this conspiracy theory popped up.

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,960
 Even when the chauffeur started, I did a couple episodes on XXX Tentation and it's

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,760
 funny because you can kind of see, it took place over three or four episodes and you

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,240
 can see how the conspiracy theory started to grow from him getting shot and it was tragic

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:25,840
 to him possibly having a beef with Drake and then to Bald Barath, Archduke, Demon of Hell,

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
 going down there and killing him with some other gangbangers or something like that.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
 It was absolutely bizarre.

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
 But it took a couple days.

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 This one within hours, this website breaks down the date that he was killed, the age

56
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,400
 he was killed, the numerical value of his last tweet, which was having strong enemies

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
 as a blessing.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,120
 If you add all the letters up, it says 187, which is the murder code in California.

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,920
 It even ties in the release date of his girlfriend's first movie.

60
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,840
 If you break that down numerically, it equals a demon number.

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,520
 The proof is overwhelming and by the word proof, I mean nonsense.

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,960
 The nonsense is absolutely overwhelming.

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,560
 Within hours, shocking to me.

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
 Super bizarre.

65
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,240
 I mean, it's a massive page of just numbers.

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,040
 To that to them is just proof that he was sacrificed by the world controlling Illuminati.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,000
 When they're not busy eating babies or shape shifting into reptilians, they're walking around

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,760
 Crenshaw, murdering people on March 31st.

69
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,440
 You know how many people were 33 years old yesterday on March 31st?

70
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
 A lot.

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,400
 A huge amount.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,940
 Just one third of them got killed or one thirty third of the 33 year old population got killed

73
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,940
 on March 31st.

74
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,440
 I'm not buying it.

75
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,360
 But these people are and what sucks is that this page is going to be up forever and that's

76
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 fine.

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
 I don't want to say that sucks.

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
 It's free speech.

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
 But you know what I mean?

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
 Like this information is up forever.

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
 People who just want to find out a little bit about Nipsey Hussle are going to go to this

82
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 page.

83
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,160
 9 out of 10 people are going to dismiss it or won't be able to make heads or tails of

84
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,360
 it but one out of ten people are going to look at it and say "Hmm, maybe he was killed

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,880
 by Henry Kissinger."

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
 Hmm.

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
 So.

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
 But anyways, whatever.

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,440
 I have no other way to end that segment other than just I'm flabbergasted that it even exists

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,800
 this closely to his death.

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

92
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
 That story just kind of fell in my lap.

93
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,640
 I didn't plan to do it but I was like I gotta cover this weirdness.

94
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,520
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

95
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,360
 In Tallahassee, Florida sits a gravestone and an elderly woman is staring at it from

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
 her car.

97
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,680
 She had it erected just a few days ago but she still visits it.

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,920
 The gravestone sits there in a peaceful graveyard, simply says "Rest in peace Jerry Michael

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,880
 Mike Williams.

100
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,680
 Loving father, loving son, loving brother."

101
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:12,440
 On October 16th, 1969, murdered December 16th, 2000, buried September 6th, 2018.

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,080
 When reporters asked her why did you put the word "murdered" on the gravestone, she had

103
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
 a simple answer.

104
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,240
 She said "In a hundred years from now, when somebody is in the cemetery, it might make

105
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,520
 them go back and look and wonder what happened to him.

106
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,320
 I just feel really sad that my son didn't get to live his life."

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,080
 The story of Jerry Williams is kind of an odd story and it almost sets itself up for

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,280
 a lot of twists and turns but it really starts off with the disappearance of Jerry Williams.

109
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,920
 Jerry Williams on December 16th went out to go duck hunting.

110
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,480
 He gets on his boat, this is down in Tallahassee, Florida so he gets on his boat, has a shotgun,

111
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,720
 goes out early one morning, never comes back.

112
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,280
 It's the normal thing, people start reporting him missing, his wife reports him missing, his

113
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,000
 mom reports him missing, they can't find him.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,880
 They do know that he went duck hunting so when law enforcement goes out and finds his

115
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,080
 boat empty, they fear the worst.

116
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,720
 Now, what they figure happened is that he had his waders on, not like little butlers

117
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,820
 clinging onto him but he had those rubber pants that were kind of heavy and he fell

118
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,800
 off the boat and then he was eaten by alligators.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
 His wife Denise was obviously upset about this, they'd been married for quite a few

120
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,480
 years, the mother is inconsolable.

121
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,640
 She can't believe that this happened but the cops say it was an accident.

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,880
 Six months later they do find his waders butlering around in the swamp.

123
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,480
 Okay, I know this is a bad joke but I have to make this lay hard in some way.

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,260
 They find his waders and they find his jacket like his vest with his ID in it so that point,

125
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,620
 six months later the cops do declare him legally dead.

126
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,220
 They go, alligators must have eaten him, horrible accident.

127
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,680
 But mom doesn't think it's an accident.

128
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,580
 She writes letters to the governor of Florida every single day.

129
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,460
 2600 letters in total.

130
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,660
 Now it's funny because when you write, a lot of people don't know this, when you write

131
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,320
 a government official, you go on a watch list for the most part.

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,600
 I've had friends who've worked in government and they've told me don't ever write a letter

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
 to your senator, don't ever write a letter to your governor.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I'm like why not?

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And they go, because they put you on a watch list.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,480
 It's not a permanent watch list but if you write a letter saying the rent's too high

137
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,760
 or I'm not getting enough money for my corn feed, they will take your letter and they'll

138
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,920
 read it, their staffers read it generally and then they'll put it in a file and then

139
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,780
 that way they can go oh yeah that guy he's been writing us all these letters, they can

140
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,460
 go directly to your file and go this guy is kind of harassing us.

141
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,660
 So don't do that.

142
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,540
 But anyway I know democracy we're supposed to be able to do that but I guess write him

143
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,940
 and tell him you're doing a great job but be friendly.

144
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,100
 But anyways, I don't write letters to my government officials but what are you going to do?

145
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,220
 It's a grieving mother.

146
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,460
 I mean she probably was on a watch list but 2600 letters to the governor over this span

147
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,500
 of time saying please open the investigation.

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,240
 Now what and she would stand on street corners with a big sign saying who killed my son,

149
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,160
 where's my son, just tragic man, tragic, the mom just couldn't deal with it.

150
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,320
 Rightfully so.

151
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,520
 So that happened in 2000 when he went missing.

152
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,680
 There were certain cops who were like I don't think that is what happened to him, I think

153
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,960
 something else happened to him but there was no evidence.

154
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,800
 In 2004, four years later, I don't know how they came across this information but I imagine

155
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,740
 a cop was taking his kids to the zoo, went to the alligator exhibit and the zookeeper

156
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,660
 said alligators actually don't eat during the winter.

157
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,460
 They stay low in the water, they do all they're eating when it's warmer and when it gets

158
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,180
 super cold they stay at the bottom of the water where it's not freezing for them.

159
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,180
 And the cop's like eating his popcorn standing next to his kid being like uh oh.

160
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
 That's not good.

161
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,060
 He goes back to the precinct, hey guys you won't believe what I learned at the zoo and

162
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,060
 he still has like a giraffe balloon and he's still like wearing his shirt that it's like

163
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,800
 his picture is face imposed on a monkey.

164
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,040
 They're like dude why are you in here with that uniform?

165
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 He's like stop it, stop it.

166
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,880
 Hey let me tie my balloon down so it doesn't fly away.

167
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,120
 Alligators do not eat during winter months.

168
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,400
 There was no way that Jerry fell off that boat and was eaten by an alligator because

169
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
 it was in December.

170
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,800
 And the other investigators are like is that caramel?

171
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 Is that caramel popcorn?

172
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 Can I have some?

173
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,320
 He's like yeah yeah take the popcorn but what do you think about my theory and they go

174
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,520
 that's actually quite fascinating.

175
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,220
 So the cops decide to reopen the investigation but the problem is four years have passed

176
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,140
 and they treated the original disappearance as an accident so they didn't secure a crime

177
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,580
 scene or anything like that.

178
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,540
 Now we're going to fast forward to the year 2016.

179
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,820
 So 16 years after the disappearance.

180
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,820
 Denise Williams ended up remarrying a man named Brian Winchester and they were actually

181
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,700
 friends with Jerry.

182
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,300
 Like Jerry and Denise were married and then Brian and his wife were married and they'd

183
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,080
 go on double dates together.

184
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,600
 But after Jerry disappeared, Brian ended up leaving his wife for irreconcilable differences

185
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,080
 and Denise and Brian started dating and eventually got married but in 2016 the marriage started

186
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
 to fall apart.

187
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,360
 She wanted a divorce.

188
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,080
 She said he was a sex addict and she couldn't deal with it anymore which is probably why

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,640
 he got divorced to his first wife.

190
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,240
 Denise gets the divorce and one day she's driving to work and she sees something for

191
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,300
 a quick second in the back of her seat she turns and Brian Winchester jumps out of the

192
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,020
 back seat like the boogeyman puts a gun to her head and says drive to this location.

193
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,620
 Now she does the smart thing.

194
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,260
 She drives the opposite direction and parks outside of a grocery store.

195
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,860
 So now there's a bunch of witnesses around and he starts freaking out and he goes please

196
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,180
 don't leave me, please don't leave me.

197
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,340
 I'm going to kill myself and all this stuff and she's saying don't kill yourself.

198
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,700
 Like that's not smart.

199
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,740
 Just give me the gun.

200
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,960
 You know we obviously I'm not going to get back together with you because you're threatening

201
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
 me.

202
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,960
 I don't think she said that but I think that's what was going through her mind.

203
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,400
 Eventually she talks him down from killing her and killing himself and then oddly enough

204
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,280
 she drives him back to his car so he could go home and creepy this part was creepy he's

205
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,120
 like thank you thank you Denise I'm so sorry I'm just going to get out of your car now

206
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,360
 I never meant to hurt you and as he's getting out of the back of her car she sees him grab

207
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,420
 two plastic sheets, bleach and a tool.

208
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,420
 So he was basically about to murder and dispose of her and he's like you're not going to

209
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,660
 call the cops right I don't want to go to jail man I'm so sorry and she's like of course

210
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,780
 not Brian despite all we've been through you're still my husband at one point until I got

211
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,020
 you being a sex addict and he's like thank you and it's not an addiction it's just like

212
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,860
 I can stop anytime I want and she's driving off.

213
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,920
 So she immediately goes to the police and says yo let me bust the flow for you no she

214
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,720
 goes so no she walks into the police department and she sees like a deflated animal balloon

215
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,920
 on the ground and she goes my ex-husband just put a gun on my head trying to kill me and

216
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,960
 then kill himself so they arrest him and he gets charged with kidnapping and attempted

217
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,160
 murder and all this stuff and gets sentenced to 20 years and at this point the cops are

218
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,420
 thinking okay we have a widow of a man who went missing she remarries one of his really

219
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:32,460
 really good friends since high school and he threatened to murder her so maybe he has

220
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,380
 something to do with disappearance.

221
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:43,340
 Brian Winchester sold life insurance and before Jerry went missing he sold a bunch of life

222
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,420
 insurance that was not necessarily under Denise's name or it was hidden that she had recently

223
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,400
 purchased this life insurance on her husband totally $1.75 million and the police were

224
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,320
 like if we had known that back then she would have been a suspect but she wasn't because

225
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,600
 we didn't know that it was hidden well and the person who sold it to her was now in prison

226
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,200
 for kidnapping so they go to him and they're like listen we're pretty sure you have something

227
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:20,060
 to do with the murder of Jerry Williams and Brian Winchester goes yeah yeah I killed him

228
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:28,920
 but but big asterix there Denise ordered me to he tells this tale is absolutely tragic

229
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,260
 that him and Denise had been having an affair for years and they decided first to kill both

230
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,180
 of their husbands and wives on a boat accident and he's like I don't want to kill the mother

231
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,080
 of my children also that'd be really suspicious if two people died and two people lived and

232
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,000
 then they ended up getting married but anyways he said you know what I remember once I went

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,360
 hunting with your husband and during the affair and he fell into some quicksand and I stood

234
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,200
 there for a second and thought I could just let him drown no one will ever know and I'll

235
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,920
 get to be with his wife my girlfriend but something took over and I pulled him out of

236
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,560
 the quicksand and so Denise goes that's perfect why don't we stage a hunting accident we'll

237
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,220
 leave it up to God if he survives it's because God willed him to survive and if he doesn't

238
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,740
 then we can be together so no one else knew this but Denise but on that duck hunting trip

239
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,220
 it was Brian Winchester and Jerry Williams in that boat and after is really like five

240
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,500
 in the morning it was super dark after Jerry had put on his waiters which Brian was like

241
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,860
 hey you should put on your waiters it was weird situation the guys like really he's

242
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,660
 like yeah put him on you look so snazzy in him Jerry put him on he puts him on Brian

243
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,240
 and then pushes him into the water but he doesn't drown even with the weighted pants down he

244
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,880
 bobs back up to the surface somehow and swims to a big tree stump sitting in the middle

245
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,480
 of the lake and at that point Brian Winchester is looking at him and he circles his boat

246
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,320
 around gets closer to him and shoots him in the face with a shotgun now he hauls the body

247
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:06,640
 up and buries it buries it nine feet deep goes home cleans up goes to Christmas party

248
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,100
 so they had the murder of Jerry Williams solved but now the police had to go after the wife

249
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,840
 Denise what is absolutely bizarre though that whole story is heartbreaking you can imagine

250
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,200
 the young man clean clean on to the log and seen his best friend circle the boat after

251
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,600
 knowing that he got pushed into the water seeing the boat getting closer and closer to you

252
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:33,160
 the shotgun aimed at you and all that stuff but anyways all that being said in 2018 Denise

253
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,520
 was also arrested for the murder of her husband and she was sentenced to life in prison with

254
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:46,840
 absolutely no physical evidence none she never confessed they had a couple recordings where

255
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,040
 she would say stuff like what do you know what's going on but see Brian said the reason

256
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,940
 why I kidnapped her and wanted to kill her because I was afraid she was going to turn

257
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,000
 me into the police because we are getting a divorce but what he ends up doing is turning

258
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,080
 her into the police after he got a 20 year sentence it's possible that she had nothing

259
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,040
 to do with it at all he gets 20 years for kidnapping her and he makes the whole story

260
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,640
 up it's possible but the police say now she has something to do with it life in prison

261
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,480
 no physical evidence the word of someone who's already facing 20 years who you broke their

262
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,180
 heart now do I think Denise is guilty yeah probably and I think she's guilty because

263
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,300
 if she didn't know about it at the beginning what you probably did but let's say she didn't

264
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,740
 she definitely knew about it when she got the $1.75 million coming in like obviously she

265
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,420
 had bought I think that's really what they hung their hat on the prosecution that she

266
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,740
 had bought this life insurance and stuff like that but crazy story and that poor mom for

267
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:53,000
 a decade and a half trying to convince the rest of the city that her son was murdered

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,560
 and they finally find him in a bog they was actually so well preserved some of his clothes

269
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,280
 were still on his body she never gave up she kept fighting for the truth about her son

270
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,960
 and in the end that she has the truth etched on his gravestone he was murdered he was murdered

271
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,120
 and his life was ended very short you know it's funny this episode is actually kind of

272
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:29,420
 depressing this next story we are going to beautiful where does this take place oh yes

273

278
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,800

282
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,060
 beautiful stuff around us quit worrying about the geography but at a certain point he goes

283
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,060
 you know I am a little parched we need to go get some lemonade so we all go to this

284
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,580
 house this house in the middle of nowhere which is already creepy enough but we are

285
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:32,500
 in the house and you feel like something is watching you the whole time you turn you

286
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,580
 look you see like a little shadow run by you think oh it's just a cat walking upright

287
00:19:37,580 --> 00:20:07,580
 he kind of brushed it off even though you still hear the hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

288
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,160
 because you can feel like something is watching you and what is watching you is known as a

289
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:21,000
 palm barrow they are also go by the name Pyroggy which means hairy feet or Karai Pyhair which

290
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,120
 means Lord of the night or man of the night and Night Man from it's always sitting in

291
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,920
 Philadelphia popped in my head and then I realized what they are describing is basically

292
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,280
 Danny DeVito okay before I read this first description I love you to death Danny DeVito

293
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,620
 but this is what the palm barrel looks like he is short and ugly short arms hairy hands

294
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,940
 and feet and the feet are so hairy it actually gives him like a stealth movement like his

295
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,220
 hairs are actually like dampening the noise so it's not just like hairy feet on the front

296
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,660
 hairy souls which seems incredibly uncomfortable imagine having a million little pebbles in

297
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,580
 your shoes but you don't have shoes and they are attached to your body he lives in forest

298
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,840
 he lives in abandoned homes sometimes he lives in your home sometimes he is hanging out where

299
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,120
 you live sometimes he is tired of living all by himself he wants to go into a home with

300
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,200
 a family these things are very very well known in parts of Argentina Southern Brazil and

301
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,960
 all of Paraguay very well known to this day they are still considered they are basically

302
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,920
 on the equivalent of a big foot type creature where everyone knows about them everyone has

303
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,360
 like a legend and some people have encounters with them there is YouTube videos about these

304
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,980
 little ghoulish creatures walking around Nicholas had heard growing up that they lived in potted

305
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,700
 plants inside your house so again it's an the big foot at least you're like well as

306
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,420
 long as I don't go to the Pacific Northwest I don't have a problem imagine if big foot

307
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,140
 was your roommate like and you can't get rid of him he's just like hanging out in your

308
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,940
 house obviously you'd be able to go like a big foot as he's knocking stuff over but

309
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,620
 the palm barrel is actually like a gremlin where even if you caught him he would just

310
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,680
 snicker and run away wreck stuff in your house steals your car keys knocks over your plants

311
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,780
 kicks your cat does whatever and then he'll go out to your farm and start killing your

312
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,220
 animals like strangling chickens ripping the udders off of cows that's kind of gruesome

313
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,240
 but he's just like messing with your livelihood so what they oh oh and he also has a special

314
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,960
 target he goes after kids who slingshot birds people who little kids are shooting pebbles

315
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,180
 at birds he totally hates them now the palm barrel before he shows up he has a couple

316
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:40,900
 quirks he'll whistle he'll whistle and it sounds exactly like a bird and then he'll

317
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,460
 make his appearance so just kind of walk into the scene there's a YouTube video of a bunch

318
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,020
 of adult men sitting around and then a palm barrel shows up I'd have seen the video years

319
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,460
 ago it's really kind of creepy it could be fake most likely is but it's still creepy

320
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,080
 but before he shows up you hear the whistle he whistles because he's talking to birds

321
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,280
 and that's why he hates kids who go after birds with slingshots he also has an affinity

322
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,560
 for rum honey and cigars which again reminds me Danny DeVito if he's messing with your

323
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,200
 livestock or if he's running around your house tipping over tables and stuff like that basically

324
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,680
 poltergeist activity but this one is real you just give him some you leave out some rum

325
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,380
 and some cigars on your windowsill and he'll actually won't go in your house he's already

326
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,660
 in there you're kind of SOL but you can still give him this stuff and eventually if you

327
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:35,020
 give him enough rum and cigars he will become he'll like you so much he'll become a guardian

328
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,740
 of your property protecting it not only from other palm barrows but just bad actors in

329
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,900
 general smoking that cigar drinking that rum I don't know if I would want to protect her

330
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,180
 who was sloshed all the time from all the rum but better than nothing it's better than him

331
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,960
 attacking you to this day a lot of farms will still leave out glasses of rum and a cigar

332
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,480
 on their windowsill superstition possibly but they still do it because they go I want the

333
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,560
 Pombero to be my friend if you ever want a free drink go to parts of Argentina Southern

334
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,040
 Brazil and all the Paraguay and just walk on a farm I doubt anything bad will happen

335
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,520
 to you you'll get a free shot of rum if not a free shot of buckshot in the brain for trespassing

336
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,100
 so that would be that right you got this little gremlin type character gremlin-esque creatures

337
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,420
 are all known all over the world sometimes they're poltergeist sometimes they're just

338
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:30,260
 little guys messing with the planes of World War two fire pilots whatever that would be

339
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,140
 it normally would just be a normal little cryptid this one though has a special ability

340
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,620
 that I actually think ranks it in some of the most dangerous cryptids out there he's

341
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:48,680
 a serial rapist which is not normal I mean you can have go like sex with ghosts and stuff

342
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,960
 like that sometimes you hear about that or you can have suck you by but this one actually

343
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,200
 not only can rape women doesn't want anything to do with men because he has children I can't

344
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,560
 think of I really can't think of another cryptid that breeds with humans they may have cryptids

345
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,640
 like a succubus who has sex with a man and then has like demon babies but this one the

346
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,140
 ponderos has sex with you and you have a ponderos and it can do it by one of two ways one it

347
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,660
 can just touch the woman's belly you just touch a woman's belly and she gives birth

348
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,620
 not immediately not like she's like and then a baby pop sound but he can impregnate a woman

349
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,400
 by touching her belly or he tricks them to have sex with him or even brainwashes them

350
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:40,480
 to have sex with him so he has all of these magical powers right he can appear as I think

351
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
 even though he's tricking him and brainwashing them they're still banging a three foot tall

352
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,920
 little monster man I don't think it ever shows up and is like hello I'm Brad Pitt haha just

353
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,080
 tricking you I'm a goblin I think he's being like hey come in this abandoned barn like

354
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,160
 a rapist I don't think he's like a shape shifting into a good looking dude he's basically like

355
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,840
 no it's safe you can walk across the ice in this lake and then she falls in and she

356
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,640
 gets half frozen and you know he's crazy he's a rapist he's a horrible little monster man

357
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,960
 and then you give birth to a ponderos and the thing is is you give birth to a baby and

358
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,160
 it's ugly or and or Harry other people in the region go really you got tricked by the

359
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:30,040
 ponderos and they assume the ugly baby is a monster now I that's super bizarre to me

360
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,360
 I don't understand like a let's say you have a baby and it's super hairy and everyone in

361
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,680
 the town is like oh man got a ponderos baby what happens when that kid grows up and it's

362
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,280
 like six feet tall do they think he's just the giant ponderos but do they just go oh

363
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,440
 no I guess he wasn't a ponderos we just called him a monster for the first five years of

364
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,720
 his life and then he got taller than three feet or even when he's an adult do they say

365
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,360
 he's like mom mom who's my father and she just points to the jungle and go he's out there

366
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,320
 you'll find him in parts of Argentina Southern Brazil and all of Paraguay and he's like

367
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,040
 ah it's only happens to single women though if you're married or dating you don't have

368
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,440
 to worry about the Ponderos getting you so again you know all of these stories generally

369
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,400
 come out of morality plays all of these cryptids the old versions of cryptids one don't shoot

370
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:28,480
 rocks at birds or the Ponderos gonna get you to don't be single ladies forget Beyonce song

371
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,280
 or a Ponderos will get you and three I don't know what the third one is I don't know what

372
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,800
 the morality tale is for the farmers but anyway so that's the that's really how these legends

373
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,880
 grow is the Ponderos real who knows I mean whether or not he's real I think is the less

374
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,400
 interesting question because we can ask that about every cryptid I think there's a more

375
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:58,320
 interesting spin on this the idea that a cryptid can breed with a human successfully for centuries

376
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:06,240
 is fascinating to me absolutely fascinating the children that the women of course is most

377
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,640
 likely not true but again let's put on our imagination caps here the children that are

378
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,400
 born from these women are and all appearances human other than the fact that they're ugly

379
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,720
 and hairy but we would have to really go back to the days of old like the Old Testament

380
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,800
 when the angels were apparently interbreeding with the women on earth and giving birth to

381
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,600
 the heroes of renown that was one of the reasons why the world was flooded according to the

382
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:40,840
 Bible between the Old Testament and the stories of Ponderos today how many other cryptids have

383
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:48,960
 successfully impregnated and really successfully infiltrated the human species how many monsters

384
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,680
 or goblins or wraiths have had intercourse with women giving birth to not just a little

385
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,280
 monster baby but a new branch on the human evolutionary tree it would be odd to think

386
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:09,280
 that every genius every person who has unbelievable physical strength or speed all these people

387
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,120
 that we look at as normal humans and go how can they do that how is that possible that

388
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,480
 he can do that I can never do that what if all of them can trace their family line back

389
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:28,840
 to a foggy night in a barn somewhere or an attic or a graveyard or some cryptid unknown

390
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,920
 to us brainwashed a young woman and inserted their seed into the line of humanity ridiculous

391
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:46,560
 I know but we do live in a ridiculous world but you know what every day doing the show

392
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:53,800
 I don't always find proof of monsters but I always do find proof that this world is

393
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:03,120
