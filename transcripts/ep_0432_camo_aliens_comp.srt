1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 In the year 1946, was a giant penguin terrorizing residents of Florida?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is it possible to tell a UFO story that's so insane, UFO researchers think you're trippin' on shrooms?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then we take a look at the story of two young boys out for a walk.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 They think they're just passing through a town they've all been to before.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 But what they've actually walked into is the past, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I bought a game for myself, since I'm locked up in isolation, not a video game.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm trying not to play those so much.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's a escape room, which actually now that I think about it, it's kind of ironic.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I'm trapped in my apartment and yet I got a game where the goal is to escape.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 But you know the escape rooms, they have them, they're this real thing.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 They have escape rooms in a box.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 This is called exit the game.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I got the haunted roller coaster, apparently.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 So it's for one to four players.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So I'm just one player.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I'm sure it'll probably be easier with four people.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 But it says one to two hours of playtime.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 So I'm gonna give this guy a shot.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I'm gonna play this, and you can only play it once too.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 You have to rip up game pieces and open envelopes and all that stuff.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So you buy it, it's like 15 bucks.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You buy it, you play it once, then you throw it away.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But we'll see how that goes. I'll let you guys know tomorrow.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Also, more importantly than that, more importantly than the sad story of me playing a game by myself,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 we have a new Patreon, Eva Marie.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Eva Marie, thank you so much for supporting the show.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And it is also Eva's birthday, April 25th.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And since that episode's Saturday, we're giving her birthday wishes today.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 We'll consider the next two days, Eva Marie's birthday days.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So thank you so much for supporting the show.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I'm sure you guys could tell from the intro.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We got three stories. Let's go ahead and get started.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Eva Marie, fire up that carbonar copter.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We are headed out to Clearwater, Florida.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And we're going back in time to the year 1946.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Now, this was a recommendation from Stealthy Steve.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And I got to say, I was talking to Stealthy Steve last night on Instagram.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 We got a great week of stuff coming up next week.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 This week's, no, I'm not saying this week's any sloucher.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I really like this episode, but stay tuned next week.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 We're going to talk about some stuff Stealthy was talking about,

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 and we're going to revisit a conspiracy theory brought to us by Ori.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 That's a little bit of a tip of what next week, I haven't done a theme week in a long time,

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 so really excited about next week. It's pretty dope.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So thank you Stealthy. Thank you Ori.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 You guys know what I'm talking about. The rest of you guys are insuspents.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Eva Marie, take us down.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 We're now flying through Clearwater, Florida.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 It's all, you know, like palm trees and stuff like that.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Old people doing their thing.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Lil Baby Scarface is just being born in Cuba right now.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But we don't have to worry about Scarface.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Stopping people up with chainsaws.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 We're just coming here to check stuff out.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Clearwater Beach, Florida. Let's hop out of the Carbentercopter.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 We're sitting on the beach now. It's beautiful.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 It's nighttime. The moon is rising.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Feel that breeze on your face. It feels nice, huh? It's been a while.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Splash, splash, splash, splash.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 We all look over. What's that?

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Tap you on the shoulder. Look over there.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 In the darkness, you see it.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Barely. You just see a form.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Splish, splash, splash, splash.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Walking through the surf.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now you're getting scared. You're trying to crawl in my lap.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I'm like, "Bro, bro, no, no, no. Settle down, settle down."

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Don't worry about it, I say, with a knowing smile.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Everything's going to be fine.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So what happened here? That's a weird intro.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 What happened here?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Back in the '40s, people in the town of Clearwater started finding giant footprints.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Now, Manute Bull was nowhere to be seen.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Actually, Manute Bull was probably a baby back then, too.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Actually, Manute Bull probably wasn't even conceived.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Most of you are going, "Who's Manute Bull?" It doesn't matter.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Giant feet, right?

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Giant footprints all over the wilderness areas of town.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But it's not just a big foot, so you can think it's some sort of Sasquatch.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 No. Or Manute Bull. No.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 It has three toes.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Now, you had people all over town going, "What incarnation is that?

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 What could have caused something like that? It looks like some sort of big flipper."

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And so people go, "Maybe someone's wearing flippers. Maybe someone's playing a prank."

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And someone else comes forward and goes, "There's no prank, young men."

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 He needs his glasses just so he's talking to people his own age.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They're like, "Come on, Larry. We're all your own age."

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 He's like, "You youngins don't know anything about the cryptids."

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 They're like, "Oh, come on." They all start leaving. He can't see they've left either.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Many moons ago, as he begins, you started getting reports of people seeing a monster walking along the beach.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 So now you have footprints, you have physical evidence.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And then you have eyewitness accounts of a bipedal, massive creature.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 So now, cryptid hunters are coming into town.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 This went on for the course of a couple years, honestly, about a year or two.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Got a lot of attention in local newspapers.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And I think a combination of that is people are curious about the unknown,

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 and it's always a slow news day, right, especially when you're the Clearwater Gazette.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So it helps you fill up pages, helps you move copies.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 But anyway, so the media is promoting this. People are seeing this thing.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 They're finding these footprints everywhere.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 You have Cryptozoologist Ivan Sanderson comes out to visit the scene.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Now, by the time an actual Cryptozoologist gets there, this thing's behavior has escalated.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Sometimes they'll find a little feather.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 What? Hmm, that's weird.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Actually, not a little feather. That would just belong to a regular bird.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 A giant feather. What?

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Once they found a lifeguard tower, knocked over.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 People get there.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Obvious saw marks. There's a saw laying next to it, a bunch of sawdust.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Only a monster from the deep could knock over a chair like this.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And it was even, they were even finding poop.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Now, which, you know, yesterday I talked about they were finding poop, or is it there too ago, finding poop of the giant monster walking around the Amazon?

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Who is it? Hey, I already forgot. And even if I remembered, I couldn't pronounce it.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Mopaginchy or something?

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Anyways, it's funny because they always find poop of Cryptoz.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 That's a big thing. Like, oh, look at this poop. It must be alive. They're always finding poop.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 You never find poop of ghosts or aliens.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 That's something to think about. Next time you're going poop, go. I wonder why we never find alien poop.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Now, obviously, the people who believe in Cryptoz tend to believe they're biological entities.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 They don't believe, someone will believe in Bigfoot, but not believe in fairies. See, that's ridiculous, right?

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Eight foot Talsimian being completely undiscovered for hundreds of years, that's believable.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But a little tiny gnome that can magically pop in and out of reality. What? You're crazy.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 So, they're always trying to find physical evidence.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And this one, you had people go, listen, based on the footprints, this has to be a penguin.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 We found a feather, which I didn't even know penguins have feathers.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So, right there, you can say, Jason, why are you debunking all this other stuff? You don't even know the biology of a bird?

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 The point is, I don't care about the biology of a penguin, right? I know about ghosts and poop. I care about those things.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 So, whether or not a penguin has a feather, I'm not for sure, but they're finding these feathers.

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 People have now seen it, and they're instead of just being a blobby outline in the middle of the dark ocean,

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 they've actually said, no, what I saw was a giant penguin.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Now, cryptozoologist Ivan Sanderson says, yes, it is a giant penguin.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Now, I believe that it got away from its natural habitat.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 But my question is, and the question that was never answered in any of these articles,

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 what is a giant penguin? Because when we're talking giant, we're talking like eight feet tall.

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 See, what happened was, the footprints were just, there wasn't like a light dusting.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 It wasn't just like a little pad hitting the ground. They were putting depressions into the dirt.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 They were creating such deep depressions in the soil. The soil had to start taking medicine.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Or, because the depression, get it? Anyways. Anyways.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 The point is, is that, the point is, is that they're finding these really deep depressions in the soil.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So, they knew whatever it was, it had to be massive.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And people started seeing it and they said it was a seven, eight foot tall penguin.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And then, Ivan goes, oh yeah, it's just a penguin that got away from its natural habitat.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 There's no place on earth that I know of, again, not a penguin expert,

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 but there's no place on earth that I know of where there is an eight foot tall penguin.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 The penguin sightings, though, continued and Ivan continued his work,

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 and people would walk around picking up poop and being like, you're Rika.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I found some of that giant penguin poop. I'm gonna sell this to the National Enquirer.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Well, someone did eventually end up talking to the media. This is what makes this story so interesting.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And again, Stealthy Steve, thank you for recommending this story.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 1988, April 11th, 1988, this dude comes forward. He talks to the St. Petersburg Times.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Talks to reporter Jan Kirby. This guy comes forward and says, yeah, we made it up.

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 We made it up. And he was laughing so hard.

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Him, so you had Tony Signorini and Al Williams.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And they used to pull pranks on the town people way back in the day.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Here's some of their-- These are their pranks.

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Whenever you watch YouTube pranks that quote unquote go wrong, oh, a social experiment,

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 they're usually staged, right? But even then there's controversy.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Like, how could PewDiePie have those guys hold up that sign?

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Here's the pranks these guys did. They locked a horse in a jail cell in the local sheriff's office.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 That would be considered an act of terrorism right now.

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 You'd have breaking and entering. You'd have interfering with police business.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But these two jokes, these two boner pullers were able to get a live horse into a jail cell

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 without anyone noticing. That's one of their pranks.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 They also thought it would be hilarious if one night when all the firefighters were sleeping in their firehouse,

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 you know where this one's going or probably don't, I couldn't have expected this.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 But how do you top horse in a jail cell? Mess with the fire department.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 They get a weather balloon, right? Which right there-- When's the last prank you ever saw on YouTube

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 when someone involved a weather balloon? They get a weather balloon, they tie it somehow.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 These guys were obviously ninjas or everyone went to bed at 7 p.m.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 They got the weather balloon, they tied it so it's floating over the fire department.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Well, now like that's not a prank, dude. There's just a balloon over the fire department.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 No, they rigged it with explosives as well.

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So when the firefighters are all sleeping, boom, a massive explosion happens right over the building.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It jumps up thinking that the town is on fire. They all run out and there's just two dudes laughing hysterically at them.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 "Oh, you should have seen the look on your face when you thought all your loved ones were exploded."

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 That's so funny, bro. You should have seen it.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 You thought everything you owned was turned to dust.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 So it doesn't strike us as odd is that what happened was these guys saw like a National Geographic article

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 about dinosaur prints and they looked at each other and go, "Dude, we can do this.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 We can pull this prank." And what happened was they made these feet of like cast iron.

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Each foot weighed 30 pounds and just made it look like a giant.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 They didn't, I don't think they specifically set out to be a penguin, but they just made a weird looking foot

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 and the guy had to like weevil wobble because they were so heavy he would go, "spshh."

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And the other guy was just there for emotional support and to probably give him beer

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 and the one go, "spshh." And then he would swing the other leg as far as he could, "bam, uh, bam."

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And what happened? What happened? They said, "We did it the first night and nobody was around."

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 But the footprints were found and then people in town started saying they saw the giant penguin walking around the beach

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 and they were looking at each other and they're thinking, "That's that guy's lying because there was no one there."

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And it was weird because it gave them a, they gave them a look at human psychology.

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 We've covered a lot of stories like that. I did an episode a long time ago about the Great Moon Hokes

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 where newspapers started publishing that there was life on the moon and then other people started saying,

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 "Oh, I have a telescope too and I saw it as well." It was all fake but other people started adding to it

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 and they 100% believed it. And so it was interesting because it gave these two guys, it gave Tony and Al

199
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 a behind-the-look-scenes at how human psychology works because they know exactly what it is.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So when the cryptozoologist comes in and was like, "Oh, it must be a giant penguin."

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 You know those dudes were dying of laughter all the time.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 They got their mouths shut and then eventually Al passed away and then Tony was telling the story afterwards.

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So that's the story of the Clearwater giant penguin. It didn't exist but people believe it existed for 40 years.

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 There was physical evidence. I don't think Al and Tony were taking dumps.

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I think they're just like, "Oh, now to make the evidence even more compelling."

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Tony, what are you doing? I'm just being in character. I don't think that was going on.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 They were probably just finding random poop. But I think it's interesting because one, it's very Scooby-Doo-ish, right?

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Like, isn't that pretty much what every Scooby-Doo is?

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 If these guys are trying to buy up beachfront property, they want people to believe in the monster.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 That'd be one way to scare people. I don't know who would be scared of a giant penguin, but probably someone.

211
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Fish. The band Fish probably wouldn't like that. Fans of Fish wouldn't like the penguin.

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Anyways, the point is, is that interesting story that I think that it should...

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I'm sure there are a lot, I'm not saying all of them, but I'm sure there are a lot of big footprints out there that are fake.

214
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 That were faked by guys like this pranksters, people who thought it'd be funny,

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 people who are committing fraud also to get more money for their Bigfoot hunting organization could be that.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 But I think a lot of times a lot of paranormal activity really can be chalked up to two dudes with nothing better to do on a Saturday night

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 than to kind of pull our chains, those of us who believe in the weird and the wacky.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I think it probably happens more often than we would like to acknowledge.

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Let's go ahead though and move on to our next story. Even Marie? Let's hop back on the Carbenter Cofter.

220
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Even Marie? Take us up, up and away. We're leaving behind Giant Penguin.

221
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 So we say goodbye to Al and Tony. We were waving goodbye.

222
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 One of them is dead, but whatever his force ghost is there, we're waving by.

223
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 No more pranks guys, they're like, "Hehehe, they're pranking God."

224
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 They're like, "Oh no dude, I totally saw Satan man, he just started, he started the book of Revelation early

225
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 and God's like, "What, what, he's putting on his bathrobe and stuff like that?" Haha, just kidding.

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 God's like, "Why you?" Anyways, we're flying away as God's eternally smiting them,

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 turning them into Giant Penguins. We're gonna fly from Clearwater, Florida.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 We're flying up to Colorado. Now once again, the story is at night time.

229
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 September 2nd, 1994. We're cutting down low. We're flying right over the treetops.

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I hope you really know how to maneuver this thing, even Marie.

231
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 We're flying, we're flying through a canyon now. Tie-frags are after us.

232
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 We evade them. We end up landing in the Greenhorn Mountains.

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 This is in Huforano County, Colorado. September 2nd, 1994.

234
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Twinkle-ing Twilight time. There's this guy, we're gonna call him Jacob.

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Dude named Jacob, local hunter working in the area. And he's out, he has his rifle checking it,

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 making sure all the bolts are in there. I don't know what you do with the rifle.

237
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I mean, other than shoot people or animals, and then, you know, clean it occasionally.

238
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 He's doing that. He's shooting people and animals and cleaning it occasionally.

239
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And then he hears a rustling in the dark forest.

240
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And he grabs his gun, he's ready to shoot whatever it is.

241
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 It doesn't matter, he's not even gonna ask, and then all of a sudden, aliens appear out of the darkness.

242
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Now, that's the most normal part of this story, okay?

243
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 That, the aliens showing up is easily the most normal part of what we're about to talk about.

244
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 These aliens, he doesn't describe what they look like, but the fact that he's identifying them as aliens

245
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 just right off the bat, where you're hearing that terminology, let's just assume they're greys, okay?

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Because it'll just make the next part infinitely ridiculous, right?

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 If it was a normal looking human alien, it's not as funny.

248
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 But anyways, these aliens are dressed in camouflage.

249
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So, remember when you were a kid and you got your dad's army uniform out of the storage?

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 That's what I imagine these guys looking like.

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 I don't imagine they had, because, you know, aliens normally have like skin tight suits on.

252
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I imagine these are gray aliens with tiny little bodies and giant heads, wearing super baggy,

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 army surplus store camouflage.

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 They're wearing camouflage, which we have never seen before in UFOology.

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Now, again, he doesn't go into detail whether or not this is skin tight, high-tech camouflage predator level.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So, we just have to assume it looks like these guys just went to the surplus store.

257
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They're walking in super baggy pants.

258
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Belt is pulled incredibly tight.

259
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But yet, camouflage is camouflage, right?

260
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It doesn't really help when your head is three feet high and gray, but whatever.

261
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 The rest of them is camouflage.

262
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 These aliens then attack him.

263
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Now, he does go for his gun. He tries to react, but they pull out a gas gun.

264
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Passes out, and then he wakes up.

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And he's tied up, and the aliens just have a perimeter set up around him.

266
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 He says that they never fed him, and the only way to keep himself fed was him eating grasshoppers.

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The aliens seem-- Hold your questions! Hold your questions right now, because, trust me, I had a ton of them right there, too.

268
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 The aliens seem to be doing some sort of maneuvers.

269
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 They seem to be doing some sort of military maneuvers. They're like hiding me on trees.

270
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Remember, again, when you guys were kids, we broke out the super soakers. We'd be like, "Hide me behind--"

271
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 I had a game we called it "Water Wars." One shot, one kill.

272
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It wasn't like, "Look how wet I can make you! No, I can make you more wet!"

273
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 You got shot? You're done.

274
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 We played paintball with water guns, and it was dope, dude.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And there was an arms race.

276
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 When those super soakers came out, and they were like the size of a small child--

277
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Domination, dude. I was blasting dudes from 50 yards away.

278
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Maybe not that. 50 feet away. Big difference. Big difference. 50 yards away.

279
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I don't think that's a super soaker at that point. I think that's a fire hose on a fire truck.

280
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 But he's-- Anyways, this isn't "Water Wars," man. Don't get a twist that this guy's being held prisoner, eating crickets.

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Grasshoppers.

282
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 I don't know the difference, but he's eating both. It doesn't matter.

283
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Finds a giant feather. Hmm?

284
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Did I just eat a giant penguin? I don't know.

285
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Actually, I heard the difference between a cricket and a grasshopper.

286
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 No, the difference between a grasshopper-- Cricket's something different.

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 The difference between a grasshopper and a locus is that a grasshopper--

288
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I don't know. I saw this recently, and I don't think it's true. It didn't sound right, but--

289
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 If a grasshopper-- There's an-- It sounds so ridiculous.

290
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 If a grasshopper gets hungry enough, and there's a bunch of them, he morphs into a locus.

291
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Okay, I did not-- I did not see that on, like, a Disney Channel show.

292
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Now, I did not read that in a Bazooka Joe comic show.

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I'm pretty sure I read an article recently about those giant hordes of locus that were plaguing Africa.

294
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And they said there's really no difference between a grasshopper and a locus.

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It's just when a grasshopper gets really, really, really hungry, and there's a bunch of them, he morphs into a locus.

296
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Even though I'm the one stating that fact, I don't really think that's true.

297
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 'Cause then, that just doesn't make sense.

298
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 If a bunch of bears are hanging out, and they're like, "Oh, I haven't eaten in a while,"

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 they don't become a mecha bear, they don't become, like, all bristly and become even more violent.

300
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I don't know, maybe they do. Maybe the mecha bear is a real thing.

301
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Let's get back to this story.

302
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So he's eating grasshoppers and/or locus, and the aliens are performing some sort of maneuvers.

303
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Now, eventually, though, the aliens are like, "You know, stop it!"

304
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And all the aliens gather together, and then one of them holds their hand out in a little tiny silver orb.

305
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 [imitates orb sound]

306
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It's floating there.

307
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And then, "Bah-bah-to-pe-to-pe-to!"

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And then, like, the orb gets bigger.

309
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 [imitates orb sound]

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And the dude, Jacob, is just sitting there, mouthful of grasshoppers.

311
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 They're turning into locus as he's eating them.

312
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 [imitates locus sound]

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 But he's not worried about that right now, because there's this glowing giant orb,

314
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 and the aliens are like, "Nah-nah-nah-nah!"

315
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Saying goodbye to him, he thinks he doesn't know.

316
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And then a door opens up, and they crawl into this thing that was previously the size of a hand.

317
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Now, all these aliens are getting into it.

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And then this object, "Nyuh-nuh-nuh!"

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Turns into a bear.

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 [imitates bear sound]

321
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Nyuh!

322
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Turns into a three-headed wolf.

323
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 [imitates wolf sound]

324
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Nyuh!

325
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Turns into a cloud, and floats away.

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 [imitates wolf sound]

327
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 [imitates wolf sound]

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Eventually, I don't know if he untied himself, or if law enforcement got there first.

329
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Probably at the same time, he's like, "He's all tied up for a couple more days."

330
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 He's like, "Oh, wait a second, they're gone! I can totally untie myself!"

331
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Law enforcement shows up, they find his truck completely trashed.

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 They find him with barely any clothes on.

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Most of his clothes have been set on fire, and are just like half burned, laying around the area.

334
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Also, another hunter in the area had gone missing during this time period.

335
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And while the cops were talking to Jacob, and they're like, "What happened?"

336
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And he's like, "You won't believe what happened."

337
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So first off, do you have anything to eat?

338
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 That doesn't taste like a grasshopper.

339
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 They're like, "Yes, here's some fried chicken. He's all bleh."

340
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 No.

341
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Nothing greasy, no greasy meat.

342
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Secondly, so this is what happened, and he repeated the story I just told you.

343
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 While he's telling the story, the other hunter that the cops are also looking for that had gone missing in the area shows up.

344
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 [panting]

345
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And he looks at Jacob, he looks at the police,

346
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and then he ran away into the woods.

347
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Got in his car and just drove home.

348
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So we don't know what happened to him.

349
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 He got home safely.

350
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 He didn't magically disappear, missing 411 forever, but whatever he saw there made him panic.

351
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Now, it could have just been a half naked dude with a mouthful of grasshoppers surrounded by law enforcement.

352
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Could have made him run away.

353
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 The suggestion is that maybe he had a similar experience,

354
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and was afraid the aliens were going to come back.

355
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 We don't know.

356
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Anyways, a lot of questions, obviously.

357
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 First off, my main question is, we don't know how long he was tied up for.

358
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Two, how do you eat grasshoppers when you're tied up?

359
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Those are my-- and it's funny, you're like, "Jesus, there's a shape-shifting UFO

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 that seems to have some sort of nanoparticle growth thing."

361
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 You're worried about how do you--

362
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 You know, the thing is with stories is that it's the little details that you get hung up on.

363
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 If it's a lie, it's a little-- how do you capture-- first off, how do you eat enough--

364
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 First off, how long was he tied there?

365
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Because he goes-- the story basically goes, the aliens gassed me.

366
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I was tied up, I had to eat grasshoppers because they wanted to feed me.

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Did two hours pass? Are you that hungry? You can't go two hours?

368
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Oh no, I've been tied up for at least 35 minutes.

369
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Gotta eat these grasshoppers. That's his fetish.

370
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 He's always looking for-- Jacob, you're going in the woods again just to pretend that you're lost like Survivor Man

371
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 just to eat more grasshoppers? What? No way! I told you I was done eating grasshoppers!

372
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I've come so far! Dammit, I'm not gonna let those grasshoppers get in those delicious yummy grasshoppers

373
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 get in the way of my recovery.

374
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Jacob, quit dreaming about grasshoppers.

375
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 So that's possible, right?

376
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 But how long was he tied up for? I would assume it would take at least two days for me to start eating grasshoppers.

377
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 But again, we don't know how long he was tied up for.

378
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Secondly, how do you capture-- Grasshoppers are kind of hard to catch, right?

379
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Especially when you're tied to a tree. Or tied to anything.

380
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Kind of hard to catch, but anyways, maybe they sat him down right on a hive of grasshoppers.

381
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 They're slowly turning into locusts underneath his body.

382
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 He's like, "Oh, it's like a vibrating mattress that I'm sleeping on."

383
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And then, you know, there's stuff about the teleporting aliens wearing camouflage,

384
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 nanotechnology, shape-shifting UFOs and all that stuff.

385
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 All that stuff's also weird. It is interesting that I got this from the website 1994,

386
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Think About It Docs, but it also-- I found the book it was originally published in.

387
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 It's called Secrets of the Mysterious Valley.

388
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And it's pretty much the same story verbatim.

389
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 There's not much new information in the book itself. It's very short.

390
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 However, there is one key piece of information.

391
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 The guy writing the book makes fun of this dude.

392
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And basically, he tells the story and then he goes, "It sounds weird.

393
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Let me actually read the actual passage to you."

394
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Because he really kind of put it into very succinct words more than I could do.

395
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Let's see here. Here's the quote.

396
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 When he's talking about all the shape-shifting UFO stuff, quote,

397
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 "Could it have been a Manita mushroom season or another flashback from the 1960s?"

398
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Unquote.

399
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 So basically, he's accusing the dude of going on a drug trip or having a bad flashback.

400
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 That's pretty bad when your alien story makes other alien people think you're insane.

401
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 But maybe that's the point.

402
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I mean, think about it. If aliens are trying to disguise their time here on Earth,

403
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 the more insane they make stuff, the better.

404
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 There was an X-Files episode where the men in black turned out to be Jesse Ventura and Alex Trebek.

405
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And that's the point.

406
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Because if you told someone, "Yeah, I saw this UFO and then Alex Trebek and Jesse Ventura came up to me and threatened me,"

407
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 you're going to get laughed at.

408
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 What if this is the only true alien sighting?

409
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Because it's so ridiculous. That's not true, though. It probably is made up.

410
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 But still, an interesting story, nonetheless, nonetheless.

411
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And I think--I'm sorry. I hate to do this. It seems like I do it once every two weeks.

412
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I've ran out of time. I know the episode's not super long, but I don't have enough time to tell the time-slip story.

413
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 That involves a little bit too much than the amount of time we have left.

414
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 So we're going to call it a day.

415
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I'm sorry that today's episode was a known, provable fraud and a story that's so bizarre that UFO researchers think to do it as high.

416
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And that's a pretty--I mean, they believe--UFO researchers believe a lot of bizarre stuff.

417
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 So the fact that this guy's getting dismissed.

418
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 So, yes. Oh, that was--I meant to do that, though.

419
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 The theme of this episode was stories that were either fraudulent or people think are drug trips.

420
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 That was actually the theme. That actually might be the title of the episode.

421
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I actually should think about that--frauds and drug trips.

422
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 But we will save the time-slip story for tomorrow, our Friday episode.

423
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 We'll be dope, and then next week we have an awesome theme for next week.

424
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 So it'll be really good.
