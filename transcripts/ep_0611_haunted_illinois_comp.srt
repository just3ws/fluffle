1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
 When a stable maid goes to check on a pretty little pony, she doesn't realize she's about

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,520
 to be thrust ear first into a mystery.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,920
 And then we travel to Illinois to take a look at the haunted roadways and spooky bridges

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,040
 of that state.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,320
 We're going to be facing down phantoms and more earthly menaces.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
 And it's an interactive adventure today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,320
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,320
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right off.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,800
 First off, writing in Dead Rabbit Command on a haunted stagecoach is our newest Patreon

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,160
 supporter Creepshow.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,720
 Everyone give a round of applause to Creepshow.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,760
 He's all spooky looking and stuff like that.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,240
 I'm assuming that's not his birth name.

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,240
 But it is your birth name.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,480
 I apologize for making fun of your name.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,720
 But Creepshow is like, it's Creepshaw.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,320
 It's actually French.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,280
 Creepshow you're going to be our spooky captain or pilot of this episode.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,440
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you're not French, that's fine too.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,960
 Just help spread the word about the show.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
 Really really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
 We also have a merch store.

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,600
 It's in the show notes.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
 Now Creepshow, I'm going to toss you to get out of the spooky spooky coach.

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,440
 It's kind of scaring us all.

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,280
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,080
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command and we are headed out to the United

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
 Kingdom.

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,040
 Take in the Dead Rabbit Durgible over there.

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,440
 Creepshow is all creeping up the place.

34
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
 We're all hiding from him in the corner.

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,240
 But I'm speaking loud enough that he can listen.

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,840
 He's not left out of this episode.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,440
 Recently I talked about the 40 and map on the show.

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,040
 It's basically an interactive version of the conspiracy theory iceberg.

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,000
 And a lot of you guys emailed me and said, "Hey, how do I find it?

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 How do I find it?"

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's in the show notes.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,120
 And I also didn't really make it label it well in the show notes.

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
 So it wasn't on you.

44
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
 It was on me.

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
 All of it was on me.

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,600
 It was on the show notes in this episode too.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,720
 So if you guys want to check out the 40 and map, it's a global map of all these weird

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
 events.

49
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,640
 And it's a really cool place.

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
 When I've done all of my other assigned reading for the day, all the websites I normally go

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,240
 to, I always end off the day with a couple clicks of the 40 and map.

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,200
 Now Alexandra Watts, a long time listener of the show, hit me up with something she

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,160
 found on the map.

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,720
 And she goes, "This is the dumbest story ever.

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,440
 Like, why is this even on the map?"

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,800
 So I said, "Let's put it on the show."

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
 So thank you, Alexandra.

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
 She's like, "No, don't put this story on the show, dude.

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
 Don't put it on the show."

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 I thought it was goofy.

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,080
 Creep Show, go ahead and land the Dead Rabbit Durgible right here.

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:39,640
 We're in the United Kingdom and there's a little pony hanging out in a stable.

63
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,880
 We're walking into the stable.

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
 We're brushing her hair.

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 Her name is Misty.

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,800
 Misty the Welsh pony.

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
 And we're brushing her hair.

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,280
 That's an old reference.

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
 How come they've never remade Mr. Ed?

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,520
 They should totally make a live action Mr. Ed with a CGI horse and you would have the

71
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,720
 rock as the horse trainer and Kevin Hart as the voice of the horse.

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
 How has that not been done?

73
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,880
 You're like, "Because that's a stupid idea, Jason."

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
 No, it's not.

75
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 Mr. Ed.

76
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,840
 Anyways, for all of you listeners under the age of 80, there's a show about a talking

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
 horse.

78
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,080
 I'm pitching script ideas to Misty.

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,960
 I'm like, "Come on, I can make you star.

80
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
 I can make you star."

81
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,400
 Let's get to the real story.

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
 So we're coming.

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,120
 And Alexandra was like, "I knew the story was going to go sideways very, very quickly."

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,080
 We're playing with Misty.

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
 We're combing her hair.

86
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,720
 And then a stable maid comes in.

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
 We all got a hide.

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,520
 We've broken into the stable and that's supposed to be her.

89
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,800
 A stable maid comes in and she's actually doing her job.

90
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
 She's like, "That's weird.

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,320
 Misty's hair looks really combed.

92
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
 Where are all these scripts doing in the stable?

93
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,960
 Looks like someone is trying to pitch this horse scripts."

94
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,560
 But that aside, she ends up going back to the, after she does her job, she goes back to the

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
 estate, the house where everyone else lives at.

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,760
 And she goes, "Hey, you guys won't believe it.

97
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
 She's reading the script."

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,320
 She's like, "Oh, this is really compelling."

99
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,200
 She goes in the master's house or the estate house, whatever it is.

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
 This is modern times.

101
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
 I didn't really set the story up very well.

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,600
 This is like a couple of years ago.

103
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,800
 This isn't like ancient feudal Europe, but this is like pretty recent.

104
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,440
 This story did go sideways.

105
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,840
 I guess I shouldn't have done it.

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
 This is fairly recent.

107
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,280
 I didn't write down on my notes, but I think it was like 2012.

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,440
 She goes into the estate house and she goes, "You guys won't believe what happened.

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,000
 I was down at the stable and Misty's ear was humming."

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And everyone's like, "What?"

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,520
 They're like, "That's impossible."

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 And she goes, "I know.

113
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,960
 I know it's quite impossible, but as I was in the stable, I could hear a diiiit coming

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
 out of her ear.

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,920
 It sounded like how your ear buzzes, Lord, Lord Buzzer.

116
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,480
 But it sounds like how a human's ear has that tinnitus in it.

117
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,040
 But I heard it coming from the pony."

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
 And they go, "Puppycock, that's impossible."

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
 But Misty's not doing too well.

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
 She also has a lip tumor.

121
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,920
 And they go, "We got to take her to the vet.

122
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,440
 We got to take her to the vet to take care of this lip tumor."

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,960
 And as they were at the vet, apparently they also informed these surgeons that the stable

124
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,280
 girl heard buzzing coming from Misty's ear.

125
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
 And they're like, "That's impossible."

126
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,160
 And they're like, "Yep, that's what we thought."

127
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:40,160
 They end up removing the tumor from Misty's lip and then immediately, "Doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,880
 They get to the left and actually looked at my notes.

129
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,160
 April 1995 is when the story took place.

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 The doctors could hear it.

131
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
 The owners of the horse could hear it.

132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
 Everyone could hear it.

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
 This sound was so loud.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,080
 They said it sounded like a quiet conversation.

135
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,900
 And you could hear it up to three feet away.

136
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,240
 They could never figure out what it was.

137
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,940
 They said sometimes it would get louder and sometimes it would get quieter, but it never

138
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,600
 ever went away.

139
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,360
 And in 2004, Misty unfortunately died.

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
 And when she died, the sound stopped and just went away.

141
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,360
 They did an autopsy on her and they could find no reason for this.

142
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
 Now, Alexandra sent that over to me.

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,880
 She's blushing at this point that I keep bringing her up, but she sent the story to me and she

144
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
 goes, "What a ridiculous topic.

145
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,120
 What a ridiculous conspiracy theory."

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,320
 Now on the 40 and map, there's a lot of stuff on there that I could not verify.

147
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,080
 That's these weird little stories that may or may not be true.

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,520
 There's just no proof of it.

149
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
 This story is 100% true.

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,200
 I was able to find articles backing this up.

151
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,200
 There's an article about it on newscientist.com.

152
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,960
 This is a 100% legitimate story.

153
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,160
 And what it is, this happens.

154
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,080
 It's called objective tinnitus.

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,580
 Humans can have it too.

156
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,120
 You know how you get the ringing in your ear?

157
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,440
 Sometimes the follicles in the ear mutate and they'll move the wrong way.

158
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,720
 So the tinnitus will go out of you instead of into you.

159
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,440
 You won't hear it, but other people will.

160
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,600
 They say it happens in humans.

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 It's incredibly rare and generally you need a stethoscope to hear it.

162
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,120
 Because it's not that loud.

163
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,600
 But for whatever reason, this horse, they don't know why the tumor was the trigger.

164
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,360
 They said the stable maid had heard it before.

165
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,320
 So she just might have had better hearing.

166
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,400
 But once they removed the tumor, everyone could hear it.

167
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,200
 They don't know why that would amplify it.

168
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
 But it is a real thing.

169
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,720
 And humans can have it and humans can transmit it, but it's never that loud.

170
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,280
 Misty is the only one we know.

171
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,680
 It gets that loud and I was reading about horses, because that's my job now.

172
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,920
 Horses don't have the best hearing in the world.

173
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,480
 Like dogs hear better than horses.

174
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,800
 It's better than humans.

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,480
 But they say it's possible that horses tend to have more ear problems.

176
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,960
 And they go, that's the theory of why they shake their heads.

177
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,480
 They go, because their ears like hurt or something like that, which sucks, because they can't itch them.

178
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
 They got no fingers.

179
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,080
 But yeah, so if you ever see a horse go, uh, give him my script, give him my script for

180
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,840
 my Mr. Edryboot and then say, sorry horse, you must have something in your ear.

181
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 Creepshow, I'm going to give you the keys to the carbonar copter and then you use your

182
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,120
 creepy magic to extra spookify the carbonar copter.

183
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,760
 Creepshow's like, yeah, now my style is in effect.

184
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,880
 We're leaving behind the UK.

185
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,960
 We're headed out to Illinois.

186
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,200
 So the other day I got an email from a dead rabbit radio listener named Nicholas and he

187
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,400
 actually sent me some really cool articles about haunted places in Illinois.

188
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,080
 And I love doing interactive adventures.

189
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,680
 They're actually really hard to pull off.

190
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,480
 The things have to align right.

191
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,720
 You have to have the right set of stories.

192
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,800
 So I'm really glad that I got these stories.

193
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,520
 Nicholas hats off to you.

194
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,740
 Really appreciate you sending this stuff over.

195
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,560
 So I want you guys to pick a number between one and four.

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
 Got it?

197
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,960
 Okay, here we go.

198
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,720
 First off, we're going to Camp Falcon.

199
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
 That's about 15 miles outside of the town of Crete, Illinois.

200
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 Camp Falcon.

201
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 It's by Tinley Creek Woods on 143rd Street.

202
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 Cars are driving by.

203
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,720
 We've gotten out of the Jason Jalopy and we see just a bunch of grass and trees.

204
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
 Now there used to be some cabins there.

205
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,180
 They're no longer here.

206
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,620
 But we're going to go back in time, just a couple years, when these cabins were there.

207
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,340
 It actually used to be a camp.

208
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,900
 So you had three cabins and a dining hall and then a few other outlying buildings.

209
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,140
 Now because it was, it wasn't super far away from civilization, but it was far enough to

210
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,140
 be spooky.

211
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,660
 Plus it was a camp.

212
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,380
 Camps are always spooky.

213
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,500
 According to hauntedplaces.com, there's no reason why these buildings are abandoned.

214
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,640
 They go, it's a mystery of why this camp 15 miles outside of the Crete, Illinois area

215
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
 is abandoned.

216
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,960
 Well, based on my research, I have a couple theories of why it may be abandoned.

217
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,280
 Hauntedplaces.com is great.

218
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,000
 I discovered this not too long ago.

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,120
 They have a comment section, so people will review haunted places.

220
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,840
 A lot of times they add additional information and spookier information.

221
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,440
 In the comments of this place, there is a man named Axeman.

222
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,020
 Here's his comment for prospective ghost hunters.

223
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,380
 "Don't go back there.

224
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,220
 The bums that beg on 143rd and Harlem live in there, they will attack you."

225
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,220
 Unquote.

226
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,100
 There's no, there's no doubt in his mind.

227
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,380
 This obviously happened to this guy.

228
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,700
 He's not saying, I don't know, the place is a little sketchy.

229
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
 You might get attacked.

230
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
 Don't go back there.

231
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,760
 He's already gone there one time.

232
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,560
 He got attacked by hobos.

233
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,860
 And what's funny is he specifies the neighborhood of the hobos.

234
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:56,880
 Which means as he was driving there, he passed 143rd and Harlem, saw a bunch of hobos, live

235
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
 in there and he's like, "Oh, that's weird."

236
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,600
 I mean, not that there's hobos, but those particular hobos, I had a vision of the future.

237
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
 And then he drives a little bit further and starts walking around the woods and then those

238
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
 same hobos show up.

239
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,280
 And he's like, "Ah, local hobos.

240
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
 Don't go back there."

241
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,660
 Even a man whose online moniker is Axeman is telling you watch out, not watch out from

242
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,200
 him, watch out from hobos, listen to him.

243
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,140
 Listen to the man named after a weapon when he says, "Don't go there."

244
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,060
 But that's another reason why they closed it.

245
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,820
 They didn't close it because Axeman's bad yelp review.

246
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,780
 The camp's not gonna be like, "That's it guys, wrap it up."

247
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
 Axeman wrote a review.

248
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,060
 They're like, "Oh no, Axeman, let's go back in time to the year 1987."

249
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,220
 This is a real story.

250
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,480
 This isn't rumors.

251
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,120
 This was actually reported in the newspaper.

252
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,560
 "1987, the Girl Scouts were using the campgrounds at that time.

253
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,080
 There was 25 girls and there was eight adults.

254
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,240
 It's 3.30 in the morning.

255
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:02,920
 They're sleeping and then all of a sudden, "Hey girls, hey girls, come out, come out."

256
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,400
 They hear people, they hear that.

257
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,480
 They hear what I just said.

258
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,640
 Everyone's woken up in these cabins.

259
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,940
 They hear people pounding on the doors, windows, and walls.

260
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,940
 Let us in, let us in.

261
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,140
 These two men, these two drunk men had shown up at 3.30 in the morning and began to bang

262
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,500
 on the doors and in graphic detail explain what they're going to do to the Girl Scouts.

263
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,460
 They're going into detail about what they're going to do to the women and the girls.

264
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,180
 The campgrounds, this is 1987.

265
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,660
 No one has a cell phone.

266
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,200
 The only phone is in the dining hall.

267
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,720
 These guys are going back and forth between these cabins.

268
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,320
 Again, it's not in the middle of nowhere, but no one else is hearing this.

269
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,040
 They're banging on the walls, the windows, and the doors.

270
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,320
 They're there for 30 minutes.

271
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,520
 Could you imagine someone banging on your door for 30 minutes?

272
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,480
 Saying that, I mean, that would just be annoying, but if they're also saying what they're going

273
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,720
 to do to you in graphic ways, they're like, "Ugh, you can handle that for maybe two minutes."

274
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,260
 Anyways, they do leave after a half hour, but you think they're going to come back.

275
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,380
 So two of the adults had to sneak out of one of the cabins, go, they call the cops.

276
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,300
 It took the police another hour to show up.

277
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,540
 They ended up going to the wrong location.

278
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,100
 They got attacked by bums and were like, "Ah, call for backup, call for backup."

279
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
 They went to the wrong haunted campsite.

280
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,700
 Apparently, there's a lot of them in this area.

281
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,060
 It took them an hour to get there.

282
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,540
 I think that's why they played.

283
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,780
 Would you rent that loa-- those guys were never caught.

284
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,780
 They were never caught.

285
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,340
 Would you want your kids to go to camp there?

286
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,620
 Would you want to run a camp from there?

287
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,320
 I think that's why it's not an operation anymore.

288
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,200
 But if you picked number four, you are now standing at Camp Falcon.

289
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,480
 It's spooky nighttime.

290
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,360
 You're looking around and you see something scuttling the bush.

291
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
 Scuttle, scuttle, scuttle, scuttle.

292
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,720
 You turn and then you see scuttle, scuttle, scuttle, scuttle.

293
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,760
 Like I hope that's a good scuttling and not bad scuttling.

294
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,880
 And then you start to see coming out of the bush a hobo.

295
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,140
 The ultimate enemy of all dead raviouranial listeners.

296
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,980
 He's a hobo and he's walking normal.

297
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
 He's just walking normal.

298
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,500
 I'm not going to make it super spooky.

299
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,180
 But you pick number four and you turn around and then you see more hobos coming.

300
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,660
 And then you look to your left and there's another hobo just standing there and he's

301
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
 taking his head.

302
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
 And then you look to your right and there's an opening.

303
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,060
 You're like, oh, this is totally dope.

304
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,300
 And then you walk.

305
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,940
 You bump into an invisible hobo.

306
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,500
 And then you get bit.

307
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,100
 And then the next thing you know.

308
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
 You wake up.

309
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
 It was all a dream.

310
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,400
 This podcast doesn't exist.

311
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,320
 You totally jumped out of this podcast existed.

312
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,520
 No, it's really 2018 and this show never happened.

313
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,040
 You get bit by it and then you wake up and you're like, oh man, it was all a dream.

314
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,400
 And then you look out your window because apparently that's what happened.

315
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
 You get bit by a hobo.

316
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
 You end up back at your house.

317
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,940
 Look at your window and the streets of whatever city you're in are filled with hobos.

318
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,940
 It's basically the walking dead, but you turn into hobos.

319
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,440
 So basically just the walking dead.

320
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,780
 All they do is walk around.

321
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,060
 Nobody has a house.

322
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,660
 But so if you pick number four, you're now in the walking dead.

323
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,820
 But if you get bit, you become a hobo.

324
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,740
 I love doing these interactive adventures.

325
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,140
 Whether or not you guys like them, it's always up for debate.

326
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,900
 But creep show, go ahead and fire up that Jason Jalopy.

327
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,860
 We're leaving behind a possible future, a possible hobo-lokalypse.

328
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,060
 That's came out wrong.

329
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,340
 Possibly a hobo-apocalypse there.

330
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
 I'll just say that.

331
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
 We're leaving behind that.

332
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,500
 We are headed out to Coles County, Illinois.

333
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,160
 Car is driving down the road.

334
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,920
 And we get to a bridge.

335
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,280
 Stop the car right here, creep show.

336
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,320
 The reason why we stopped the car right here is the bridge in front of us is called Air

337
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,200
 Tight Bridge.

338
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,880
 This bridge spans the Embarrass River.

339
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,200
 I don't know that's how you pronounce it, but that's what it looks like.

340
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,080
 The Embarrass River.

341
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,480
 This also, I should say, is known to be a gathering spot for bums.

342
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,720
 This is not a joke.

343
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,860
 This place also has a bunch of bums in it.

344
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,260
 So I don't know what's going on in Illinois, but apparently it is the walking dead with

345
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,500
 a bunch of bums.

346
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,260
 This place is also a gathering place for hobos.

347
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,580
 People say it got its name, though, because of a particular paranormal event.

348
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,660
 So creep show, go ahead and let's try to drive across this bridge.

349
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,100
 Car is going across the bridge.

350
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,260
 But we noticed something.

351
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,220
 Other than the noise of the car, there's no other sound.

352
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,260
 You can't even hear the water babbling under the bridge.

353
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,360
 You can't even hear birds.

354
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
 Nothing.

355
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 Turn off the car.

356
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
 See?

357
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
 Nothing.

358
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:40,820
 So some people say it has the name Air Tight Bridge because there's some sort of weird

359
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,800
 phenomenon around it, but you can't hear anything on the bridge.

360
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
 That's cool.

361
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 That's actually a really cool phenomenon.

362
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,240
 It would basically be like a portal, but only for sound.

363
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,640
 So I think that's a cool thing.

364
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,300
 The other theory, I think this one's dumb, I'm not going to spend too much time on it,

365
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,980
 but they say that I probably shouldn't spend any time on it.

366
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,180
 If your gas tank has more air in it than gas, your car can't cross the bridge.

367
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,180
 How would you even test that?

368
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,540
 I guess if you looked at the gas gauge and you're like, "Oh no, I only have a quarter."

369
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,860
 Then you just want to take the, first off, that's impossible because then to this day

370
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,660
 there'd be cars backed up.

371
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,140
 Once you had like a quarter tank of gas and you could have crossed the bridge, then what?

372
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,260
 You got to get out and walk and find more gas.

373
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,680
 You just siphon the car that's in front of you, that's been stuck there for 20 years.

374
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,400
 It wouldn't make any sense.

375
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,760
 I don't understand why that would even be part of the theory.

376
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,280
 The idea of there being no sound, that'd be like having a haunted house where you know

377
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,040
 10 serial killers lived and they basically were trading victims and a thousand people

378
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,440
 died there and then someone going, "Yeah, and on a full moon, a black cat shows up."

379
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
 You're like, "What?

380
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
 That's super anti-climatic."

381
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,480
 There's a place where sound doesn't happen.

382
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,700
 And then you're like, "Oh, and then sometimes kids will push your car across the bridge."

383
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,460
 And you put powder on the back of your car and you can see little handprints.

384
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,460
 What?

385
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
 It's dumb.

386
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,820
 But anyways, this place also has a true mystery behind it.

387
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,060
 Let's head back to the year 1980.

388
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,140
 It's October 19th, 1980, to be exact.

389
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,380
 And three men are walking through the area and they see a body.

390
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,700
 Now it's pretty close to all the wings, so they assume that it's just a prank.

391
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,440
 But as they get closer to it, they realize it is an actual human woman.

392
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,680
 She's naked and her hands, her feet, and her head are all missing.

393
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,880
 That happened in 1980.

394
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,960
 It took until the year 2008 to identify the body.

395
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,200
 There's a woman named Diana Riordan Small.

396
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,920
 She was never reported missing by her husband, which they thought was suspicious.

397
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,380
 But it took them until 2017 to arrest him.

398
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,500
 He was 71 when he was arrested.

399
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,180
 He committed the crime back in 1980.

400
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,140
 He was arrested in 2017 and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for it.

401
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,740
 What's interesting about these stories is both this one in Camp Falcon, you have the

402
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,620
 legends and you have true crime actually happening at these locations.

403
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,580
 A lot of times at Cry Baby Bridge, there's like a woman through her baby off the bridge

404
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
 and then jumped to the bridge.

405
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,560
 Like they never have any proof of these stories.

406
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,640
 And even the Camp Girl story, I looked up because I was doing a deep dive into Camp Falcon.

407
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,200
 That wasn't on the haunted places thing, I believe.

408
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,760
 But you have these true crimes actually brought into this.

409
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,040
 So I think that's a very, very interesting thing.

410
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:36,400
 But if you picked number two, you are standing alone on Air Tight Bridge.

411
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,100
 It's the middle of the afternoon.

412
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
 It's safe.

413
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,060
 You should be safe, right?

414
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,500
 But you're standing there on the bridge.

415
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 Your car broke down.

416
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,100
 You didn't check to see how much gas you had.

417
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,700
 You're like, "Dag, Navajigson, why'd you have to make jokes about that?"

418
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,780
 I was trying to test the theory and now my car is broken down.

419
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,740
 And while you're standing on that bridge, you see something in the bushes.

420
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
 It's not another hobo.

421
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,220
 I was about to make a joke about more hobos, but we already did that one because there

422
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,900
 are hobos in this area too.

423
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,560
 You see something moving in the bushes.

424
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,040
 You see a man come out of the bushes with a large knife.

425
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,440
 He's dressed very nicely.

426
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
 He's the opposite of a hobo.

427
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,760
 He's a nobo.

428
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,960
 He's wearing a tuxedo and he's carrying a knife.

429
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,600
 Now, cars are driving by you.

430
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 You don't have to worry about it.

431
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,480
 You start screaming for help.

432
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,520
 But nobody can hear your screams.

433
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,400
 They can see you actually.

434
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
 Okay, so hold on.

435
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,700
 Even if they couldn't see you, even if they couldn't hear you, they can see you waving

436
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,420
 your arms frantically, making no noise.

437
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,460
 There's a man in a tuxedo.

438
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
 There's a nobo.

439
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
 Shows it with a knife.

440
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,220
 Okay, so you get pulled.

441
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,780
 Okay, you're standing on the bridge.

442
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
 It's 3 PM.

443
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,020
 Your car broke down.

444
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,340
 You're like, "Damn it, Jason."

445
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,260
 And then all of a sudden, you fall off the bridge.

446
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,500
 Now you're under the bridge.

447
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,220
 Oh, splash.

448
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,980
 And then you see a bush.

449
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,280
 And then you see a man, a nobo, show up, a very rich man with a knife crawl out of the

450
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
 bushes.

451
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,000
 And you're screaming from underneath the bridge.

452
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,640
 "Help me, help me, help me."

453
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,480
 And you're reaching your arm up and you can see the cars driving over the bridge.

454
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,120
 The people who have better gas mileage than you.

455
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,320
 And you're like, "No, no."

456
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,200
 And no matter how much you scream, nobody can hear you.

457
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,760
 Nobody can hear you as the nobo wraps his arm around you and begins to stab you.

458
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
 That's super gruesome.

459
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
 I'm so sorry.

460
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,260
 I'm actually doing the motions over here.

461
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:35,020
 And then you die in the river and the nobo just slinks back into the bushes, waiting

462
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:43,780
 for his next victim to scream all they want, but nobody can hear anybody on airtight bridge.

463
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,460
 That was kind of gruesome considering a real person was murdered there.

464
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,220
 Sorry, Diana.

465
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,540
 But your husband is in prison and that's good because he's a piece of work.

466
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
 Blah.

467
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,960
 And he goes, "I'm creepy."

468
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
 And that was a little too much.

469
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
 Sorry, creeps.

470
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,240
 Let's go ahead and leave behind airtight bridge.

471
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,440
 Drive us on out to the bridges of Blood's Point.

472
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
 Now we're cooking with grease, right?

473
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,000
 We had airtight bridge, which may have just been bad gas mileage.

474
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,960
 Camp Falcon 1 was actually quite terrifying, but the hobos turned out to be.

475
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,600
 The hobos and the drunk youth of Illinois were the real threats of that story.

476
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,660
 But dude, can we go wrong with the bridges of Blood's Point?

477
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,900
 Look at that name.

478
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,020
 You have the bridges of Blood's Point.

479
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,940
 There's multiple of them.

480
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,700
 You have Blood Point Road.

481
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,420
 You have Blood's Point Cemetery, dude.

482
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,620
 This is super spooky, just the name.

483
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,900
 It's in Cherry Valley, so that kinda ruins it right, but maybe they're blood red cherries.

484
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,460
 Don't assume those cherries you're eating aren't actually frozen human blood.

485
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,260
 Don't assume that.

486
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,140
 Whenever someone says you want a cherry on your sundae, go, "No, what do you-- do I

487
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
 look like Army Hammer?

488
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,720
 You think I'm some sort of cannibal?

489
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,280
 You sicko?"

490
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
 Blood red cherries, Blood's Point Bridge.

491
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,400
 This is awesome.

492
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:08,880
 Supposedly if you go to Blood's Point Cemetery, you'll run into hell-- you won't run into

493
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,480
 Wolfman Jack, that's not where he has his radio station.

494
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,760
 Hellhounds live there.

495
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,280
 Coming out of the darkness.

496
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,520
 This is where the story of Blood's Point kinda falls apart.

497
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,420
 Apparently, they're not hellhounds, but this area does have a problem with packs of dogs,

498
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,860
 packs of realistic three-dimensional dogs attacking people.

499
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,300
 So not necessarily hellhounds, just really poorly behaved dogs.

500
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,380
 So you gotta be careful.

501
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,380
 You gotta be careful.

502
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,940
 But apparently also those dogs, they'll come out of nowhere and they'll bite you and then

503
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
 they'll disappear.

504
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,300
 It doesn't say they fade away into the mist between the realms.

505
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,100
 I think they just run-- I think they just run back into the bushes to hang out with their

506
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,260
 nobo masters.

507
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,120
 But there are no hellhounds, just regular dogs that'll bite you.

508
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,840
 The name Blood's Point isn't because some guy got stabbed and Blood was dripping out

509
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,840
 off a knife and then it spelled in the dirt Blood's Point like an old 1980s movie title.

510
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,360
 No, there was a guy named Arthur Blood.

511
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,560
 That's it.

512
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,200
 Which what did his family do for a living?

513
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,440
 Right out of his family getting that name.

514
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,800
 Arthur Blood was the first western settler in the area and he started flora township and

515
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,160
 he's like, "Let's name it after me.

516
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,860
 Let's name it after the spookiest thing inside the human body."

517
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,700
 And to top all of this stuff off with the Blood Red Cherry on your Dairy Queen Sunday,

518
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,140
 there's a bridge that has one of the things I hate the most about bridges.

519
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,780
 It has one of those legends that your car stalls on the bridge and then the kids push

520
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
 your car.

521
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,700
 Like, I made a joke about it in the last segment, but this one it's real.

522
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,940
 Your car stops on the bridge and then little hands show up.

523
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,300
 The most ineffective way to move a car is children.

524
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,140
 Having 30 of them doesn't help.

525
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,080
 And if they're ghosts, it definitely doesn't help.

526
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,480
 Ghosts can't even knock over tea cups and stuff like that.

527
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,680
 Now they have to move a half ton of Detroit steel across the bridge.

528
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
 It doesn't make sense.

529
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,320
 They say if you put powder on the back of your car you see little hand prints and stuff

530
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
 like that.

531
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,800
 Even if it was real, first off you'd have every physicist in the world out there testing

532
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 this.

533
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,320
 But that's the most ineffective way to move a vehicle.

534
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,400
 Now like a ghost horse, a ghost horse attaching itself to the front of your Mustang, that'd

535
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,680
 be kind of ironic.

536
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
 And cool.

537
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,340
 30 ghost kids pushing your car, whatever.

538
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,860
 Now this is where we get back on track, ladies and gentlemen.

539
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,860
 Because the story goes like this.

540
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:34,700
 There was a bus that drove off the bridge into the river and 30 kids died.

541
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,060
 You're like, "Jesus, is that really us getting back on track?"

542
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,180
 Well hold on.

543
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
 It's a tragedy.

544
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,020
 It's a fake story, but it's a local rumor.

545
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,940
 The bus goes off the bridge, the 30 kids die.

546
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,840
 Now when you stop your car at night on the bridge the kids push your car, whatever.

547
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
 Super lame.

548
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,200
 Kids go into the light, go into the light, leave the mortal plane.

549
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
 There's better things out there than you being AAA.

550
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,200
 But there's another version of this story in this area that it wasn't a busload of

551
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
 kids.

552
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
 It was a van full of kids.

553
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,280
 You're like, "Jesus, that's not big enough difference."

554
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
 It's not big.

555
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
 Hold on, hold on.

556
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,080
 It was a van full of children.

557
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,620
 They were on their way back home from a birthday party.

558
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,940
 The driver lost control and the van goes off the bridge and crashes into the river.

559
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
 Everyone just had a lot of fun at the birthday party.

560
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,620
 They're all having their own birthday hats, the presents.

561
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,980
 And I'm don't worry, this doesn't get any darker than this unless you hate what's coming

562
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
 up next.

563
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:37,220
 If you picked the number one, you're standing on this old wooden bridge on Sweeney Road,

564
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,220
 which is where this part of the story takes place.

565
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,760
 You see this van sitting halfway in the river.

566
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,320
 It seemed to have been there for ages.

567
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,040
 Now you know the stories of the children who were coming home from the birthday party.

568
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:01,400
 And you had heard that the driver was also a father of one of the children and the entertainment

569
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,120
 for the party.

570
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,780
 The old rusty van door opens up and you see an arm reach out of the car.

571
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:20,220
 Now even though it's caked in mud and mold and filth, you can see a little bit of bright

572
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,060
 colors on the arm.

573
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,900
 A face looks out of the van.

574
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,420
 Half of it gashed open, bloody wound.

575
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,340
 The other half a white painted clown face.

576
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:43,900
 The driver of the van coming back from the birthday party was the birthday clown.

577
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,480
 And there's been reports in the area that if you go late at night and while the kids

578
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,000
 are pushing your car, if you look underneath the bridge, you'll see the battered and torn

579
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,240
 form of a clown crawling towards you from underneath the bridge.

580
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,260
 If you pick number one, that's what you're looking at right now.

581
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,380
 You can't move.

582
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,660
 You're standing there paralyzed.

583
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,740
 It's almost as if 30 kids are holding onto your legs.

584
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,980
 You can't move as this clown crawls closer and closer to you.

585
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,140
 It's so close you can hear the mud dripping off of its face and hitting the pavement

586
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,900
 in front of you.

587
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,940
 The last thing you smell, I don't know why I smell out of all the senses.

588
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,940
 I don't know why this one.

589
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:38,340
 The last thing you smell is a mixture of old stale swamp water, face paint, and the stench

590
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:47,620
 of hell as the clown monster takes a bite out of your face.

591
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,220
 Now most of you guys don't care about clowns, but just pretend you were scared.

592
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,220
 Because I think that's scary.

593
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,940
 I'm not really scared of clowns, but that would be scared of clowns.

594
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,780
 I would be petrified of clowns if that happened.

595
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,940
 I see clowns, I don't even think about it.

596
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,900
 But if I saw a clown monster crawl out of a wrecked vehicle from 30 years ago and make

597
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:14,020
 its way towards me, even if I could get away, I would never trust another clown ever.

598
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,260
 Creepshow, let's go ahead and leave behind this clown and these little kids.

599
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,580
 They're set in traps.

600
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
 Maybe the kids aren't pushing the cars across the bridge.

601
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,300
 Maybe they're pushing it off the bridge.

602
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,300
 But they're not good.

603
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,340
 They're not good at it.

604
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,940
 So they accidentally push the cars to the other side of the bridge.

605
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,300
 We don't know because it's a stupid myth and I don't think kids are effective car

606
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,420
 pushers anyways.

607
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,660
 But we are leaving behind the Bloods Point bridges.

608
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,860
 We're headed out to our last location.

609
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,780
 If you picked number three, this is you.

610
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,620
 We're headed to Collinsville, Illinois.

611
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,720
 Specifically, we're going to Lebanon Road.

612
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,940
 On Lebanon Road, there are seven railroad bridges that if you drive through these bridges in

613
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,660
 the right order at the right time, you can go to hell.

614
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,780
 Now I know what you're thinking.

615
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,580
 Why would anyone want to do that?

616
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,580
 We'll answer that maybe in a bit.

617
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,660
 But if you drive through all the gates in a particular order, and the order is well

618
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,940
 known, it's not like people have to do this randomly, if you drive through all the gates

619
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,660
 in a particular order and you drive through the last one exactly at midnight, you will

620
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,280
 be transferred to the hell dimension.

621
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,980
 Your car will actually go to hell.

622
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,220
 I said we were going to talk about it later.

623
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,940
 I guess we're going to talk about it right now because I've already gotten to this point.

624
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,900
 The question is, why would a human want to go to hell as a person?

625
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
 Some people might want to be like, "Dude, heaven's lame.

626
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,660
 I want to go to hell when I die."

627
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,580
 And as a soul, I mean, it's still kind of a dumb thought, but whatever.

628
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,500
 What would be the advantage of going as a biological human?

629
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,540
 Would there be any, like if it is a realm of the spirit, if you went there as a human

630
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,700
 with a car full of weapons and rock and roll CDs and sayings like, "Oh dude, I love this

631
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,100
 stuff."

632
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,420
 Would there be any advantage to that?

633
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,660
 And you're probably thinking, "Jason, you're totally overthinking it.

634
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,580
 This is just a bunch of teenagers who have told this story for the past 50 years."

635
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,820
 But if someone said, "Tell you what, you can go to hell for a couple weeks or a couple

636
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,580
 minutes even and then come back out and you'll totally be safe, would you do it?"

637
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,460
 And everyone's shaking their head, "No."

638
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,340
 I'm just trying to think if there would be an advantage to it.

639
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,620
 I can't think of one.

640
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,860
 I wouldn't want to drive for an hour knowing by the end of the destination, I'm going

641
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,860
 to hell.

642
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,000
 There's a special clause to this one.

643
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,140
 If you do the journey backwards, if you start at gate seven and drive underneath the first

644
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,020
 bridge right at midnight, you don't go to hell but a bunch of hellhounds show up.

645
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,500
 These are actual hellhounds, not the wild dogs from the last story.

646
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,580
 These are actually hellhounds and they will tear open reality and you can take a glimpse

647
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,220
 of hell.

648
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,500
 You can see hell.

649
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,700
 Now that's a little more appealing.

650
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:51,720
 It's not high on the places I want to see, it's probably fairly low, but that I could

651
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,760
 see someone wanting to do.

652
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,520
 To take a glimpse of hell.

653
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,760
 I wouldn't want to go there under any circumstances whatsoever.

654
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,240
 But if someone says, "Hey, you do as a paranormal researcher and I wasn't going to get sucked

655
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,760
 in and the hellhounds weren't going to trip me," or, "They're all standing on each other's

656
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,200
 shoulders and pretend to be a businessman and they're like, 'Here's your new house.'

657
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
 I'm like, 'Ugh.'

658
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,180
 If I was just looking at it, that might be fine, but again, I'd rather see pretty much

659
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:24,540
 anything else on the planet earth than a million years in a split second eternal torment."

660
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,740
 But again, as a paranormal researcher, I might want to see that before I see a chicken having

661
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,460
 sex with a book.

662
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,820
 There are things I would want to see less than hell, but there's not a lot of them.

663
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
 So you have that.

664
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,160
 But basically I'm saying, as long as possible, find my choice between going to hell or simply

665
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,660
 looking at it.

666
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,000
 I would rather just look at it and then be alive again.

667
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,440
 But what's interesting is let's go through these gates real quick.

668
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,160
 We're going into the hell at the end of the episode.

669
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
 No, no.

670
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,360
 Gate 1, apparently there's just nothing, no real rumors attached to it.

671
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,560
 It's fairly close to the town.

672
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,680
 Gate 2, because you're doing this journey at night, there are stories of Ku Klux Klan

673
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,220
 activity out there and people being hung, people being lynched off of this bridge.

674
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,140
 So people say that if you drive through gate 2, super tasteless, but as you should, which

675
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,820
 is pretty much this whole episode, if you drive past gate 2, apparently you will see,

676
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,900
 you know you're on the right path because you'll see a hanging man waving at you in

677
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,380
 the darkness as you drive underneath that bridge.

678
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,020
 Gates 3 and 4 are known as the twin gates.

679
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,180
 And in the real world, outside of any of this paranormal stuff, they are the most dangerous

680
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,940
 gates to go through.

681
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:41,480
 There's like a hairpin turn that you have to go through to get from gate 3 to gate 4.

682
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
 There are reports here.

683
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,800
 This is where we get the most paranormal activity reports of ghost hunters on the ground.

684
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,920
 You go through, sound is silent.

685
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,360
 Again, they say the only thing you hear in this area is a stream.

686
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,520
 You do hear water, but you hear no birds, you hear no bugs, you hear no animals, nothing.

687
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,120
 Sound again is warped here.

688
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,600
 Although there is a story of another car hearing a car approaching them, and because it's such

689
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,060
 a tight corner, these ghost investigators were really afraid they were going to get

690
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,180
 a car accident and the sound passed them there was no car.

691
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,460
 So there does seem to be some sort of phenomenon here from people on the ground.

692
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,740
 There's also a house out there, and it's not like a spooky house.

693
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,540
 It's a house with people living in it and there's signs all over the house.

694
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,660
 Stay out, private property, go away, all that stuff.

695
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,820
 Because I'm sure they get a lot of visitors being like "hey, do you guys ever go to hell?"

696
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,900
 And they're like "no, you can go to hell because I'm going to call the cops and get

697
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,140
 out of here."

698
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,520
 Gate 5 is no one, not necessarily for being paranormal, but it's the longest and it's

699
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
 the narrowest.

700
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,080
 It's very--that one is also very dangerous to be driving down.

701
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,400
 Especially late at night, because remember a lot of kids are going to be doing this stunt.

702
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,320
 Gate 6, there's a rumor about it that years ago, of course the story is always generations

703
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,240
 before the people telling it, two teenagers are tripping acid, dude, and they were going

704
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,960
 to open the gates of hell where they were tripping acid, man.

705
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
 Totally cool.

706
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,700
 And that's not cool, driving on acid, not a great idea.

707
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,700
 Apparently they were driving through gate 6, they were tripping on acid and they smashed

708
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,740
 into the wall of the tunnel, they died on impact.

709
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,020
 People say these days you can see a ghost car sometimes crashing the wall.

710
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,900
 Apparently there's another place in the area called Acid Bridge.

711
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,940
 Unrelated, but two kids doing acid driving, they weren't going to hell, they were just

712
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,380
 driving around, they drive off the bridge.

713
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,600
 As you can see a car full of acid fueled ghosts here, and then for some reason other

714
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,240
 people thought it was a great idea and they died in another part of the area off of the

715
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
 bridge.

716
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,760
 And then when you get to gate 7, that is the final gate, you have to pass it right at midnight,

717
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,440
 your car will journey into hell.

718
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,240
 Now I got a lot of my information from a website called the Horror Syndicate, they're the ones

719
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,960
 who really--they went on this trip, they're the ones talking about the dangerous turns,

720
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
 the ghost car and all of that stuff.

721
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,340
 They did an update and they said it's closed.

722
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,220
 This place is super popular and they announced on their website the gates of hell are closed.

723
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,980
 Sorry saying you're out of business, he's like no I need so many more souls.

724
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,340
 The roadway's actually been closed and it was gates 3 and 4.

725
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,180
 Barriers, concrete barriers have been put up so you can no longer go through gate 3 and

726
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
 gate 4.

727
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,060
 Obviously the theories are this, one it was safety thing because that was the tightest

728
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,860
 corner and you had to do them in the right order.

729
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,160
 And remember if you have to pass it right at midnight, so if you have teenagers that

730
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,560
 started it late and it's a long journey, people would get bored on this trip, they'd

731
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,400
 think it was this quick thing, people would get bored halfway through and just turn around.

732
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,200
 You have kids doing this if they're leaving late, they're speeding, you have these tight

733
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,280
 corners, you have people doing it in different directions because some want to go to hell,

734
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
 some just want to see it.

735
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,120
 Everyone is scared, everyone's jumpy, probably a lot of drugs and alcohol involved like the

736
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,080
 acid kids.

737
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,480
 Then you have a house in there of people with like cars and jobs, it's not a spooky

738
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,900
 house, it's a regular house.

739
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,220
 So the fact that 3 and 4 now have barriers in front of them could be a safety thing,

740
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,480
 it could be those people who own that property by gates 3 and 4, just erected the barriers

741
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,620
 or told the city can you do something about these, these people are driving around all

742
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,220
 the time, it's super dangerous.

743
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,340
 Apparently the horse syndicate found out there is a workaround to this, you can actually

744
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,300
 still hit those gates but you have to go in this long loop, somehow you can get past

745
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,920
 the barriers, they go you can still make it but you have to double back through tunnels

746
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,080
 and take different routes and things like that.

747
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,680
 That actually would make it more dangerous.

748
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,600
 Because now there's no rhyme or reason to any of this stuff.

749
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,240
 And if you're driving around concrete safety barriers on road that probably isn't even

750
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,720
 maintained at this point, it's more dangerous but really at the end of it, that makes it

751
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,520
 more fun for these kids.

752
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,440
 But we're not worried about the kids of Illinois, they can fend for themselves.

753
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,640
 We're worried about the people who picked number 3.

754
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,180
 Because if you picked number 3 before the safety barriers went up, you decided to get

755
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:04,060
 in a car all by yourself and you're making the journey through the 7 gates of hell.

756
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:10,140
 You passed the first one no problem, you passed the second one and see a man who was unjustly

757
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,900
 hung a century ago waving at you as you drive underneath his body.

758
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:24,280
 You make the sharp corners at 3 and 4, you drive down the long dark tunnel of 5.

759
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,460
 When you get to 6 just to make the experience perfect, you take a hit of acid.

760
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:38,600
 You take that little piece of paper and you put it on your tongue.

761
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,120
 You're like Jason, I should have taken that hours ago.

762
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,240
 Acid doesn't work like that.

763
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,860
 I don't know how long it does acid.

764
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,540
 It doesn't matter, this is super acid.

765
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,820
 This is acid you bought from a hobo at Camp Falcon, it's super concentrated acid.

766
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,620
 You put it on your tongue, it's like a sprite commercial centered on one cubic centimeter

767
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:07,380
 of your tongue, it explodes your soul and you pass through gate 6 and then you pass through

768
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,100
 gate 7 right at midnight.

769
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,860
 The legend wasn't true.

770
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,880
 You wasted that hobo acid on just a drive.

771
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,880
 So you go home, you drive all the way from Chicago to wherever you live, you go home,

772
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,600
 you go to bed, you wake up, you catch your face off, you feed it to the dogs, you feed

773
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,360
 it to your dogs, it's really intense acid.

774
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,840
 And then you're just going about your business and every so often out of the corner of your

775
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:44,560
 eye you see something move, turning you look, nothing's there.

776
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,360
 You just continue to go about your day.

777
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,180
 You're going to the reconstructive surgeon, you're picking out a new face today, you're

778
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,700
 like oh this would be a good day.

779
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,600
 I hope I look like Brad Pitt.

780
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,700
 Keep forgetting how many women listen to this show, they're like I don't want to look like

781
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,640
 Brad Pitt.

782
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,920
 Your life existence continues on, every so often you see something out of the corner

783
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,320
 of your eye.

784
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:11,040
 And then you have a great family, you go to college, you get rich, you start your own

785
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,360
 college, you start college for people who repair faces.

786
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,280
 And then you're surrounded by your loved ones when you die and you go peacefully in your

787
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,520
 sleep.

788
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,760
 And then you drive through the tunnel of gate seven and you look around and you go what?

789
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,840
 I wasted all that hobo acid.

790
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,520
 Oh man, that sucks.

791
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,160
 A minute might as well drive home now because that's what people do when they're done with

792
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,480
 their activities, they go home.

793
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,640
 You go home, cut your face off, cut your face off and you start seeing more shadows in your

794
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,320
 field of view.

795
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:51,320
 The world seems to be getting darker, but you have a good life.

796
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:58,320
 You meet your soulmate, you get married, have children, you die surrounded by your family.

797
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,080
 You're driving through the tunnel and you go what?

798
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,400
 I wasted all that hobo acid.

799
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,360
 I hope I have a sharp knife at home because that won't be a waste.

800
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,960
 And you see out of the corner of your eye a multitude of dark figures.

801
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,520
 But when you turn to face them, they're gone.

802
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:26,760
 Your eternity is living a perfect life, but seeing evil gaining ground every single day

803
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,880
 towards you.

804
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,000
 You will always end your journey surrounded by your friends and family as you die.

805
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:45,240
 But each time you die, you will become so much more fearful, so much more paranoid and afraid

806
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,760
 that you don't understand why the people who love you love you.

807
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,920
 After the hundredth time this happens, you are a husk of your former self.

808
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,160
 So when you meet your soulmate, they still have that beautiful smile.

809
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,240
 They still look at you like you are a whole person, but you have simply withered away

810
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
 at this point.

811
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,360
 The fact that you know you're not a complete human and that people treat you so normally

812
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,080
 begins to drive you mad.

813
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,280
 And the dark figures are now clouding everything.

814
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,960
 You can't see past the shadows, but you can still hear the voices of people who love you.

815
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:30,520
 And that actually makes things a thousand times worse.

816
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,280
 You know you are nothing.

817
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,680
 And reality is just a joke.

818
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:46,000
 And you are doomed to be the punchline until time itself ends.

819
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:11,520
 If you pick number three, you truly are trapped in hell.

820
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,520
 You are the one who will be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the

821
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:25,520
