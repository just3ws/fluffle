1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 A man is trying to have a nice relaxing nap on his couch, until the world of the paranormal

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
 wakes him up.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,600
 And then we take a look at an amazing story that took place 19,000 feet in the air.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,520
 It was supposed to be a simple delivery on a FedEx plane.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,880
 Instead it turned into a life and death encounter in the not so friendly skies today on DeadRabbit

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
 Radio.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:35,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of DeadRabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,520
 Hope you guys are ready for a wham bam action packed episode.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
 You're like no I'm not.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,080
 You're trying to get your homework done, you're trying to get your finals done, you're trying

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
 to relax.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
 Wake up!

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
 No relaxing this episode.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,760
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, coming in with

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
 giant bags of stimulants for us all.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,320
 We gotta stay up.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
 It's WilliamFontaineDelator.triev.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,880
 And hopefully I just didn't out you as a speed dealer.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,320
 They're not real stimulants officer, they're magical stimulants.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,320
 Which are twice as powerful and ten times more illegal.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,400
 William, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you're not a truck dealer like William,

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,880
 that's fine too.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,560
 Just helps for the word about this show.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,040
 Really really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,680
 After we pay William's bail and get him out of jail, William, I'm gonna toss you the keys

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,040
 to the Jason Jalopy.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:39,080
 We're gonna leave behind lock up and we are headed out to Chrisfield, Maryland.

31
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,480
 This story was recommended to us by Kent Allard, long time listener Kent Allard.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,000
 He actually recommended two previous stories to us and all of these stories take place

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,120
 in the town of Chrisfield, Maryland.

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,640
 This town is a population of 2,726 people.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,360
 We have three episodes from this town.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
 This town is basically seven dead kids away from being Pennywise territory.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,560
 It's a lot of spookiness, a lot of high strangeness for such a small town.

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,120
 This story and the other ones came from a history book about Chrisfield and the surrounding

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,920
 areas so thank you Kent for sending this over.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,120
 We're at a little house on Charlotte Avenue.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
 Don't mean to dock you, don't mean to dock you.

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,000
 The story is from 1943 so I'm pretty sure you're dead.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,120
 I'm not saying it like it's a good thing but I don't think you can docks the dead.

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
 You're like, "Hey look at that gravestone over there.

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
 That's Abraham Lincoln."

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,720
 We're at this little house on Charlotte Avenue.

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,440
 It's the home of Captain Jim Tucker and it's July 19th, 1943.

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,480
 And Captain Jim Tucker is out there working on his boat and he's like, "Ah, the pirate's

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,960
 life, I'm not a pirate.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,360
 The captain's life for me," he says and he's like working on his boat and he's like, "That's

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
 I'm done.

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
 I'm leaking.

53
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,440
 There's a bunch of barnacles trying to pilot it away."

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
 He's like, "I'm done."

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
 He leaves it because it's too hot outside.

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
 It's July in Maryland.

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
 He's walking back to his house.

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
 He goes, "You know what?

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,400
 I'm just going to lay on my couch, catch a couple of z's and wake up later.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,000
 Hopefully my boat is still afloat and I will finish working on it."

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,120
 But as he's laying down, he feels a hot flash right in his face.

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
 Wakes him up.

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
 You know what that is, right?

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
 It could be a fireball.

65
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,160
 That's pretty much the only thing he could be right.

66
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
 He jumps up.

67
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,000
 He jumps up off the couch and he's trying to figure out what it was and he realizes now

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,440
 his entire house is as hot as it is outside, which is not what you want.

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
 Which is not what you want.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,760
 That's why we have houses in the first place for it to be different than the elements.

71
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,320
 And while he's trying to figure out what's going on, Martha, Martha, did you feel that?

72
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
 He's looking over.

73
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,960
 He has this mirror in his living room.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,880
 It's a big round mirror.

75
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,560
 It's about 24 inches in diameter.

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,680
 He's looking at the mirror and he goes, "Oh my God."

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,600
 Word starts getting around town.

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,080
 Captain Jim Tucker is going around town.

79
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
 He's a bit of a braggart.

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
 He's a bit of a boaster.

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
 He's going around town.

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,800
 He goes, "Guys, you won't believe what just happened.

83
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,960
 I was outside working on my boat.

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
 It was super hot outside.

85
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
 It went in the house.

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
 The house was as hot as it was outside."

87
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,560
 They're like, "Maybe you should shut the door when you go."

88
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,920
 And he's like, "No, you don't let me finish the story."

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,880
 The mirror is magic.

90
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 I have a magical mirror now.

91
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
 Did you know that?

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,520
 I probably should have started with that instead of the whole lead up about fixing my boat.

93
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,160
 So people are like, "We want to see your magical mirror, of course."

94
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,680
 No one's going to be like, "Oh, check it out later.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,800
 I got better things to do."

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
 Everyone's coming to his house to check out this magical mirror.

97
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,640
 Now this is what was going on.

98
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,020
 This was reported in the Chris Field Times newspaper.

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,520
 On the one hand, it's really weird that the newspaper is reporting this story.

100
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,200
 On the other hand, previously, they reported a story about a man who shot a photo of a

101
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,720
 witch, thinking it would kill the witch.

102
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,640
 Instead the bullets went through the photo, went through the photo, and into the house

103
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,080
 next door making the next door neighbor scream.

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,040
 Slow news day or just the coolest town ever you'd decide.

105
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,480
 This is what's going on with this mirror.

106
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,400
 When you look at it, it takes a second for you to see it, but then you see an island.

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,240
 You see an island with palm trees off in the distance.

108
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,760
 And it's not like you're looking at a drawing.

109
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,360
 I know when I was reading this story I was imagining like the far side of just like a

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,680
 little cartoon island.

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,520
 No, this looked like you were looking through a window.

112
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:24,400
 You were seeing an island covered in palm trees off in the distance and then up to nine different

113
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
 ships.

114
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,120
 They said there were some tankers, some freighters, some warships.

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,080
 They didn't actually make it.

116
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
 It wasn't cool enough.

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
 It wasn't television.

118
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
 It wasn't making sound effects.

119
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
 They're watching these boats go by.

120
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,320
 "All hands on deck."

121
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,600
 Oddly enough the newspaper described one of the ships like this.

122
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 Because the journalists of the Critsfield Times went here as well.

123
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,400
 First it was just a bunch of Captain Jim's drunk buddies coming from the bar.

124
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,920
 And then a really small word spread in town.

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,400
 The journalist, he might have been a drunk too for all I know.

126
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,240
 He is reporting on witches.

127
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,320
 He has this quote.

128
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,920
 He wrote in his article, "One ship has its stern up out of the water so the keel can

129
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,800
 be seen and apparently is about to plunge beneath the sea."

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,360
 So again it's not like just these vague images.

131
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,160
 It's action packed.

132
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,640
 Something's about to go down here.

133
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,760
 This story is taking place in 1943.

134
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:30,560
 So during 1943 Captain Jim Tucker had a lot of relatives, a lot of young men he knew

135
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,320
 in the Pacific fighting against the Japanese.

136
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,920
 Even everyone in town knew at least one person who was overseas and a good portion of them

137
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,760
 were in the Navy and a good portion of them were in the Pacific front.

138
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,320
 So he's looking at this and he's afraid it might be an omen.

139
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,520
 Obviously the island with the palm trees would make you think tropical.

140
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,160
 And then the warships and the boat that looks like it's about to go under kind of made him

141
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,880
 think it was an omen.

142
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,040
 That's the end of the article though.

143
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,000
 We don't have any more information.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,480
 This is a collection in this history of Chris Field book.

145
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,440
 This particular section is some of their weirdest articles.

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,560
 Some weird true crimes, some weird paranormal stuff like this.

147
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,800
 So this was actually reported in this newspaper.

148
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,840
 I was able to verify this newspaper existed when I covered it on previous episodes.

149
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,540
 But there's no follow up to it.

150
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,160
 We don't know if his loved ones made it home safely.

151
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,200
 We don't even know how long the images lasted.

152
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,600
 They lasted long enough for multiple people in town to see it but after this article was

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,400
 reported we don't know if you could still see them to this day as they were a mirror

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,360
 somewhere in Chris Field, Maryland.

155
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,560
 The most cursed town in the United States that is still displaying this image.

156
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,040
 Or a different image now.

157
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 Something else.

158
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,880
 Something showing another vision of a future or a past or something happening right then

159
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,600
 but across the world.

160
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,680
 And what did the hot flash have to do with anything?

161
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,560
 Here's the thing, it would be one thing if he came in and had a heat stroke and he was

162
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,800
 like "Ugh, I shouldn't have been drinking all that seawater while I was working on my

163
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,640
 boat" and solved this.

164
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,760
 That would be totally one thing.

165
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,720
 It could still be reported in the newspaper.

166
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 Very very slow news name, Mansover's Heatstroke hallucinates.

167
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,640
 But the fact that other people were able to see it as well.

168
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,220
 What was up with the heat?

169
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,880
 Was that creating the effect in the mirror?

170
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,600
 Is that what opened the portal of the mirror?

171
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,560
 Was it something completely unrelated to it?

172
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
 It's just a weird story.

173
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,480
 It's one of those stories that I like.

174
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
 Sometimes I love stories that have concrete answers.

175
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,640
 I love solving mysteries.

176
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,080
 But you don't get that a lot in this line of work.

177
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,200
 And then I like the stories like this that are just super open-ended.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
 We don't know if this is some sort of magic mirror.

179
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,600
 We don't know if this is some sort of fortune telling mirror.

180
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,120
 Which is the same thing technically.

181
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
 But you know what I mean?

182
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,480
 Was this a ghost event?

183
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,720
 Was this telling the future?

184
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,080
 Was it an alternate reality?

185
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,400
 Was it showing him in another world?

186
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,680
 What was behind this?

187
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,080
 What crafted this?

188
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
 That's what I like about this story.

189
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
 We don't have a concrete answer.

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 It's not aliens.

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 It's not ghosts.

192
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
 Not demons.

193
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
 We don't know what it is.

194
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
 It's just a mirror.

195
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,000
 The reason why I like those stories is because they're the stories that can happen to anybody.

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
 And also it's not terrible, right?

197
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,880
 It's not like he looked in the mirror and saw himself holding his eyes out and he goes

198
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
 "Soon!"

199
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
 Like that's not fun.

200
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,880
 I don't want that to happen to anybody.

201
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,800
 But if tomorrow I want to go brush my teeth and I'm looking in the mirror and I see like

202
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,280
 a boat sailing by and I see much dudes singing a sea shanty, that's cool.

203
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,920
 I'm in the shower and they're like "Yo ho ho.

204
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,400
 I'm trying to sleep through it.

205
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 Yo ho ho.

206
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,960
 That would get annoying after a while."

207
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,080
 But I'd still invite people over to see it.

208
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,600
 I wouldn't invite them over to see an image of themselves holding their eyeballs going

209
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
 "Soon!"

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,280
 They're like "Jason, I don't know if I want to come over to your place while your friends

211
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,960
 have cut their eyeballs out."

212
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
 I'm like "What?

213
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
 That's fake news dude.

214
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,480
 Come on over man.

215
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,080
 Nothing's going to happen."

216
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
 Yet.

217
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,080
 William, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter.

218
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,520
 We're going up, up and away.

219
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,480
 We've got to get high in this story.

220
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,760
 Not the type that requires all those stimulants.

221
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
 William, I'm going to toss you the keys to this Carbentercopter.

222
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,720
 We are leaving behind Chrisfield, Maryland.

223
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,720
 I have no doubt we will be there again soon.

224
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,480
 Because there's a bunch more articles from there.

225
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,920
 We are headed out to Memphis, Tennessee.

226
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,680
 I'm going to Graceland.

227
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,400
 Graceland.

228
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,560
 Every so often, and this is one of the things I love about doing this show, every so often

229
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,640
 I come across stories that I can't wait to tell you guys.

230
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
 And I'll tell people about them.

231
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
 I'll tell people about them.

232
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
 They're like having lunch with me.

233
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,040
 They're like, "Guys, you won't believe this.

234
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,200
 This is one of those stories.

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 This is one of those stories.

236
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,480
 I don't want to hype it up too much."

237
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,040
 But when I read it, I was like, "Dude, this is so dope."

238
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,360
 And it happened in most of our lifetimes.

239
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,480
 And I never heard of this before.

240
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,560
 William, go ahead and land us here at this airport in Memphis, Tennessee.

241
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,680
 It's April 7th, 1994.

242
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,520
 And I got most of my information from an article written by Max Garland for the Memphis Commercial

243
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
 Appeal.

244
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,960
 We're walking around this airport.

245
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,640
 We're walking around with our aviator glasses, our cool jumpsuits, the theme song to Iron

246
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
 Eagle is playing in the background.

247
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,400
 When I did that last story, right, when I did the story about the mirror, I go, "Oh, Captain

248
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
 Jim Tucker."

249
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,160
 And I always like to dig a little bit more.

250
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,720
 I wanted to find out, I wanted to find out, like, did he lose a loved one in the war?

251
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 What happened to him?

252
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
 Did he ever get his boat repaired?

253
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
 These are questions I needed answered.

254
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,840
 So when I typed in Captain Jim Tucker, this story came up because this story has a Jim

255
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
 Tucker in it.

256
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,880
 So oddly enough, whether it was fate that brought me to this awesome story, whether

257
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,280
 this is his descendant, who knows, maybe he survived a boat tipping over in the Pacific.

258
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,000
 And he's here now, but it's April 7th, 1994.

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,760
 There's a FedEx flight, a Federal Express flight that's going to take packages from

260
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,520
 Memphis, Tennessee to San Jose, California.

261
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,320
 It is a routine flight on a DC-10 cargo plane.

262
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,440
 This plane, you had Captain David Sanders, first officer Jim Tucker, and flight engineer

263
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
 Andy Peterson.

264
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,560
 Now, they were actually called in.

265
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,200
 This story is so dope because it's just weird the way fate works.

266
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,280
 These three dudes were all called in at the last minute because the crew that was supposed

267
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,720
 to fly this DC-10, it was a man and a woman.

268
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,200
 They had worked one minute over the FAA regulated shift.

269
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,960
 Like, if you work over this shift, you can't fly a plane.

270
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,440
 Safety reasons.

271
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,080
 They worked one minute over their shift so the FedEx guys go, "Well, we're going to

272
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,440
 have to bring in another crew.

273
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
 We can't take the risk."

274
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,680
 You know, of course you'd go, "Oh, come on, man, one minute."

275
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,400
 Well, we can't do it.

276
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,000
 So they bring in David, Jim, and Andy.

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,760
 Now, these are three...

278
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,720
 I've never met these guys, but the article described them as they're pretty broad-shouldered

279
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
 guys.

280
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
 These are not...

281
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,160
 If you had to fight three pilots in the world, you wouldn't want to fight these three, right?

282
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,240
 Maybe you wouldn't want to fight the red-bearant either.

283
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,400
 I'm sure there's other guys.

284
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,040
 Lewis Gosta Jr. as well, but definitely not these three guys.

285
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,200
 They're not Arnold, but they're also, you know, they're broad-shouldered.

286
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,080
 They're pretty fit dudes getting into this plane.

287
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,320
 Now, this plane is not headed to a bodybuilding contest.

288
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,480
 It doesn't matter how physically fit they are on any other flight.

289
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,800
 In any other flight in the world, it would not matter that these three dudes are on it.

290
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,360
 They're getting ready to take off.

291
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,480
 It's a routine flight, and this other employee of FedEx shows up, and he's like, "Hey, guys.

292
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
 Hey, guys, do you mind if I take a jump-seater?"

293
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,200
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure, no problem."

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,280
 A jump-seater is where any employee of FedEx, apparently...

295
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,320
 I don't know if it's like the guy working at the FedEx store in your neighborhood, but

296
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,880
 if you are a FedEx employee, you can catch a flight.

297
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,960
 You're basically mail yourself.

298
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,480
 If you're at the airport, you go, "Hey, can I just..."

299
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,000
 Because the plane's going out there anyways.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Can I just hop on board since you're going out there anyways?

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,640
 I'll go to San Jose, California.

302
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
 Yeah, sure.

303
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,080
 Jump on.

304
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,120
 His name is Auburn Callaway.

305
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,040
 Now, David, Jim, and Andy are pretty fit.

306
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
 Auburn is buff.

307
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:24,240
 Auburn is this big buff dude who gets on a plane and he has a black belt in martial arts.

308
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
 And a guitar case.

309
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,400
 That's his only luggage as a guitar case.

310
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 They're like, "Oh, this is dope."

311
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,800
 And hopefully there's a guitar in there and he'll play some jumpy tunes.

312
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,200
 Now what they didn't know is that Auburn is a man with a plan.

313
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,440
 Not a good one, but a man with a plan.

314
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,280
 He was about to get called into corporate.

315
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,320
 The very next day, he was going to have to go to corporate and he was going to get a

316
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,080
 disciplinary action labeled against them.

317
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,920
 He believes he's going to get fired.

318
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,000
 So he has a man with a bad plan.

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,480
 And the plane is getting ready to take off is when we start getting the black box recording

320
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,200
 of what's going on.

321
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,240
 So there is a full audio recording out there of all the events on this flight.

322
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,120
 There's a transcript, a written transcript, but you want to talk about lost media.

323
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,760
 The black box for this flight is nuts.

324
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,200
 The flight starts off totally normal.

325
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,640
 They're doing their checks, hitting buttons and stuff like that.

326
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,600
 The plane, taxi's, it takes off, it's in the air.

327
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
 The crew is in the cockpit.

328
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,440
 David, Jim, Andy, they're just sitting in the cockpit flying the plane.

329
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:38,960
 And Captain Jim is sitting there and then all of a sudden he hears a commotion.

330
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,160
 It happens so quickly.

331
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,200
 He's not really thinking about what's going on.

332
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:51,560
 But he hears this commotion in the cockpit and he turns and he looks and he sees Jim

333
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,200
 and Andy slumped over blood gushing out of their head.

334
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,080
 In an instant Auburn launched his attack.

335
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,400
 So Auburn's plan was this.

336
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,920
 He figured he was getting fired.

337
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,960
 He hated FedEx.

338
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,640
 So two birds with one stone.

339
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,020
 Or technically three pilots with two hammers.

340
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
 He decided this.

341
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,520
 He took out a lot of life insurance on himself and he took out workplace, deft and dismembered

342
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,120
 insurance, accidental insurance at work, stuff like that.

343
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,360
 His plan was to get on this plane and crash it.

344
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,560
 Everyone on the plane would be dead including him and his family would make a lot of money.

345
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,000
 But he also wanted to make sure, I mean obviously if there's a plane crash and there's a bunch

346
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,820
 of bullet holes, people would know something was up.

347
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,760
 So he brought weapons that would mimic a plane crash death.

348
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:54,320
 He had two claw hammers, two mallets and a spear gun.

349
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 So Captain Jim sitting there, he hears this commotion.

350
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,040
 He turns and within a second both of his coworkers are slumped over blood pouring out of their

351
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,080
 heads and he sees this dude with two, he came in with both hammers and started hitting them

352
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,000
 at the same time.

353
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,520
 So hard knocked him out.

354
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,480
 Captain Jim puts his arm up to start deflecting these hammer blows.

355
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,440
 They're in the air, they're 19,000 feet in the air.

356
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,840
 He's getting hit with his hammer.

357
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,760
 Captain Jim knows this is a matter of life and death.

358
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
 This is not a normal hijacking.

359
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,280
 The guy's not going to take the plane to Cuba and make demands or anything like that.

360
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,960
 He's going to try to murder himself and his crewmate.

361
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,120
 So he starts fighting back in the cockpit of the cabin.

362
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,320
 But as this fight's going on Jim and Andy start to come too.

363
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
 What?

364
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,640
 What just happened man?

365
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,360
 I was just sitting here all of a sudden blood shooting out of my head.

366
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
 A full on brawl is now going on in this cockpit.

367
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,800
 The plane is still in flight and everyone but Auburn is bleeding profusely.

368
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,240
 They are able to push Auburn out of the cockpit but he grabs his spear gun and aims it right

369
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,400
 at Andy's face.

370
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,240
 Blood is just pouring down Andy's face.

371
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 He can barely see what's going on.

372
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,860
 All he sees is this spear gun aimed right at his head.

373
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,320
 He grabs that spear gun and he just lands on top of him and they're wrestling over this

374
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,800
 spear gun now.

375
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
 Captain Sanders jumps out of the cockpit.

376
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,000
 He's fighting over the spear gun as well.

377
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
 The only person left flying the plane is Jim Tucker.

378
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,480
 And he's sitting there at the control panel and he is trying to make sense of everything.

379
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,680
 And at this point this is happening so quickly no one has radioed in to traffic control.

380
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,640
 The plane is in flight as far as ground control knows everything is A-okay.

381
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,120
 There's his blood squirting everywhere.

382
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,480
 Jim Tucker is sitting at the cockpit and he hears his two coworkers beating this guy up

383
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,840
 and they're not doing that well.

384
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,680
 They are grievously wounded and they're fighting against this guy who has weapons, who was

385
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,000
 prepared and is a martial art black belt.

386
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,680
 Jim Tucker wants to get up and fight.

387
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
 The plane is on autopilot.

388
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,440
 It's going to be able to go straight for a while.

389
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
 It's going to be able to fly a bit for a while.

390
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,080
 So all three of them can fight.

391
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,440
 But Jim Tucker from that rain of hammer blows, the very first attack, he's paralyzed now

392
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,680
 on the right side of his body.

393
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
 So he can't get up and fight.

394
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,920
 He's sitting at the cockpit of this DC-10 cargo plane and he hears a fight for survival

395
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,480
 happening 8 feet away from him.

396
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,680
 And if that fight goes sour, he's next.

397
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,360
 First thing he does is he tips the plane nose up, sending all of the combatants rolling

398
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,040
 towards the back of the plane, even his buddies, right?

399
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,720
 He's trying to give him an edge.

400
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,160
 He tips the plane up and he hears them start rolling down the aisle.

401
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
 Fight continues.

402
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,400
 He's in a DC-10 cargo plane.

403
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,040
 He does a barrel roll.

404
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:10,640
 If you don't know much about cargo planes, they are not designed to fly upside down for

405
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,920
 any amount of time.

406
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:21,240
 He does a barrel roll in this DC-10 and at that point, ground control realizes something's

407
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,360
 up.

408
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,280
 They notice that this plane is flying upside down.

409
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:36,840
 So now ground control is calling into the flight.

410
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,760
 And as he's doing this barrel roll, this is the way combatants think.

411
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,720
 When you're life or the life of your loved ones, your teammates, your crew, are in danger,

412
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,160
 you think incredibly fast.

413
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,760
 As he's doing this barrel roll, he knows that this is throwing everyone off their guard.

414
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,840
 But he also knows eventually the barrel roll has to end.

415
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,920
 If you were in a fight and all of a sudden you get thrown into this roll, you're in a

416
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,400
 fight in an airplane, you're thrown into this roll, you would know eventually this roll's

417
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 going to end.

418
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,200
 So all I got to do is hold on until the roll is complete and then I can get back up.

419
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,760
 He knew that he had to keep Auburn off balance because he was going to mop these two dudes

420
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
 up.

421
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,520
 The other two dudes had too much damage to him.

422
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,160
 He didn't know this dude was a martial art.

423
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,880
 He didn't come in wearing his black belt.

424
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,760
 But just from his size, you knew that this was going to be a tough fight and he didn't

425
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,920
 have blood shooting out of his brain.

426
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,560
 So as he's coming out of the barrel roll and this plane was never designed for a barrel

427
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,640
 roll, a DC-10 has never done a barrel roll intentionally.

428
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,200
 As he's coming out of the barrel roll, he goes "Okay, I got to do something else to

429
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,040
 keep Auburn off of his guard by some time."

430
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,200
 The plane's coming out of the barrel roll, he does a nose dive.

431
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,480
 No DC-10 in history has ever flown as fast as Flight 705 did.

432
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,960
 He's in that nose dive and they said that as he was performing his maneuvers, the fighters

433
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,800
 went from a moment of being weightless to having more than three times their weight in G-forces

434
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
 on top of them.

435
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,280
 And he's hitting this nose dive and he's watching the instruments showing the speed.

436
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,680
 These DC-10s were built to hit like 510 miles per hour and he's going, he's going, he's

437
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,840
 doing this nose dive and he's watching the instruments and he's going so fast the instruments

438
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,760
 can't even register how fast he's going.

439
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,080
 The problem is, the problem is he might have postponed the fight a bit.

440
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,460
 He needs to now level the plane up.

441
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,280
 The problem is, is that to do that easily, he needs to de-throttle.

442
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,760
 The throttle control is on his right side.

443
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
 He's paralyzed.

444
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,260
 He can't move his right arm or his right leg.

445
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:57,760
 So as this DC-10 is flying faster than any DC-10 in history, straight towards the earth,

446
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,720
 Jim Tucker fighting that control, finally, finally able to level the plane off, reaches

447
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,560
 over, decelerates the plane, hits the call button and says, "Hey, FAA, yes, sorry about

448
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
 all that stuff."

449
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,080
 It happened so quickly.

450
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
 Guys, we're under attack.

451
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
 There's a dude on here.

452
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
 He's beating us up.

453
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
 There's a police at the airport right now.

454
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
 We're turning around.

455
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
 We're headed back to Memphis.

456
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,260
 The flight had only been going for about 30 minutes, so they came back around and air

457
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,380
 traffic control goes, "We're going to have everyone there for you.

458
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,380
 We'll have police.

459
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
 We'll have paramedics.

460
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
 You land that plane.

461
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,600
 We'll take care of it."

462
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,100
 When the plane landed, the paramedics were actually the first to board.

463
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,820
 They were the first there.

464
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,860
 Paramedics were the ones that handcuffed Auburn.

465
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,740
 The article said that when the paramedics got on board, it looked like a grenade exploded

466
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,000
 because there was so much blood.

467
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 These guys were just bleeding out of their head and punching and rolling around on the

468
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
 ground and having G4.

469
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,680
 There was just blood everywhere.

470
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,600
 Auburn didn't really have an alibi.

471
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,960
 He really didn't have an excuse for that.

472
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,480
 He was like, "No, no, it was the other guy.

473
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,440
 He parachuted out and I'm his evil twin.

474
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
 I mean, he's a good twin.

475
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
 I'm the good twin."

476
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,880
 He actually got life in prison for this.

477
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,040
 Luckily, all three dudes fully recovered from this.

478
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,540
 The one who had it the worst was Jim Tucker.

479
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,980
 He was paralyzed for about two years, but over time he regained use of his arm and his leg.

480
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,300
 He's still blind in one eye.

481
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,100
 I mean, that's how vicious this attack was.

482
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,740
 Remember, he was only attacked for just like a couple seconds in the initial flurry of

483
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,220
 hammer blows, but it was enough to paralyze him for two years and then still lose sight

484
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
 in one eye.

485
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,700
 But man, can you ... This is one of those stories.

486
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,100
 So you can read the transcript.

487
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
 Let me read you part of the transcript.

488
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,520
 I thought this was the ... This is the black box recording.

489
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,740
 I would love to hear ... Because everyone survived, but I'd love to hear the audio of

490
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
 this.

491
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,620
 Let me read you a clip of this black box recording here.

492
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,400
 Do you live over in ... These are the crew ... This is the crew talking.

493
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,560
 Do you live over in Arkansas, Dave or ... Nah, I live in Fisherville.

494
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,800
 Ah, Fisherville.

495
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
 Great spot.

496
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,440
 Sounds of hammer blows striking pilots.

497
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
 Ow!

498
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
 Oh, God.

499
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
 Oh, ah, God Almighty.

500
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
 Ow!

501
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
 What the ever are you doing?

502
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,260
 God, ugh, God Almighty, God, God.

503
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
 Get him, get him, get him.

504
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
 He's gonna kill us.

505
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
 Get him.

506
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
 Get up, get him.

507
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,760
 I can't.

508
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
 This one would have been funny.

509
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,660
 I would not have read this if they had all died horribly.

510
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,060
 I don't think they were saying ow.

511
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:43,900
 I don't know if that's an actual word people say, but yeah, it has the whole transcript.

512
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,680
 It goes all the way to when they land, basically.

513
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,480
 It ends when the door is being opened.

514
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,520
 And yeah, they're fighting him to the very end.

515
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,840
 They're fighting him to the very end.

516
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,080
 But they stop him.

517
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,120
 So an amazing, amazing story.

518
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 Yeah, look at it.

519
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,080
 He's still fighting for the hammer at the very end.

520
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,080
 The plane is still landing.

521
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,120
 And there he's still trying to grab one of the hammers.

522
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,840
 So hey man, he's relentless.

523
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,160
 Very, very interesting story.

524
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,940
 I would be shocked if this hasn't been made into a movie or a TV movie or something like

525
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,020
 that.

526
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,080
 It's a fascinating action packed adventure.

527
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,160
 The heroes win.

528
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,660
 The villains lose.

529
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
 I didn't even know this happened.

530
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
 It happened in my lifetime.

531
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,180
 There is action and adventure everywhere.

532
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,420
 You don't want to live through it right now.

533
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,660
 I'm not saying I want to be one of these dudes.

534
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,620
 I'm not saying oh man, my life sucks.

535
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,380
 I wish some guy attacked me with a hammer.

536
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,620
 Absolutely not.

537
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,420
 But it's cool to know that when the action starts, there's real heroes out there to stop

538
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
 it.

539
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,920
 They're just trying to do their job.

540
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,000
 They're just trying to deliver some mail.

541
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,720
 Instead they go toe to toe with a big buff martial artist in a plane.

542
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,320
 He's wielding weapons and they win.

543
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,920
 Not just using their fists.

544
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,520
 They use many of those.

545
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,880
 Not just using their wits, but using physics.

546
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,920
 Turning that plane into an ever changing battlefield.

547
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
 Fascinating story.

548
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
 Fascinating story.

549
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,520
 Thank you Captain David Sanders.

550
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,620
 First officer Jim Tucker and Flight Engineer Andy Peterson.

551
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,620
 Truly heroes of the skies.

552
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
 None of them flew.

553
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,780
 None of them ever flew again after this.

554
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,580
 They were all done.

555
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,380
 They were all like nah I'm good.

556
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
 I'm good.

557
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,020
 I'm probably getting pretty good retirement from FedEx.

558
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,340
 But the plane, despite it going faster than any DC-10 had ever done, despite it doing a

559
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,260
 barrel roll and these planes are not designed, they've never been tested to do a barrel roll,

560
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,680
 they still flew for years and years after that.

561
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,600
 Came out without a scratch.

562
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,760
 That is the story of Flight 705.

563
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,720
 They thought they were just going to deliver some packages.

564
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:58,880
 Instead they delivered some punches into the face of a madman.

565
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,160
