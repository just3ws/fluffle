1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
 An unseen car crashes into a raging river.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,000
 Is there any hope for the occupants?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 What would you do if you had a rifle locked and loaded?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,840
 And you saw Bigfoot.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,000
 Then we head out to Poland to find a cult with such bizarre beliefs.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,340
 You don't have the balls to join today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,840
 *Music*

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,340
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,840
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon, St. Sava.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,340
 St. Sava. Really, really appreciate your support.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340
 Really, really helps out a lot.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
 You will be our navigator, our pilot, our...

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,840
 What's the person? A chauffeur for this episode?

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,840
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
 Just help get the word out about the show.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,840
 That really, really helps out a lot as well.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,340
 So, St. Sava, let's go ahead and fire up...

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,840
 Let's get into Jason Jalapy.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
 We're gonna start off the episode in the Jason Jalapy.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
 We are headed out to Spanish Fork, Utah.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
 *Music*

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,340
 Our little car is driving down the road.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
 *Music*

26
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,840
 It's March 6, 2015.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,340
 And we're driving along. Now it's nighttime.

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,340
 It's 10.30 PM. We're driving down the road and in front of us is some other car.

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,840
 It's a Subaru. It's a Nissan Subaru.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,340
 If that's even a thing.

31
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,340
 And we're driving alongside of it.

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,340
 And all of a sudden you hear a...

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,840
 *Splash*

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,340
 Splash.

35
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,340
 No, there's not someone opening the can of Sprite.

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,340
 Refreshing Sprite and feeling the blast.

37
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,840
 Feeling that refreshing splash of citrus flavor.

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
 No.

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,340
 Us and the car in front of us both heard in the darkness a car go off the road.

40
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,840
 *Splash*

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,840
 Pull over and we're looking around and don't see anything.

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,340
 Can't see anything at all. It's super dark outside.

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,840
 But they call the police and they go, "Hey, I think I heard a car crash, but I don't see anything here."

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,340
 Now what's...

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,340
 What I would assume happens is that the police come out and check.

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,340
 But maybe it was too dark for the police too.

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,340
 Maybe it was maybe this center of Utah is actually a black hole.

48
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,840
 All light gets absorbed.

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,340
 But the police do show up.

50
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,840
 I don't know how they didn't notice this, but they show up.

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,340
 They're shining their flashlights.

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,840
 The light is bending into a circle and they're like, "Oh, we gotta go."

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,340
 So their light is bending into the event horizon.

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,840
 They're like, "Oh, we gotta go."

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,340
 So anyways, the police leave.

56
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,840
 Now, 12.24 p.m. the next day.

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,840
 So what is that? Like 14 hours later.

58
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
 There's a fisherman down by the river.

59
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,840
 He's throwing his little thing and shh.

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,340
 His fishing rod is what I meant. Don't be dirty.

61
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,840
 And he's drinking a refreshing sprite.

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,340
 And he sees a car upside down in the water.

63
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
 Now it's like half sticking out of the water.

64
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,340
 It was far and like, you wouldn't be able to see it from the road.

65
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,840
 So if you were driving down the road, you wouldn't have seen this.

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,340
 It was like in a gully.

67
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,840
 But I do think it's weird that the cops didn't spot half of a car in the river.

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,840
 Again, time and space may be distorted in this part of Utah.

69
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
 But the cops didn't see the night before.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,340
 The fisherman does though, 12.24.

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
 It's a long time.

72
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,340
 So the cops get to the scene that day.

73
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,340
 And they're really not expecting to find any survivors.

74
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
 Because it's been 14 hours, the water's freezing cold.

75
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,840
 It's March in Utah.

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,340
 The car's been upside down in the water.

77
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,340
 It would be summertime in Arizona.

78
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,840
 Your chances of living very long in an upside down car.

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
 But again, part of the car was sticking out.

80
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,340
 But you know, they're figuring whoever's in the car is dead.

81
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
 So when they get there and they kind of start looking at the scene,

82
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,340
 figuring out how to safely move the car,

83
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,340
 they hear a woman yelling, "Help! Help me!"

84
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,840
 What? They're looking behind them.

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
 They're like, "I know that sounds not coming from the car.

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,340
 Is there a woman on the freeway who needs her help?"

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,340
 "No! Help! Help!"

88
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,840
 So everything gets kicked in a high gear.

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,340
 And the cops run down there and they start to look in the car.

90
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,840
 And they see there's a little baby in the car.

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
 A little tiny baby.

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,840
 18 month old little girl was in her child's seat.

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,840
 And her head was barely touching the top of the water.

94
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,840
 She was cold. She didn't have long.

95
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,840
 The cops immediately, like the footage of this,

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,840
 where the cops when they noticed they were like trying to get into the vehicle

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
 to find out who's yelling and to help them,

98
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
 not just to discover who it is.

99
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,840
 They see the baby and you hear them go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby, baby!"

100
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,840
 And then they started singing that song by Justin Bieber.

101
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,840
 It becomes a musical dance number during this rescue.

102
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
 They rescue the baby. It's so heartbreaking.

103
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,840
 They show them like handing the baby up the hill.

104
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
 I mean, like minutes at this point.

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
 It's not like one guy trying to walk up a muddy hill.

106
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
 "Ooh, Benny Hill!" he's explaining.

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
 He passes it to one person. She passes it to someone else.

108
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,840
 And it goes on and they show a little 18 month old baby

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
 getting like chest massages and an ambulance.

110
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
 This is all like body cam stuff.

111
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
 Little "Wake up, baby!"

112
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,840
 Now, the baby is 100% fine. The baby is totally fine.

113
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,840
 But, but by the time they got there,

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
 by the time they were able to do all this rescue stuff,

115
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
 the mother, Jennifer Grossbeck, 25 years old, was dead.

116
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,840
 She was dead long before the cops got there.

117
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,840
 Now, none of these cries for help are caught upon any sort of body cam.

118
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,840
 But multiple officers and rescue personnel on the scene have all said

119
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,840
 they heard someone. They heard an adult woman crying for help.

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,840
 Here's a quote from Officer Tyler Bedose with the Spanish Fork Police Department.

121
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,840
 "I don't know what I thought I heard. I'm not a typically religious guy.

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 It's hard to explain. It was definitely something.

123
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 Where and why it came from? I'm not sure."

124
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
 Now, there's a, the baby survived. The mother died. That's obviously tragic.

125
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,840
 Was the mother's ghost crying out for help to save the baby?

126
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,840
 Because, you know, because really what would have happened?

127
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
 Because they had heavy machinery out there to flip the car.

128
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,840
 Had they just thought the car's been in the river for 14 hours,

129
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,840
 an adult would have been over, you know, dead by now.

130
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,840
 You wouldn't think a baby would just be barely touching the water.

131
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,840
 A average sized adult would have had their heads submerged for hours and hours and hours.

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,840
 The, they were, they were going to flip the car.

133
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
 And who knows what the baby would have been like,

134
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,840
 "Oh, they're doing demolition derby down there. They're pushing it with other cars."

135
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,840
 If they had not stopped to really run into the car and to look into the car,

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,840
 they may have mechanically flipped the car over and that could have done some serious damage to the baby.

137
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,840
 Sad story with a miraculous ending. Let's go ahead and get this story.

138
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
 Let's get this episode a little more chipper.

139
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,840
 St. Sava's over there. Don't, don't be sad, St. Sava.

140
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
 No, no, I just got something in my eye.

141
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,840
 I don't know why my voice is so eye-pitched all of a sudden.

142
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,840
 It's okay, Saint. It's okay. Here's, here's a, here's an official Dead Rabbit Radio handkerchief.

143
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,840
 You can use, I should have Dead Rabbit Radio coronavirus masks.

144
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
 Dang it.

145
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
 Anyways, let's hop inside the Carbner Coptor.

146
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,840
 Let's leave behind St. Fork, Utah.

147
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,840
 We're waving goodbye. We're avoiding that black hole.

148
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
 Push it harder. Push it harder, Saint.

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
 [Makes weird noises]

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,840
 We're flying away from Spanish Fork, Utah.

151
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,840
 We're headed out to the Montana Wilderness.

152
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,840
 [Makes weird noises]

153
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,840
 Beautiful trees everywhere, dotting the land.

154
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,840
 And I gotta say, this story was recommended by our good friend, friend of the show, Bennett,

155
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
 AKA Bigfoot Bennett, sending me some more stories.

156
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,840
 So, thank you so much. Gotta give a shout out to Bennett for sending this one over.

157
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
 There's a hunter there, and he has this rifle.

158
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
 And he knows what he's hunting.

159
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
 He's hunting the Sasquatch.

160
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
 Now, a lot of people say they're Sasquatch hunters, but this guy means it.

161
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,840
 He's not taking pictures. He's not setting up trail cams.

162
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,840
 He doesn't have any of that lame plaster cast stuff.

163
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
 He wants to kill it.

164
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,840
 So, he's walking through the woods, and he sees...

165
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
 He sees it.

166
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
 And he uses his right.

167
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
 Birds are all waiting to flutter at the gunshot.

168
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
 They're like, "When it goes to flying?" He's like, "Barry, Barry, no, not yet.

169
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 We're gonna be dramatic. We're gonna wait until the gunshot."

170
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,840
 You guys are like, "I have to go poop." You're a bird. Just poop here. Just hold on.

171
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
 Hunter has the rifle.

172
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
 He sees in the brush.

173
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,840
 I don't know what brush is. He sees in the brush.

174
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
 [imitates gunshot]

175
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
 That was the birds. That was the birds.

176
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,840
 On the other end of that rifle, about 50 yards away,

177
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 this dude is out doing some target practice.

178
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
 Plink! Plink, plink, shooting stuff.

179
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
 All of a sudden, [imitates gunshot]

180
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 tree shatters next to him.

181
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 [imitates gunshot]

182
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,840
 Birds find a way. Oh, that was awfully dramatic.

183
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
 Another gunshot towards him.

184
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
 Oh, another gunshot.

185
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
 [imitates gunshot]

186
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 Finally, the dude who was just there doing some target practice was like,

187
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,840
 "Stop shooting! Stop shooting!

188
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,840
 I mean, I'm assuming you're not. I'm assuming you're doing this on accident."

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,840
 And then the Bigfoot Hunter walks up to him and goes,

190
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 "Oh, dude. I'm so sorry."

191
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
 Quote, "I thought you were Bigfoot."

192
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
 So there is a guy in the Montana wilderness.

193
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
 This isn't the first time this has happened.

194
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
 There was a guy in the Montana wilderness,

195
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
 because another--this dude called the police.

196
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 Another guy came forward to the police and said,

197
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
 "Yeah, um, the other--you won't believe it.

198
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
 The other day I was walking through the forest and the police were like,

199
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
 'Let me get someone shot at you and thought you were Bigfoot.'"

200
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
 Yeah, how would you know?

201
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,840
 There's a guy in the wilderness--the police actually did interview him,

202
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
 but they didn't press the charges against him.

203
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
 That's what it was.

204
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
 So the police did find this hunter and they interviewed him,

205
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
 and the hunter goes, "Listen, I'll be totally honest with you."

206
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
 Quote, he looks right at the camera. Quote,

207
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
 "I don't target practice,

208
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
 but if I see something that looks like Bigfoot,

209
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 I just shoot at it."

210
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 Quote, turns away from the camera and looks at the cops.

211
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
 Now, I get it. Montana is a big state,

212
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
 and there's not a lot of people there,

213
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
 but I still don't understand why the police are like,

214
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
 "Whether or not people want to press charges on this guy,

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,840
 the fact is he's shooting--the fact is he's blind."

216
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,840
 Because what do you think of when you think of Bigfoot?

217
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,840
 There's three attributes that Bigfoot has.

218
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
 One is he has big feet.

219
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
 That's the most obvious one, but you can't see those as a hunter.

220
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
 Two, he's hairy.

221
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 And three, he's--say it with me--big.

222
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
 He's like eight feet tall.

223
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 So unless these other hunters being shot at

224
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
 are all NBA prospects,

225
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
 I don't--I--he definitely--he's just looking--

226
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
 he sees a guy who's five foot ten,

227
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
 he's five foot nine, and he's like, "There he is.

228
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 The legendary Bigfoot."

229
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
 He's shooting at normal human-sized people.

230
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 Even if these people are like,

231
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
 "Chris Hemsworth, six foot two scale,"

232
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,840
 I would never confuse Chris Hemsworth with a Bigfoot at all.

233
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
 So, they definitely--

234
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 whether or not they're pressing charges,

235
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
 they definitely should put a stop to his,

236
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
 "I shoot anything I think is Bigfoot."

237
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
 "Oh yeah, and I can't tell."

238
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 I don't know what a Bigfoot looks like.

239
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 I think Bigfoot is just a normal-sized human being,

240
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
 so I'm gonna shoot those two.

241
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
 So, that is going on.

242
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 You may want to cancel your flight out to Montana,

243
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
 or if you live there, maybe move,

244
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,840
 or quit wearing your Bigfoot costume for Halloween.

245
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
 And then let's take a quick trip back up here

246
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
 to Klamath County, Oregon.

247
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
 This happened on May 8th.

248
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
 I think it was 2019, actually.

249
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
 This guy calls up, 9-1-1,

250
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,840
 starts being a jerk to the 9-1-1 operator.

251
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
 But don't do that, right? Don't do that.

252
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
 You 9-1 once you're in emergency, you suck,

253
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
 and you stink.

254
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 Pew-ee! Oh, and by the way, I'm having a heart attack.

255
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,840
 Because how you treat them is kind of how--

256
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
 Think about, like, when you go to a restaurant,

257
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
 and you're rude to the waiter,

258
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
 and then first off, your food may come on time,

259
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
 but I guarantee it's been spitted and second off.

260
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
 It might just take a while if she doesn't come back

261
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
 to your table a lot.

262
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,840
 Imagine that scenario, but your life is in danger.

263
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
 So anyway, he says, "Guy calls up 9-1-1,

264
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
 he starts being a total jerk to the operator,

265
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,840
 and he says that some dude has an axe

266
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
 and is, like, attacking him."

267
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,840
 Again, in that circumstance,

268
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
 do you have time to be a jerk?

269
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,840
 9-1 operator, he finally gets to the meat of the matter,

270
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
 and the cops show up.

271
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
 Now, they're taking their time.

272
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
 The cops show up, and the guy goes,

273
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
 "Oh, you just missed them.

274
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
 You just missed them. You just missed the man with the axe."

275
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,840
 And then, as the man's talking to the police,

276
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
 he goes, "Oh, it wasn't just any man.

277
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
 I want to call 9-1-1 if it was just a man.

278
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
 I am obviously tough enough to fight a man with an axe."

279
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,840
 It was Bigfoot with an axe.

280
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,840
 And then the cops looked at each other, and they arrested him.

281
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
 But I'm on a mental health hold, I think.

282
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,840
 So there we go, two weirdos in the woods.

283
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
 One hunting Bigfoot, one being attacked by Bigfoot.

284
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
 But now that I think about it, they should team up.

285
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,840
 It should be like a buddy cop comedy, but they're not cops.

286
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
 They're both insane.

287
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
 It's like one man has the gun.

288
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,840
 Click, click. One man has the tongue.

289
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,840
 And he's super like, like he's cussing at people's...

290
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
 is what that means.

291
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
 But together, they're tongue and gun.

292
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
 That's the name of the movie.

293
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 People are like, "Wait a second.

294
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,840
 Is the implication the guy with the gun doesn't have a tongue?"

295
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,840
 Maybe that's it too. Maybe the guy without the gun can't talk.

296
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
 He's a mute.

297
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,840
 And then the guy who can talk can only be rude to people.

298
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,840
 And he's a pacifist. He can never shoot a gun.

299
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
 But that's my new movie. Don't steal my idea.

300
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
 Tongue and Gun.

301
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,840
 It's the story of two men lost in the woods.

302
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
 They were looking for a Bigfoot.

303
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
 They found each other instead.

304
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
 Actually, now that sounds more like a romance.

305
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
 Who knows? Tongue and Gun.

306
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
 James Wan, I know you listen to this podcast.

307
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
 Make that movie happen. Tongue and Gun.

308
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 The hunt for Bigfoot.

309
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,840
 Saint Sava, let's go ahead and fire up that carbonar copter one last time this episode.

310
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
 We are headed out to Poland.

311
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,840
 It's going to be a long journey. We're headed out to Poland.

312
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,840
 Specifically, we're going to a place that I didn't know existed.

313
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
 It sounds like a super villain.

314
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
 It's called Roklaw.

315
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,840
 There was a Reddit thread from a user known as Pat1.

316
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 And this was on the Unresolved Mysteries subreddit.

317
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,840
 And it was interesting because it was one of those conspiracy theories cults that I had never ever heard of.

318
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
 There's not a lot of resources on this.

319
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,840
 He's obviously translating it from Polish.

320
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,840
 And so when I was checking out some of the links he provided, I was running Google Translate.

321
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 There's not a lot of information out of this.

322
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,840
 So, I'm going to say right up the front, this is all allegedly.

323
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,840
 80% of this, 90% really, of this research is coming from Pat1.

324
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,840
 So, I really, really appreciate it for bringing the story to the light.

325
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,840
 And I really appreciate it for you doing the translating for it.

326
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
 Awesome, awesome job.

327
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
 Because I had never heard of this and it's quite fascinating.

328
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 We're going to land our helicopter in Roklaw, Poland.

329
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
 It's 1980.

330
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
 We're walking down the street.

331
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
 Everything's communist gray.

332
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,840
 Every so often there's a red flag fluttering in the distance we're walking from.

333
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,840
 And we see a guy named Edward Milenick.

334
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,840
 He's 35 years old and he's running through Town Square.

335
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
 Now, the night previous, he had a dream.

336
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 The Blessed Virgin Mary came to him.

337
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
 And really wasn't a dream.

338
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
 There's just a vision at night.

339
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
 At least what he claims.

340
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
 The Blessed Virgin Mary comes to him.

341
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,840
 He's running through the Town Square and he's like, "Everyone, everyone listen.

342
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
 I saw the Blessed Virgin."

343
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
 He wasn't doing that.

344
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
 He wasn't announcing at the next stage.

345
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,840
 But he does get a little nugget in his brain about starting a cult.

346
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
 And he does.

347
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
 He does.

348
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
 It's called the Entrowwies.

349
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
 The Entrowwies cult.

350
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,840
 By the mid-90s is when it kind of explodes in popularity.

351
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,840
 And it doesn't get super big, but cults don't have to be big to be dangerous.

352
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 You had 27 founding members and then you had 15 what was known as ordinary members.

353
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,840
 And then, so that's quite small for a cult, but then they would have classes in Poland

354
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
 that were attracting people because we're getting into the ideology in a second.

355
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,840
 They would have classes that would attract people and you'd get up to 600 people per class.

356
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,840
 But by 1994, the cult was disbanded.

357
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,840
 It was declared that the mission had been fulfilled.

358
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,840
 What they had been brought here for had been taken care of and they disbanded.

359
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,840
 So that is, that information is from a book called "Nahill Obstat"

360
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
 Religion, Politics and Social Change in East Central Europe.

361
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
 And that was written by Sabrina P. Ramit.

362
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 And it was a book about those subjects, Religion, Politics and Social Change.

363
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,840
 That was pretty much all the information about this group, the Entrowwies.

364
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:34,840
 But when we look at the research and the links that Pat wanted, we get a more interesting,

365
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
 but there really a footnote in cult history.

366
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,840
 Edward Milnick, 35 years old, he already was, before he even had the vision,

367
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
 he was interested in stuff like bioenergy therapy.

368
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,840
 That's like where you rub in the hands over people and you're feeling the energy waves.

369
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
 Oh yeah, let me push that one down.

370
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
 Okay, that one needs to come up a little more.

371
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
 Oh, not up too far.

372
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
 There you go.

373
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
 Hocus pocus type stuff.

374
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,840
 Dowsing, taking a stick or the little pendulum and being like,

375
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
 "Oh, there's like water here.

376
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,840
 You're next to a river as the wind's blowing it towards the river."

377
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,840
 But his classes, now again, this is all alleged because this is all from,

378
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,840
 this is all from the Reddit posts and this is all from articles that had to run through Google Translate.

379
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,840
 So there could be some errors here, but this is pretty much the gist of it.

380
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
 So allegedly, these were the stories that were told.

381
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 We're going to go to one of these Entrowwies class meetings.

382
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
 They're open to the public.

383
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
 We sit down, we're eating popcorn.

384
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
 This, that's not against the religion, you're allowed to eat popcorn.

385
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
 This movie starts projecting and it goes,

386
00:17:34,840 --> 00:18:04,840
 dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-d

387
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,840
 [Squeaking]

388
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
 That one is farther away.

389
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
 It wasn't a smaller ship.

390
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
 That one lands farther away from our main ship.

391
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
 [Squeaking]

392
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
 Doors come down.

393
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,840
 One ship was filled with the slobs.

394
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,840
 So you have all these people walking out of the ship and they're like,

395
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,840
 "Ugh, this is so awesome that we landed here.

396
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,840
 Hey, Po, what should we name this place?"

397
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 I don't know.

398
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 Let's name it Poland.

399
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 But we'll pronounce it Poland.

400
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
 Ah, that's a good idea.

401
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
 Then from now on, this place is known as Poland.

402
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,840
 Technically, they landed on a Silesia mountain,

403
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
 which is only 19 miles from Rokol.

404
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,840
 I mentioned this is so funny because we covered another cultish guy,

405
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,840
 Stanislaw, the guy who believed that the Yetis were trying to take over the planet still.

406
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
 He was a very, very famous artist.

407
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
 And I made, when I was doing that episode, I made the reference.

408
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
 It's always funny when people invent cults.

409
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,840
 Wherever they invented the cult and whatever ethnicity they are,

410
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,840
 that's the perfect species.

411
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,840
 You very rarely see a cult spring up in Tennessee

412
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,840
 saying that the most advanced people on the planet are New Zealanders.

413
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,840
 And the promised land is this little patch of land in New Zealand.

414
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,840
 It's almost always your ethnic group and where you're at.

415
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
 And Stanislaw, that artist guy had the same thing.

416
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,840
 Polish people were the only true humans.

417
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
 Everyone else was a Yeti-interbreed creature.

418
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 That was an old episode.

419
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
 That was like episode 150 or something.

420
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
 Anyways, so same thing here.

421
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
 They have two spaceships.

422
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 One of them is filled with slobs.

423
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 They land in Poland.

424
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,840
 Ship two is filled with Jews.

425
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,840
 At this point, when they announced that,

426
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,840
 and the other ship was full of Jews,

427
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
 we kind of look at each other and we're like,

428
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
 "Okay, where's this going?"

429
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
 And of course you know where it's going.

430
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,840
 It delves deeply into anti-Semitic territory.

431
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,840
 Jews are the enemies of the human race type of nonsense.

432
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 Everyone else is pure except for this Jewish ship.

433
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 People are tricked into worshiping Jews.

434
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
 That was one of the things where their ship,

435
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
 they said was the center of the world,

436
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,840
 but the true center of the world was Poland.

437
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
 So while everyone should be paying attention to Poland,

438
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,840
 in this version, Mary has Jesus who's half Jewish.

439
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
 And then because he's only half Jewish,

440
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,840
 he totally goes to war with the Jews

441
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,840
 and is trying to save the Polish people.

442
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,840
 And then it just nonsense like that.

443
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,840
 Just made up stuff, right?

444
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
 Because I'm not...

445
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
 I know it's pretty much a trope on this show

446
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
 that I don't know my geography,

447
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
 but I'm pretty sure Israel...

448
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,840
 I'm pretty sure if you're born in old-timey Israel,

449
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 you're not Polish.

450
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
 So the fact that for whatever reason

451
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,840
 they think that the mother Mary is Polish is...

452
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
 Again, I know why they think that's

453
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
 because the people who are following this are Polish.

454
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
 Now, this is going to obviously get 600 people

455
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
 into a classroom because you're being told

456
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 during communist Russian rule that you are the special people.

457
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
 Not only are you special,

458
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
 you're actually the only pure line from this other world.

459
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
 It makes you feel special.

460
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
 Colts really try to make you feel special.

461
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
 That's how they get you in.

462
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
 Again, if this cult was saying,

463
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
 "Well, there's two groups of people.

464
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
 The true believers were the chosen one

465
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
 and then the Jews."

466
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,840
 That doesn't resonate as much.

467
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
 Because then anyone can be the chosen one.

468
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
 It has to be,

469
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,840
 "We were denied our genetic birthright

470
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,840
 because of these Jews in this other spaceship."

471
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
 So it's very attractive religion

472
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,840
 to people who are being oppressed, right?

473
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 It makes you feel like in the near future

474
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
 you will have your birthright.

475
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
 Your genetic birthright will be re-established to you.

476
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
 Now, they also go to this level.

477
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
 They say that the Jewish people

478
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
 still have their starship on Earth.

479
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
 It's still on Earth where it landed.

480
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 I don't know what happened to the Polish one.

481
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
 It just kind of decayed.

482
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
 They just took it apart to build houses

483
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
 and they're like, "Hey, wait, don't we need that?"

484
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah."

485
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
 The Jewish people still have their spaceship now,

486
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
 but they need to power it with central European energy.

487
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,840
 So the Jewish people decided to start World War II,

488
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,840
 create the Holocaust so that specifically

489
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 Adolf Hitler was doing the Holocaust.

490
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
 The whole purpose of the Holocaust

491
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
 was to get energy for the ship.

492
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
 That was the whole point.

493
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,840
 They were using the souls, the biological energy

494
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 of other Jewish people and central Europeans

495
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
 to power the ship.

496
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
 But Hitler was defeated before the ship

497
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
 could reach maximum power.

498
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 So then the Jews backed Stalin

499
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
 to get more energy for the ship.

500
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,840
 So again, we see that this would be so attractive

501
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
 to Poles in the 1990s.

502
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
 The reason why we are under hardcore communist rule

503
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
 is because the Jewish people put us here.

504
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
 They're trying to siphon off our energy

505
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
 to create our ship.

506
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,840
 Now, every cult needs not only a bad guy,

507
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
 but they need a redemption story themselves.

508
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
 So you're totally on board.

509
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
 We're not.

510
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
 We're not.

511
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
 We're like, "No, this is nonsense."

512
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,840
 But Johnny Polish seed is totally on board

513
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
 with this thing, right?

514
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
 He's been bought in hook, line and sinker.

515
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 And he's like, "I believe.

516
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
 I believe that we came down, that I'm pure blood,

517
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
 that the Jewish people have their ship,

518
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
 and they're trying to take off

519
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
 and they're going to leave all of us behind.

520
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
 What do we do?

521
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
 What's our redemption?"

522
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,840
 And that is when the entroves let them know

523
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
 that we do not, while we do not have a spaceship

524
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 here on Earth, there is a race of alien people out there.

525
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,840
 Who will come and rescue us.

526
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,840
 Specifically, you're going to have 144,000 white people,

527
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,840
 Slavs, 600,000 other people from other races as well,

528
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,840
 but still mostly other Slavs.

529
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,840
 But the 144,000, the chosen one will definitely be Slavs,

530
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
 definitely be people from Poland,

531
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
 and then we'll get people from other races as well.

532
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
 Their ship is going to go,

533
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
 they said, "We're just going to lay low.

534
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
 We're not going to do anything for right now.

535
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
 We're going to lay low."

536
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,840
 "Alien soon," another hallmark of occult,

537
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
 is the coming promise day.

538
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
 It's not too far off in the future,

539
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,840
 but the alien soon will come to Earth to rescue us.

540
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
 And then you would go,

541
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
 "Well, if the Jewish people's ship is powered

542
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
 by the souls of Central Europeans,

543
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,840
 what's the alien ship powered by?

544
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
 Do we have to sacrifice?

545
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
 Is there going to be another massive war?

546
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
 We're going to have to sacrifice a bunch of people?"

547
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
 And Edward laughs.

548
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,840
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

549
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,840
 The alien ships are not powered by the souls of Central Europeans.

550
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
 They're powered by testicles.

551
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
 You're like, "What?

552
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
 I'm sorry, I missed that last part.

553
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
 Can you repeat that?"

554
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're powered by testicles."

555
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
 "If you're like that, why do you keep moving away

556
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
 from the microphone whenever I'm specifically

557
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
 asking you what they're powered by?"

558
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 And then Edward goes,

559
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
 "Okay, okay, here's the thing.

560
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,840
 Aliens do need human body parts,

561
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
 not energy, not biological energy.

562
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,840
 They do need human body parts to power their ships.

563
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,840
 And they love human testicles for their ship."

564
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
 I don't know.

565
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,840
 I don't know if it allows them to turn on their spinning rims

566
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
 or that little underglow.

567
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
 They have that little underglow underneath the ship,

568
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
 like all the nice cars in the 1990s.

569
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,840
 But that is it.

570
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
 They need human body parts.

571
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
 And they specifically--

572
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
 I've never known a car to be like,

573
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
 "You know what?

574
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
 I love gasoline in myself,

575
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
 but you know what I really love

576
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
 is gasoline from Puerto Rico."

577
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
 You're like, "What?"

578
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
 I mean, gas is gas, right?

579
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
 Body parts are--

580
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
 But first off, alien ships--

581
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
 I don't know why I'm quibbling on that.

582
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,840
 An alien ship that needed human body parts.

583
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
 How did it get here in the first place?

584
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
 Secondly, why would it want--

585
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
 why would it want balls?

586
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
 So this is where we get the connection to yesterday's story,

587
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,840
 because you had people castrating themselves.

588
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
 It became a ritual.

589
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 So basically, you were giving up your testicles

590
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
 to power an alien spaceship

591
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
 that may or may not ever come.

592
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
 People were into this.

593
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,840
 Now, again, they say that the Colt disbanded in 1994

594
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
 because their mission was complete,

595
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 which makes you wonder,

596
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
 is there a giant vault somewhere

597
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
 full of enough testicles to power an alien starship?

598
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,840
 But a lot of people in Poland think that

599
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
 the secret police just crashed the party and shut it down.

600
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,840
 But since '93-'94, the Colt's been done with.

601
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
 But what we do have

602
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,840
 is we have a couple of missing people connected to this.

603
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,840
 March 1st, 1993, a young man named Anzhed Selecki,

604
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 he was 18 years old.

605
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
 He attended a couple meetings of this group

606
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
 when this is 1993, so they're still in action.

607
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
 He attended a couple meetings.

608
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
 He was really into paranormal, spirituality, stuff like that.

609
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
 He started going to the meetings.

610
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
 He started-- again, this is a warning sign

611
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
 when people are into Colts.

612
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
 He began blowing off normal activities.

613
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
 He really stopped talking to his friends,

614
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
 kind of just hung out in his room all day meditating.

615
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,840
 March 1st, 1993, walked out of his house, never seen again.

616
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,840
 There was another teenager, according to Pat 1 on Reddit,

617
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
 he says that another teenager went missing,

618
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
 but he couldn't find much information regarding that.

619
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,840
 It was just something that Pat 1 was aware of.

620
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,840
 February 21st, 1995, so this is after the Colt supposedly broke up.

621
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,840
 There was a PE teacher named Bogoslaw T.

622
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
 From Germany.

623
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
 He came to Poland, so you weren't getting people from other countries

624
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
 attracted to this group.

625
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,840
 He came to Poland specifically to be with the Antrobes.

626
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,840
 They had a satellite group in Germany.

627
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
 They have a big Polish population in Germany,

628
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
 but in that particular region.

629
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
 He's seen in Warsaw, February 22nd, 1995.

630
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
 A few weeks later, he goes missing.

631
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,840
 A few weeks later, his body's pulled out of the Odra River.

632
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 He had a head injury.

633
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
 You know, you fall in a river, you bang your head,

634
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
 you can die that way, right?

635
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
 Mutilated body? Well, maybe he fell into the river,

636
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 hit his head, fell on a bunch of rocks,

637
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
 got mutilated up, right?

638
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,840
 Surgically removed testicles.

639
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
 The cops tracked down two surgeons who were known members of their troveys,

640
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
 and both of them go, "Well, the group doesn't exist anymore.

641
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
 I don't know anything about it."

642
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
 And so that case went cold in 1996,

643
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,840
 and apparently, again, according to Pat 1,

644
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 in 2009, the police records involved in this case were destroyed.

645
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 So, obviously, it's an oddball, no pun intended.

646
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,840
 It's an oddball cult that has stories of racial superiority,

647
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
 another group having racial inferiority,

648
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,840
 or being malignant towards mankind.

649
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,840
 These are all very, very common tropes in cults.

650
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,840
 A selected few, a coming judgment day reward for the faithful.

651
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,840
 But, cults never really just kind of go, "Oh, we're done.

652
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
 We're done being..."

653
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
 Because imagine if you did get castrated,

654
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
 and then, like, a year later, and it's like,

655
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
 "Oh, we're done. We're not doing this anymore."

656
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,840
 It would be surprising if the cult is completely gone.

657
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
 Even if the secret police broke it up,

658
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
 it would be surprising if there weren't some holdouts.

659
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,840
 If anything, when the government comes in to shut down the cult,

660
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,840
 it actually emboldens members,

661
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,840
 because then they know judgment day is coming,

662
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 because they're actually being shut down.

663
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
 So is this group still out here?

664
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,840
 Are they still harvesting human testicles to power a spaceship

665
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,840
 that will eventually take them out into the cosmos?

666
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,840
 I hope not.

667
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
 I absolutely hope not.

668
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,840
 But we will never know, unless someone in this group gets caught,

669
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
 someone in this group comes forward, we'll never know.

670
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
 It could be a group that is 100% underground.

671
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
 And it's one of those--

672
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
 and thank you so much, Pat-1, for putting all this information out.

673
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
 It's one of those groups that, as we're looking--

674
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
 and conspiracy theorists have a tendency to do this--

675
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 is these massive, multinational groups.

676
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
 And they're constantly paying attention to them,

677
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
 which I'm not saying don't do that,

678
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,840
 but at a certain point, the conspiracy becomes so overriding.

679
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
 It's this political group that's the bad guy.

680
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
 It's this political group that's the good guy.

681
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,840
 And they're looking at these massive plots

682
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,840
 from all these major figures that we can just name over and over again.

683
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,840
 It's these little groups that actually exist,

684
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,840
 existed, and have done harm, or may continue to do harm.

685
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,840
 While everyone's looking up at their political opponents and going,

686
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 "I bet you they're doing horrible things."

687
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
 "Two blocks away from you,

688
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,840
 there could be a group of people actually doing horrible things."

689
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 It's easier to look at your political opponents and go,

690
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 "That's the bad guy."

691
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,840
 Rather than to look at the small group of people that meet in the house

692
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,840
 once a month, you may not even notice it.

693
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
 But they notice you.

694
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,840
 When you're wearing the sweatpants walking down the street,

695
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 they notice you and they go,

696
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,840
 "He's packing a lot of fuel that we could use for our spaceship."

697
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,840
