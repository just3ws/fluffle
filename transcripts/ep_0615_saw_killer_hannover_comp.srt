1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 What happens if you have to hide from a ghost that can appear anywhere?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 Well, all ghosts can do that, but this ghost is extra creepy.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,800
 Extra creepy ghost.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,800
 And then we travel to Germany to try to unravel a bizarre string of murders.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,000
 Has someone somehow committed the perfect crime year after year?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Or is the serial killer from another dimension today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I don't know, I think I'm a lot bigger.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I hope you guys had an awesome time yesterday.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Listen to yesterday's episode.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Maybe you're binging this on the weekend.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I hope you guys had a good minute in between episodes.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Stomping into Dead Rabbit Command, knocking over all of our equipment, is God Rilla.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to God Rilla as you run in terror from this gorilla-Godzilla combination.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Maybe it's gorilla and God combined, I'm not for sure.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But God Rilla, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you guys are just a normal human being, that's okay too.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Just helps spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 So God Rilla, we're going to toss you the keys.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You catch them in your giant monkey hand.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 You crush the keys. I have to make you some new keys.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 We're going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We are headed out to Japan.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 [Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-D

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 [Dead Rabbit Durgible]

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 My pulse is normally like 60 beats per minute, which is almost like top tier athlete.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Why isn't everyone on Beta Blockers?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Why isn't everyone on this medication?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I've suffered no ill side effects from it.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 How come everyone's not on a pill to make their heart beat slower?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Like my heart rate at rest is the same as Michael Jordan's heart rate at rest.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And that's dope right now. Michael Jordan's heart in me.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 How come everyone's not taking Beta Blockers to just lower their heart rate?

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I don't know. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Are you a pharmacist?

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Go ask your boss. How come everyone doesn't get beta?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I'm not talking about babies and stuff like that, right?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 You don't put it in their bottle, but if everyone could have the resting heart rate of a top tier athlete,

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 why wouldn't they just give these pills out? I don't know.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But anyways, I'm not a pharmacist. There might be some reason for that. Who knows.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But anyways, that was that segment. Did you guys like that first story?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Now I just realized that I was checking my pulse before I started the show.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And I was like, man, this is good. My heart rate's dope.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Normally I guess it's like at 80 beats per minute. Now it's at 60.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So I've prolonged my life. Your heart rate, they say every heart beats a million times and then it starts to give out.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 That's why larger animals who hearts beat slower, they live longer, like elephants and whales and things like that.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Creatures like hummingbirds that have "t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And creatures like hummingbirds that have ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I mean, that's an actual segment of this story, but I did just come up with it. God Rilla, God Rilla's taking all my beta blockers. I'm like, no, no, I need those.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 He's like, oh, me God Rilla wants sluice or slow gorilla heart.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So while we stop at the pharmacy because he took all mine and we have to get his stomach pumped, we are in Japan.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Now I'm going to say I got most of my information about this story from a website called Kawabana.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's actually a website of a Japanese horror podcast. So they cover everything from Japanese horror movies to Japanese creepypastas.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 The host of the show, Tara A. Devlin, she's written a ton of books on the subject and basically the books are like collections of creepypasta, Japanese creepypasta, and she has a podcast.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I've not listened to the podcast itself, but I wanted to give that podcast a shout out. The website seems really, really cool. I got a lot of cool information from it.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 We may be revisiting the site in the future as well. So while we're in Japan, me and God Rilla are both in the hospital, you decide to go back home until we're both better because that's the kind of friend you are.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 You leave us when we're in need and you go back home, you hit your right home on a competing podcast, Irgible. You're at home and you're reading a book.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Oh, this book's really interesting as you're turning the pages. You're illiterate. You're just saying that out loud in case anyone's listening as your eyes shift from side to side.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I love reading. And you put the book down and you're sitting there and you see movement out of the corner of your eye. You're like, "Huh? What?"

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 And you turn and you look and what's weird is that where you saw movement, it's impossible because you saw movement. You know, I've been to your place. You know what it's like. You know, you have that dresser in your room that's against the wall.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 See, that's pretty good guess, right? Because all dressers are against walls. But no, no, no, I've been to your house, hastily, hastily traveled to your house.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 You have that dresser that's pressed up against your wall. You know the wall I'm talking about. There's a gap in between the wall and the dresser. It's pretty small, but it's there.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And that's where you saw the movement and you go, "Huh? It's impossible." So you kind of walk over there and you're looking in between the dresser and the wall.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's just the tiniest of all gaps. What do you see in there? A little hummingbird? What? And you're looking and then you see it. You see a woman's eyeball staring back at you from the darkness.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 But it's not just the eyeball. It looks as if a human is standing back there. A young woman is looking at you. It's impossible. No human can fit back there. But a ghost could.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 A ghost known as Tsukima-Ana, aka "Gap Woman" because she lives in the gaps. Or my favorite name. This is her real name. This is what they call her in Japan.

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 One millimeter woman. Because she can exist and even something as small as one millimeter. So one millimeter woman is this ghost. The name says it all, right?

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 She lives in- Now it doesn't have to just be one millimeter. You don't just move your dresser like a foot away from the wall and you're like, "Where are you going to live now? Now she's a foot wide."

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And it's not like she's a compressed, super squished up person. Imagine if you took someone and you could only see a millimeter of them. The rest of them was in the wall and the rest of them was in the dresser.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And then if you moved the dresser, you would just see more of her. So it's not like she's all funny, squished up, and she waddles out like a pencil. That's all you can see of her. She can exist in any gap. This is a really, really old Japanese legend.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It actually dates back to the Edo period. This is really, really funny because recently we did the story about how the samurai used to travel around the region, around Japan, looking for spooky stories to tell each other in the dark when they were playing the game.

75
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 It was like the Hundred Candle game or something like that. I'll put that episode in the show notes. But we recently covered that. This story started around the same time.

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And actually the reason why we know that is because a samurai was collecting scary stories. And this samurai wrote 10 volumes of 100 scary stories. And one of them was the story of the one millimeter woman.

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So you go, "Okay, what does she do?" Other than being the lost of time in space, you're like, "Yan, boring!"

78
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Other than that, other than existing where nothing should exist, her main power is to drive you mad because you will find no solace from the one millimeter woman.

79
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 She will appear in any and all cracks. So they usually say like the one thing that people tend to do when they run into this girl is first off you would cover up the crack in between the dresser and the wall with some tape.

80
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But then you go into the bathroom and you notice there's like the mirror is just cracked open a bit. The little door that has the mirror in it. I haven't been in your bathroom so I don't know how to describe that.

81
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 You see an eyeball staring out, huh? Sometimes when you sit down on your toilet seat, it's been a while since you fixed it at wobbles. You probably need to put some caulk down. She's down there.

82
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 She's like, "Oh no! I hate being down here. You're rocking the toilet bowl back and forth." She's like, "Oh, this hurts."

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 She can appear in any crack whatsoever. Cracked fingernail. She's in it. Actually, I don't know if she can do that. But any crack in your house.

84
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So door cracks, cracks in your walls. Remember she's one millimeter. So just a crack of paint on your wall, she's staring at you. So it drives people mad.

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So they try to tape it up. There's another version and you just go crazy because you can never cover up. You basically develop OCD over cracks. You can never cover them all up and you go insane.

86
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 That's one way she kills you. The other way is you fall in love with her because you're sitting there. You're a lonely soul. One millimeter woman comes and seeks you out and you're sitting there all alone and you meet another lonely soul staring at you from the millimeter crack in your wall.

87
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But you don't want to cover it up. You see this as a kindred spirit. It's really not. It's actually a form of brainwashing. Like you might go, "Well, I'm lonely and she's lonely, so we'll not be lonely together."

88
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 No, she feeds off your loneliness. She basically brainwashes you so you can't leave her. You're getting nothing from the relationship. It's not like you want to watch television. You make a huge gas in your wall and turn on some Seinfeld and she's just sitting on the couch next to you. It's all ripped open.

89
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 No, she feeds off your loneliness. So don't think that you actually have a friend. The one millimeter woman is nobody's friend. She lives in your wall. She drives you insane. There's been stories of people going over and be like, "Hey, how come Ralph's not at work anymore?"

90
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 They show up at his house and Ralph is sitting there all emaciated. He's like, "Ugh." And then they're like, "Hey, how come you haven't left?" And they're like, "Well, because my girlfriend's here."

91
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And then everyone turns and they look and he's pointing at a crack in the wall. They're like, "Ralph, you have not been binging the wall?" And he was like, "No, no, no, no, no." His eyes shift from side to side. He's like, "Okay, maybe a little." But there's also a girl in the wall and they're like, "That's even more confusing." He's like, "No, no, no."

92
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 See? And he points and there's the one millimeter woman staring at them from the wall and the friends leave. And he won't leave. He basically starves to death because he doesn't want to leave the girl alone. Plus, he's having a lot of fun with that hole in the wall. How do you get rid of the one millimeter woman? You don't.

93
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 According to legend, she's there to stay and they say if you see her, she'll follow you home. Tara was saying there was a theory about, "Could you lure the one millimeter woman to someone else's house?" And she said theoretically, "Yes." But in the stories, the woman doesn't tend to leave until the first person's dead.

94
00:11:44,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So it's kind of like the rain curse, but you can never get rid of it. You can only pass it on. You will die of it. So all the friends who came over to Ralph's house to see what he was doing, banging the wall, they would also all one day wake up and see this woman staring at him from the crack on the wall.

95
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And also they go, "Well, that wall, that hole in the wall, I shouldn't king shame. Hmm. It's the year 2021." And they are all doomed to the same fate. There's also, because it's the year 2021, very inclusive year for ghosts, there is a male version of Tsukiyoma.

96
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I don't think he goes by the name the one millimeter man. Men tend not to have names based on tiny lengths. His name is Tsukama Otoko, or the Gap Man, which is a better name. So Gap Man is the same setup, but he's far more vicious.

97
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 You're sitting in bed, you're flipping a coin in the air, and it falls and it rolls and it rolls against your dresser. You know where this is going. You get up, you're like, "Aw, great. I bet you there's a ghost in the dresser, right, Jason?" I'm shaking my head.

98
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 You walk up, you look behind the dresser, you see Gap Man, it's a dude, and he reaches out and he grabs you and yanks you into the gap, which is far more terrifying than slowly falling in love and starving to death.

99
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Getting yanked into a one millimeter gap is far scarier than "and he fell in love and his friends never saw him again." That's super lame. And you don't just go into the gap, it's not like all of a sudden you have 280 pounds being pulled through a one millimeter gap, which is inconvenient at best, right?

100
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 At best, it would ruffle your suit. You also get sucked into another dimension. And so there's that too. It's not just the fact that your entire body is compressed to the width of a penny within a split second.

101
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 You're also then, you're like, "Oh, that wasn't so bad. I mean, I tied instantly." But then you're floating in some sort of dark, eternal hell dimension. Nobody has time for that.

102
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Unless you're in there and time is meaningless, that's super spooky. So again, that's one up on one millimeter woman. And Gap Man's even more proactive than that. He will appear behind you. He doesn't even have to live in gaps. This dude has it all. This guy's basically just a ghost whose hobby is gaps.

103
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 One millimeter woman, that's her whole existence. He pops up behind you. You're walking through your house. Gap free house. You're living in a giant domed circle with no furniture. He'll just appear behind you and go, "Let's play hide and seek."

104
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Now, I don't know if he sounds like Beetlejuice. "Hubba, hubba." But he'll jump behind you and he'll say, "Let's play hide and seek." And then he's it.

105
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Did you like the spooky sound effect? That wasn't me. That was the actual door outside being super spooky.

106
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 You then have to run and hide from a man who can exist in one millimeter cracks. So the point is you can never hide. So it's kind of just a messed up game. So he just pulls you into the hell dimension. Like, that's it. Same thing, same end result.

107
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 There's just, he likes a little bit of chasing at that time. So still super spooky.

108
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Apparently, if you guys have been turned on by the fetish of a young woman staring at you from a crack in the wall, there are ways you can indulge this. Can you believe this? There are ways you can indulge this fetish online.

109
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 First off, there's a movie called The Spirit Behind the Door that's available on Amazon. There's also a book called Tsukiona. It's about a gap girl who lives behind this guy's dresser and then she starts eating human food and she gains a bunch of weight and she's no longer one millimeter.

110
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Now she's a normal girl and she walks up from behind the dresser. And I'm assuming she bangs the dude at some point. Like a romance thing. There's that.

111
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 If you're into tiny women, if you're into tiny women, if you have a feeder fetish, you're tied into one millimeter women growing. Check out that book. And then the movie as well. You can watch that.

112
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 So there you go. The story of the one millimeter woman, AK Gap woman. She may be watching you right now as you're sitting in your room listening to this or you're driving your truck at night listening to this or you're just out fishing listening to this.

113
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Be aware of the cracks around you. All of the cracks. They're everywhere. Because right behind you, right in front of you, right underneath you, there may be an eyeball watching you.

114
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And then being like, "That's gross. I can't believe you just did that. You're all picking your nose." The eyeball like looks away.

115
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 God, really, I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbon helicopter. We're going to leave behind Japan. We are headed out to Hanover, Germany.

116
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Carbon helicopter is flying across Europe. We're headed back to September 26th, 1975.

117
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to a Reddit user known as Dr. Winter. They compiled a bunch of research. I had vague memories of this story, but they were able to compile all this research that I'd gripped a lot of the notes from.

118
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 So I want to give a shout out to the people who've worked hard before me. Thank you very much, Dr. Winter.

119
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 In September 26th, 1975, in Godarilla, I want you to land this carbon helicopter right there. We're in Hanover, Germany, specifically bring the carbon helicopter down to the Schneller-Groben hydroelectric power plant.

120
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. If we get it out, we're walking around. And right when we get there, we see a bunch of German police officers just kind of shaking their head.

121
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 They're like, "How dare they let that gorilla fly that helicopter?" No, they're not shaking their head at us. They're shaking their head at the water.

122
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 They're like, "How dare you gum here, water?" They're watching a man fish out a body. A body of a dismembered young woman. This is a dark episode, but it's an interesting one.

123
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Probably should have given me that warning before I mentioned dismembered woman. But what are you going to do? It's not like I can go back and edit stuff out of the show.

124
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 They find this torso of this woman floating in the water. Estimated age, 23 to 25 years old. They believe she'd been floating in the water for around two weeks.

125
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Her arms and legs had been taken off with a circular saw of some kind. Even though the arms and legs had been chopped off of this woman's body, apparently at least one of the arms, if not more, there's only two, but one of the arms, if not other body parts,

126
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 were wrapped to the torso with some rope. So it was like a bundle floating down the estuary. So they had fingerprints. They had no head on this woman, but they had fingerprints.

127
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But the fingerprints came up as no match. They could tell that this woman at some point had given birth to a child and had a scar on her abdomen.

128
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 That was September 26, 1975, February 21, 1976. Parts of a woman, 25 years old, began appearing all over Hanover, Germany.

129
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Over the next seven days, they find at one point half of her torso. So it's like it's been sliced down the middle. They find the left half of her torso.

130
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 A couple days later, they find the right half of her torso. In between two parked cars and a parking lot, they find the woman's thorax sliced in two, just sitting there between two parked cars.

131
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Now I'm not laughing at what happened to the woman. I'm laughing at the people who discovered it, because that's just awful. That's just absolutely awful.

132
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 But anyways, they find her leg in a dumpster sticking out of a dumpster near an all-girl school. No idea who this woman is.

133
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It's a different woman than the first one, though. They know that, because the first one, they have the whole torso. This one, it's a sliced up torso.

134
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 May 28th to June 11th, 1977. Six body parts of a young man. Are you like, "Jayson, are you just listing off body parts?" I- Kind of. Kind of. But I'm going somewhere with this.

135
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I have to list them all. May 28th to June 11th, 1977. Six different body parts of a young man, aged 17 to 18, are found at the hydroelectric plant. One a week. Always on the weekend. No clue of who this victim is, either.

136
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 At this point, the police are starting to think, "Okay, so we're always finding- The first body, they believe was in the water for two weeks, but the other things, they're finding in these patterns. They go, 'Someone's definitely leaving these out on purpose. They're doing it to shock people.'

137
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And this last guy, he was happening every Saturday, we'd find another body part. So this guy probably works Monday through Friday, which is basically like 80% of the population.

138
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Also, I don't see why you couldn't dump body parts on your way home from work, but that was their working theory. June 5th, 1977, during that same body dropping spree, the arm of a 50-year-old man was found at the hydroelectric power plant.

139
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 So now he's just dropping multiple people at the same time. July 10th, 1977, just a month later, the lower body of a 40-year-old woman is found in a nearby forest. She had been cut with a machine saw.

140
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 This is the first time that the coroner says, "This person was murdered before they were chopped up." And you go, "Well, obviously, Jason, all these people are murdered."

141
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Well, first one of the theories was that someone was doing this as a prank. It was medical students, because we know how funny those guys tend to be. Medical students were dropping body parts to be funny.

142
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 People thought maybe these were grave robberies, because they couldn't match any of these victims to missing people.

143
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 This was the first one that goes, "No, this person was murdered." So this isn't a prank unless those college students are really getting out of hand.

144
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 This isn't a prank. Like, this person was murdered and then chopped up. They could actually see violence done to the body pre-mortem.

145
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 This one, they said, this woman they noticed, she had evidence that she had an appendectomy. She had her appendix removed. And she had a child. They could tell that from the remains.

146
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 That was on July 10th, 1977, December 18th, 1977. The upper body of a 50 to 60 year old woman is found on a dirt road.

147
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 They find strangulation marks on her neck, again showing that this woman had been murdered, cause of death is ruled as a suffocation.

148
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 She had an appendectomy and had given birth to at least one child.

149
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 These victims have never been identified. Ever. To this day, people have no idea who these victims are.

150
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 The serial killer, the saw killer of Hanover, is the name the media gave him, has never been identified. There's been suspects, but it's never been identified.

151
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Let's put our conspiracy caps on for this one, guys. And I don't mean any disrespect to the families. But we don't even know who the families are, actually, now that we think about it.

152
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 One of the theories the police had was that this guy was a butcher. And he's chopping these people up and he was freezing them for a while and then disposing of the bodies.

153
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And that's why they didn't know who they were, but that doesn't make sense. It's not like someone goes missing and you're like, oh no, my son's been missing for two weeks.

154
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 What? What's that? I forgot his name. I don't remember his name. No matter how long you froze a body, people are still going to know these people are missing.

155
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So here's my theory. Conspiracy cap, fully on, guys. Here's my theory. There's four women and two men killed.

156
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And out of the four women, three of them have two things in common. One of them isn't that rare, though. You have three of the women, the first one and the last two, they all gave birth to a child.

157
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 That's not super unique among women. But what are the chances of all of them having appendectomies? Now you go, Jason, the first one didn't have an appendectomy. You didn't say that, at least.

158
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And I know how could you go with your notes. No, but the first one had a scar on her abdomen. So could that have been an appendectomy scar?

159
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 The other body of the woman, also the ages are interesting, too. The first woman is 23 to 25. The second woman is 25 years old. That's what they determined.

160
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And then the last two was a 40-year-old woman and then a 50- to 60-year-old woman. The one who was 25 years old, her body was cut in half.

161
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 I don't know if they could determine if that body had also given birth due to the injuries. I'm not for sure on that. But conspiracy caps fully on, what if the victim is the same woman?

162
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 What if this killer is killing the same woman in different time periods? He kills her when she's 23. He kills her when she's 25. He kills her when she's 40. He kills her when she's in her 50s.

163
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And that's why she has the same markers. What if that's the reason why these women are never able to be identified? Because they're not even from this time period.

164
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 If you have a 23-year-old body, you can start to look at 23-year-old women who've gone missing the past couple weeks, past couple months, but you're not going to think to go back a past couple years.

165
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 If a 25-year-old woman went missing in 1966, well, she's not going to be 25 in 1976. You're not really going to think about that.

166
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 And if a woman went missing in 1966, could you freeze the body that long? I mean, technically you could. You could freeze the body that long.

167
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 But there would be evidence that the body was frozen that long. Because I've seen movies. I saw Demolition Man. They'd have little icicles on him.

168
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 You know what I mean? They would be able to tell. They wouldn't be able to tell if the body had been frozen for two weeks, but they could tell that it was in deep storage for 10 years.

169
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But what if the victim didn't go missing in 1966? What if the victim went missing in 1466? Or in 2066, for that matter?

170
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 You just find in body parts, you're not finding their clothes. You're not finding their caveman rags or their Jetson clothes.

171
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It's been over 40 years. These crimes happened when I was born. It's been over 40 years, and we have no idea who the victims are.

172
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 A lot of times we have no idea who the killers are. We have six different victims and no idea. With fingerprints, we have no idea who these people are.

173
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 DNA tests, nothing. This is a cold case, nothing. They cannot figure out who these people are.

174
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Is it possible that they're not from around here? And I don't mean they're not from Hanover, Germany. They're not from this time period.

175
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I'm not saying that every unidentified person that is found murdered is the victim of a time-traveling serial killer.

176
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 But is it possible that some of them are?

177
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 The past would be the perfect place to dump bodies. Because you never, you would just be some weird mystery.

178
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 These people were found, no one knows what happened to them. You could dump corpses in the past, no problem.

179
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And you never get found out for your murders in the future. And this killer, the saw killer of Hanover, Germany, may have actually been traveling through time, killing the same woman over and over again.

180
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Which just sounds absolutely horrific. And it would actually be interesting to look at how time-travel works.

181
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Like, maybe he really wanted to kill this woman, but no matter how many times he kills her in the time stream, she still gets older and lives a normal life.

182
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 He has to literally keep executing her over and over again. But time isn't a confined loop like that.

183
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 As to the two men who died, one of them, it was his arm, came just floating down the river. The other one was a bunch of severed body parts of a young man. I don't know.

184
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Maybe that's the same dude. Maybe that's the same dude too. But there's no evidence for that. There's not much evidence for my other theory as well.

185
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But that one, we just see some body parts of a young man, and then eventually an old man's arm, floating down the river.

186
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And think about it, those two happened at the same time. Let me look back at my notes. Yeah, that's the only time that the body parts were kind of getting mingled together.

187
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 So maybe that also is the same boy. What if... dude, check this out.

188
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 There is a interdimensional time traveler who is a serial killer. But technically he's not a serial killer, because he just keeps killing the same woman over and over again.

189
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 But twice he was stopped. The first time as a young man, the woman turned his own blade on him and chopped his body up and threw him through the time portal, where his body parts landed in the river he threw.

190
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Now that I think about it, she would have had to throw one through the portal every Saturday, but actually know that I think about it's time travel.

191
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 So she threw him all at one point in the time portal, because time doesn't really matter with time travel. One fell through every Saturday.

192
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And then the killer came back as an adult man, as a 50 year old man, and she stopped him again, but this time she was only able to cut off one of his arms.

193
00:28:47,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 And that arm fell through the portal. But he learned from that mistake. There were no more male body parts found. Now the saw killer of Hanover was one armed, but he still was able to kill that woman two more times.

194
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 So how would you stop a time traveling serial killer? Obviously, that starts a whole process of, well they would know they were coming back to be hunted, because they would know that they had got caught in the future and all sorts of stuff.

195
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And what it sounds like from this story, if we go with the time travel hypothesis, is that you can't really stop the time stream. If he killed the woman when she was 23, but then he's able to kill the woman when she's 60, obviously she was able to age up.

196
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So time isn't as cut and dry as we think it is. But for whatever reason, he's taking out these different versions and dumping the body parts in Hanover, Germany.

197
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 It's a bizarre theory over a real world crime. It's taking a real life series of murders and putting a sci-fi veneer on it, turning it into basically a short story.

198
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 But it's an interesting concept nonetheless. The coincidences are bizarre. And it opens up that question of how would you stop a time traveling serial killer?

199
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And it also opens up the question of this, whenever we think about time travel, obviously the question is would you go back and kill Hitler? Would you go back and kill Hitler as a baby? Would you go back and kill Hitler as great great grandparents?

200
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 How do you know that you're not destined to be an evil of humanity? How do we know that? Hitler wasn't 10 years old and being like, you know what, someday I'm totally gonna just destroy Europe.

201
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 He's just playing with planes and stuff, picking his nose. So when a time traveler comes back and confronts you, puts that gun to the back of your head and proclaims, I'm doing this for all of humanity,

202
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 will you take that bullet? Will you believe that he is right? That you are destined to become sort of blight on the planet?

203
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 That's an interesting question. But what the Sawkiller of Hanover reveals is it might not be that simple.

204
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 No matter how many times you kill someone in the past or in the future, time requires them to exist. The Sawkiller of Hanover may be a story of brutal unsolved murders in a small German city, or it may be proof of the complications that involve time travel.

205
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 No matter what you do, you cannot stop the future. So when that time travel does pull that trigger and blows your brains out, trying to save humankind, he doesn't realize you are still destined to destroy us all, and somehow you will do it.
