1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Russian bots finally exposed by the mainstream media.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 The worst sports disaster in world history.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we take a look at a curious case of a man who went missing

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 and then reappeared today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Dead Rabbit Radio theme]

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 You know, this cold is really kicking my butt.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And I thought that and then I thought, where does that phrase come from?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Why the butt? Why? Like why not man?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 That's really kicking my head in or man, that's kicking my feet.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Like why the butt, but why is the butt what's getting kicked?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Because the other person who's doing the kicking can really aim for any part of your body

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 and the butt actually isn't the most vulnerable.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Like it's all cushiony and stuff.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 So I wonder where that phrase came from.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 If only I had some sort of magical device program built on my computer

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 that would allow me to enter in that phrase and find the origins

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 but alas, such a knowledge box does not exist.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We got a lot of weird stories for you today.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 The first story is, I know I don't talk about politics on the show.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 It is the unwritten but often spoken rule.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Because there's just too much politics in the world.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 People need a place to escape. However, I can't let this story go by.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We've heard about Russian bots over and over and over again in the news

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 and now gentlemen and ladies or ladies and gentlemen however the phrase goes

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 we have uncovered the truth the year 2018.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 The month, this month, coincidentally, because it was just in the news.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So they have this big robotics, they have this, in Russia, they have this big electronic show

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 and the presenter was like, it was for youth in technology.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He's trying to get them young, trying to get those nerd hooks into those people young.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And you might have already seen this in the news so you know where this is going

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 but I thought this was absolutely hilarious.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So there's this conference and they brought out this robot

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and he's walking, no cables, no like suspension system.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 He walks out on stage and they're like, look this is Boris, the robot in the audience.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It's like, oh, that's really cool.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Now, the presenters had him walk out on stage and dance a little bit and talk

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 and the youth in the audience were like, oh cool, it's a robot.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And that was kind of it but what happened was the Russian, the state Russian network,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 the state Russian network, it's a Russian 24 original title, presents this story

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 and they're like, look, look at how advanced Russia is, we have this robot

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 and they're showing this clip. The robot comes out on stage, doing a little dance move.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 It's talking, it's walking around.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And the television program was like, this is the state-of-the-art robot

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 that we have invented here in Russia.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And at this point, the guys who were running the show that was originally set up

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 to entertain young kids were like, dude, it is only a matter of time before this blows up.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 People were like, that is one of the most advanced robots ever.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 A lot of the robots we have are like tread based or they have four legs

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 but to have a robot that can walk on two legs with no additional wires or anything like that

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 and spoiler alert, it was human sized, it was a human sized robot, is quite advanced.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Like, Osimo was like three feet tall, he was quite slow.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 This robot was six feet tall and was moving.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Spoiler alert, like a human.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And so people were watching this in Russian television scientists and just around the world

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 and they were like, where are all the sensors on this robot?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Where is all of its stuff to be able to tell where to go?

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Like, it's oddly built, it looks like a human with no additional sensors.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Other questions were, why weren't there any research papers being developed on this robot?

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Why did Boris just walk out on stage one day?

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Why didn't we see documentation going back saying we've worked on this sensor, we've worked on this sensor?

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 But then another question came up, someone goes,

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 okay, maybe they put the sensor somewhere we can't see him,

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 maybe they kept the project under wraps, but why can't you see a human neck exposed when he turns his head?

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Yes, Boris the robot was not a robot, it was a man in a robot suit.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And the presenters at the show never once said, we built this robot, this is something real.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 But when it was reported on Russian television, they said that this was an actual real android.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And then photos surfaced of the robot without his head on and it was human, obviously human underneath.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The company that made the robot costume were like, oh yeah, that's a standard robot costume.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Oh, and then Russian 24 took the clip offline, but by then it's all on YouTube, so it's everywhere, so as you can see this robot dancing.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I get it, they were just trying to entertain kids.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 It would be the equivalent, is if you had a show and Chuck Cheese walked on stage,

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 was waving at the kids and playing the banjo, and then some news network was like,

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 giant mutant rat terrifies children. It was that level of incompetence and the Chuck Cheese people were like,

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 he was just a dude in a suit, you didn't even ask us.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 There was a real rat running around. Is Chuck Cheese a rat or a mouse, actually?

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 The implications of he's a rat are far grosser than if he's a mouse.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So, Russian bots, I thought the story was hilarious.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 It was a mix-up, a little bit of mix-up, a little bit of national pride, sometimes those two things collide.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And you get an embarrassing YouTube video that will be laughed about by dorks and geeks and podcasts for a long time.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Second story we're going to cover, if that was interesting, is actually very short as well.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 But here's the thing, I'm going to tell you this story.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And other than certain specifics, I want to see if you can figure out what would be different today.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 If this story took place today, what would be changed?

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And there's going to be specifics about like construction material and the actual sporting event.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 But just the general outline, I want you to listen to it and think,

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 that wouldn't happen today or something different would happen today.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So this is the story. There was a town, this is going way back in time, we're going back to 27 AD.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Roman Empire rules most of Southern Europe and other parts of the world.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And there was a town called Fidne. Fidne. Fidne. Fidne.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So Fidne, that sounds more not American. Fidne was this town and it was situated in the Roman Empire.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Now what happened was there was this time period where, if the editing sounds weird on this episode too,

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 it's because I'm sneezing every five minutes and my voice changes.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Emperor Tiberius said, "You know what dudes, no more Gladiator games, I just don't like them.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 They're banned from the Empire." And everyone's like, "Aww."

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 But in 27 AD for whatever reason, Tiberius, because you know what, I think we need some Gladiator games.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And everyone's like, "Wah, wah, wah."

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 So at this point there was a entrepreneur/crook named Attilius.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 His name's Attilius. And he's like, "Okay, they want games. I'm going to build an amazing Colosseum

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 and I'm going to make a ton of money. I'll be the first Colosseum up, then the Colosseum.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But we're just going to pack them. We're going to pack them in boys.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 We're going to get some of that sweet, sweet Lyra. So, or is it Lyra? It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So, he says, "Let's build this quickly and we've got to build it cheap because we've got to build it quickly."

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So he builds this massive Colosseum in Fidenay out of wood, which that's not unheard of back then,

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 but they didn't really scope out the land. They just started building it.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 The land itself was uneven and due to not the greatest materials and not the greatest craftsmanship,

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 because he's trying to save that money, it's not the safest place in the world.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So, they do finish it and he's like, "Come on, come on, to the Gladiator Games.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 That's all the marketing we do in this time. We just yell on the street corner. That's it."

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I wonder what marketing was back then. I guess it was probably, I had to all be viral marketing word of mouth.

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 What else are you going to do? You didn't have a printing press.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I don't even know if they had paper. Didn't they just have scrolls?

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 That'd be really expensive to advertise an event in ancient Rome,

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 because you pretty much just get a bunch of dudes who are like, "Hey, were you the Battle of Marathon?"

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 They're like, "Yeah, sure." He's like, "Okay, I need you to run all around the Roman Empire,

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 telling people to come to my Gladiator Games."

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Like, what are you going to do? Throw, like, make a bunch of Eagles fly around dropping stuff?

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It'd have to be word of mouth. How did you advertise anything back then?

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 There were merchants. I mean, I guess if there was a merchant, you'd be walking on the street

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 and someone would be like, "Glass bottles, glass bottles," and they need to go buy a glass bottle.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 But if you were going to have a Gladiator game in a certain town on a certain day,

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 how would you get people to... You're like interrupting, fortune telling,

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 like people are throwing chicken bones and it's like, "Come to Atelius.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Come to my famous casino." Not casino.

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It spells like, like, Gladiator Games Thursday night, only in Friday.

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 But anyways, he marketed it somehow. And I know that because he said in an article,

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 that's why I was trying to figure out, "Well, how did he market stuff?"

130
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 They get it... The place is packed.

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Because they're like, "Finally, Gladiator Games are back.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I've always wanted to see people get chopped up."

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And so the Colosseum is packed full of people and the games start and there's like,

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 [makes noise]

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And they're like, "Oh, no. It's not a cat. It's not a giant cat."

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Under the Colosseum, that's supposed to be the sound of the wood creaking.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I know that sound that'll like, "Hey, there's a bunch of tigers."

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 He's like, "That's where I put my tigers." He was cutting costs so much.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 He's like, "I'll just put the tigers underneath the stands."

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Anyways, so let me... No special effects. The place blows up.

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 It just falls apart. The whole Colosseum collapses.

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It was packed full of people and we know it was packed full of people because the death toll is anyway...

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 The death toll. People actually died, not including the people who were injured or the people who saw any of it.

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 10 to 50,000 people and even at 10,000 people, it's the worst sports disaster of all time.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 There's never been that amount of people killed at a sports game ever in history.

146
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 10,000 people minimum died during this. Another historian ramped it up to 50,000.

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Some people say probably 10,000 and other 40,000 injured, but they just collapsed.

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 People began to leave their homes to save the people that they could.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 You had rescue workers all over the place throwing stuff around.

150
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The emperor himself came to Fidene to assist in the recovery effort.

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Not like he was picking up boulders and stuff, but to help maintain order and kind of be there as a presence in the city.

152
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Maybe he was picking up boulders, I don't know, but he was there to assist in the recovery effort.

153
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And what happened afterwards was that the Roman government said, "Okay, this can never happen again. Ever happen again."

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 So we're going to make some new laws. One of the laws was that you couldn't build a Colosseum unless you were rich.

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Like you had to have a certain amount of money on you before you could build a structure that big.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 They said, "We only want people who, so it's not a get rich quick scheme. You already have money, then you can build a Colosseum."

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 They also made it a law that all Colosseums had to be, or amphitheaters, but they had to be built on a solid, structurally sound foundation,

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 because he was just basically building it wherever he could.

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And it had to be inspected and certified for safety.

160
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Attilius himself was banished, and based on the terminology, some people think he was kicked out of Rome.

161
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Other people think he was banished in the sense that he could no longer do any sort of business like that.

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 He was banished from the business of basically entertainment or gladiatory games and so on and so forth.

163
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And I said in the beginning, "Could you name a part of that story outside of certain specifics that wouldn't happen today?"

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 27 AD is when that story took place, and it is almost to a point exactly what would happen today.

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It was mind-boggling. When I was reading the story, I kind of stumbled across it somewhere, and I'm reading it and I'm thinking,

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 "This is everything. It's so funny because I think we have an idea that the past people are more like Regal,

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 or more barbaric, or more like thoughtful, or more savage, or whatever."

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Depending on the region, depending how you think about it.

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But this story, I could have changed specifics about this and the date, and you would have thought it took place in 1980 Scotland,

170
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 or 2018 Australia.

171
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 A guy wants to get rich quick.

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 He builds something really, really cheap. It injures or kills a bunch of people, and new legislation is put forth,

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 so that never happens again.

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 That story happens all the time. It's roller coasters. It's swimming pools. It's all sorts of stuff.

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Other sports arenas. And it's funny because I'm reading it and I'm picturing it.

176
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 It's funny to think that the Roman Senate was probably getting old-timey phone calls. People are picking up seashells and they're like,

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 "Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,

178
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 "Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum

179
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 "Let's try to maintain our way of life. Let's try to keep humanity strong." And I said, "People probably think I'm giving them too much credit, but they were basically humans at that point."

180
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 This really bears into that point where these guys, every character in the story still exists today.

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 You have the senators who are like, "Damn it, we gotta legislate this stuff." You have the greedy person.

182
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 You have the emperor who has to make a show, but he has to come out to the disaster area. Presidents will go to hurricanes and stuff like that.

183
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Even though he had nothing to do with it, either he was there for a moral reason or he was there for a publicity reason.

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 You have just the average people who wanted to go about their day who fell prey to someone's greed.

185
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And then you have the people who ran out of their houses and were going about their day and saw this horrible disaster.

186
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Can you imagine going to a disaster scene that had 10,000 casualties? Not to mention the giant cat living underneath the Colosseum.

187
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I just think it's an interesting story because it shows how little humans change, despite the fact that the specifics have changed for humanity throughout the years.

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But humanity themselves, they act in the same ways. This story could have played out anytime between 27 AD and today and you would see those same elements.

189
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Fascinating stuff. Fascinating stuff.

190
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Okay, we're going to move on to our next story, our last story actually.

191
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I don't like time, I won't say I don't like time warps, but time warps and portals and stuff like that, portals that are out of their dimension.

192
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 They always scare me because you think that they're probably one of the most mundane, fortian, weird things that can happen.

193
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Like, Bigfoot is just like this big dude who hangs out in the woods, people are looking for him all the time, but he's kind of contained to certain areas.

194
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You don't want to see a ghost, don't go to a haunted house. You don't want a succubus to come in your house, don't summon one, stuff like that.

195
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 But portals are creepy because you just don't know where they're going to pop up.

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 You're assuming they exist in the first place, but the idea of walking through the woods or walking to school or something and then all of a sudden warp, you just disappear.

197
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And then no one ever knows what happened to you, people are like, "Oh, whatever happened to Jason Carvener?" His podcast just ended that day and they're like, "Well, he did rack up quite the enemy list in 125 episodes,

198
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 and I'm really just floating around in this weirdo dimension." But most people who go missing are found dead, or they're runaways, or they're returned home.

199
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 They're just like, "Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, I was just over at my boyfriend's house." That's the majority of missing person cases.

200
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 But there are the cases where people just go missing and then for the longest time, people go, "Well, we don't know what happened to him."

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And for most of those cases also, I'm sure they're dead, we just never find them, or they're spirited away to some other country or whatever.

202
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 But we have this interesting story. This story takes place in the year 1978 and we're in the Lake Michigan area.

203
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Now, there has been talk about the Lake Michigan Triangle or the Great Lakes Triangle, how these are areas of abnormal disappearances with boats and airplanes and people and stuff like that.

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 But there's no problem with those designations because I could draw a triangle over any geographical area with high traffic and pick out 10 stories.

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 That's super easy to do. And then go, "Lookit, 10 people went missing in the past 30 years." Isn't that weird? And you're like, "Wait, what?"

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 But if I tell those stories right, I can make it sound weird. Really, I could draw a triangle over from Hood River to Portland to, I don't know, somewhere else here, Gresham.

207
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And I'm sure all have at least 10 bizarre disappearances.

208
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 So there was a bunch of women who went actually missing up here in Hood River like a summer or two ago, or it wasn't just women, they were hikers.

209
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And I was like, "Oh, seared up killer." And people are like, "No, people disappear from here all the time because they go on hiking trails and disappear."

210
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And I was like, "I don't know." That was actually before the podcast. But I think they found two of their bodies.

211
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 One of them was weird. One of them jumped in the river or something like that. But anyways, the point being is that you can take any geographical area and draw lines around it and say, "There's weird stuff in here."

212
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So I really dismiss the idea. I like the idea of the Bermuda Triangle just because it's longevity. I don't really give it much credence as a real phenomenon because boats and planes, it's one of the most highly trafficked areas in the western Pacific Ocean, that's what I'm trying to say.

213
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 So, but whatever. But these new ideas, they're like, "Oh, look at this triangle. I don't give much credence to it." There is an, oh, you know what? I'm not even going to do the episode. Here, hold on a second.

214
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 This was going to be this, I'm going to say this real quick. I was going to make it its own segment. It pretty much falls into what I've just been saying.

215
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 This particular segment of the man, I know it's getting confusing now. Okay, let me back up.

216
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So, Sean on YouTube sent me a story about a man eating stone, a stone that eats people. And I looked into it and it was a, like, this guy writes kind of this nonfiction fiction kind of legends of an area.

217
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And he's the only person who's ever stated that there's a stone that eats people. And the stone that eats people, it's in Vermont. He's like, "Maybe a stone's eating them." What?

218
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And what he's referring to is in Vermont there's a thing called the Bennington Triangle. It's a triangle that's full of missing people. People go missing here all the time. Listen to this craziness.

219
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 From 1945 to 1950, six people went missing in the wilderness. So, I mean, like, I could, that's nothing. Like, they'll always draw, and thanks Sean for the recommendation.

220
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Like, I'm not saying that it was a bad story or anything, but I couldn't really feel anything more than that. Some of the disappearances were weird. Like, it could have been a killer.

221
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 But it doesn't mean one of the stories was a kid was sitting in his car and the mom went to go to the grocery store. And when she came back, the kid was missing. They never found him.

222
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 How did a rock eat him? Like, how is this author saying that maybe rocks are eating people? When one of the missing people is a kid in a car, was he listening to rock music and it came out of the speakers?

223
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 So, Bennington Triangle, the Great Lakes Triangle, the Michigan Triangle, all that stuff. I don't really give it any credence. But the reason why I'm talking about it is because this particular, and again, thanks Sean for the Man-Eating Stone story.

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 The reason why I'm talking about all of the triangle stuff is because people have tried to take the actual real life story of Stephen Kubocki and fit it into this weird mystical stuff.

225
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Yeah, a couple boats and planes have gone missing in Lake Michigan. It's a giant lake. Basically, a sea. Stuff's gonna sink.

226
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But anyway, so, Steve Kubocki. It's February. It's 1978. Lake Michigan. He says, "Hey mom, hey dad, he's an adult, but whatever. Hey mom, hey dad, I'm going to go skiing. I'm gonna go ski in the area of Lake Michigan."

227
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 He says, "It's all frozen." And they're like, "Okay, son, see you later." So he goes out to the lake. Now, he doesn't come home. And the first people are worried, but then more time passes and they're like, "Well, that's weird. Stephen's not someone who's just gonna disappear."

228
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So they begin searching for him. They find his footprints leading up to the frozen lake. They mysteriously stop.

229
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Now, my first, and I could be wrong on this, but my first idea when I read that sentence was, "Can you leave footprints on ice?" Like, if you're walking on the lake, if they lead up to the lake and he was gonna walk across the lake, do you leave footprints on ice? How does snow sit on an ice lake? I don't know.

230
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 But anyway, so his footprints led up to that. They found, I think it was his jacket by the side of the lake. And then, audibly enough, when they were continuing to searching for him, when they doubled back to that area, they found his backpack as well.

231
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I'm always also a little iffy on that type of stuff, because it means either someone set the backpack there, what's more likely was the backpack was covered up by the snow or whatever.

232
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 But anyway, so that was the story. 15 months later, there is a knock on the Kubaki family door. They open it up, and there's Stephen. And Stephen, this is a weird story. And you could read into it a lot of different ways.

233
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But Stephen basically tells his family. He goes, "I don't know what happened to me for the last 15 months." No idea. He goes, "All I know was that I just woke up 40 miles from my home where I'm at right now, mother, father."

234
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 He recognizes me, right? They're like, "Yeah, yeah, Stephen, quit being weird. Just tell us the story." And he goes, "Okay, sorry."

235
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 He goes, "What I remembered was I woke up 40 miles from this home. I was wearing clothes that weren't mine. I had never owned these clothes before. And I was carrying a satchel, which is not mine. And the satchel was full of maps. But I'm home."

236
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And the field he ended up in that was 40 miles from his family's home was 700 miles from Lake Michigan. And that's it. He has refused to give comment on this story. He doesn't talk about it at all.

237
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 He's actually a practicing psychologist in Seattle now. He's a real person. He really did go missing all that stuff. And he doesn't talk about it.

238
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I answer no questions. He says, "I don't remember. I don't remember." Now, let's unpack that for a bit. One, people go missing on purpose all the time. They call it runaways. And that's possible.

239
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And then he may have had to change his heart and decided to come back home for whatever reason. Two, he could have gone through some sort of weird portal and have no memory of what happened.

240
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And just woke up in the field. And they're like, "What? Where am I? Whose clothes are these? What's the satchel? Maps?" Like, he could have had that progression of realizations.

241
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 But there's also the possibility that he disappeared and does remember what he saw. But he knew that, one, if he told anyone they'd think he was crazy, he'd think he was making it up.

242
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And two, if he told anyone for the rest of his life, people would be asking him, "So how did the gnomes taste?" So what Pinkleberry was the best one to write on in your magical adventure in that other dimension?

243
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Like, he could have just been like, "You know what? That was a horrible place. I mean, it was full of magic and whimsy and wonder, but I don't want to talk about it the rest of my life. I'm just going to tell people I forgot and move on."

244
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Quite odd. And you know what's interesting too is that I'm surprised. Every article I read kind of had the same information, which makes me a little suspicious about the story overall.

245
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 But you would think if someone went missing and they had this search effort for him, generally they bill the family if the person ran away.

246
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Like, if you went missing and then it turns out because of your own negligence, you went missing or you were just running away, they'll sometimes bill the family. And that didn't happen in this case.

247
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But who knows? It was funny because the thing that intrigues I think everybody when you hear that story is like, "Maps? What are the maps? Like, what? Maps of what?"

248
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And so I read it and it just said he had a satchel full of maps and I was like, I was thinking, so are they like magical maps? Like, were they showing him maps to get out of the fairy realm?

249
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Was it just maps of local, like, terrestraps? And then I read another article and it said he had a satchel full of strange maps.

250
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And I go, "That is... you're making that part up." You added that word in. Because if they were strange maps, you would definitely tell us why they were strange or what was strange about them.

251
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 They're just adding to the mystery, strange maps, whatever dude. Like, don't add stuff. Don't make stuff up. The story's weird enough. You don't have to add in strange maps. Because what? What was strange about them?

252
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Anyways, so who knows if the story's real? The story could be totally made up. He could have made it up. It could be internet legend. And the guy really exists.

253
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 That's why he doesn't want to talk about it. He's like, "Ugh." But let's assume that it's real for a second. Does he still have those maps? Where do those maps lead? Has he ever gone back to that area? Does he know what happens to missing people?

254
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And the scariest thing of all is that if he did go to a place of magic and wonder and whimsy, you probably would talk about it. But if you experienced some of the worst torment of your life, it was like just an active war zone of hate and violence, you'd want to forget about it too.

255
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 So, did Steve Kubecki disappear? Was he one of the lucky ones who reappeared back into our reality? Only he knows the answer. But I still stand by my original statement that portals are scary. Maps are not.

256
00:27:40,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Dead or Abra Radio G. I wonder what type of clothes he had. I wonder if he had snazzy or nice clothes. He's like, "Man, I need to go to the portal more often." It's like a shop in a mall. It's like next to 17 again. No, no. It's next to Forever 21 and the Taco Bell food court. It's like the portal. It's just like this "whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
