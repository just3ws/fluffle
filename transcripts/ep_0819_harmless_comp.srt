1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
 Just when you thought it was safe to do absolutely anything in life.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,240
 Here comes three chilling stories that should make you think,

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,460
 "Uh-oh, anything can kill me."

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,960
 Hopefully you're not super paranoid listening to this episode.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,200
 First off, is there any truth to the story that there is a man-eating carpet

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,680
 roaming through abandoned houses in Canada?

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,280
 But then we meet a baby, a little tiny baby person.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,920
 Who is smarter than he seems?

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,880
 What? Huh? What's that story gonna be about?

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,040
 And then...

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,160
 [laughs]

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,800
 I just threw a bunch of stuff together in the last minute.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,680
 No, no, seriously, this is a good episode.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,040
 And then we take a look at a man driving through Portland, Oregon.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,880
 He's about to get home to see his wife and give her a big smooch on the lips.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,600
 Instead, he is chased all the way to his front door

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,360
 by a manifestation of pure, fluffy evil.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:08,120
 [music]

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,520
 I'm your host, Jason Garvin, or I'm having a great day.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,960
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,120
 You guys heard the intro, we got a ton of stuff to cover.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,760
 When harmless things attack us, the theme today, and that might sound vague,

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,320
 that might sound cobbled together, but it's not.

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,520
 All of these stories are really creepy, very interesting, and make us think,

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,120
 "Hmm, I better be careful of every single thing around me."

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,720
 But one person, I'm not careful around one person,

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,240
 I always welcome into my house.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,640
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our Thanksgiving livestream supporters.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,440
 Give it up for just a guy.

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,280
 Everyone, woo, just a guy, come on in.

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,560
 [laughs]

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
 You're the man.

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,920
 Just a guy, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or the livestreams, or me financially in any way,

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,360
 that's fine, I don't care.

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,840
 Just help spread the word about the show.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,960
 That helps out so much.

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,280
 When you get other people to listen to the show, it really, really matters.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,920
 So please, if you can't support the show financially, please help the show grow.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,280
 Just a guy, let's go ahead and get started here.

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,480
 I'm gonna toss you some oars.

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,320
 We're gonna take the Dead Rabbit Robo.

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,840
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,600
 We're gonna row all the way out to Orleans Island, Canada.

47
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,680
 Splash, ooooh.

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,240
 We're rowing this boat.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,640
 We get to Orleans Island in Canada.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,360
 The reason why we're headed to Orleans Island is because there's a local urban legend in this area.

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,400
 It's spread from camper to camper at a local summer camp, but eventually got into the surrounding

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,440
 communities as well.

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,640
 An urban legend that may make you question science itself.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,880
 So here's the story.

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,480
 In a neighborhood not much unlike your own,

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,480
 there's an abandoned house.

57
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,080
 And in that abandoned house is nothing.

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,040
 It's abandoned.

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,480
 But even abandoned houses, they have carpets.

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,280
 So these kids are like, "Oh dude, you know what would be totally dope if we get some

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,800
 brew skis and head on over to the old McMannaville place."

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,720
 It's been abandoned for at least 50 years.

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,440
 Let's go down there.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,040
 So they go down there and they're drinking some brews and they're making out with some girls

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,160
 and sitting on the couch that they brought with them because it's an abandoned house.

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,160
 And then they go, "Hey, Timmy, go get us some more brews."

67
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,200
 So Timmy leaves.

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
 He leaves the room.

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,920
 Half hour or so pass.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,640
 "Hey, where's Timmy?

71
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'm starting to sober up.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,160
 Hey, Joey, go get me some brews."

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,920
 And Joey goes into the next room and the gang leader is sitting there.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,840
 And he's completely sober.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
 He's thinking about his life.

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,240
 He's like, "Oh, all the decisions I made, they've all been so poor.

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,600
 Papa, why don't you love me?"

78
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
 And then he's like, "That's fine.

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,840
 I'm going to get my own brew skis.

80
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,800
 Get out of my way, chicks."

81
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
 And he's pushing these girls off of his lap.

82
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,840
 He walks into the room where all the beer is supposedly at.

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,360
 And he sees the beer, 12 packs and the 24 packs and all this stuff.

84
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,960
 He's like, "My brew skis."

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,040
 But then he also sees, he moves his head slightly to the right,

86
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,000
 and he sees the desiccated corpses of the other two dudes he sent in there.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,840
 And he's like, "No, what are you guys doing?

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
 Wake up, wake up."

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,240
 But they're all gross and stuff.

90
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,960
 They're all, "Ugh."

91
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,880
 And while he's trying to figure out what to do, he's like, "I can either call 911

92
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,560
 or I can get this delicious alcohol."

93
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:25,640
 He hears a movement behind him, and he turns and he sees something rise out of the carpet.

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,880
 No.

95
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:35,240
 He sees the carpet itself begin to take the shape of this long, slender snake-like entity.

96
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
 And it's looking right at him now.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,160
 It's bottom half of its body is spread out thin like a carpet,

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,960
 but the rest of it is this snake-like form.

99
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,640
 And this thing is glaring at the gang leader with pitch black eyes, just staring at him.

100
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:58,600
 And then suddenly, the snake attaches itself to the gang leader's face

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,040
 and begins to suck the brains right out of his skull.

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,640
 And it's that last little piece of brain.

103
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,600
 The very last piece of brain is the one that he can see out of.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
 It's one that controls all of his eyeballs.

105
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,400
 He can actually see his brains being sucked out of his nose into the snake's mouth.

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,760
 All of his memories, all of his cherished times, drinking in abandoned houses, gone forever.

107
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:30,840
 As the snake begins to digest his delicious gray matter deep inside its unholy body.

108
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,920
 This is super interesting because it's a fairly recent urban legend,

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,960
 and it makes so much sense on two different things.

110
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,640
 One, we always look at urban legends and what they do is they warn people.

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,720
 Urban legends are the same things as old myths.

112
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,120
 When people go, "Why is that mountain on fire?"

113
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,320
 "Well, a god came down and he cracked it open and hot lava is up there."

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,640
 So don't go up there because the god will hate you.

115
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,560
 So many stories about cursed locations going close to the water.

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,960
 "Oh, don't go there. A siren will suck you into the water."

117
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,600
 These are always to warn people. Don't do things.

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,600
 And when we look at modern myths, don't pick up hitchhikers

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,920
 because they might vanish and steal your jacket.

120
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,560
 Which is very common with the vanishing hitchhiker.

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,120
 They might leave a pool of water in the back of your nice car.

122
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,840
 This one.

123
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,600
 "Don't go into abandoned houses."

124
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
 This is actually a really good lesson for kids.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,640
 I'm sure some realtor invented this story.

126
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,680
 So in that sense, on an urban legend sense, it totally makes sense.

127
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,880
 You're telling a story in the next generation.

128
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,800
 If the parents just say, "Don't go in abandoned houses."

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,280
 Who cares, parents? You suck.

130
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,880
 But if you hear the story like this, "Don't go in abandoned houses,"

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,480
 or something will suck out your brain,

132
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,880
 that is going to frighten 9, 10, 11-year-old kids.

133
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,160
 And maybe a few 20-year-olds.

134
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,800
 So in that sense, that's really interesting.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
 And on the other side, though,

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,960
 evolutionarily speaking, you're like, "Goddamn it, Jason.

137
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,640
 Not this. You've gone so long without going on an evolution rant."

138
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,280
 Evolutionarily wise, speaking.

139
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,680
 This could happen, right?

140
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,760
 For evolution to work, you have to have something remain

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,600
 quite stable for a long time.

142
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,520
 Like, everything can't be moving too fast, or it won't have time to evolve.

143
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,240
 Like, if everything is constantly changing in the environment,

144
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,920
 it won't be able to adapt to it.

145
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,600
 Let's say that you have a little black mold floating around houses.

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,840
 And usually people are just like, "Achoo!"

147
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,200
 And they're like, "Oh, man, I sure do have the sniffles in this house."

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,800
 Infused with black mold, they don't see that their lungs are thickening up.

149
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,880
 But over time, the mold maybe would start to like form into,

150
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,400
 instead of just being all microscopic, like,

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,320
 let's say you keep coughing in the same corner.

152
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,280
 And then the mold is like, "Hey, buddy, I know you."

153
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,720
 And they're like grabbing onto other mold,

154
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,600
 and they're like getting together,

155
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 and they're like, "Hey, maybe if you and me team up,

156
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,440
 we can be extra moldy together."

157
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,880
 And so the same guy is like coughing in this corner.

158
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,760
 I imagine he's like a guy from an Alice in Chains video.

159
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,400
 He's the man in the box, and he's just facing one angle.

160
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,800
 And the black mold keeps like getting stronger and stronger,

161
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,080
 and it keeps meeting its buddies,

162
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,560
 and it forms like a little chain of mold.

163
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,160
 And then at a certain point, the mold would go, "Wait a second."

164
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,760
 So every so often, we wait for this dude to cough over here

165
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,360
 to get more of us.

166
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,280
 But we notice he's also coughing in his sleep,

167
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,720
 and he's coughing in the bathroom.

168
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,600
 Maybe if we walk over to the bathroom,

169
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,760
 we'll get extra dudes quicker.

170
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,160
 So the mold is kind of like floating through the air,

171
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,440
 and it's like hanging down in the bathroom.

172
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,280
 It's like, "Oh, no, this is a terrible plan.

173
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,440
 It's super stinky in here, and we're mold."

174
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,080
 But it starts getting more mold attached to it.

175
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,120
 And then, okay, this is an over the course of like a weekend, right?

176
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,920
 Maybe a guy moves out, and someone else moves in,

177
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,520
 and he's like, "Oh, I love this place."

178
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,680
 Except for their weird smell.

179
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,360
 And you start having all this mold accumulate,

180
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,120
 and the mold through different generations

181
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,720
 are starting to go, "We can move.

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,840
 Like we're walking around.

183
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,360
 We're going over here."

184
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,640
 And then, like, eventually it figures out,

185
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,360
 "Wait a second.

186
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,840
 Instead of like waiting for dudes to breathe us in,

187
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,520
 and then cough us out, what if we cut out the middleman?

188
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,640
 What if we ate them?"

189
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,680
 Okay, so here's the thing.

190
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,800
 I know evolution takes billions of years,

191
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,240
 and I know I'm trying to compact it

192
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,640
 from the invention of the carpet to now,

193
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,480
 but I'm just saying that scenario,

194
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,200
 okay, forget that.

195
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,160
 I said any of that.

196
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,440
 Forget that I said any of that.

197
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,800
 We've had a...

198
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,200
 As it would behoove a creature to adapt itself to urban hunting,

199
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,120
 I guess would be a better way for me to say it.

200
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,600
 A creature that could actually have an unlimited food source

201
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,120
 in an urban or suburban environment,

202
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,440
 because so much of nature is crafted for the natural world, right?

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,400
 Butterflies don't do super well in apartment complexes.

204
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,080
 I think it's high time, and I bet you it has happened,

205
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,080
 that we start to see radical evolution

206
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,400
 in creatures for the urban environment.

207
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,320
 We do see it, I know, like in hospitals,

208
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,560
 where we have those microbes that eventually doctors are going to be...

209
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,720
 They are expecting a day quite soon.

210
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,400
 You don't know how much of this is fearmongering,

211
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
 I've been hearing this for the past five, 10 years,

212
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,080
 but doctors have said there will come a time

213
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,360
 where we are no longer able to do surgeries.

214
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,880
 That's how bad the germ problem is getting.

215
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,520
 The germs are becoming indestructible.

216
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,680
 Whenever we're using hand sanitizer,

217
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,480
 and we've been using it a lot in the past two years,

218
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,880
 this was something they talked about this pre-COVID.

219
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,000
 When you use hand sanitizers,

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,800
 it says on the bottle, it kills 99.9% of germs.

221
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
 That's true.

222
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,080
 The other 0.01% simply becomes stronger and more resistant to antiseptics.

223
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,800
 And in hospitals, they've had to start breaking out robots

224
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,680
 that have UV lights that just drive through the hospital.

225
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,120
 Originally, they had nurses with UV lights walking around the hospital,

226
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,760
 and they're like, "We can't even keep up with the germs."

227
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
 So now they'll have these devices, these Roombas,

228
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,800
 that are basically shooting laser beams at bacteria.

229
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,280
 But there are a lot of medical professionals who say,

230
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,080
 "We may reach it."

231
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,360
 Can you imagine that?

232
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,120
 Like, we have come so far technologically as a species,

233
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
 which is fascinating to me.

234
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,920
 From the 1800s and the coal stacks of England to today,

235
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,040
 I love this thing that we've just become,

236
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,720
 this technological species.

237
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,240
 There's nothing like it that we know of in the universe.

238
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,320
 But there may come a point where we can't do surgeries,

239
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,160
 because when they cut you open in a hospital,

240
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,400
 you get an infection.

241
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,160
 From a disease, from a germ, they cannot stop.

242
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
 Yeah, there may come a time.

243
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,120
 So we do have this fast evolution of these creatures,

244
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,240
 and part of it is because of us,

245
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,000
 we're putting all this antiseptic hand lotion.

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,160
 So my idea of the black mold walking around

247
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,520
 like the Mesa next germ,

248
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,640
 meeting other guys, forming up,

249
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,240
 that might sound a little ridiculous,

250
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,360
 but you could easily, in the timeline that we've had,

251
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,240
 with all of these radical environmental changes and stuff like that,

252
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,480
 a creature that did adapt to live in abandoned houses,

253
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,040
 to disguise itself as things in the abandoned house.

254
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,880
 I don't think that's super far-affect.

255
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,360
 So using science, the carbon monster may exist,

256
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,760
 or if it doesn't exist now, it may someday.

257
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,600
 But it's probably just a urban legend,

258
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,640
 but I do think it's creepy,

259
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,360
 and I do like the idea of this creature just living in abandoned houses,

260
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,200
 and it would be something that maybe it ate rats.

261
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
 Maybe it didn't even have to eat at all.

262
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,240
 Maybe the sucking out the brains was simply a defense mechanism of it,

263
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,440
 but a creepy story nonetheless.

264
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,880
 Just a guy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

265
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,720
 We are leaving behind this house.

266
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,880
 We lost a couple of listeners there like beer?

267
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,920
 Free beer on this episode?

268
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
 I was like, no, no, no.

269
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,840
 They're going in there.

270
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,920
 Again, their brain sucked out.

271
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,400
 Sorry, guys.

272
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,080
 When you're reincarnated,

273
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,240
 make sure to check out my podcast once again.

274
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,200
 But for the rest of us,

275
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,960
 let's hop on board the Jason Jalopy.

276
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,000
 We're leaving behind this house.

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,880
 We're headed all the way out.

278
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,640
 To a little baby's room.

279
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,400
 Make sure to honk that horn right when we pull up.

280
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,200
 Baby's like, whaa.

281
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,000
 I found this story online.

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,560
 It was posted by someone under the name of Book Thief.

283
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
 We're going to call them Terry.

284
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,840
 And Terry posted this story.

285
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,160
 They said my aunt put this video up on Instagram,

286
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,400
 and it was one of the craziest things I'd seen.

287
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,440
 So my aunt has a little baby,

288
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,360
 a little one and a half year old baby,

289
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,640
 and he's chilling in his crib.

290
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,400
 Little baby arms moving around.

291
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,800
 Those little thick baby legs kind of kicking at nothing.

292
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,480
 And in this video,

293
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,160
 it's like one of those nanny cam videos,

294
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,480
 the baby's like kicking in like,

295
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
 its leg is wrapped up in a blanket,

296
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,200
 and it looks like the baby's trying to kick off the blanket.

297
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,160
 And then in the video, the baby talks.

298
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,440
 Baby talks at one and a half years old,

299
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
 which would be a feat in and of itself.

300
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,280
 And the baby's like, mama, mama.

301
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,040
 At one and a half, that's pretty advanced.

302
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,240
 Usually they're still idiots up until around age two.

303
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,160
 Then they start learning words super quickly,

304
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,400
 and they can start string together sentences.

305
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,200
 But one and a half,

306
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,600
 even if it's just making like little statements,

307
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,240
 that would be weird.

308
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,920
 Maybe babies say mama at one and a half.

309
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,240
 I don't know.

310
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,680
 But anyways, the point is,

311
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,080
 this is not a baby development podcast.

312
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,720
 I'm not going to talk about baby evolution, thankfully.

313
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,480
 The baby's leg is wrapped in the blanket,

314
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,240
 and the baby's just kind of laying there,

315
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
 trying to get the blanket off.

316
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,160
 And then he goes, you got to help me.

317
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:34,920
 And there's just silence in the room, almost like a pause,

318
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,680
 almost like the baby is talking to someone we can't hear.

319
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,440
 The baby says, you got to help me.

320
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,200
 And then I know, but you got to help me.

321
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,440
 Silence.

322
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,680
 Now, obviously, we want to see this video, right?

323
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,960
 And someone asked, hey, Terry, can you post the video?

324
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,760
 And they're like, no.

325
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,240
 So that makes it a little suspect,

326
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,720
 right?

327
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,320
 That makes it a little suspect

328
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,560
 that they told this story about this baby talking.

329
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,600
 But fascinating.

330
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,400
 That's not the whole story.

331
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,440
 That's not the whole story.

332
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,080
 Like, damn it, Jason, I thought the baby was going to attack somebody.

333
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
 This is called when harmless things attack.

334
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:16,920
 Hold on.

335
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,760
 That in and of itself is kind of interesting, right?

336
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,320
 When I first read it, my mind immediately went to that award-winning documentary,

337
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,480
 "Little Man" by the Wayne's Brothers.

338
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,760
 It documented the true life story about a tiny bank robber who pretended to be a baby.

339
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,600
 It reminded me of something like that,

340
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,560
 like maybe this baby was actually an adult felon,

341
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,520
 or I thought of things like reincarnation.

342
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,120
 I've told this story before on the podcast.

343
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,600
 Language is very weird.

344
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,040
 Language is a very weird thing.

345
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,560
 I'll tell it briefly now.

346
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,400
 I was working at Best Buy as a manager.

347
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,320
 I was super tired.

348
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,480
 I was partying late the night before.

349
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,760
 This was a Saturday shift.

350
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,360
 It was like 10, 11 in the morning.

351
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,240
 There was a line stretching as far as the eye could see,

352
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,440
 and I'm ringing people up.

353
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,040
 And this woman and these two dudes come in line,

354
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,160
 and they're talking about something like a movie they were going to go see,

355
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,200
 or a book.

356
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,560
 I think you have something like that.

357
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,760
 And I remember I was ringing them up,

358
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,360
 and I said, "Yeah, the movie was good,

359
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,640
 but the book was a lot better."

360
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,200
 And I kind of commented on their conversation.

361
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,880
 And she goes, "You speak French?"

362
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,720
 And I look at her and I go, "What?"

363
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,880
 And then she is speaking nothing but French.

364
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,320
 Now, I don't know French at all.

365
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,680
 I am Basque, so my ancestry is from that region.

366
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,160
 But the only thing I can think of,

367
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,920
 and we just kind of looked at each other and were like,

368
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,560
 "I'm gonna creep down.

369
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,080
 I finished their transaction."

370
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,960
 The only thing I can think of is I was so tired.

371
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,080
 My brain was working on some sort of ancestral memory,

372
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,320
 and I spoke fluent French.

373
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,480
 I could understand everything they were saying.

374
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
 And I spoke fluently.

375
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,680
 Blew both of our minds.

376
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,520
 So I think I honestly believe that the baby can talk.

377
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,760
 I think that on the core of it,

378
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,920
 this baby talking isn't super weird.

379
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,960
 Who was it talking to?

380
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,000
 This could be totally fake.

381
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,040
 This could totally be fake.

382
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,000
 Every stuff, everything we cover on the show could be fake.

383
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,160
 But we deal with the world of paranormal.

384
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,240
 We do give it some wiggle room,

385
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
 unless we can prove that it's fake.

386
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,840
 When this baby is talking,

387
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,760
 find that absolutely fascinating.

388
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,920
 I think language in the brain is fascinating.

389
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,320
 And I wanted to roll it into this story too.

390
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,040
 I found another story that's kind of similar.

391
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,840
 This was posted.

392
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,520
 This was in a totally different forum,

393
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,720
 totally different setup.

394
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,840
 This was posted by someone called Skinny Mini 18.

395
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,000
 And I just found this the other day.

396
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,160
 Skinny Mini, we'll call them Joe.

397
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,360
 Joe has a girlfriend who has a younger sister

398
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,400
 who's 19 years old.

399
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,840
 We'll call her Maxine.

400
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,120
 Now Maxine has cerebral palsy,

401
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,480
 and she has autism.

402
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,640
 And even though she's smart,

403
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,960
 she needs help with everything.

404
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,880
 She needs help with everything.

405
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,840
 Her older sister taught her how to walk

406
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,880
 and taught her how to talk.

407
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,360
 And all of this stuff and takes care of her.

408
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,040
 And it's actually a really good relationship

409
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,800
 between the boyfriend, the girlfriend,

410
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,520
 and the sister.

411
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,880
 They're a family.

412
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,440
 But one day the girlfriend confides in Skinny Mini.

413
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,640
 Something weird has happened with Maxine.

414
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,480
 Something... I've never really told anyone about this.

415
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,000
 I don't even know how to put it into...

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Let me just tell you.

417
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,160
 She can't support herself.

418
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,640
 You know that.

419
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,680
 And the way she talks,

420
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,160
 she talks in a very childlike way.

421
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,760
 She even thinks her stuffed animals are real people.

422
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
 She talks to her stuffed animals as if they're real.

423
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,640
 So she just has this childlike innocence to her.

424
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,120
 And it shows in her voice, it shows on her face.

425
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,280
 But three times.

426
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,680
 Three times this has happened.

427
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,560
 I'll be sitting there with Maxine.

428
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,800
 She'll be playing with her toys.

429
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,920
 Bright smile on her face, eyes wide.

430
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,000
 And then she looks at me.

431
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,640
 She looks at me dead in the eyes.

432
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,120
 And her face is different.

433
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,520
 She looks like an adult.

434
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,840
 The innocence is gone.

435
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,600
 And it's replaced with the look of fear.

436
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,080
 She looks right at me.

437
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,040
 And she says, "I'm stuck.

438
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,120
 Stuck in here.

439
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,160
 And I can't get out."

440
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,960
 And then her face changes back into a child's face.

441
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,680
 Bright, beaming smile.

442
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,480
 She turns her head and plays with her toys.

443
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,360
 Three times.

444
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,480
 She's come out of this mindset of a child and pleads.

445
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,080
 She says she's trapped.

446
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,000
 She says that she needs help.

447
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,880
 She needs help.

448
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,880
 And then back to that childlike innocence.

449
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,040
 Here's the thing that's so interesting about that story is

450
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,200
 she was born with cerebral palsy and autism.

451
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,440
 We have stories and we talked about it before.

452
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,840
 Like before you, when you have Alzheimer's generally like a week before you die,

453
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,200
 it goes away.

454
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,560
 Not all the time because now we give them so much drugs.

455
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,760
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

456
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,960
 That was a really weird one.

457
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,160
 But they have this time period that a week before you die,

458
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,920
 like you have Alzheimer's, you have dementia,

459
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,360
 you will snap out of it and you'll have all your memories back

460
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,120
 and you'll sit and talk to your loved ones.

461
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,840
 And they, for years, they watched you just waste away.

462
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,720
 And then one day you walk into the rest home or if you have them at home,

463
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,040
 you wake up and your dad's sitting up in bed and he's like,

464
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,240
 "Hey Joe, you catch the game last week?

465
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,160
 Oh man, dude, those Raiders are doing so good."

466
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,680
 They don't know what causes it.

467
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,760
 And again, nowadays we drug them up so much.

468
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,640
 We don't see this often, but it happens all the time.

469
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,480
 It happens all the time from like the late 1800s until the early 80s

470
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,560
 when we started treating Alzheimer's differently.

471
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,680
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

472
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,960
 I don't remember the exact details.

473
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,600
 And when people were talking about this story,

474
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,440
 a lot of people used examples like that.

475
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,600
 They said, you know, my grandpa had Alzheimer's and then one day,

476
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,640
 like before he died, he woke up or I knew someone who was in a car accident

477
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,400
 and they were in a coma and then they came out of the coma

478
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,360
 and they started talking like everything was normal and things like that.

479
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,960
 And that is, there's a miracles, right?

480
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,000
 I'm not going boring, your memories.

481
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,720
 But I'm saying this one is someone who has always been in the childlike state.

482
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,520
 They've always been here.

483
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,320
 So what is coming out in these moments?

484
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,120
 I can understand someone who, you know, I don't,

485
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,960
 my uncle got shot in the head with a shotgun

486
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,640
 and he was limited to a vocabulary of 74 words

487
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,560
 and he had a hard time using the left side of his body.

488
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,960
 And that's how I grew up knowing my uncle and loving my uncle.

489
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,560
 I'll put that episode in the show notes as well.

490
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,440
 It's a really good episode.

491
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,000
 But it would have been a miracle if he snapped out of it, right?

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 But, you know, he had parts of his brain missing,

493
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,400
 like physically gone from the shotgun blast.

494
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,160
 And those stories that people were once someone

495
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,880
 and now there's someone else due to some sort of accident

496
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,120
 or chemical imbalance or something like that.

497
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,800
 Maxine was born with cerebral palsy, was born with autism.

498
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,160
 And so who is she switching into?

499
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,960
 And why?

500
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,800
 And in such a state of distress too,

501
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,840
 it's panic, it's fear that crosses Maxine's face

502
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,360
 when she comes out of this.

503
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,560
 But again, who is that?

504
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,280
 Is this an alternate personality?

505
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,160
 Is it the real Maxine?

506
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,080
 Is who this incredibly bizarre story?

507
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,640
 And to me, it goes back to the baby story where language,

508
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,360
 and I am more of, I know this is probably getting too much,

509
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,120
 anyway, but as time goes on,

510
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,800
 I'm starting to see the brain more as a receiver

511
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,160
 than a transmitter.

512
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,200
 And I don't know what the implications of that are.

513
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,000
 But if your brain is a receiver,

514
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 if the body itself is broken and the synapses are not working,

515
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,840
 the signal is still coming in strong.

516
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,640
 It's just like a television set that has a bent antenna.

517
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,960
 The signal is still coming,

518
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,520
 and all the other televisions are working just fine.

519
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,680
 It's the television that's busted that's messing with the signal.

520
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,640
 You never think, oh, the signal's not coming good from the tower.

521
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,000
 You know it's the television set.

522
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,040
 That's how I see the brain.

523
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,960
 And so in these moments, is the signal finally getting through,

524
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,320
 even in a baby.

525
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,920
 The signal is getting through.

526
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,600
 It was interesting too, all the comments about Maxine,

527
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,920
 people were like, oh dude, maybe you should hypnotize her.

528
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,680
 Maybe you should give her some THC instead.

529
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,840
 I'm sure they do not take medical advice on the internet at all.

530
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,520
 But that aside, what an interesting story.

531
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,160
 That's one of those stories, honestly, that I read and I go,

532
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,320
 and I don't do this very often.

533
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,440
 That's one of the stories that I read and I go, I hope that's fake.

534
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,000
 I hope Skinnymini was typing this up and posting it.

535
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,520
 I hope that's fake, because this is one of the stories that,

536
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,160
 if it's true, it's really terrifying.

537
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,120
 It's really terrifying.

538
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
 You know what I mean?

539
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,480
 Like being trapped like that.

540
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,040
 There are diseases called locked-in disease and things like that,

541
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,680
 where your brain is fully functional, but your body isn't.

542
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,200
 But again, those are people who were quote unquote "normal" before.

543
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,240
 The chemical imbalance before the accident, before the injury,

544
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,880
 all this stuff.

545
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,760
 Maxine was always in this state.

546
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,240
 So what is this personality?

547
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,400
 What is popping through in these moments?

548
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,440
 Absolutely bizarre.

549
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,440
 Just the guy, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Carbonercopter.

550
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,360
 We are leaving behind this house containing Maxine.

551
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,640
 We're waving goodbye.

552
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,360
 We are headed all the way out to Portland, Oregon.

553
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:53,240
 As we're headed out there, I want to give a shout out to the website I got the information from.

554
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,360
 This is one of my favorite websites.

555
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,640
 I go to it all the time.

556
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,800
 Phantomsandmonsters.com.

557
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,400
 Really, really good website if you're looking for

558
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,640
 cryptids, paranormal stuff.

559
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,360
 I love this website.

560
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,840
 I go to it all.

561
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,760
 I'm actually getting ready to advertise on that website.

562
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,080
 I need to send over the PayPal payment.

563
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,280
 I like the website so much.

564
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,080
 I'm going to support them financially and get a little

565
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,520
 Dead Rabbit radio banner on there.

566
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
 Really, really great website.

567
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,600
 The story takes place on December 21st, 2021.

568
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,440
 So just a couple of weeks ago, this happened.

569
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,960
 We're in Portland, Oregon.

570
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,560
 It's 11.30 at night and it's a clear night.

571
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,120
 There's a couple of clouds far off in the distance,

572
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,080
 but it's not raining.

573
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,040
 It's not snowing.

574
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,880
 It's just a nice peaceful night.

575
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,520
 And this young man, we're going to call him

576
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,360
 Matthew.

577
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,720
 He's driving home after a night of hanging out with his friends.

578
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,480
 And he's been driving for about 10 minutes.

579
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,200
 And he notices he's being followed.

580
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,080
 But not by a car, not by the cops.

581
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,360
 He's being followed by a dark cloud.

582
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,160
 I don't know.

583
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
 I don't know how I would pick that up.

584
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,680
 I don't know how that would really click in my brain.

585
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,560
 But this cloud is pretty low to the ground.

586
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,160
 Low enough that he can notice that it's following him.

587
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,760
 He's driving.

588
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,280
 He's going 60 miles an hour and he sees this dark cloud

589
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,160
 keeping pace with him.

590
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,920
 Now it's farther away.

591
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,240
 It's not like right next to the car yet.

592
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,440
 But he does notice this black cloud seems to be going down the highway with him.

593
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,960
 It was completely pitch black,

594
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,440
 but in a way that paranormal activity often defies normal physics.

595
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,680
 It was pitch black, but he could see through it.

596
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
 Can you go Jason?

597
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,120
 That's absolutely impossible.

598
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,280
 I've seen that with shadow people.

599
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,240
 When I've had my encounters with shadow people,

600
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,960
 they are pitch black,

601
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,200
 but you can actually see things behind them.

602
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,960
 Such a weird phenomenon.

603
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,760
 And this is one of those details because I've seen stuff like this in real life

604
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,360
 when I read stories like that.

605
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,240
 Go okay, this has a little bit of little more credibility

606
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,560
 because you don't see that detail a lot in Shadow Man stuff.

607
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,840
 Pops up here and there.

608
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,600
 And if you've experienced it yourself,

609
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,400
 pretty good indicator the story is true.

610
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,600
 But I don't know if this guy is going to make it enough.

611
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,800
 But anyways, he's driving on the road,

612
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 he sees this pitch black cloud,

613
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,080
 yet you could see through it.

614
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
 And this thing is, it's sizable.

615
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,880
 It's five feet high and about 25 to 30 feet long

616
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,560
 going down the freeway next to him.

617
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,280
 And even he in this moment is thinking,

618
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,560
 I don't even know if this is real.

619
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,920
 I'm living this.

620
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,800
 I'm looking at this,

621
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,320
 but this can't be real.

622
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,640
 He starts to realize he's the only car on the road.

623
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,600
 Now 1130 at night is not super late,

624
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,000
 but Oregon does seem to go to bed very early.

625
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,760
 So that could be feasible as well.

626
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,360
 He's driving on the road.

627
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,760
 He's the only car on the road.

628
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,320
 He's been traveling for around 10 miles at this point

629
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,240
 and the cloud is keeping pace with him.

630
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,440
 So he picks up his cell phone

631
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,840
 and calls his wife because he's freaking out.

632
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,560
 He's totally scared by this thing at this point.

633
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,880
 And he goes, he's talking to his wife and he's like,

634
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,400
 hey, let me chase by a cloud.

635
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,080
 She goes, how much have you actually had to drink?

636
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,920
 Were you breaking into abandoned houses again?

637
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,840
 He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop doing that.

638
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,120
 But I think this cloud's chasing me

639
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,800
 and he's driving on the road and he decides,

640
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,160
 maybe if I change lanes, I'll lose it.

641
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,200
 Because if I'm being pursued by something

642
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,560
 and I'm going in a straight line

643
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,840
 and it's going in a straight line,

644
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,480
 maybe we're just happened to be going in a straight line together.

645
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,480
 He changes lanes, then he looks, it's gone.

646
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,600
 Man, just a figment of my imagination, he thinks.

647
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,920
 This story definitely won't end up on a paranormal podcast.

648
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,560
 And then he turns his head and he looks right outside

649
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,760
 the driver's side window and it's right there.

650
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,240
 The cloud is now right next to the car.

651
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,400
 And now that it's right next to the car,

652
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,120
 he realizes it's growing in mass.

653
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,040
 Now that it's right next to the car,

654
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,960
 he can truly take in the magnitude of the thing.

655
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,320
 It's bigger than the car, right?

656
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,120
 It could easily swallow his entire vehicle

657
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,400
 with room to spare.

658
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,240
 He's panicking now, right?

659
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,280
 This thing's right next to him,

660
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
 but luckily there's the exit for his house.

661
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,040
 He pulls off on the exit and the cloud disappears.

662
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:13,320
 But then as he's coming off the exit ramp,

663
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,320
 and now he's driving through the neighborhood to get home,

664
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,200
 it reappears.

665
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,880
 Now it's on the passenger side of the car.

666
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,240
 He says his neighborhood,

667
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,520
 it kind of seems to be like this big cold to sack type of area.

668
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,040
 And he goes, "Every time I drive into the neighborhood,

669
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,800
 every time anyone drives into the neighborhood,

670
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,640
 right at the beginning of this cold to sack type area,

671
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,560
 there's a house with a dog.

672
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,520
 And every single time a car drives by,

673
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,760
 the dog runs out of seemingly nowhere

674
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,000
 and begins barking, barking, barking, barking, barking, barking,

675
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,280
 defending the house, defending the house.

676
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,840
 I'm a brave dog from the car that goes driving by.

677
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,920
 It is something that happens every single time

678
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,760
 you drive by or anyone drives by.

679
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,600
 The dog runs out and barks at the car.

680
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,560
 Now as he's driving down this road,

681
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,200
 the cloud once again disappears.

682
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,320
 But he notices the dog is now running through the yard

683
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,200
 towards the fence,

684
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,920
 prepared to bravely defend his master's home,

685
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,000
 and the dog stops 15 feet from the fence,

686
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,840
 completely stops, and just stares at the car."

687
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,040
 He said, "Every single time a car drives by,

688
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,040
 that dumb dog barks, except that night,

689
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,120
 it just sat silently."

690
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,240
 When he pulls up, his wife is standing outside,

691
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,360
 zooming in full rain gear, just in case it's a rain cloud.

692
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,480
 She sees him pull up and she's looking for this mysterious cloud.

693
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
 She doesn't see anything.

694
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,320
 And he gets out of his car, he doesn't see anything either.

695
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,120
 You have to be thinking it must have been a mistake.

696
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,040
 I mean, what's weird, the dog wasn't barking,

697
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,680
 but other than that, it was just you visually seeing anything.

698
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,920
 The car didn't get rocked, nothing got shattered,

699
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,840
 you didn't hear a voice, you just seen something,

700
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,560
 and the eyes can be deceived so easily.

701
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,800
 YouTube is full of optical illusions.

702
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,240
 So he goes, "You know what, let's just go inside.

703
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,440
 I need to get some sleep."

704
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,360
 But he can't, right?

705
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,600
 He's just been pursued by this cloud.

706
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,720
 He can't really make sense of it.

707
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,880
 And they're up, they're still up,

708
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,080
 and it's about three in the morning.

709
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,800
 And at that point, his older brother, who lives with them,

710
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,120
 with him and his wife, his older brother pulls up in his car.

711
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,120
 And the brother's like, "You know, why are you guys still doing up?"

712
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
 And they're like, "You won't believe this at night.

713
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,440
 I mean, you literally will not believe what just happened."

714
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,760
 So they tell him the story about the cloud

715
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,400
 and chasing him and changing opposite sides of the car

716
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,920
 and all that stuff, and the dog not barking.

717
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,200
 He's like, "The dog didn't bark."

718
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,560
 He goes, "Let's go in and check out the car."

719
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,520
 So they actually go out to the car and they're looking around.

720
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,400
 And Matthew is standing there with his brother,

721
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,760
 and his brother starts to bring up the topic of demons.

722
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,640
 Basically like, "Well, bro, you might have had a demon

723
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,760
 attached to the car or something like that."

724
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,320
 You know, there's a couple different ways to get rid of demons.

725
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,720
 And as he's saying this, all of a sudden he stops.

726
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,160
 He looks at his little brother and says, "Did you feel that?"

727
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:10,440
 Suddenly, the entire driveway becomes extremely cold.

728
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,840
 Bone-chillingly cold.

729
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,520
 And as Matthew is staring at his brother

730
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,880
 and his brother is staring at him

731
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,320
 and they're trying to figure out why, I mean,

732
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,840
 it is Portland right in December.

733
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,280
 It can get cold really, really quickly,

734
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,480
 but as they're processing this,

735
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,560
 all of a sudden Matthew feels a crush against his ribs,

736
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,000
 as if someone straight up punched him right in the rib cage.

737
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,120
 And the blow was so hard, he actually got pushed into his brother.

738
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,000
 They both ran into the house,

739
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,520
 slamming the door behind them.

740
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,120
 And Matthew took a photo of his side.

741
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,440
 And the photo is available in the show notes.

742
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,280
 He has this massive red mark across his rib cage there.

743
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,200
 A cloud.

744
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,040
 A pitch black cloud following you down the road.

745
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,600
 Might just seem like an anomaly.

746
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,840
 Might just seem like some weird weather pattern

747
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,920
 or maybe just a trick of the light.

748
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,600
 But could it be more than that?

749
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,600
 Could the things we see and we simply hand wave off

750
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,080
 and dismiss as maybe a little anomalous but harmless?

751
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,320
 Could these actually have supernatural?

752
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,200
 Could they actually have demonic origins?

753
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,480
 A terrifying story.

754
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,040
 Terrifying story and a perfect way to wrap up

755
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,400
 when harmless things attack.

756
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,640
 Who would think that a cloud could actually beat somebody up?

757
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,560
 We actually, it's funny because we did cover

758
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,280
 an episode a long time ago, it was episode 285,

759
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,000
 about another guy who got attacked by a cloud.

760
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,080
 So there is precedent for this type of thing.

761
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,120
 Very, very odd story.

762
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,440
 Again, we're always looking at these high level threats

763
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,240
 like these demonic armies or people getting possessed

764
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
 and becoming serial killers and stuff like that.

765
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,720
 And sometimes the thing that can affect you the most

766
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,320
 is the cloud floating down the street,

767
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,400
 is the carpet in the abandoned house.

768
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,880
 In the world of the supernatural,

769
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,680
 there's really no such thing as harmless.

770
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,840
 There's just the appearance of innocence.

771
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,520
 And that is the best way for an evil entity to take

772
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,840
 because you let your guard down.

773
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,200
 And that's what these creatures want,

774
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,800
 is for us to have our guard down.

775
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,400
 Matthew and his family are going to be on alert

776
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,160
 for any sort of weird paranormal activity

777
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,120
 that's happened in their house

778
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,480
 because it happened in their driveway.

779
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,440
 But imagine that this cloud followed you home

780
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
 and you didn't notice it.

781
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,720
 And you pulled up to your driveway

782
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,960
 and you just got out of your car and went to bed

783
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,440
 and that cloud, that malignant energy, seeped into your house.

784
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,640
 And you didn't know to protect yourself.

785
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,240
 You didn't know to be on the lookout for these crazy events.

786
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,320
 You just went about living your life.

787
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,520
 While all the while there is an entity in your house now,

788
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,320
 slowly infecting everything good about you and your loved ones.

789
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:06,280
 All because you didn't notice that cloud following your car one dark night.

790
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,400
 The world of the supernatural,

791
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
 the world of the paranormal is fascinating.

792
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,720
 It's very, very fun to research this stuff.

793
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,800
 But don't forget 90% of it are enemies of mankind.

794
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,880
 Demons, aliens, portals warping you into an other dimension

795
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
 that is not made for humans to ever live in.

796
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,440
 The world of the paranormal is not our friend.

797
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,520
 It is our foe.

798
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,360
 It is our hunter.

799
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,280
 It is our predator.

800
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,400
 It may seem fun and entertaining and it is.

801
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,240
 It may seem harmless.

802
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,080
 It is not.

803
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,880
 It can destroy you.

804
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,800
 It can destroy your soul.

805
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,400
 It can destroy those you love the most.

806
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,800
 So never let your guard down when you're researching the paranormal.

807
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,120
 You never know what path it's going to take you down.

808
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,000
 And even though that path may seem full of wonder and excitement,

809
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,680
 just remember the world of the paranormal is not your friend.

810
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
 So don't let your guard down.

811
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,600
 Be careful where you tread both mentally and physically.

812
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,560
 The world of the paranormal is always looking for fresh souls to corrupt.

813
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,800
 Please make sure you are not one of them.
