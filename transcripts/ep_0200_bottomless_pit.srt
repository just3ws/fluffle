1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
 Can bees live in your eyeballs?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:12,240
 Can mannequins move on their own and then we travel down into the earth as we explore the mysteries of

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,600
 Bottomless pits today on Dead Rabbit Radio

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:28,200
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Garvin or I'm having a great day

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,660
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's the 200th episode of Dead Rabbit Radio

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,520
 We've almost been out this for a year. We started I think it was in

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,580
 June June of last year. We're almost at a full year

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,920
 But we're definitely 200 episodes in that's kind of cool. It's kind of nice

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,160
 I don't know what I don't know what else to say. I appreciate that you guys are coming back to the show

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,680
 Listening to it. Our download numbers are always going up. Now the first news story. I saw pop-up

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,240
 Quite a few days ago, and I thought that's fake. That's absolutely fake

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,680
 Recently we're in Taiwan. There was this woman named he who goes to the graveyard to go visit her relatives

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,800
 It's not like they were living there anything they were buried and she went down there

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,240
 And she wanted to tidy up their graves so she began pulling weeds and then she's like ah my eyeball and goes home

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,320
 She's like damn ancestors should be protecting me

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,360
 She goes home and her eyeball keeps hurting and itching and stuff like that

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,440
 And she can't figure out what it is and so she goes to the eye doctor

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,480
 I'm sure going to try to pronounce the word but I'm just calling the eye doctor and the eye doctor starts looking in there

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,280
 And he says not the woman but the doctor the pronoun as in he has the doctor said

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,500
 It looked like there was an insect leg in there and when he began poking around there was four

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,440
 Sweatbees in her eyeball like not like actually in the ball itself

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,040
 But like around the eyeball on the inside

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,080
 Drinking her tears and I'm like that story is fake the story is 100% fake and

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,720
 Then I saw it pop up the next day and it was kind of the same thing when I go up fake news spreading around

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,320
 How would you not know there's I could understand if there was one bee in your eyeball?

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,280
 Maybe but four bees in your eyeball and apparently sweat bees are really small, but I was still super

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,320
 I was like that's not true and then finally another article came out today

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,000
 And they actually included video footage of a press conference where the young woman and the doctor

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
 Gave a press conference with photographs of

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,800
 The bees in her eyeball now

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,520
 I had seen photographs of bees on an eyeball and earlier things that I think that's just like some mock-up

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,780
 But apparently it's real. I mean they held a full press conference and these people are given interviews

33
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,560
 I don't understand what they're saying

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,520
 But they kept cutting back to pictures of bees and eyeballs and it was like this big news deal

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,360
 I don't think of that. I do think it's real. How do you go about your day with four bees in your eyeballs?

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,960
 I always heard this urban legend quote-unquote urban legend. It may be true

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,800
 But I heard a long time ago. There was a young wife a young hot blonde a young beautiful hot blonde wife

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,640
 Sitting there in her yoga pants and her tank top her tight tank top

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,240
 Press against her body. Anyways, I don't know what she was wearing the point. That's what I hope she was wearing

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,460
 She was mailing wedding invitations and she was licking the envelopes

41
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,760
 But in the letter you guys know how you stick put a letter in but anyway, she's licking the envelopes

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,480
 She's licking the envelopes and eventually she licks and she gets a paper cut on her tongue. Ow

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,200
 Only there was a Jason here to kiss my tongue and make me feel better

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,880
 But I wasn't there and she just kind of went about her business. It's really hard to to treat a tongue wound

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,480
 But then a couple days later, maybe a couple weeks later. I'm not exactly for sure of the time period

46
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,400
 I was just horrified at the story her tongue begins to throb and starts to like

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,560
 pulsate

48
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,400
 And she's swelling up. She's not swelling up her tongue is swelling up if she was swelling up that would be a different story

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
 That'd be a very very sexy story

50
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,960
 Anyways, eventually she goes to the dentist and the dentist is like you need to go to the doctor because that is completely abnormal

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,000
 Tongues shouldn't pulsate. They shouldn't

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,400
 Undulate in your mouth. She then goes to the doctor and the doctor's looking at it

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,000
 And he's like, oh, yeah, that's looks like maybe you have like a really bad infection. She might want to eat in a week

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,560
 Can you help me doctors like yeah, I can understand you and I can help you and

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,240
 He cuts her tongue open and a bunch of cockroaches came out now

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,920
 I doubt that story is true

57
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,360
 The the this that was a story that I heard and which the cockroach had a cockroach had laid eggs

58
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,800
 That got stuck to the envelope and when she licked it and cut her tongue

59
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,440
 The eggs went into her tongue and they fed off of the blood and saliva in her mouth

60
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,160
 So they became full-grown cockroaches and the pulse I'm getting grossed out just thinking about it

61
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,520
 the pulsating of her tongue where the cockroaches

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,200
 Crawling over each other and they cut it out and all the cockroaches came out again

63
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,800
 I don't know if that's a real story, but that's quite disgusting and whenever I lick an envelope

64
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,240
 Which I very rarely do nowadays. I think of that story

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,000
 But that's enough of cockroaches apparently the bee lady is cool like they got the bees out

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
 But man, that's pretty disgusting

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,160
 But I wouldn't much rather take bees in my eyes than cockroaches in my mouth and no I'm not gonna make a dick joke there

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,960
 But I was very tempted to halfway through that story

69
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,560
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story now our next story is kind of weird

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,520
 Because it's something that I'm sure has a simple answer

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,980
 But everyone in the neighborhood is being really tight-lipped about it. We are going to a place called Wappenger's

72
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,520
 Falls, New York Wappenger's fall. Oh, yeah, that's the only way I can pronounce that word

73
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,880
 Wappingers. Anyways, we're going there. We're going to a place with the last word falls in New York

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,920
 The year is 1871. There's a choo-choo train driving along riding along the rails and there's a horrible accident

75
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
 *makes noise*

76
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,920
 21 people are killed sorry 22 people are killed

77
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 That's why I have notes and not only that but the train actually derailed and smashed through a neighborhood

78
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,000
 So that was bad, right? That's a bad that's a bad combination of things

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,040
 1877 so only five years later a massive fire rips through that same neighborhood and all but two buildings are burned down a house

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,320
 And then I think like a bigger house or factory or something like that

81
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,960
 But you're like, okay, what does that have to do with anything jason a train crash fire?

82
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,400
 Where you going with this? Does this story involve a sexy sexy bride with something swollen in her mouth?

83
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,280
 And no, unfortunately not this story involves something equally sexy in a weird way. There is a house

84
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,320
 There is a house that lives that lives there is a house that is in that neighborhood

85
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,440
 Known as the john loson house and what makes this house noticeable or

86
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,440
 Remarkable is the fact that it is inhabited by only three mannequins

87
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:17,160
 So there's three mannequins dressed up in period clothing. So like older time clothing. They're not wearing juicy couture

88
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,320
 You know, they're just kind of wearing like frilly dresses and little sun hats and stuff like that

89
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,640
 So you walk by the house and you just see these three mannequins sitting in the kitchen

90
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,160
 They're like, that's kind of bizarre. It's kind of weird

91
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,800
 You've never seen anyone else in the house

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,920
 Now that would is just bizarre enough. You're thinking maybe there's a serial killer there

93
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,000
 You're thinking all sorts of weirdness stuff, but you're like three mannequins. That's fine

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,120
 But then a couple days later you walk by the house again

95
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,320
 And now you see two of the mannequins sitting on the porch

96
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,240
 And one of them inside the living room looking out of the window

97
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,280
 And you go, oh, okay. So it's some sort of joke like some guys moving around mannequins in there

98
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,120
 Puts them out on the porch dresses them up in old timey clothing

99
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,760
 You know, whatever one of them's left out one of them's inside playing solitaire because she's the lonely one

100
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,480
 But then you notice that almost every time you pass by that house the mannequins are in a different position

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,480
 When the weather is bad, they are never outside. That's one one pattern you notice

102
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,200
 But a lot of times you'll see them sitting on the porch. Sometimes all of them sometimes just one or two of them

103
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,480
 You'll see them inside and they'll be in poses. It's not like they're just leaning up against stuff

104
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,880
 They're dressed in different clothing than the last time you saw them. That's all you know

105
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,160
 Now neighbors have reported that on occasion there is a light on in the kitchen, but the drapes are closed shut

106
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,160
 But other than that nobody knows who lives in the house

107
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,120
 Nobody knows who's doing this

108
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,160
 There's something creepy about mannequins. It's really bizarre like I remember their twilight zone episode where the mannequins come to

109
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,720
 Life and that was kind of spooky that was kind of spooky and like a weird surreal way because spoiler alert

110
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,720
 The girl didn't know she was a mannequin and she like escaped and lived her life

111
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,680
 Like once a year one of the mannequins got to spend a day out

112
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,680
 But this one mannequin went out and then developed this whole false memory

113
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,000
 Knit forgot she was a mannequin and then one day she goes shopping in the stores and the mannequins

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,560
 Adopt her and turn her back into a mannequin that that kind of creeped me out because it was just kind of a weird story

115
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,240
 But the fact that they like look like human and they're they're not and they just kind of stand in human poses

116
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,720
 And the fact that most of the time they're really really hot. They're really sexy

117
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,000
 You very rarely see an unattractive mannequin

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,120
 I guess the ones that are missing their heads and their arms and their legs are pretty unattractive

119
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,000
 But even then they got a little nice little hourglass shape

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,480
 But generally mannequins are pretty hot now when I was reading about the story

121
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,720
 I was it was kind of bringing me back to that childhood thing like oh man

122
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,960
 That would be so spooky to like have mannequins walk around. There's something just creepy about that

123
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,720
 But of course I kept digging because I'm like logically this is impossible

124
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,760
 If there was a house that mannequins were walking around then

125
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,400
 One of two things would have happened

126
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,800
 One the government would have come in and taken those mannequins and turned them into super soldiers

127
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,400
 Or at least found out what sort of phenomenon was happening in this house

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,440
 Or two this would be the only story that was ever covered on every paranormal website ever

129
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,120
 If it was 100 true that these mannequins could be documented moving around

130
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,760
 It would be the first ghost story you ever heard as a kid

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,480
 So I kept digging and it turns out

132
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,000
 That the idea that nobody knows who lives there is a bit of a

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,360
 Misleading statement because as a boggett for a long time that statement was true

134
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,920
 But as of now since august 2016 the mannequins are gone from the house

135
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,040
 And when people started asking one of the neighbors said

136
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,080
 The mannequins are removed out by the person who owned that house

137
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,120
 And now they're in another house, but you can't go there and I won't tell you where it's at

138
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,640
 So I do know who lived there, but I'm not going to tell you who it was

139
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,640
 I'm not going to tell you where they went. I'm just telling you that the mannequins are gone

140
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,000
 So that I think still leads us back to our first theory

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,600
 If these things were real and I believe there are real paranormal things that kind of fly under the radar

142
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,320
 But if I'm able to stumble across that one late night while I'm you know just scrolling through stuff

143
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
 Then I'm sure the CIA could find it

144
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,400
 But it leads us back to that theory. What if these mannequins were real and they were being spotted in this area?

145
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,080
 And they're in this house moving around and the first thing that happens is the government would come out because they would

146
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,840
 Investigate anything that was weird. I got a story prepped coming up for next season as well about

147
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,160
 Russia's psychic spies that they just like announced in their newsletter

148
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,160
 That's the whole thing. I really have to dig into that but governments do look into this stuff

149
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,920
 So if the government came out and found that this was a real phenomenon

150
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,360
 They stood out there for a few days in a surveillance van. They saw you walking back and forth going what?

151
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,000
 Like golly the mannequins are still moving around

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,720
 But they're surveilling the place and they don't see anyone coming in they would go in

153
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,720
 Examine what was going on and if there was something paranormal going on they would simply take the mannequins

154
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,080
 And then they could just have like some CIA agent pretending to be a neighbor being like oh, yeah, I live there

155
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,400
 They moved away mannequins everything moved away

156
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,040
 And then people go like oh that's the end of that mystery

157
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,200
 While really these mannequins are like being trained in some CIA

158
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,920
 CIA warehouse to like fight other mannequins there to fight other inanimate objects are these things real?

159
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,120
 It's most likely it was an art installation. Some guy was goofing around

160
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,440
 It could have been some weird fetish thing too could be that souls of people who died in that train crash

161
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,600
 You're like, yeah, why should you mention all that stuff in the beginning?

162
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,840
 Could be that souls of people who died in that train crash inhabited those

163
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
 mannequins

164
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
 The most likely one obviously is it's some sort of art thing or sex thing

165
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,640
 But if these things are real

166
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,480
 They're not just at someone's house that this neighbor won't say where it's at

167
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:01,480
 They're being fully examined by government or non-governmental agencies to find out what makes these things work

168
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,120
 And how to make more of them

169
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,880
 Moral of the story

170
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,760
 Do not get lost in a macy's or seers

171
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,520
 ever

172
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,040
 Because you don't know which one of those mannequins could actually be a spook in more ways than one

173
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,400
 For new listeners of the show, I use the word spook and it's meaning as an FBI or a CIA spy

174
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,960
 I do not mean it as a racial slur. I'm not saying watch out for black mannequins a long time listeners of this show

175
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,320
 I'm sure are well aware of the fact that I use the word spook a lot

176
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,720
 That's not a racist slur. Okay. I figured I had to jump in there just in case you're like

177
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,120
 My dear that guy's super racist. He doesn't like black mannequins. I love all mannequins

178
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,200
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our last story here

179
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,640
 The next story is something that I was always intrigued about as a child

180
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,800
 I think a lot of people were just because the imagery is so bizarre and it really tests the limits of what's physically possible

181
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,880
 We know they exist in space

182
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,280
 But do they exist in earth?

183
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,360
 I'm talking about bottomless pits

184
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,800
 Now, obviously I'm talking about black holes in space, but you know just a pit that goes on forever

185
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,920
 Would defy all logic all physics

186
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,880
 But it's something that there's just something really like enthralling about that idea

187
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,960
 So I started looking into bottomless not literally I wish I don't know if I knew a pit was bottomless

188
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,520
 If I knew a pit was 100 feet deep, I don't think I'd look into it like I don't like

189
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,320
 Looking into the pitch black abyss

190
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,640
 Especially if it's high maybe if it's like three foot and I look down and I see cthulhu

191
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,760
 I'd be like oh, it's kind of cool

192
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,920
 But I want to want to look down a giant abyss

193
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,280
 And see cthulhu even though he'd be farther away. I'd be safer

194
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,320
 There's quite a few stories about bottomless pits the stories that I found seemed to center in

195
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,960
 America and two of them are actually quite close to each other

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:56,760
 But for our stories the first two are actually only small entries that were in this book called weird usa

197
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,080
 Which we've had some run-ins with before

198
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 They're the ones who talked about spider web gate cemetery, which was just absolutely just

199
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:12,280
 Garbage information, so I'm always a little iffy on weird us books. I'm sure the authors are lovely people

200
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,680
 I just had a bad experience with the information from that one. Anyways, first off

201
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,640
 Let's hop in the jason jalopy. We're just we're not crossing in the oceans

202
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,600
 We're driving our car it looks like the Beverly hillbilly's car, but we got those spinning rims on it

203
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,960
 So it's like jeet out. We're going to Hannibal, Missouri

204
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,040
 Now down in Hannibal, Missouri

205
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,560
 There is a legend that there used to be this pit or I'm sure it's still there

206
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,080
 It probably doesn't like fall in on itself

207
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,960
 But there is a pit in Hannibal, Missouri, which no one has found

208
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,120
 since this happened

209
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,520
 But it was this bottomless pit and animals kept falling into it

210
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,000
 So I don't know how stupid the animals are down in Missouri

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,600
 But anyways animals kept falling into this pit and people are like well golly

212
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,240
 Better find out what's down in that pit now

213
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:05,640
 That's a bad idea. There's no time frame for this story. I don't know if it took place in 1997 or 1797

214
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:12,840
 Because if it took place any time past the 1970s, you just throw a camcorder down there attached to a rope obviously and see what you get

215
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,520
 But back then whenever this story took place the guy a guy said you know what I'm gonna do

216
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,440
 I'm gonna tie a rope around my waist and I'm gonna lower myself in

217
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,320
 Yee-haw and he goes down into the pit

218
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,800
 And then at some time later according to the book sometime later his friends show up and they hoist them out

219
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,520
 And here's the exact quote his hair had turned completely white

220
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,600
 And he was wildly insane somebody stop me like I mean

221
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,280
 It's not somebody stop me that that part I made up, but

222
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,880
 The wildly insane it sounds like something you'd put on like a sixth graders t-shirt

223
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,720
 Or like a fourth graders t-shirt totally tubular and wildly insane you pull a man out of a pit

224
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,560
 How do you differentiate they're like man this guy looks insane and someone else goes no no no

225
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,120
 He's wildly insane

226
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,480
 Obviously that story is probably not true for a couple reasons one

227
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,200
 There's no time period given for it the guy who went wildly insane. We don't have his name

228
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,440
 Did he lower himself into the pit?

229
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,760
 With his friends not noticing and they just showed up to you know drink some brews and watch the game and they see a rope

230
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,520
 Leading into this pit

231
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,040
 Was his friend supposed to be there to pull him up and a short time later

232
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,720
 He realized they had went and watched the game without him and totally forgot he was hanging down there

233
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,760
 Such a bizarre story, but anyways he goes wildly insane most likely a fake story

234
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,320
 But it's a legend in Hannibal, Missouri

235
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,280
 Now we're driving hot back in the jason jalopy with a wildly insane guy in the back just

236
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,880
 She's going crazy quoting Deadpool the whole time. We're like, oh my god. This guy's driving me nuts

237
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,760
 We drive up to

238
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,920
 Tacoma, Washington

239
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,480
 And there this time we have a dude's name

240
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,600
 But we still don't have a time period for it and technically we have half a name. His name is johnson

241
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,720
 Now his name his first name may be john his last name son

242
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,720
 But probably not it's probably just johnson. He finds a hole in his yard. He moves into this house

243
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,840
 And he doesn't notice the hole at first, but then one day this dog finds his big old hole

244
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,040
 It's a hole that's about four feet in diameter and it's interesting because we're looking at these legends here

245
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:28,200
 Think about the story. I just told you about Hannibal, Missouri. That was pretty much all the information

246
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,880
 That was in the book

247
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,480
 That's all the information of the legend and now we're moving to this one. Well, you're gonna find more concrete stuff

248
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,440
 This one we have the size of the hole. It's four foot in diameter

249
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,640
 It has a three foot brick wall around it. So it almost looks like a giant well or medium sized well

250
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,720
 I don't know how big wells normally are

251
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,480
 But there's like a three foot brick wall surrounding it which makes it a little suspicious

252
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
 He didn't notice it in the first place, but whatever

253
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,040
 And he looks down. It's this huge pit

254
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,440
 So he wants to figure out what's down there obviously and now I don't think he did it on the first day

255
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,200
 He moved in but one day he's bored. It's Saturday afternoon. He throws a rope down there

256
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,320
 He keeps low night. He didn't toss the coiled rope down there

257
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,480
 He's lowering a rope down there is what I meant to say and all the rope goes down

258
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,960
 And he's holding the end and this does he doesn't feel that he's hit the bottom yet and he's like, hmm

259
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,120
 That's weird. He did he throws 40 feet of rope down there. No bottom now

260
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,720
 That's really probably to me 40 feet doesn't sound that long

261
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,640
 But I guess going straight down it probably is he starts to think it's an abandoned well

262
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,360
 And what are you going to do with an abandoned well? He starts throwing old tires into it

263
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,880
 Just tossing old tires down there just because he has to get rid of them anyways

264
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,880
 I don't know what this guy was doing for a job. Maybe it was like automotive repairman

265
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,960
 Maybe just really like tires. I don't know

266
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,320
 Eventually the hole starts to fill up full of tires, which is what will happen when you throw tires in there

267
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,880
 At a later time he starts talking to his neighbors. He's like, you know, hey, yeah, it's pretty nice area. Isn't it? Yeah

268
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,640
 Hey, he goes. Hey, hey, have you guys know anything of previous owners?

269
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,040
 Never mentioned to me about the big old hole in the backyard and they're like, oh, yeah

270
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,280
 Yeah, that hole they didn't tell you about that

271
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,280
 Johnson's like no, what's going on with that hole? I keep throwing tires in it and they're like, oh my god, don't throw tires in it

272
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,360
 No, I'm just joking. I didn't say that

273
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,400
 Anyways after they gave him a heart attack

274
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,280
 They go no, no, it's throw it's safe to throw tires in there

275
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,880
 But don't throw marble in it because the previous owners kept throwing chunks of marble in there

276
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,760
 Now I'm assuming that they were some sort of like counter maker. Again, I don't think they just really really love chunks of marble

277
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,640
 They kept throwing chunks of marble in there and eventually it filled up and then there was an explosion and it blew out everywhere

278
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,840
 And then they moved away now. I don't think the two events were connected

279
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,400
 But the marble did all shoot out like a shotgun blast and they moved away now at that point if I was Johnson, I'd be thinking uh-oh

280
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,560
 I better start getting some of those tires out of there because I don't want a tire explosion

281
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,800
 But he doesn't he just leaves them in there

282
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:01,000
 But what he starts to notice is over time he has this pile of tires in the pit and now like you can see the top of the

283
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,080
 Tires, they're higher than the pit

284
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,160
 Over time he starts to see the top of the tire slowly go down

285
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,800
 And after an indeterminate amount of time they don't put it in the article pretty soon

286
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,520
 He couldn't see the top of the tires anymore like the pit was getting smaller and smaller and smaller

287
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,640
 It was just melting or shrinking or falling into something

288
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,840
 And that's all we know. We don't know where he lives. We don't have any other information on the story

289
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,760
 If there ever was a tire explosion, we don't know. We don't know what's going on

290
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,560
 Interesting story again most likely a local legend, but it's interesting to see the comparison one has far more details

291
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:41,480
 So it's almost automatically more believable. It's very weird. I read the first one

292
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,120
 I was like, well, if I don't know who it is and I don't know when it happened

293
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,760
 Then it's probably not real

294
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,640
 But the second one I still missing some key details like a location and a date

295
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,400
 But it's more believable because the character acts in a more believable way. He goes, oh, it's a big pit

296
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
 I wonder what I'm gonna do with it. I'm throw garbage in it

297
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,520
 Not lower myself into it and go wildly insane. It's just kind of interesting how those two things play out

298
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,680
 But when I said bottomless pits when I said I was going to talk about bottomless pits

299
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,880
 I'm sure a good 30 40 of you go up

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:20,120
 He's going to mel's he's going to mel's not mel's diner from happy days. That's dated reference. Did they still even show reruns of that?

301
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,120
 No, anyone who really investigates bottomless pits knows the story

302
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,720
 Of mel waters mel waters

303
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,520
 Is a man who made a phone call

304
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,160
 I don't know why i'm talking like that all of a sudden mel waters is a dude so back in back in

305
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,320
 1997 mel waters called up coast to coast am with art bell

306
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:49,160
 And told this crazy story over the radio and really sparked a renewed interest in the idea of bottomless pits

307
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,120
 He is the elan musk of the bottomless pits

308
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,400
 He is the guy who really like got everyone to think. Whoa, this could actually be something

309
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,760
 We're going to ellensburg washington. So very very. I don't know if it's near actually

310
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,280
 It's in the same state as the coma. We're still in washington

311
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,360
 I probably should have looked it up on google maps

312
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,760
 But anyways, we're in ellensburg washington and you have a man named mel waters

313
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,720
 And what he did was he found a bottomless pit

314
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,240
 He found a big they can't say that it's bottomless until they started testing it

315
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,480
 But he notices this giant pit in his property. It also has like a little bit of a wall

316
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,400
 I think his wall was made of metal just a small like wall

317
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,000
 And his first thing is he starts throwing garbage in it, which again is a normal thing

318
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,160
 And now you see again the difference. We have dates now. We have a full name and stuff like that

319
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
 He starts throwing garbage into the pit

320
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,400
 And starts to get curious about it and

321
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,440
 Can't see how deep it is. He takes a pack of lifesavers wraps a string around it lowers it figuring if it hits water

322
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,920
 He'll pull it up and the lifesavers will be dissolved nothing. So he's doing these scientific tests

323
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,440
 Eventually, he's able to get 80,000 feet

324
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,160
 of fishing lure

325
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,120
 string

326
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,200
 Fishing string that's what it's called right fishing line fishing line. I never I'm not an outdoors dude at all

327
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,120
 Anyways, he's puts down 80,000 feet of fishing lure dammit a fishing line

328
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,720
 And doesn't hit bottom doesn't hit bottom

329
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,920
 Now people are going away a second this story is okay. Let me finish. Let me finish. He doesn't hit bottom

330
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,240
 So now he's like truly

331
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,560
 Truly, this is a bottomless pit

332
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,920
 He keeps throwing junk in it can't figure it out keeps throwing junk in it

333
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,680
 But then he knows these dudes his friends of his these friends of his are basque sheep herders

334
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,040
 So rock on basque brothers his basque sheep herders

335
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,720
 Are hanging out with him and he's telling them about this hole and they said well

336
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,600
 You know if you really want to test this hole we got a test for you. So they take a sheep

337
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,720
 This is okay

338
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,080
 So let before I get into the sheep story that was a little bit of a teaser because then it gets really bizarre

339
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,800
 Let's talk about the fishing fishing line

340
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,200
 um 80,000 feet of fishing line is obviously a lot

341
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,160
 Of fishing line. I mean that must have cost him quite a lot of money to get that much unless he's a true scavenger

342
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,960
 and just like rifling through fishermen stuff

343
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,080
 80,000 feet is a ton but

344
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:20,840
 I that's what I thought when I read that I was like there's no way any human could collect 80,000 feet of fishing line if

345
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,000
 Unless they worked at a fishing line company and they were like stealing it like Johnny Cash. So

346
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,840
 That was my logic

347
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,080
 But there was a geologist who said there is no and this is a little more scientifically

348
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,640
 Possible than my just like you can't own it. That's impossible. This geologist said

349
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,640
 fishing line

350
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,840
 Drop to 80,000 feet into the earth would melt

351
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,560
 It would just melt because it's just too hot down there. It's not saying the hot lava is down there

352
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,920
 But the temperature 80,000 feet down is way too hot

353
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,880
 It's impossible the the heat of the planet would just burn the string

354
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,440
 And also you'd wonder how does he know that it doesn't hit the ground to just start piling up

355
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,200
 But let's give him the benefit of the doubt here for a second

356
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:09,160
 Because assuming the hole is actually that deep at a certain point. It's like not into the earth anymore

357
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,880
 It's like almost a portal into something else a a basically a gateway

358
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:21,240
 It's less a bottomless pit carved into the planet and more of a really really deep pit that opens to some sort of abyss

359
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,280
 Which is actually where the term bottomless pit comes from so

360
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,880
 That aside the geological pressures and stuff aside because we're getting into the weird stuff now

361
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,040
 He's back. He's hanging out with the bass sheep herders. They take a sheep and they put it into a crate

362
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,880
 And they begin lowering it into the bottomless pit and the whole time they should

363
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:47,080
 They hear it getting less and less as they're lowering it down

364
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,680
 They lower it down about 1500 feet and then all of a sudden they hear it and the the ropes start shaking violently

365
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,600
 They hear it running around in the crate and screaming and then nothing

366
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,720
 The lamb goes silent. You're pulling this

367
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,320
 Sheep up this lamb slash sheep

368
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,560
 Up to the top of I do in this with my hand motion for some reason like i'm pulling a rope

369
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,040
 They pull it to the top of the pit

370
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,600
 And the sheep is dead

371
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:20,360
 So they do see it's dead and they do a field autopsy on it. They cut it open and it's all of its organs have turned to like this gelatinous

372
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,960
 tumor

373
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,320
 And they're like, oh that's disgusting. No one's eating lamb chops tonight

374
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,160
 and so

375
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,920
 They pull it out

376
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,160
 And they see that the tumor is moving and the one dude goes

377
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,440
 I'm gonna cut it open. I'm gonna see what's in that the other guys are like, no, no, no, don't don't don't and he does

378
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,040
 He cuts it open and what is described as

379
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 a tumor seal

380
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,520
 Just falls out still attached with an umbilical cord

381
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,440
 To something to the basically the mama tumor inside the sheep

382
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,080
 So it's basically it looks like a seal

383
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,880
 But it kind of also looks like a giant tumor just like a growth

384
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,440
 With hauntingly human like eyes is how it's described

385
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,200
 And according to this website that i was reading

386
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,200
 It says that the seal the tumor seal looked at the sheep herders and mel

387
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,000
 And the sheep herders looked at the tumor seal

388
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,640
 silently

389
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,440
 For two hours at a certain point someone's going to be like you guys are seeing that right like I would say that after the first 30 seconds

390
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,880
 But apparently for two hours everyone just kind of looked at each other

391
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,280
 And then after two hours the tumor the tumor seal nodded to the men and jumped into the pit

392
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,000
 And they're like what in tarnation was that and mel's water's just like I don't know wait

393
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,600
 Wait wait a second

394
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,000
 I used to have esophagus cancer and now it's in remission

395
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,840
 He felt the tumors in his own body disappear going to remission. So bizarre

396
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,920
 yes

397
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:02,600
 It's weirder because the tumor seal keeps showing up after that he pops back out of the pits. He's like

398
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,440
 I'm back folks. He's doing a little dance like the frog from Warner Brothers

399
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,400
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

400
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:14,520
 Ta-da-da-da has a little top hat now and a cane he shows up just all the time it starts visiting the sheep herders be like what are you guys doing?

401
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,720
 Can I play rummy? Yeah, I'm really good at this here. Let me deal. He ended and he's

402
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,360
 Playing with the cards

403
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,680
 He can also well he can't talk to them, but only veam shortwave radio

404
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,840
 So he's like down there on a ham radio

405
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,760
 His name is to me. Hey, it's to me coming from the hole. How are you guys doing up there?

406
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,120
 And they're like god damn it too. Well, this guy stopped calling me. Hey, to me. What's up?

407
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,440
 He can talk to him via shortwave radio

408
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,760
 I mean come on. So we're gonna get into how the story evolved in a second. He can talk to them via radio, but

409
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,280
 Unfortunately for us whenever they tried recording his voice. It just came out as static

410
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,120
 But if we were there, we would have been able to understand what to me was saying

411
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,920
 Eventually though people always go were mel. Where's this hole at?

412
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,320
 Like seriously, I can get cured of my cancer. I can throw garbage down there

413
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,480
 I might even be able to be harassed on various occasions by a talking tumor and he goes well

414
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,920
 I can't tell you where it's at because this is kind of the conclusion to the story

415
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:20,120
 The federal government found out about the hole and they either scared him off their property and took the place over

416
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,040
 Or they bought it from him or both right now

417
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,440
 Well as of really his last communication mel said he was living on australia

418
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,480
 On the federal government's dime. They basically paid him off but told him if they didn't take the deal

419
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,040
 They were going to find a drug lab on his property

420
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,840
 And that place is now owned by the u.s. Military which that pattern does fit

421
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:48,840
 Other weird locations we found when I did that death valley episode all these weird underground spots are all now owned by the government

422
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,240
 And they're totally off limits to civilians

423
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,760
 But it's a very convenient answer as well. So let's start getting into the nitty gritty here

424
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,440
 We're running a little long, but let's get in the nitty gritty here because I just can't leave you with that

425
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,080
 There's never been anyone

426
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:09,720
 Oh something that a lot of skeptics go is they say mel waters never existed. There's no record that he lived in that area

427
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,760
 However, he could be using a fake name. I'm not going to totally hang my hat on the fact like well

428
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
 There wasn't a guy named mel waters up there

429
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,400
 Then the whole story is fake

430
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,960
 Like I'm not going to hang but I think there's other stuff that proves that the story is kind of ridiculous other than that

431
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
 Using a fake name is not

432
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,120
 Musicians use fake names. Like that's just kind of a normal thing

433
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,760
 There's other interesting

434
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,760
 Things that are about this one. They are used to be a file on all the mel water stories at

435
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,200
 A local library that files gone and people have pointed to that being some sort of conspiracy

436
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,480
 Although other people could say it could just been a patron who took that

437
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,320
 People are still looking for mel's hole today. I don't know if mel is still alive

438
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,320
 And if it's a fake name, we never really would know if he was alive

439
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,520
 People believe they've narrowed down kind of the area where the hole could be but since they don't know

440
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,960
 Who the person was who really made the phone call to art bell

441
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,880
 Or owned the property or anything like that. They can't look through property records

442
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,560
 So people are still looking for this hole and everyone else is saying your guys are idiots because it doesn't exist

443
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,640
 It's physically impossible

444
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,960
 And I think they're half right a bottomless hole cannot exist

445
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,720
 That goes all the way through the earth just the pressure of the earth would collapse a hole at any given point

446
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,080
 So what you can have though, where's it going to get, you know paranormal here

447
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,640
 You could have a deep hole

448
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,360
 Or it really anything that enters into

449
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,520
 Some other realm

450
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,640
 So it doesn't even have to be a bottomless pit you could look at the pit and it could only be three feet deep

451
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,320
 But when you throw a penny in there, you just see the penny disappear into the ground

452
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,200
 Obviously science disagrees with me on that

453
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,200
 But I mean when you're looking at the paranormal and the supernatural that's possible

454
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,080
 You could come home from work today

455
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,400
 Walk through your bedroom door

456
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:08,200
 And end up in raven dale some magical forest full of pixies and a dark overlord trying to take stuff over in a supernatural world

457
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,680
 It's incredibly

458
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:16,680
 Small chance at whatever happened, but in a world where you believe in the paranormal and supernatural it's possible

459
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,400
 So make sure that you're really good with your bow and arrow skills before you go home

460
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,720
 But if you were able to have a static place you could have these weird time slips and portals moving around

461
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,360
 But if there was actually a hole

462
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,800
 That you were able to go into and enter into this other realm

463
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,040
 And that's why it seems bottomless. There's some other fantasy realm

464
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,360
 That is just full of couches broken down tv sets in tires and they're like why god

465
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,240
 Why are you punishing us as another tire comes rolling crushing their village?

466
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,680
 But I think that's the really the only workable way you could have a bottomless pit as described in these stories

467
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,560
 Because really that's only the interesting way if someone goes I found a bottomless pit

468
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,520
 You're like really and they're like look I can look all the way through the planet earth. You'd be like, yeah, it's kind of cool

469
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,560
 But that's not necessarily interesting

470
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,640
 I want a bottomless pit that leads somewhere not just a pit that just goes

471
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,000
 To the molten core of the planet big whoop. Yeah

472
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,120
 Like that's to me is just a big old hole in the ground

473
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,640
 I would want a bottomless pit that was truly bottomless like you could throw stuff in forever and it would never fill up

474
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,720
 And then that's a paranormal thing

475
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,920
 Otherwise you're just throwing couches through and they're getting melted in hot lava

476
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,480
 And that's really not bottomless the bottomless part the bottom part is just the other side of the planet

477
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,640
 So if we take that scenario I took a little long time to get to this point

478
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,440
 This is my point if we take that scenario that could be moved

479
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,000
 That could be moved

480
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,960
 If you if you were able to identify that here is a hole

481
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,800
 And in this hole is a static gateway to another realm

482
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,320
 We can either do one or two things we can put a government or a military presence on this hole

483
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:06,120
 And it would be super bizarre because we're in this little part of washington all of a sudden this military base springs up out of nowhere

484
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,680
 And maybe there was one there for a time

485
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,800
 But it seems like the first thing they would want to do is

486
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,360
 Can we move it?

487
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,040
 Can we move this hole?

488
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
 We want to put it somewhere else

489
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,280
 If we dig this hole up

490
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:28,440
 Will the unusual qualities remain as scientists are like, I don't know you got 8 000 feet of fishing line and they're like, yeah it's over there

491
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,240
 You figure out how deep

492
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,720
 The actual earth pit is and where it opens up into something else

493
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,680
 And the thing is is you could say well, we could dig it up and we could retain its properties

494
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,920
 Or we could dig it up and then it's just a bunch of dirt is the risk versus the reward

495
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,640
 And if this agency or this government says it is

496
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,640
 It's absolutely where we don't want it here. We want to be able to access this on a regular basis without bringing trucks in

497
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,200
 Let's move it

498
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,800
 so

499
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,480
 Going on that thought mel's hole. I believe if it's real at all

500
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,120
 Which i'm highly doubtful of

501
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,600
 But if it's real at all

502
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,760
 It isn't there anymore

503
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,040
 They would have found it by now people have said that they've seen it before

504
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,960
 The story actually I forgot to mention the stories of this bottomless pit existed before the phone call

505
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,320
 That mel made and some people go no, it was just a really really deep pit. It wasn't really bottomless

506
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,200
 But whether or not it's like this portal where you can throw sheep down and then talking tumors pop out

507
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,320
 I don't know people have said the dogs have come back to life being thrown in there

508
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,480
 People have said black beams have shot out of there or radios will play really old music when you walk by which I think they just have

509
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,320
 the oldie station on but

510
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:47,320
 There's lots of other weird phenomenon. So it would be something that the military would or a government agency or a

511
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,120
 secret society would want control of

512
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,000
 But not there

513
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,600
 They'd want to move it

514
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
 there could be a place

515
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,120
 outside of the view of

516
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,080
 us of normal people

517
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,760
 that

518
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,880
 all of these items all of these things

519
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,200
 are stored

520
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,680
 And you go isn't that the plot of like indiana jones isn't that the plot of that show warehouse 13 predictive programming maybe?

521
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,800
 predictive programming

522
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,480
 No, I think I honestly believe that if any of this stuff is real if any of this stuff is provable whether it's walking mannequins or bottomless pits

523
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,880
 Somebody wants to own and contain those and study them and more importantly use them

524
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,600
 Because why not?

525
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,560
 The one thing we forget a lot of times

526
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,920
 Is that governments and secret societies and secret agencies?

527
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,960
 And it's mad scientists are people. They're us. They are us. They just have more

528
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,000
 access to the paths of power or money or technology, but they're us

529
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,640
 If you found a bottomless pit

530
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,920
 You would start throwing junk into it if the illuminati had access to a pit

531
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,920
 They're going to start throwing junk into it. It's just human curiosity to want to do these things

532
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,240
 But after you got tired after you got bored of throwing your eight television set down there and never hearing it smash

533
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,560
 You're going to think

534
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,560
 If I can throw stuff down there

535
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,880
 Can stuff from down there come up?

536
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,680
 But see that's where we differ from these other groups

537
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,000
 We can just think about it or lower a sheep down 1500 feet

538
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,640
 If you are a governmental agency or a secret society

539
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,200
 You have the resources

540
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,040
 to find out

541
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,800
 100 percent

542
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
 What's on the other side of that portal?

543
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,880
 You have the power to 100 find out what's on the other side of that portal

544
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,680
 The question is

545
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,000
 What will they bring back up?

546
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,560
