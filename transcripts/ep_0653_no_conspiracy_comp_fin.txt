 A trio of true crime stories that'll really make you consider
 Existing on the planet earth you'll really wonder about whether or not you want to stick around you should
 But you'll question it and then we travel back to the conspiracy theory iceberg to look at the only conspiracy theory worth researching
 There is no conspiracy theory today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 *Music*
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I can barely say that with a straight face, but I hope you guys are having a great day and hope you guys can say it with a straight face
 It's so hot in here. I'm recording in the haunted closet
 That's not like the name of a studio if I'm recording in the literal haunted closet
 I gotta run my AC and shut it off come in come into a place where the dead has not departed to record this podcast for you
 The temperature goes up immediately. I don't even know why they're running the AC for an hour before
 Recording each episode, but I'm here for you guys. You know who else is here for us. He never leaves us alone
 He's always hanging out in the most convenient part of our body
 Is there an in is there an inconvenient part of the bunny stick your finger up your nose?
 I want you to pick out our newest patreon supporter. It's boogers. Everyone give a round of applause to boogers you pull him out
 He's like my he's like this is not what my name means. I'm not a booger
 I don't know boogers. Maybe it's like a ghost of a guy named Gus that
 Little less disgusting so pick your nose pull out a booger name it Gus boogers
 You are gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon or if you guys aren't a booger
 That's it's preferable, but just helps her the word about the show really really helps out a lot
 I actually didn't say that in the last episode with Robert Reith
 He was the village person dressed up as a carpenter if you're not a village person
 If you don't have a sexy carpenter outfit like Robert Reith or you're not a booger like boogers
 totally fine
 Both are preferable if you're not those things just helps read the word about the show really really helps out a lot
 Robert Reith we're waving goodbye to him as he fades away like a force ghost and boogers
 We're gonna toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable
 We're leaving behind dead rabbit command take your salty gooey hands put all over the controls for the next person has to play
 The dirgeable we are leaving behind dead rabbit command. We are headed out to a courthouse
 We got a court date dude. This kind of sucks
 So the other day a patreon
 I'm not gonna say who was was driving the Jason Jalopy a little too fast a little too wild got a traffic ticket now because we're all
 Fluffle because we're all a family of rabbits. We all have to attend the court hearing and
 We're here in court. Well while we're in this courthouse. We're gonna fight this speeding ticket. We get an elevator ding and
 Listen man, I've been to court a couple times myself and I've had friends who've gone to court
 Everyone's miserable every single person at the courthouse is miserable the person working in the cafeteria is miserable
 The judges are miserable. It's not a great place to be I was in court
 I was in court when I ran into a solar plexus clown glider. It's a bad place
 Interdimensional
 Creatures hang out in court rooms. I'll put that episode in the show notes
 But ah you don't want to go to court or have anything to do with court or watch the show night court actually that show is pretty funny
 I can't make a joke about that being bad
 We're in this courthouse
 You just want to get the speeding ticket taken care of this very long introduction for three very short stories
 But we want to get this speeding ticket taken care of we're in this elevator now
 We know every time this door opens a weirdo is gonna get inside
 Because that's how the story is framed and that's what happens in real court houses ding elevator door opens and inside steps. Oh
 Good this guy is actually a US Marshal
 His name is David Timothy moon and we're like, oh, what do you hear for and he's like, oh, you know
 I'm a US Marshal so I like do Marshal stuff and we're like, okay, that makes sense
 Maybe he'll protect us for the rest of this
 Adventure there. We're on this very linear and this very vertical adventurer on we go up another story
 the elevator opens up
 The elevator opens up and inside steps
 Ronnie Lou Helton. He's 73 year old man. So we see this old man walk in he looks like the dude from up
 He's just kind of saunter's in and so we know where the marshals here. He's obviously working. We ask hey Ronnie
 What are you here for and he turns to us and he says so the other day?
 This is totally blown out of proportion
 Proportion and everything I'm about to say is alleged because I haven't been found guilty of anything yet
 But on April 7th, 2021 so very recently I was minding my business in Corbin, Kentucky
 And I was walking through a neighbor
 I don't want to tell this story from his point of view
 It's gonna sound super creepy because I have to keep saying I did this stuff
 So this dude named Ronnie Lou Helton was living in Corbin, Kentucky, and he's walking down the street
 He's walking through the Gordon Hill Pike neighborhood. It's 4 p.m
 This is prime time to be like hanging out doing little kid stuff playing with GI Joe's or Paw Patrol or whatever kids play with these days
 There's a little three-year-old boy in the backyard. Look at me grandma. I'm a three-year-old boy
 I don't have imagination yet. I don't know if I'm a jet or a knight
 The grandma's like oh great this kid's gonna be a struggle. Three-year-old boys running around his grandma's backyard
 Now Ronnie is walking through the neighborhood and he has predator vision
 Not predator vision like he'd vision, literal like sexual predator vision. He's like he just sees normal
 He just sees normal. There's no like red heat signature, but it's just creepier
 He sees this three-year-old boy running in the backyard and he walks up to the fence
 Hey, how would you like to come over the fence Ronnie says and the boy's like, you know, probably not and
 Ronnie reaches over the fence grabs the boy's hand and starts to lead him along the fence line now Ronnie's a short man
 Ronnie's about five foot one and
 The boy is three years old so he's obviously short so we're talking like a picket fence
 But Ronnie's really not tall enough to reach over and grab the boy, but he noticed there's a part where the
 Ground on the boy side of the fence kind of
 Lumps up and the fence is technically shorter at that point
 So he's leading the boy over to this lump
 And he means to pick the boy up and run away with him as this is going on the grandma who's supposed to be babysitting this kid
 Looks out and sees
 Ronnie leading this kid down the fence line and she goes let go of my son
 My grandson, let go my grandson. She's easily confused
 Ronnie let's go with the boy the boy runs deeper into the safety of the yard
 Now stranger abductions. They're super rare. They do happen. They're terrifying, but that's not even the end of this incident
 To make it even creepier. I mean this is like 4 p.m. It's so casual
 You have to think that this guy has done this before
 Allegedly he then yells to the grandmother quote all give you a
 thousand dollars
 for this little boy
 unquote
 That's really creepy the fact that he knew that he had a number
 He's probably in the past been like I'll give you 750 dollars and they're like no dice and they're running away
 And he's like, hmm, maybe I should up it next time
 He's obviously
 Doesn't done this enough times to know a thousand dollars is the sweet spot
 He yells out I'll give you a thousand dollars for this boy
 They say no like you should and the guy then turns and gets in his car, which was just parked right there
 They get his license plate number. They turn it over to cops the guys arrested. He's actually charged with attempted kidnapping and
 Because he yelled out a price. He actually got charged with human trafficking as well
 We're standing in this elevator here with this man who tried to abduct a three-year-old boy and then offered a
 $1,000 price tag for the boy and it's so funny because if it was just the kidnapping I probably wouldn't even cover it
 I'm like boring
 Who then tries to kidnap a three-year-old out of a yard
 Call me later when you find out the old man's really a skinwalker or something interesting the fact that he's yelling out a price makes it so chilling
 To me. He's probably bought kids before
 Allegedly
 Allegedly, there's a US Marshal in this elevator. I gotta be careful what I say legally, but it's just creepy
 It's so and the fact that he thought the grandma would go you almost tried stealing my grandson
 But now that you offered me a thousand dollars come in for some tea. Let's talk
 No, he's awaiting some serious serious charges
 So we're now in this elevator with this man who tried kidnapping this little kid. That's not cool
 It's more than uncool it's disgusting, but the elevator we're still stuck in it
 The door opens up another man gets on into the elevator steps
 Kevin Wayne Van Levin. It's a 59 year old home inspector
 We go hey, we don't learn our lesson by asking the first guy what he was in for we ask this guy
 What are you in for and he goes? Oh man, you guys won't believe it
 Well, you guys probably will because there's video evidence of it
 But this is my story and then he does wavy lines and we're flashbacked into this memory of his reluctantly
 We do not want to be in this memory. It's March 12th
 2021 again super recent
 Those chemtrails are finally starting to catch up with everyone and infecting their brains. We're in Oxford Township, Michigan
 Kevin Wayne Van Levin is a home inspector and he is doing what his name implies. He's inspecting a home
 He's looking at it and he goes yeah
 Four walls four walls a ceiling perfect. Check that down. There does seem to be some sort of foundation or floor
 Yeah, it's a floor
 He's very very good at his job. He's very thorough
 So when he's doing his home inspecting the people whose home he's inspecting they say we're gonna go out get a bite to eat
 You do your thing but when they did leave him they didn't expect what was gonna happen
 But they had a video camera and so they're out grabbing a quick bite to eat and all of a sudden
 Their phone goes off there they're like tone goes off their phone and it shows that they had movement in
 their babies nursery
 And they're like, oh no, we forgot the baby. I don't know like he's a home inspector. He's walking around the home
 Why would you even care that motion sensors were going off?
 It pops up on their phone that there's motion in the nursery and the mother she goes
 I didn't really I didn't I wasn't really bothered by it, but for some reason I
 Decided to look at the video and this is the video we have we see Kevin walk into the nursery. It's very very nice
 Nursery, it's I didn't even know was a nursery doesn't have like the
 stereotypical crib and like the haunted rocking chair and stuffed animals
 It looks more like some weird art deco room
 So that's gonna have a real imaginative life, but anyways, it looks very
 Spartan as a nursery
 Now this is now an interior design podcast you wouldn't know is a nursery except for the fact that this man Kevin picks up an Elmo doll
 this tickle me Elmo doll and
 He is walking around the Elmo doll and then he turns his back to the camera and he's kind of like in the closet now and
 he is
 Humping Elmo and you go Jason. How how do you know?
 How do you know if he has his back to the camera and he's halfway in the closet? How can you tell?
 well, you can you can tell right you can tell from the motion of his arm and
 Almost moments of ecstasy. Oh tickle me harder. You can tell he's banging this this doll
 Now he might have known there was a camera there
 I hope he didn't know he did turn his body enough that he was trying to conceal it from something
 But not so much that you can you that you know, right when you see the arm kind of moving not Elmo's arm
 but Kevin's arm and
 Then you see Elmo smoking his cigarette afterwards
 He uses this Elmo doll to masturbate on and then to make things worse
 He puts the Elmo doll back where he found it
 So the idea was that no one would be the wiser except for him and Elmo and there would just be this
 Soaking disgusting Elmo in the corner of this nursery
 Well, they were watching it. They're watching it live
 They called the police the police actually apparently according to this article. I read on the mail online
 By Lauren Lewis the police I believe got there as he was leaving and
 He said oh, no, no, I totally wasn't
 How do you how do you come back from that?
 You're just standing there and two police officers show up and they're like, hey, are you Kevin van Levin and he goes
 Yeah, yeah, that's me and they go. Did you have sex with?
 You immediately would think how did they know how did they know?
 Red fur all over your crotch. You know, how would they know you wouldn't think to come up with a cover story that quickly for that, right?
 So he does though apparently he's like no, no, no, it was totally consensual. Elmo. Okay. Want to me?
 He denies it. He totally denies it
 But then they say well, there's video of you and then he's like, okay, you caught me guys
 You hold his hands up to me handcuffed. They're like, we don't want to touch your hands. You know what you're just doing
 So he is facing
 What was the it was a weird mischief vandalism or misdemeanor
 Malicious vandalism and it carries like a two-year sentence and I think because there's the sex angle to it
 an odd part of his bond he's not in jail right now. He's able to bond out one of his
 conditions of his bond is he can't be in a
 House that he doesn't own that kind of makes him like a vampire, right?
 I think he can't come in your house without special permission. There's this zombie apocalypse. They're like come in come in
 He's like I can't the law doesn't allow it, but he goes in the eyes in a toy factory
 He's like you guys wait there. They're like a food supermarket. He's like I'm gonna go to this stuffed animal factory
 Woohoo the apocalypse has done me right. I will have to say this though the home and I thought this was very noble of
 Kevin he's a home inspector. He's in someone else's home. It's March 12th, 2021 as he's sexually assaulting Tickle me Elmo
 He's wearing a mask
 He is very courteous of COVID restrictions that it's salute to you Kevin
 hats off hats off to you the fact that while you were committing this disgusting crime you continued to wear a mask
 He should be an example for us for us all
 So there we go. We got two
 Creepy stories from these weirdos legend weirdos that we ran into this courthouse
 But I said there was a trio of stories and we're looking around. I'm looking at you. I'm checking
 Have you been delmo recently? You have no fur on your crotch good to go then we realized the grossest story has been here all along
 Deputy US Marshal David Timothy moon has been lurking behind us the whole time. He wasn't lurking. We knew he was there
 He was eating a ham sandwich. He's like hey, I'm still here May 2019
 David Timothy moon
 50 year old man
 24 year veteran of
 The US Marshals this guy had a long career. He actually didn't even answer to the local
 Deputy Marshals in Phoenix, Arizona, which is where this story takes place. He his bosses were in DC
 This guy was a highfalutin dude
 But even highfalutin US Marshals gotta buy houses
 They have places to live. They don't live in yurts. They have to live in a home
 So when US Marshal David Timothy moon
 Was house hunting? He's like oh this place looks great. The neighborhood looks awesome. I read that thing about home inspectors
 They're supposed to have four walls and a roof looks good to me
 He's walking around this house and at one point the real estate agent goes into another room and that is when David
 Timothy moon makes a decision
 He realizes that one of the rooms in this house that he's looking at buying is a three-year-old girls bedroom
 Now the girl's gone. The girl is absent. Nothing bad happens to the girl and David walks into this empty room
 He looks from side to side. He's skulking now. He's skulking through the room
 He's crawling on all fours like the grudge girl
 he zeroes in on
 Something in the corner of the room now I'm gonna say this this room looks like a little kids room
 To make this whole thing even more disturbing. There is giant stuffed animals and like Disney characters and stuff Disney characters
 There's not like animated characters running around. It's not toon town
 But she has all of this stuff
 It looks like a little kids room to make this all even creepier
 But somehow if you walked into someone's room right now, would you be able to tell what their dirty clothes hamper was?
 I couldn't
 Vines on the floor my dirty clothes on the floor, but
 Apparently he was able to walk into this room. He's probably scoping it out the whole time
 He's probably like hey
 Can we take another look at this room and the real estate agents like we've been
 Ten times already. He's like yeah, but I think I left my watch in there and he's still wearing his watch
 He's like he's able to zero in on the dirty clothes hamper of this little girl
 He begins and the reason why we know all this stuff
 It's because this was also on video. He begins going through the dirty clothes and
 he pulls out a
 pair of the this I so disgusting
 He pulls out a pair of the little girls underwear and goes
 He's just sniffing it. He's just in hate
 You know how disgusting children are how filthy they are
 They're the ones constantly picking their nose and picking their butts and being super gross and never taking baths and stuff
 I didn't man. It was a struggle to get me to take a bath. I was 12 years old
 I hated taking baths and showers. They're gross dude and this dude is smelling her underwear
 And then he throws him back. He leaves the room and then a couple minutes later
 He's able to ditch the real estate agent again
 Run back into the room get another sniff of these disgusting dirt. It's dirty clothes, bro
 It's dirty clothes and he's smelling them and
 Then to just make the thing funny
 So gross that's so gross. There's an interview ABC 15 when they're interviewing forensic psychologist John
 Bellatoro was very interesting quote quote this isn't someone who's unsure and needs to look around and try to figure out
 Is this the thing that arouses me? He knows immediately
 Unquote just like the guy in the first story. This isn't someone who is driving on the road and he goes
 You know what? I think I'm gonna do today for the first time ever. I've just had this thought
 I'm gonna kidnap a young boy. This is someone who's thought about this over and over again
 This is someone who has fantasized about this and they knew this was what would turn them on
 With David Timothy moon. It's not alleged. He actually pled guilty to this crime
 We'll get to that in a second, but it's on tape. He's sniffing a little girl's underwear
 Like what is going to say that it's back as it's just on tape the whole thing's disgusting
 But as an outsider as a non-pervo you look at it and you go why why why any of that?
 Did he pick that house because he knew a little girl lived there?
 Is that how creepy this is or did he just happen to be in a house and see a little girl's room and go?
 I bet you there's a hamper in there like what is the logic behind this?
 Outside of just the disgusting part of the fetish. There's so many other pieces now. He said he told the court
 It's the biggest mistake he ever made and they believed it. They believed it
 It was kind of like a one-time thing. It was just like he happened to I mean who hasn't been house shopping and been like
 You know what? I'm missing in life the disgusting smell of used underwear. That's what's been missing in my 50 years of life
 He got charged with all this stuff. He pled guilty to
 Misdemeanor trespassing his sentence. I mean you can argue over what type of this ought to me
 This is reeks of no pun intended this reeks of a sex crime, right?
 No one's like this is my path to fortune and fame smelling underwear
 The only thing that works is like some sort of fetish
 He pleads guilty to misdemeanor trespassing all he gets for this is
 Unsupervised probation no one's even keeping an eye on him your hamper right now your hamper may be unsafe
 He may be hiding in the shadows right now
 Trying to get a whiff of your clothes unsupervised probation and when he completes this program of not being supervised
 It's not even a program. It was the same thing he was doing before he got arrested
 This can be expunged from his record. No one will ever know he was the panty sniffer of Phoenix, Arizona
 And you could go maybe it is maybe it is just a one-time thing
 Maybe he was just walking through and he happened to fall and trip into the little girl's room
 And then he was getting up he accidentally fell into the hamper and smelled underwear twice maybe
 But also according to the police report when he found out the police were looking for him. He threw his computer away
 So we're
 These three dudes we just had to pay a speeding ticket and now we're sitting with a guy tried kidnapping a little boy
 Allegedly a guy who was banging Elmo allegedly in a man who's blood guilty to sniffing little girls underwear technically
 I guess he probably pled guilty to entering the room
 Anyways
 So that is that story I actually
 Interactive adventure I questioned that but I was like nobody wants to pick any of those numbers none of those are fun
 But I didn't want to package them all in one
 Story we pay our speeding ticket we get out of there boogers
 Let's hop in that carbonicopter. We're leaving behind all these alleged pervos. We are headed out to the conspiracy theory iceberg
 The conspiracy theory iceberg there's a lot of icebergs out there they keep evolving
 I actually have appeared on a conspiracy theory iceberg
 12 inches sent me a video from parallel pipes. They did a breakdown of the conspiracy theory iceberg
 It's one of those videos
 That's about an hour long and they just go over everything
 That rabbit radio is listed on there and he says it's a really cool podcast and I agree with that
 I don't know why I'm listed on the conspiracy theory iceberg. I'm actually down low enough
 I'm next to solar plexus clown gliders, but it's dope
 I'm actually become meta the man who started reporting on these conspiracy theory icebergs has now become part of the iceberg itself
 But but with the conspiracy theory iceberg because there's so many of them some are interesting some aren't some are too mysterious
 We'll never know and some are very vague
 There is no
 conspiracy is
 Often found on the lower levels if not the lowest level of the conspiracy theory iceberg and it's something I looked at on and off over the years
 But that's an easy get right you could always say all conspiracy theories are fake that this is all some sort of
 Mind manipulation or like I've said before a lot of conspiracy theories are fake to distract us from real conspiracy theories
 And that's not a new idea a lot of people have said that even before I started saying that I'm not saying I made that up or anything like that
 But it's a real easy one and so when I would see that on the conspiracy theory iceberg
 I would think oh I could do an episode like that, but
 I'm really not saying anything new
 But a couple weeks ago I
 Got an email from somebody and I think they solved the answer
 -
 There are no conspiracies
 It's very very simple
 belief
 There are no conspiracy theories and this is it and I'm
 Paraphrasing what this person sent me and I'm not gonna reveal this person's name, but this is the theory
 Conspiracy theories are used to pass information from one person to another
 That information we are not privy to
 Conspiracies don't really exist. They're simply coded messages
 Now I've talked about that before
 With certain stories and I've talked about hitting codes being passed back and forth
 But it actually that's just scratching the surface of this one. So for example, let's say I wanted to let's say
 I'm a member of an organization because you'd have to be really powerful to do this
 We're not talking about low-level theories like monkeys don't exist, but it would explain why theories like monkey don't exist
 Doesn't become popular, but birds don't exist do
 Birds don't exist as a very very well-known conspiracy theory
 We covered it on the show a long time ago Carson was the first person to recommend it to me. Thank you very much Carson
 There's flyers in every major city. It's very it's it's a meme
 It's fake. It was set up as a parody of conspiracy theories
 Why is that one more popular than monkeys don't exist?
 Which is which is earnest at the very least that they're both dumb
 But one of them people honestly believe it that monkeys do not exist. It's hilarious
 Right and it makes more sense. I was talking about this on a live stream the other night
 We don't see monkeys in our daily life. You can actually convince someone that monkeys don't exist
 It's a lot harder to convince someone that birds don't exist because we interact with birds all of the time
 Why is birds don't exist more popular than monkeys don't exist?
 Because what's happening is one group of people are trying to spread a message to another group of people
 They're using the conspiracy theories as code and we've talked about this before on the podcast
 But we're gonna go more in-depth now because conspiracy theories blow up very quickly
 They get publicized very quickly the message gets spread very quickly and people are just looking at the surface of it
 They're not looking for the code
 It's an easy way to spread your message is to actually make it controversial to make it
 Shocking look at that Lil Nas X dude
 He came out with that song called call me by your name
 Montero whatever it is and this video he's like banging Satan and he's like doing a lap dance for Satan
 And then he breaks off Satan horns and becomes Satan and
 Everyone like this song had like millions of downloads and he was selling those shoes and all stuff
 no one would have ever downloaded that song if it was him at a
 Concert if it was just video of him singing to his fans exact same song you make it controversial
 You're gonna get the message out
 Nobody would he would have had the same hundred thousand people who downloaded his last song download this song instead
 He has all of these YouTube videos and these political pundits talking about it
 It was 100% strategy
 100% strategy behind that so if I want to send a message to you
 I will craft a conspiracy theory called birds don't exist and you know what the message is
 I know what the message is and I also want to take this moment to say a
 Good example of this in Dead Rabbit recommends this
 I don't want to go into detail about it because it's such a good movie
 I don't want to spoil it
 Beyond the Silver Lake or under the Silver Lake. I want to recommend that I should know the name of it
 I'll put it in the show notes. I think it's under the Silver Lake
 It's a movie about this about how conspiracy theories are actually in hidden messages and music and all the stuff that we think is satanic
 Illuminati stuff is actually two groups of people communicating with each other two powerful groups of people communicating with each other
 It's a brilliant movie. It's a great movie. I recommend checking it out
 But for what we're talking about here, let's get back to this core thing
 There is no conspiracy theory conspiracy theories are just ways of people to pass messages back and forth. That's still super vague
 right
 Like it's easy. It'd be easy for me to make that statement and then be like, okay, that's the end of the episode
 I got an email from somebody who actually not only can specify what the message is
 but he
 made good on it
 Boogers let's hop back in that carbonicopter. We're leaving behind the conspiracy theory iceberg. We're headed out
 To the New York Stock Exchange
 Carbonicopter lands in the middle of stock exchange everyone has to stop trading for the day economic disaster
 But we're here and the reason why we're here is this is the theory if you take a conspiracy theory
 Like the great reset which we talked about yesterday and you strip it of
 All of the satanic stuff of all of the Illuminati stuff you boil it down to its essence
 its stock tips
 when they start talking about ways to
 We're gonna invent this microchip and we're gonna put it in your hand and all that stuff when that's the conspiracy theory
 invest in biometric technology
 when you can find a conspiracy theory and
 boil it down to
 How the private market would benefit from that?
 That tells you who to invest in
 Think about it this way monkeys aren't real the conspiracy theory is
 NASA is trying to prove that God doesn't exist that evolution is real and monkeys are a part of evolution
 So they're faking it. They're faking all of it
 Technically, I guess you can you can invest money in NASA birds aren't real is all about how birds are actually spy technology
 They're like drones. They're sent out to
 Investigate us and they're all fake their robots
 You would then when that conspiracy theory started
 You would go okay, let's start moving investments towards unmanned aerial vehicles
 Let's start putting some of our investments in drone technology and surveillance technology
 Who's the hot camera maker right now?
 Who's making the best optical cameras for these drones invest in them?
 the theory is is that conspiracy theories like birds aren't real was a way for
 people to spread stock tips to commit insider trading that they're all fake
 When you look at stuff about microchips being implanted
 invest in the biometrics when you start looking at stuff about the
 Singularity and the singularity is going to take stuff up start investing in companies that are trying to do AI
 One organization is looking at the stuff and they know that they're going to have a huge product come out
 They see that they're going to have their stock is going to blow up
 They know something's going on to alert their fellow conspirators
 They craft a conspiracy theory that's based on what they know is going to happen
 And it's not that they know that the great reset is going to happen the great reset
 The reason why that's more popular than other conspiracy theories in this theory is
 It's being pushed because they're trying to get other people to invest in the products that prop up the quote-unquote great reset
 It's fake. It doesn't exist
 But you will eat bugs is a thing that people are constantly saying when they talk about great reset
 The whole thing in this theory the whole thing was set up. So you would start investing in companies that
 Grow bugs now you go Jason
 Maybe that's the horse leading the cart or the cart leading the horse if the great reset is coming
 They're gonna force everyone to eat but I can't believe I'm still talking about the stupid great reset
 But the great reset is coming. They're gonna force everyone to eat bugs. Of course you should invest in bugs
 But the great reset is something it's so hypothetical. They're not saying it's gonna happen tomorrow
 But according to this theory if you invest in bugs now if you invest in bug farms now
 You're gonna start making money now. In fact the person who sent me this story
 Claims to have made hundreds of thousands of dollars
 By simply following the biggest conspiracy theories out there stripping them of the satanic and the Illuminati nonsense
 Investing in the core technologies talked about in those conspiracy theories no matter how outlandish the conspiracy theory is
 Even if it's something that's not supposed to take place until the future not supposed to take place for a while something like transhumanism
 You boil it down to stuff you can invest in this person has claimed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars
 This isn't and they were trying to get me to invest in them. I've talked to this person a lot
 Way before this we were actually interacting they listened to the show
 They're a fan of the show and they approached me one day and said hey
 Do you know of any new big conspiracy theories that are coming up and I said no not really and they said well
 This is why I'm asking because here's my theory and I've actually taken this theory over the past couple months and made a lot of money
 So if you could figure out what the next big conspiracy theories are going to be it can give people tips on how to become rich
 Is that the reason and this has been a question that I've talked about a lot on the show why some conspiracy theories are more popular than others
 Is it because some conspiracy theories are artificially propped up not because of you know Russian disinformation
 Trying to prop up flat earth to make Americans look stupid. That's a popular conspiracy theory out there
 Not because it's they're building up these fake conspiracy theories to blind us from the truth the reason why
 Trees are mountains or mountains are trees and trees are bushes. However that one was set up or monkeys don't exist because those are
 Organic conspiracy theories those are actually thought up by individuals. It's just an interesting piece of this puzzle
 Because that is always a question. Why is flat earth more popular than
 So many other conspiracy theories. It's dumb. It's observably dumb
 YouTube promotes it YouTube lets the algorithm run with this flat earth stuff. Why is someone benefiting from it?
 Is it as simple as when you see the flat earth stuff come up?
 It was to promote GPS technology when you can boil down these suit
 It doesn't work with every conspiracy theory doesn't work with the obscure ones
 But when you can boil down these popular conspiracy theories that everyone knows about and find out how the private sector would benefit from
 Technologies in that conspiracy theory you can make money apparently
 You can make a lot of money
 Now again, you could argue if you if people are talking about putting biometrics inside of you and
 That's being talked about in the news and you invest in those companies
 It's because they plan on putting biometrics inside of you
 They've been talking about putting biometrics inside of you since 1992
 I've been hearing about the microchips under the skin since 1992 and you could go well
 They're doing it in Sweden. They're doing it at this nightclub in Sweden. Da da da da
 They have never ever been able to fully implement a microchip under the skin
 They've been talking about this almost my entire life
 But companies have been making these things and I you may be able to take a look at
 When those conspiracy theories started when those conspiracy theories start to dip and they're not as popular and then they peak again in popularity
 And look at the profits look at the stock increases of those companies
 it's not that people
 legitimate stock investors are
 Reading godlike productions and they're super scared that everyone's going to get a microchip
 It's not that the conspiracy theory makes people worried and they're investing in it or makes them hopeful
 And they want everyone to get microchip and they're investing in microchips. It's that the conspiracy theory is false
 It's 100% fake and it's a way to tell your friends what you are investing in and what you should invest in
 Without ever getting caught for insider trading without it ever being tracked back to you and the conspiracy theory just lives on
 It would explain why some conspiracy theories are more popular and longer lasting than others
 All these conspiracy theories we investigate and we're trying to solve these mysteries
 could be just
 Wrapping paper
 Around a gift that the rich people are giving each other
 We never get to
 Until you crack the code and start investing as well
 So the next time you see a conspiracy theory pop up and you start to see it gain popularity
 And you have a little money to throw around
 Maybe you should try this too
 Boil it down to its essence. What are the technologies needed to make this conspiracy theory work?
 And see if it actually could be insider trading
 However the flip side could be that it's not that it actually is
 Investors knowing the conspiracy theory is true and they're trying to make as much money as they can
 Before the world ends
 You could be investing in a microchip company
 And making some short-term gains because you thought it was just a code
 But when that microchip is being forced into your head against your will and you cry one final teardrop
 Before your emotions are completely overwritten
 You will remember that your investment helped in the future of mankind
