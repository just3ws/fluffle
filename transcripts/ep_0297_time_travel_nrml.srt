1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Russians perfect time travel and use it with horrible results.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we take a look at an interesting theory being proposed by one of Internet's most popular characters.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Are we on the verge of a dimensional merge between the real and the fictional?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 According to Chris Chan, we are today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 A while back I mentioned a Minecraft server that may be available for people who support the show via Patreon.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 It actually, we've been beta testing it for about the past week.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Everything seems to be going great.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 So I want to give a thanks to Burrito, two different people.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Cantillians, Irobarto, Gorgonzola, Henshin Kee, the King, DJA and the Valeyard.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 They've all been just hanging out on the Minecraft server building stuff.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 So I'm announcing it now.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 If you support the Patreon at any level, you can play on the Minecraft server with us.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It's actually a lot of fun.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It's just we're in the middle of this wilderness.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 We have a couple houses being built slowly.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 So if you support the Patreon at any level, you'll get the IP for the Minecraft server and then I have to whitelist you.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And that's to prevent trolling.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And I'm going to say this to you guys, if we can behave ourselves on the Minecraft server over a period of time,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I will look into reopening a Discord as well.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 But baby steps.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I can much more control activity on a Minecraft server, I believe.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It's pretty grief-proof right now.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 But if I can, if we can keep this going for a while without any craziness,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 and my craziness threshold is quite high, but if we can keep this going without any craziness,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 then we will look at reopening a Discord server as well.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But if you want to support the show via Patreon, that's great.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 At any level, you can get access to the Patreon and I can whitelist you.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And then you will be able to play on the Minecraft server.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Let's go ahead and jump in to our first story for today.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Our first story is a sequel to yesterday's story.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 However, if you missed yesterday's story, not a big deal,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 because the yesterday's story kind of talked about one character involved in this,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 and now we're going on to another one.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So if you missed yesterday's episode, don't worry about it.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It's a good episode, though. I recommend checking it out.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 We're headed to Russia. We're headed back to Russia.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We're going to take the Dead Rabbit Robo.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 We've got to get a workout.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We've just been sitting playing Minecraft all week.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 My thumbs and my fingers work, but everything else is atrophied.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So let's get a Dead Rabbit Robo.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I will row. I will row. You can kick back this time.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Sip some margaritas, because I row us across the ocean.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I need the workout more than you do.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 We're going back to the year 2001.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And actually, before we go back to year 2001,

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 we're going to row the Rabbit Robo to Russia,

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 and we're going to visit the news offices of Pravda.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Now, Pravda is a Russian news agency,

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 and I'm going to put the word "news" in quotes,

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 and I'm going to put the word "agency" in looking side to side nervously.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 A couple of episodes ago, I talked about Taz news agency.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 They're the ones who talked about the aliens walking around the park and everything like that.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And they're a fairly reputable major news organization.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Pravda is a news agency.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Again, quotes in side to side look,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 because while they do report the news,

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 they make stuff up a lot, too.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And it's really hard to tell the difference.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I learned my lesson back in the early 2000s,

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 that when you read something on Pravda,

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 it probably was fabricated.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But you never know, right?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You never know.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So we're walking around the Pravda offices,

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 and they have just like photos of Bigfoot that you actually see them photoshopping,

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Borschelten taking a shot at them.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But then they also have photos of just like actual news events.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 They have photos of the Islamic State taking over parts of the Middle East.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So, very, very bizarre place for us to visit.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Almost imagine if Mad Magazine in New York Times

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 merged into one office, we have Pravda.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 To go a little bit of where we're headed,

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I'm on the Pravda website when I was researching this,

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and you know, you have little like links, little links all over the place.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And one of them was Anomalous Phenomenon.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So I'm reading this article about time travel,

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 and it was in the subject of anomalous phenomenon.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I know you guys are impressed.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I can pronounce that word.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And I click on it because I go,

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 "Oh, there's maybe more interesting articles that Pravda has written about anomalous phenomenon."

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I click on it, the first article that pops up on the Anomalous Phenomenon page.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 No joke, as of doing this, this is the first article that pops up.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Commemoration of International Women's Day.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 So either they think International Women's Day is anomalous phenomenon,

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 it ranks up there with time travel in UFOs,

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 or they don't know the definition of the word anomalous.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 But it's there, and if you guys don't believe me,

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 you can follow the links, you can click on it, and it will pop up.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And if it's still not the first story, it'll be somewhere there on the first page.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 But anyway, so that's kind of the people we're dealing with here.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Sorry, Pravda.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Actually, no, I'm not criticizing the other one who made the website.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 The other one who has this reputation.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 The year is 2001,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 and we are going to meet a man named Vodam Chirbobarov.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Vodam Chirbobarov.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Now, in yesterday's story, he met a time traveler, Eugene Gayduck, from the future,

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 and then he said, "Vodam, you're going to be instrumental in building this time machine."

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 He's like, "I have no idea what you're talking about."

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And Gayduck's like, "Well, it's because it happens in the future, dude."

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Like, he haven't done it yet, and Vodam's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right."

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Makes sense.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So now we're going to follow the supposed adventures of Vodam.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 He is a real person.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 He's done a lot of writing on anomalous phenomenon.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 He's kind of like a UFO dude in Russia.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But he's also been linked to these time travel writings and these particular time travel experiments.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 The year's 2001.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Vodam's hanging out with his scientists, dudes.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And he's like, "Hey, you know what, guys?

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 We meet you.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Yeah, you over there.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Yeah, you put the coffee down.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Nah, you can hold it, it doesn't matter.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 But you too.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 We're going to build a time machine."

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And everyone's like, "Yay."

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And so they build the time machine.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Now, it's really interesting that they go simply from the concept to actually creating it.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But they had to not tell people they were building a time machine because they figured it would fall into the wrong hands.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Which makes sense.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 This is a quote from Pravda.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 This is the exact phrases from Pravda.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Apparently they are working at a place called the Moscow Aircraft University.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So it's basically like, "I wouldn't mind going there.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Plains, walking into classrooms.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 All the classes are held in giant hangers.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 You have to fly in there."

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And I don't know, that joke was stupid.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Anyway, it's just called Moscow Aircraft University, no jokes.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 This is the funny part.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I don't have to make this joke.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 This is the funny part.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 This was the quote in the Pravda article.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 When asked what the scientists were building, here's this quote.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 "To keep the machine secret, we marked it as a beaver rat trap."

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Now, here's the thing.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I'm walking through Moscow Aircraft University and I see a weird looking device in the corner

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 of the room and I go, "Hey, what's that?"

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And someone guy goes, "Ah, that's just a beaver rat trap."

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 That's going to make me more curious to, one, find out what a beaver rat is.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Two, how it works.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And three, are there any beaver rats in it?

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Like, that would make you more suspicious.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 "Hey, man, what's that over there?"

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 "Oh, that's just a cotton candy machine."

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 "What?

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Oh, dude, let's go get some cotton candy."

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 "No, no, no, you're going to go back in time."

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Like, don't name it something intriguing.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Just say, "Oh, that's like a cardboard box disassembler."

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Be like, "Yeah, it's lame."

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 "Where's your cotton candy machine?"

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 They're like, "Oh, that's a cross campus."

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I'm like, "Yay!"

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Running through Moscow Aircraft University.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So, it's a beaver rat trap is what they call in it.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But this machine works.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 We're going to assume everything probably said is true for the further duration of this narrative.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Okay? The machine, the beaver rat trap/time travel device works.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It actually works.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Vatom and the scientists get it to work.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's not a beaver rat trap.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They announce it.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 This time machine 100% works.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 But it has a very, very interesting flaw to it.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 It moves you through time,

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 but it only moves parts of your body through different parts of time.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So, they start off, they first off, they're going to test it, right?

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 They don't use it on a beaver rat.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 They get some cockroaches.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 They put the cockroaches in it, turn it on,

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 [imitates cockroaches]

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 All the cockroaches are dead.

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 They're like, "Oh, okay. That's interesting.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Let's see what killed them."

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Start doing little dissections to peel the top of the shell off their doogie-houser music is playing while they're poking it with little metal.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 What they figured, not metal, they used some medical tools.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 What I'm saying, they're not using shards of steel.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 What it is, is that, like, their eyeballs went 100 years into the future.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So, their eyeballs would have aged 100 years while the, I don't know if cockroaches have livers, but for the sake of this, they do.

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Their livers go back in time 30 years.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And their tummy goes forward in time 10 seconds, stuff like that.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So, it teleports parts of you into the future, parts of you get older or younger as if they were going back in time.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Then, they go, "Let's fix this machine, because we have something here.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 We have cockroach with 100-year-old eyes, 30-second old stomach and a liver, 30 years ago."

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 So, they go, "Fix it. Fix in it."

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And then they go, "It's all fixed. Let's throw some mice in it."

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Throw mice in it. [imitates mice]

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Open it up. All the mice are dead, and it's the same thing.

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Body parts of the mice are aging at different rates.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Now, you're saying that's technically not time travel. Time travel is traveling in time, but their organs are traveling in time.

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But they're still, it's not like their lung disappeared.

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Just they had lung as if they had lived 30 years.

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So, they're on to something. You've got to give them that, right? They're on to something.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 So, all the mice are dead. Now, I've got to fix it.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 [imitates mice]

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Oh, here's the thing. This is what I don't understand. So, you kill a bunch of cockroaches and you fix it.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Wouldn't you test it on more cockroaches? Just to see if you got the fix right?

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Instead of moving up to mice.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 So, the mice die. You know where this is going? The mice die. They fix it and they go, "We need to test it again."

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And they go, "Do we have any more mice?" And they're like, "Yeah, we already did mice."

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 "Let's get a puppy."

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Now, don't freak out yet. Don't freak out yet, okay? They get this puppy named this...

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 They get a puppy named Lunar Rover, which makes me think in space there's a puppy called Time Travel Machine.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But this puppy named Lunar Rover is put into a Time Travel Machine.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 [imitates machine noises]

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 They open the door. The puppy is alive. Little Lunar is alive, but suffers such massive brain damage.

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And it starts attacking them. Like it has rabies. And they're like, "Well, back to the drawing board."

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And they have to... Now they have a rabie infected dog running around their laboratory.

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Or Labradori...

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Okay, so, anyways.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Brain damage dog. That's... I guess it's really not a joke. I tried forcing one of there.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Okay, so anyway, so you've done that. You killed a bunch of cockroaches. You killed a bunch of mice.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 You gave a dog time rabies through the portal of time. Fix the machine.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 What's next, man? Vadom and eight of his buddies crawl into the Time Machine.

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 They're all huddled close together. I met... I always imagined this thing was quite small, but if you could...

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 If it could fit eight dudes, I mean, that's like... That's like a lot of dudes to fit into an enclosed area.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So, hey, they're all, "Uh, get in there. Uh, why are you still drinking your coffee? Uh, put that down, man. You've been drinking that this whole time."

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And they're all squeezed in there. And then they realize, "Oh, wait, someone has to stand outside and turn it on."

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I don't know how they figured that out. They probably had the lame scientist outside.

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 He's like, "I want to time travel, too." They're like, "Yeah, yeah, you can do it next time. Dork. Hit the button."

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Shut the door on him. So, anyways, they hit the button.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 [Mimics button noises]

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 They get out. Totally fine. No one has rabies. No one's biting each other unless he's really good at hiding it.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 He's like, "See you guys later. I'm headed home." And he's driving home. He's like, "I can't wait to bite everybody at home."

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 But everyone got out and was fine. And what they figured out was that there was a 3% time shift in the device.

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 So, I had to look this up. 3% of an hour is like 1.5 seconds or so. And then my math could be wrong on that, or Provdus' math could be wrong on that.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But apparently, from the time they got into the machine to the time that 8 men got out of the machine, there was an additional 1.5 seconds had elapsed in the machine that didn't happen outside the machine.

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 So, they traveled 1.5 seconds into the future. And they're like, "Yay, success. Yay, yay."

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Cockroach is like, "Where's my parade? Where's the parade for my people who died shaking his little fist at them?"

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 But the humans don't acknowledge them. They're like, "Yay, we perfected time travel."

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 There was also a weird, you know, with Provdus, you're going to have translation errors as well, even though it is on the English website.

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 There's still some bizarre stuff on there. It said there was changes in the machine's size.

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 So, I don't know if it got bigger, if it transmuted in some sort.

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 But anyways, they didn't feel anything except for, quote, "moderate arrhythmia."

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 So, that means their heart rate increased, and their colored circles in their eyes, it's not like they all came out with back-center of their eyes.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 They're like, "Oh, what happened?" They're like, "It took a 1.5 second nap."

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It means that they had little cool-looking anime eyes for a while. They might still, I don't know, assuming again, this story has any truth to it.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So, Vadim and his buddies did build a time machine like Gadeuk had predicted.

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But that's actually when people started looking into what Vadim had done.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 It turns out that that's only the tip of the iceberg.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 There were time machines built in Russia long before Vadim, but they had the unfortunate problem of being invented underneath Joseph Stalin, one of the world's most brutal dictators.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 In 1952 Russia, Stalin was dead by now, but his... I think he was dead by now. It doesn't matter.

250
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Stalin shadow loomed along over giant chunks of the Soviet Union. It was not a desirable place to be building time machines in, because here's the thing.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Like in the West, you build a time machine, people go, "Would you kill Hitler? Would you go back and kill Hitler?"

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Like, that's kind of the go-to question with time machine.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 In the Soviet Union, they're like, "Ah, Hitler's dead. We have our own, this horrible dictator here and his horrible,

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 "horrible, "apparatus-y setup if I could build a time machine. I want to kill Hitler.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 "I'd go back in time and stop the rise of the Soviet Union."

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And so don't... you can't build those time machines in the Soviet Union.

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Like, you just couldn't do that, right? You couldn't build... any dictator worth their salt would try to stop time travel, because everything already works for them.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 They're the dictator. They're in charge. They don't really need to go back in time and make themselves more of a dictator.

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So anyone in a communist-controlled country, there will be no time travel, because people will immediately go, "Let's go back in time and make it,

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 "so I don't have to work in the wheat fields."

261
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So anyways, bad time to be a time travel scientist, 1952 Russia. And here's why.

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 According to Pravda, there were some signs... this all came out of secret documents that got found, apparently.

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Probably just a writer, sci-fi writer, made them up.

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And according to Pravda, these secret documents were uncovered after the fall of the Soviet Union.

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 There were these scientists working on a time machine, and they're like, "Oh, we got this. This might actually work.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 "We've used dead cockroaches everywhere. We might be onto something."

267
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 KGB comes into the laboratory, arrests everyone, executes 18 college professors.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I believe that detail, Pravda. KGB executes 18 college professors and 59 other students and professor colleagues and stuff like that.

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Substitutes, it was just their day that someone else called in sick, sent to work camps, and all of the machinery was destroyed.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 But later, the program gets started back up. And this time, it gets started back up with government supervision, because we're in the year 1961,

271
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 and they're like, "Well, you know, we're kind of losing the space race. Maybe we can win the time travel race."

272
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But, looking at all the professors, all the scientists, no killing Stalin, no reversing the Soviet Union,

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 and they're like, "Yes, sir, everyone has their fingers crossed."

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Build the time machine, and they get some of the best Russian time travel experts in the country, all eight of them,

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 because there's only eight of them at the time. The eight leading time travel researchers are working building this machine,

276
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 and then one day, people go to work, like everyone goes home, buy eight leading researchers,

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I'm just a guy who like, mops the floor, and they're like, "See you later."

278
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 He goes home, comes back the next day, building is demolished, the building they're in was demolished, and all of the researchers are gone.

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And so people go, "Oh, well, let's stall." "Oh, Stalin's up to his little tricks again, good thing I went home early that day."

280
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 But the idea is the time travel machine may have vanished them all away, building gets destroyed, but again, if this story's true,

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 it's most likely the KGB just came in, shot everybody.

282
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Now we're jumping up to the year 1987, so we're near the end of the Soviet Union.

283
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Things were pretty good, Gorbachev's in charge, everyone's still afraid, nukes are gonna fall everywhere,

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 but it's not as bad as back then, and the program gets started back up, which makes sense,

285
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 because the Soviet Union knew that things weren't going well for them, they're like, "If only we had some way of reversing time."

286
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Again, no killing Stalin, but if we could go back in time and maybe get a better version of the Cuban Missile Crisis,

287
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 or we could get more land in Germany or something like that, we could be in a better position.

288
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 So you can start building this time machine again.

289
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 The scientists were like, "Yes, start building the time machine in 1987, August 30th, 1989."

290
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Boom.

291
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 There was a massive explosion on the Anju Islands.

292
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 This is where this laboratory was where they were working on this new time machine.

293
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 The time machine was like 760 tons, it was this massive device, completely gone,

294
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 as well as two square kilometers of the island that it was situated on, just a massive explosion just ripped through the island.

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Don't try looking that up on Wikipedia, it didn't happen, but anyways, there would be a trip if that actually happened,

296
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 but I would bet dollars to donuts, it didn't happen.

297
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 But anyways, and again, we're back in the fictional universe, the Russian scientists are like, "What happened?

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 All my stuff was there, I left my lunchbox there that day, oh no, it's gone."

299
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And the working theory is that the time travel device opened up a portal in time.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 This is hilarious, this is the perfect way to end this story, I know this has been a long one,

301
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 but the portal of the device is so funny.

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Okay, you finally get a working time machine built.

303
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 KGB is not assassinating you anymore, it's not killing cockroaches.

304
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 You build a time machine and, and this scientifically makes sense.

305
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 A time machine, if it disappeared from our time and went into another time,

306
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 there is a brief period where there is a doorway open between the two points in time, right?

307
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 So it's not like you blink out of existence, I mean this is all theoretical, but you blink out of existence and you appear in their timeline,

308
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 it would be the same thing when I open a door and leave my living room into my bedroom,

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 and no matter how fast I shut the door, it could be a millisecond, I can't pass through it without something being opened there.

310
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 The working theory is this, they got a time machine to work, they teleported in.

311
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 This is so funny, you build a time machine, it's your life's work, you activate it, you go to the, this is the theory,

312
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 they went to a precise point where a meteorite struck Earth.

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And so when the time travel, I guess if you're going to the future you don't really know,

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 but the time travel machine opens up a portal right when a giant asteroid was hitting the planet,

315
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 and what happened was the time machine did go into the future,

316
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 but the asteroid, the impact of all that energy smashed into our reality and destroyed these islands.

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I should have looked up and see if there was ever an explosion there, hold on a second.

318
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 So I just spent about five minutes looking at it, the only reference I could find,

319
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 and this is kind of what I figured, the only reference I could find to a massive explosion on those islands

320
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 is basically either from copy pasted from the article involving the story,

321
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 or it involves the time travel story in another way.

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 So I don't think it happened, I looked around a bit, watch out, because I went to a website,

323
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 the first website I went to defeated my ad blocker and it was a bunch of pop-ups,

324
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 that's honestly what took me so long, but it was just a second, because I edited it like time travel.

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And let's finish this story off like this, and actually we're going to finish off the episode like this.

326
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I've run out of time to talk about the dimensional merge, I apologize, we'll talk about that tomorrow.

327
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 We're going to end the time travel story like this.

328
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Massive explosion hits the Anju Islands, time travel machine is gone,

329
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 and people are like, "Ah, all that hard work, and all we got was two kilometers of decimation,

330
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 and we lost some of our leading scientists, will we ever know what actually happened?"

331
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And then, they start getting a message, and they're like, "Hurry up, Johnny,

332
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 pick up that radio handheld set thing, because it's 1987 and we don't have stuff that Jason can identify."

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 It's just a telephone sitting on top of a computer, they pick it up, "Hello?"

334
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And then they get this transmission from the scientists in the time pod.

335
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So that these are the exact quotes, this is exact quote that came from these fictional scientists

336
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 who traveled into the future.

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 "We are dying, but keep on conducting the experiment. It is very dark here.

338
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 We see all objects become double, our hands and legs are transparent.

339
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We can see veins and bones through the skin.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 The oxygen supply will be enough for 43 hours.

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 The life support system is seriously damaged.

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Our best regards to the families and friends."

343
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Transmission just cuts.

344
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Time travel is immensely dangerous, but all travel is.

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 When we first started going across the oceans, very, very dangerous.

346
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Traveling into space, very, very dangerous.

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 It's funny because a lot of time, traveling into space on a scale is as dangerous as traveling across the ocean.

348
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It seems, it takes more energy to do it, but it's around the same level.

349
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And it's easy for us to now go, "Oh man, you know, space travel is so spooky,

350
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 like you're getting up there and you can get lost in the middle of nowhere

351
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and if something happens you're just kind of boned for six months."

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And then you hop on a carnival cruise and just go, "Hey, party down doing the Macarena."

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 We can perfect, or we can make space travel faster and safer, like we have made sea travel.

354
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And sea travel is still dangerous, but we can make it faster and safer and cheaper to the point where,

355
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 in a hundred years, you'll have people with private spaceships flying around the moon.

356
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Time travel is one of those things, though, that if we ever do get the hang of,

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 and I do think it's possible, but that's a whole other, like, that's a long discussion about what actually time travel is,

358
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 but the idea of traditional time travel, of being able to go back into the past, if that is possible,

359
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 it's not only dangerous for the travelers themselves, getting stuck in time, machines breaking down, dematerializing.

360
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It's the only form of travel that's dangerous to everybody else as well.

361
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 If a boat sinks, the people on the boat are having a bad day.

362
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 If a boat is carrying some sort of oil, some sort of noxious chemical radiation stuff,

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 being shipped to somewhere for some reason, sinks, it's a bad deal for a bunch of people in the area,

364
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 maybe a generation of people.

365
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And the same thing with a spacecraft.

366
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 If it has some sort of nuclear-powered engine and it blows up, the area is going to be irradiated,

367
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 and maybe for the next 500 years, people aren't going to be able to be in that area.

368
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 But those type of disasters are very, very, would be very, very hard to come by.

369
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Time travel is, you hit a button and you jack up the entire time stream.

370
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Like, everything has changed because you were an idiot.

371
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I once started writing a story a long time ago, and it was about a group of scientists who built a time box.

372
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 They could see different periods of time.

373
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 The first thing they do is, let's see what would happen if Hitler won World War II.

374
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 It's always an easy question, because it was such a pivotal moment in world history.

375
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 So they look into it. It's not like a cardboard box. It's not like a diorama they're looking into.

376
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 They're standing inside this encased metal box.

377
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 They dial in the coordinates. They're doing their sci-fi stuff. I'm not good at writing the technical stuff.

378
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 It's just magic, basically, but with a science fiction bent.

379
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Really, what a lot of science fiction is, except for hard sci-fi.

380
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 But anyways, they go ahead, they activate the device, and they can see, basically, their location in a different time period,

381
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 and they can get readouts from other places.

382
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 So they put in their little thingamajiggers, and the world is a vast wasteland.

383
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 They're like, "Oh, that is what we figured. If Hitler had taken over, the world would have collapsed."

384
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Let's see now what would happen if Soviet Union had won the Cold War.

385
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 A vast wasteland. They're like, "USA, USA."

386
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 But then they go, "Let's see what would happen if Kennedy hadn't been assassinated."

387
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 "Vast wasteland." And they're like, "What's going on?"

388
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 They go, "Let's see what would happen if the Metz won 10 Super Bowls."

389
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 That's my level of sports stuff.

390
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 But anyways, they put it in. They're like, "Jason, you're an idiot."

391
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And he's like, "No, let's put it in."

392
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 "Metz won 10 Super Bowls."

393
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 "Vast wasteland."

394
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And they begin just putting in just minor stuff.

395
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And the world is destroyed in every possible other scenario.

396
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Then this box they're in is shielding from all the effects of time travel.

397
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 They end up leaving the box and they're like, "We don't know what to make of that."

398
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And once they leave the box, these two time travelers show up.

399
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And they're like, "We're here to deliver the exposition."

400
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 The time travelers say, "There is not a single event in human history that has not been perfectly modified by us in the future."

401
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Everything that you think is free will is actually somebody coming back from the future and having to change it,

402
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 because otherwise the world would be destroyed.

403
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Everything that you do is totally corrected by us.

404
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And now we have to correct you, because this device shouldn't exist.

405
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 So they kill all the scientists, dismantle the box, make it so the scientists who are never born disappear into the future.

406
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 If time travel is real, it is being used every single day.

407
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And the world around us is a finely tuned machine.

408
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Because the people in the future already know the past, and to ensure they have a future, they have to correct our past.

409
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Nothing is left up to chance.

410
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 There is no free will.

411
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Everything is polished and perfect for the sake of those in the future.
