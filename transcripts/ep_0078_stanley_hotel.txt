 Did a talking mongoose haunt a family in the 1930s?
 And today I talk about personal experiences I had at the historically haunted Stanley Hotel today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.
 Both my best friends forgot my birthday.
 One, I could understand both.
 So if you detect that my voice is a little monotone than normal or you
 hear the sound of my soul being ripped from my body, that's why.
 I actually didn't plan on recording an episode today, not just because of that, because I had got called into work tomorrow
 and I had a long day today, but
 yeah, what are you gonna do?
 Let's go ahead and go on to our first story.
 So our first story is the story of Jeff the Talking Mongoose.
 Now his name is Jeff, but it's spelled G-E-F.
 He's a little...
 Well, he's a talking mongoose. I think that kind of is obvious, but
 it's a little more than that. It was almost a... He looks like a mongoose, but nobody really ever saw him.
 He acts like a talking animal would if you think animals can talk, but
 he also has qualities of like a poultry geist. It was a curious case back then.
 Well, I guess it's a curious case now, but you know... Man, this is going to be a hard episode to record.
 Okay, let me get centered here. So anyways,
 Jeff the Talking Mongoose. So this story took place back in the 1930s. It was in the Isle of Man, which is somewhere in Europe.
 Maybe it's off of England? I don't know.
 Let's just see if we can get through on this episode.
 So Isle of Man is somewhere on the planet Earth. I believe it's in England.
 And so anyways, there's this family living out there.
 They're called
 the
 Irvings.
 And it's a mother and a father and a little 12 year old girl.
 And they start to hear little voices. No, no, no, no. Let me back up here. So the dad's name
 is James. This is going to be a rough one, guys. Just just get through with this.
 We can get through this together. So the dad's name is James and they start hearing like these weird noises in their walls
 of this house in the 1930s. So it's not the most well put together house.
 And he keeps hearing these like noises and for whatever reason he decides like I'm going to start talking to these noises and figure out what they are.
 And he realizes that the noises change.
 So he begins like growling at the at one point there's like a growling come from the wall.
 He growls back and then it seems like the creature responds to him. So he's like, oh, that's interesting.
 So he's talking to the wall. He's talking to the wall for a while.
 You know, over the course of weeks and stuff like that.
 And like he would,
 if he growled the creature on the other side of the wall would make a similar growl. So then he's like started making other animal noises.
 And eventually he could name an animal and it would like if he goes chicken, it would go back back back back.
 And he goes every so often it sounded like it was a gurgling.
 Like it was trying to learn English. And and here's your this is where I say and you I'm sure you're saying as well.
 How do you how do you make gurgling? How do you equate that with having to learn English? Here's the thing. This story is so
 inconsistent.
 Because yeah, if you heard first off if you heard anything coming from your walls, you're taking a sledgehammer to it and strangling anything.
 On the other side, especially if it's making a bunch of animal noises. Eventually it does start talking though and introduces itself as Jeff.
 And I don't know it's spelled a g-e-f. I don't know if that's normal
 for Isle of Man or if the the mongoose is like spell it with a g and leave off an f.
 But anyways, so James Irving is like, oh, I got this hyper intelligent
 mongoose. Even he said he was a mongoose from New Delhi.
 And he's like Jeff's like, hey, I'm a mongoose
 from New Delhi. And so James begins talking to it.
 And it gets to the point. There's a bunch of weird stuff that goes on in the story. So anyways,
 the mother doesn't like Jeff and the Jeff.
 Or the mother doesn't like Jeff and Jeff doesn't like the mother so they don't interact much. But the young girl, she's 13. Her name is Vori.
 That's a bizarre name. So
 the the mongoose
 talks to Vori, talks to James and talks to Vori and Vori actually like
 Jeff will show himself to Vori.
 James only just he catches like fleeting glimpses of it.
 And he's basically like a total dick. Like he's and that's where he has the qualities of a poltergeist where he'd like throw stuff and be mean
 and he'd say like jacked up stuff to these people one time he called James Irving like a big fat potato head or something like that. And yeah, so
 at one point he Jeff is like
 really really like getting on
 Vori's nerves like in a creepy way in like a stalker way and and Vori's like i'm tired of Jeff. I'm tired of Jeff running around
 this house, you know, and i'm i'm seeing them and stuff and he's just being a dick to me.
 So the parents are like okay, well, let's see if we can figure out another room you can stay in.
 And Jeff doesn't like that.
 Okay, he didn't call him. Let me back up here.
 Because he didn't call him a big fat potato head. What he called him. So James was reading the newspaper very slowly.
 And Jeff wanted him to read it quickly for whatever reason. He said read it out. You f-
 Fat headed gnome.
 So i mean i well maybe fat, fat potato, fat potato head was funny. I don't know. But anyways
 Fat headed gnome is what he called James once. Anyways, Vori got sick and tired of him like
 dicking around with her. So the parents get together and they're like let's have a meeting
 and figure out what room to put you in that we can, you know, so you don't have to interact with Jeff much because you couldn't find him.
 And then like as they're having this meeting Jeff says i'll follow her wherever you put her.
 Which is creepy. Here's a little thing. So
 James at one point they're like
 We'll put you
 Vori you can sleep in your bedroom and we will barricade you
 In you like you can barricade yourself into your room. So when you sleep you don't have to like hear like
 Creepy mongoose noises while you're trying to sleep and here's a quote
 Soon we saw the top of the door bulging in as though some terrific force were thrusting against it. That's that's some um
 50 shades of gray shit right there
 Soon we saw the top of the door bulging in as though some terrific force were thrusting against it
 But the door held
 Then Jeff's queer
 Uh, yeah, this is probably good. I'm doing this episode then Jeff's queer
 Then and I know the word means weird, but then Jeff's queer high voice said i'm coming in
 a few seconds later a heavy pot of
 A few seconds later a heavy pot of ointment kept in the room crashed against the bedstead
 It should be bedstand, but whatever bedstead that might be a real thing in the isle of man
 But so he basically like when they were like stay out of our daughter's room
 He's like thrusting against the door and breaks his way in the door bulges and he has a queer high voice. So anyways
 He busted now, of course
 Vory ends up like kind of getting over her fear of
 Jeff and they kind of start living with it, but
 What happens is word gets out that there's this little
 Little mongoose guy running around this house talking mongoose and so of course paranormal investigators start showing up at the house and
 You know the neighboring town knew of it people in the area knew of Jeff the talking mongoose
 and
 And then these psychic investigators show up
 See what's up, and this should be your first clue something's going sideways with this story
 Nothing happens. They don't hear them
 They don't see them
 Nothing happens now
 Family would be like hey jeff say something
 say something
 nothing
 Now other psychic investigators would come out and they would hear jeff being like get him out of here
 He doesn't believe in spirits. I don't like him that knucklehead
 And they'd be like oh my god psychic investors like oh my god. I totally heard that
 At one point actually this was interesting so at one point like so there's this theory that poltergeist activity
 Is caused not by the spirit like poltergeist activity that between that and it goes is poltergeist is when stuff moves around your house
 like doors being open and stuff sliding around
 And there's a strong thrusting against your bedroom door that's generally classified as a poltergeist and there is a
 Scientist who came up with the theory
 That poltergeist activity is actually not
 Ghosts it is caused by mental anguish. It's basically more like psychokinesis than anything else like than that
 Than like a spooky spirit. It's more like
 Your mental your your basically your mental is leaving
 Like your mental anguish can't be contained in your body or in your brain. So it has to find another outlet. His name was
 Nam dude, that's a dope name. Sounds like the lord of the rings villain
 nandor
 Fodor maybe not a villain. He could actually be like anyone that could be the most normal guy in
 Lord of the Rings where does that take place middle earth?
 Nandor Fodor could like be the guy who delivers your mail, but in any other
 Universe he'd be the bad guy. So anyways, he came out
 And he had a couple interesting theories, but the main one was first he was like, uh, it's kind of kind of poltergeisty kind of not
 He ended up thinking that it was not generally poltergeist activity is caused by young kids going through adolescence
 And they're go have all this energy and it's like being expelled psychically
 His thing was I think it's the father. I think he had like all these great dreams and desires as a kid
 and now he's like locked in he got a woman pregnant. He's
 Just the husband and has a kid and all this stuff and he's just letting all the psychic energy out and so on and so forth
 Now a couple psychic investigators, like I said, didn't hear anything and some of them did some of them brought reporters and witnesses as witnesses nothing
 They couldn't hear anything. Now words started to spread
 That it was a hoax
 That it wasn't true
 At one point one of the psychic investigators was walking and he heard the voice
 He's like, oh my god, he heard the voice now. He's walking in the the father
 James is next to him and vori standing behind him and here's the voice being like he doesn't believe in the spirits
 and a psychic investigators like
 Uh, that voice came from right behind me where the little girl is who's following us and the father's like no, no, no, no
 It wasn't it wasn't it was it was the the little mongoose it ran into the walls
 And so that kind of really soured people on jeff because this fabled psychic investigator was like
 Yeah, I heard it. It was the little girl
 Eventually the family moved the Irving's moved and jeff didn't follow them
 They had no other reported
 dealings with jeff the james passed away and the the mom and the vori had to move away
 They actually had to sell the farm at a discount because the word in town that was that it was haunted
 No one wanted to buy this house at this haunted house
 Which I wouldn't have a problem with it, especially if he was kind of like a dope little
 Mongoose running around the new owner ended up buying the property
 The new owner ended up buying the property and maybe like a couple months a year or whatever later ended up shooting this giant
 mongoose
 This giant creature that was running around because there were mongooses in the area or mongies
 Some guy imported them. I could just just sit that in the beginning
 Some guy imported them to help
 Coal the rabbit population
 Anyways, the new owner of the house
 Shot a mongoose and he's like I killed jeff and vori now an adult was like that's not what he looked like and now the house is
 Burned down. There's been no jeff sightings
 Even in her old age vori
 Was like no it was totally true and I didn't like him and I wish he just left us alone
 So again, it's kind of weird. I can understand her saying no it is true
 And it was a whimsical fantasy of me hanging out with this talking mongoose or
 No, it was all fake and it sucked because it ended up ruining my life
 But she's stating that no it is real and it ruined my life like she basically
 She became no one as the fraud. I guess that would be a reason to
 Keep up keep it up if you didn't want to be considered more of a fraud. I don't know
 Do you think I remember my very first episode on this podcast all those months ago was about talking critters little talking animals
 And obviously not like jeff. They were about how
 animals communicate with each other, but
 I think for an animal to be oh and it could speak hebrouw and knew all these languages
 It was just such a it's such a weird if it's fake
 It seems like they made it overly complicated. They could have just said there's a creature in my walls
 That throw stuff or that even that's complicated. There's a creature in my wall that talks or makes noises or whatever
 Or it would if you're gonna fake it just say there's a ghost in your house
 But it wasn't just a talking animal. It was a talking mongoose
 Who came from new deli?
 and could throw things
 and could hear whispers like they were normal conversations and
 spoke several different languages it seems
 If it was a hoax, it seems like it was an elaborate hoax
 It's possible that they were the victims of the hoax
 But other people have said you know it went on for so long
 Either the entire family was in on it from the beginning
 Because they go the way that the house it's kind of cramped up
 That one person wouldn't be able to hoax the other people
 They did also say the way because you know the creeks on the wall
 I was saying the built the house wasn't built really well
 You could be on one floor talking to the wall and you would hear the sound somewhere else
 But the investigators who came out said everyone was in the same room
 But again actually now that I say that those are the times nobody heard it
 It's probably a hoax
 But no, there's no but to that. It very most likely is a hoax. However
 It would be awesome if it wasn't. It would be awesome if there was a little
 Like rap scallion mongoose who was running around your house being like listen to me fat head of gnome
 And like bulging your door open
 Maybe not the second part
 But yeah, jeff the talking mongoose
 Hoover the talking seal I found out about because I was researching jeff. This was the story and I should say this too
 jeff the talking mongoose was recommended to me by through email from a listener named antonio
 So thank you for that
 He I had heard about jeff a while back and kind of passed on the story because I was like, uh, and then I ended up
 But I said, you know, he sent this to me. I'll do some more research on it and
 There's a ton of stuff on jeff
 And they found like hair samples and there's like photos and stuff like that
 But again, they sent they like we found hair from jeff and they send it out to a lab and they go yeah, it's from
 a dog
 Or a cat or rat or whatever
 Same thing a little paw prints and there were mongooses in the area as well
 There's drawings of them if you find a drawing very convincing. It's not really evidence, but
 Jeff the talking mongoose. I wish you existed, but I think you are completely fake
 Let's move on to the next story here. So
 the next story
 is
 I'm going to talk about
 Some personal experiences I had
 at the Stanley hotel. It's a historically haunted hotel
 The story is that the Stephen King stayed there on the off season
 So his family were the only ones there and he had a nightmare about his son being chased down the
 hallway by a hose or something like that
 Then he's like i'm gonna write a book about that. I'm not a huge Stephen King fan
 I think his short stories are amazing, but his novels are just pretty wandery
 Go on and on and on but
 So anyways, there's you know, a lot of ghost hunter shows have gone there and it's just no one locally and
 nationally and internationally as this haunted location so
 At the time my mother was doing
 She worked for the national guard
 Helping veterans come when they're they're coming from Iraq or Afghanistan or really anywhere
 But generally it was coming from the hot zones
 So my mom was she worked for the national guard. That was her job
 So veterans would come back and she would help she ran these programs to help get them back into
 The groove of things so it was a lot of like family retreats and things like that to just kind of
 automate them to civilian life
 They're still they're still soldiers, but you know what I mean like now they're back to like having to pay bills and go to the movies and things like that
 And they do these big seminars. So one year they were having the seminar at the Stanley hotel
 And my mom I was in the area my mom said hey, do you want to go up to the Stanley hotel?
 We're going to be there for the weekend. We're going to be running like these workshops, but you can just run around the hotel
 I was like hell. Yeah, dude. You know, it's pretty dope
 So we go to the Stanley hotel
 And the first night I just decided to we were there for like
 Two days three nights or whatever the first night. I was like, you know what? I'm here. It's cold. There's snow everywhere
 I hate the snow
 And I was like, I'm just gonna like chill. I go tomorrow night
 I'll probably like walk around and look for ghosts and stuff like that
 But tonight we're just gonna chill and so I ended up watching for the very first time eastbound and down and I was laughing so hard
 That shows hilarious never heard of it before and I watched like six episodes
 They're doing like some marathon and showtime
 The next day I get up. I'm just kind of again walking around eating croissants, you know stuff
 You do normally hotels. I went for a walk around the hotel. It's just very normal place
 One thing I've noticed is that it's beautiful hotel was built like in 1907
 It's beautiful
 Like old school antique
 Really rich person hotel
 Just hardwood everywhere
 It's just it looks like you're walking around a giant mansion
 and
 In the middle of this like turn of the century built
 hotel
 There are these math. I mean massive like the size of a baby's head
 water mains like fire
 What are those things called
 Not necessarily like what are those fire sprinkler things was this? I mean like you be walking through this
 like
 Million dollar hotel and right above your head. There were these huge metal pipes running all it totally looked
 like half of it was
 Trump tower and then you look up slightly and you're like in the steerage section of titanic
 And you're like what it was weird because it was totally throwing off this vibe
 I'm thinking oh, you know, they probably just have to have like this world-class sprinkler system for
 You know because it's a fancy hotel. They don't it's maybe it's for insurance reasons
 I'd never been in a fancy hotel before I'd been in like
 I don't know
 I always thought holiday in was nice. So
 The next day I'm just kind of walking around exploring stuff walking but not like super exploring stuff like I said I was eating croissants
 And that night I said, you know what so now it's the second night
 I was like I'm gonna like just walk around and the place was
 packed
 Because it was winners for people were up skiing
 They had all the national guard people there not all of them obviously, but you know a bunch of national guard people there and their families
 Oh, oh, oh, so so this is when it started to get weird. So the whole thing is
 Ghost based around ghost tours and stuff like that
 Which is really not what I'd want to hear if I just came back from Iraq
 Being here about these tortured soul. They're like this person died a horrible death
 And now he's doomed to walk the planet and you're like
 I just watched a Hummer get blown up in front of me like three weeks ago
 I don't want to hear about this stuff and there were complaints about that afterwards people were like
 Don't ever have another seminar here all they ever talk about at the hotel
 Like all the tours are based around like people dying
 But he was so I go on the ghost tour
 During the day and they're like the tour guides this very attractive young woman and she's like
 Oh, this is the ballroom where sometimes you'll see like a ghost at 3 a.m
 Dancing around that I'm like, uh, and they're like this is this hallway and this is the door. This is room 237
 This is where Stephen King stayed or 217 or whatever
 This is where Stephen King stayed and this is from the movie and everyone's like, oh
 Then we go to this one room
 And she's like this room is haunted because inside this walk-in closet
 There's a ghost of a randy old man
 And if women walk in there, he'll feel you up
 He'll like grab your you know, he'll like tickle you or grab your butt or whatever
 And I'm like, uh, and she goes any volunteers that go in
 And this 13 year old girl goes all go in and the tour guides demeanor totally changes
 Before you know, she's dressed up in like this old school like colonial costume or 1900s costume, whatever
 And she's like been super bright and vibrant and she's talking about like this creepy pervert ghost in this closet
 Who grabs women and the little girl goes all go in and the tour guides demeanor completely changes
 She goes you have to be over 18 to enter the closet
 So I remember thinking okay
 What like if this is totally fake
 Why would it matter how old the person was because whoever goes in there?
 It's the power of suggestion. They're gonna go in there and they're gonna be come out and be like he touched my butt
 But if if there really is a perverted old man living in that closet
 You don't want to send a minor into that room
 I remember thinking they totally changed the color of the whole tour because before it was like
 You want to hear some campfire ghost stories and then after that it was like
 Stay away from the men to stay away from the old man with the candy. I was like, what?
 And I was like that's that's a weird thing you think I mean, maybe you don't want a 13 year old girl going in there
 And then coming out being like mommy mommy he touched me like even the power suggestion works
 But it's kind of I was like well, that's a weird reaction and that was just the beginning
 So that night I'm walking around the hotel by myself and it's probably around 10 o'clock at night
 And I wasn't like a big nerd and have my camera or my infrared scope or anything like that
 I might have had my I don't think I had a smartphone back then but you know, I wasn't like I'm gonna find me some ghost
 I'm gonna prove
 These exist. I just kind of wanted to walk around late at night in this creepy hotel because it is admittedly quite creepy
 And I get I'm walking down the hallways and I see
 Here talk about taking the boob hill guys. I see these four coeds
 Sitting kind of hanging outside their hotel room kind of chatting it up and I walk by and there's some guys
 They're like, hey, baby. What's up? Not to me to the girls
 So that would be a totally different story
 So I kind of walk around the hotel. I come back maybe 30 40 minutes later and they're still out there
 And I walk up to him. I'm like, hey, what's up? And they're like, oh nothing
 And they go, what are you doing? I was like, oh, you know, I'm just kind of exploring the hotel and stuff like that
 Of course, we started talking about ghosts because that's really why people come there
 So I just sit down there and I'm we're kind of just sitting on the floor outside their hotel room
 Two of the girls are kind of coming in and out and then the other two girls are staying out there the whole time
 We're just talking and stuff like that and one of the girl goes, you know, it's weird
 Before you showed up we kept hearing this noise in this door down
 The way like we can hear the alarm clock going off really loudly
 I'm like, well, that's not that weird and and she goes. Yeah, but what's weird is that?
 Why isn't anyone
 Acknowledging it like you think if the person in the room was asleep
 They shut off the alarm
 But at the very least the people in the neighboring rooms should be complaining because it's really really loud
 and I was like
 That's interesting. Yeah, let's go check that out and they're like, yeah, really? I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Let's go. You know, I used to hunt ghosts and something. Yeah
 So we get up and we go down the hallway
 And I you can clearly hear this loud ass eat
 Eat the most annoying noise in the world is an alarm clock. You can't shut off
 Eat eat eat and it's very clear when you're standing outside the door
 And again, I'm thinking well, it could just be that the alarm clock's going off
 And I'm talking to the girls and I was like, it could just be the alarm clock's going off and
 Nobody knows that it's on and that the the walls are fairly thick
 at this point one of the girls
 kind of leans to the door
 and I think she went to test the handle or something like that and
 She it doesn't open
 She let's go the handle and we're talking there for a bit more and then the handle turns on its own
 Like someone's trying to get out
 So at that point we realized that either one of two things have happened
 There was either somebody in there and they thought someone was turning the knob to get in
 Or there wasn't someone in there and something was turning the knob to get out
 So we kind of like did a Scooby-Doo run
 Back down to where their room was and I was like, oh my god, that's totally terrifying
 But again, I'm thinking, you know, completely
 understandable
 Then we got in our brain to break into a janitor's closet. It was so bizarre
 That okay, that's standard Jason stuff
 And I remember there's this janitor closet. Oh the light was on in the janitor closet. That's why and again now
 We're like at midnight and I go that's weird the the lights on the janitor's. I don't know why I thought it was weird
 I think I was just saying stuff to impress chicks
 But I was like, you know, the janitor's lights on I wonder if there's something spooky in there
 And they go, oh, yeah, let's check it out. So we go now we're back on their floor
 I actually the whole thing the doorknob down the way also took place on their floor and the alarms clock did stop
 Going off after a certain point, but again alarm clocks electricity stuff turns on and off doorknobs
 Maybe when she turned the doorknob and let go and then we were talking maybe she tightened it and then undid itself
 There's rational explanations for a lot of this not all of it
 I remember I was thinking. Oh, you know, we should break into this janitor's closet
 I used to be a real hooligan back in the day. I didn't have a problem with like breaking into stuff
 So and I remember I want to impress these girls and I thought you know what I should do
 I should pull out like my credit card and like try to jimmy the door thing
 And it's not going to work. It never works because the way that the lock is it's
 The smooth part is on the other side on the your main part on the outside part. It's like the rectangle and on the inside
 It's the little
 Half moon shape thing
 And I thought but you know, I'm gonna try it'll be kind of cool
 Like to look make it look like I'm a burglar or something
 That wasn't far from the truth at the time
 But and I pulled out my credit card and I remember I stuck it in knowing full well it wouldn't work
 And it worked
 And I so I'm like in front of these girls and as a care I got this
 Pulling out my credit card knowing that I was just going to jiggle it around for a bit and then be like
 I must be one of the special lugs
 I pulled my credit card out
 I slide it against the lock and it goes click click and I was like holy shit now. Maybe that's not paranormal
 Maybe that's just me being a pimp
 But again, I or a badly designed door, but I thought that was really weird. It shouldn't happen
 The the janitor's closet was not haunted by the way
 But as the night progress you're like Jason you're just
 This random stuff. This is the creepy thing. So I'm sitting there with the girls and now we're probably around
 I don't know midnight one o'clock and I say, you know the scariest stuff supposedly happens at 3 a.m
 The witch's hour and they're like, oh really? Oh and I asked them. Why are you ladies here?
 Why are you it's spring break? That's okay. Yeah, I remember now was happening during spring break
 But there was snow everywhere. I guess it was in colorado. So there's always snow everywhere, but
 I go so why are you guys here? Like, why aren't you guys like on a beach and spring break? Oh, I should add if they were all
 really really hot
 I go, why are you guys here and not like at a beach somewhere and they go?
 Oh, we just wanted to go and see a bunch of ghosts and I'm thinking I said
 That's how horror movies start like going four hot girls going together
 To like a haunted like a purposely haunted location. You know how many horror movies start like that and they're like, oh
 They didn't make ghost noises, but I mean, you know because they were hot and I'm telling them are hot, but anyways
 So we're sitting there and I said let's stay up till
 I don't know how many people are still listening to this episode, but
 We're sitting there
 It's and I said let's stay up until 3 a.m. Now at this point two of the girls were like, you know what?
 We're tired. We're gonna go to bed but the other two girls were and at this point
 We're just chatting about all sorts of stuff their room was right on the corner
 So it was right next to us the staircase one of many staircases in the building
 And we're sitting there and we're talking and the girl who's sitting closest to the stairs goes
 Did you hear that?
 I see her kind of look over the awning and she goes
 Did you hear that me and the other girl are like, what did you hear and she goes?
 someone she was just walking up those stairs, but
 Like they stopped halfway and there's no one down there and I'm like what?
 The other girl would kind of look over that ledge and there's nobody down there
 It's like three or four flights of stairs and there's more stairs going up
 So maybe about an hour later
 We're all sitting there. We're talking
 And we all hear
 Someone walking up the stairs and you could hear like the
 Going up and the stairs don't seem to make that much noise when people normally walk on them
 But you can hear like the creak of each stair getting closer and closer
 And we're like what what was that?
 And then I think about an hour
 It happened again, maybe a half hour later. We hear the
 But now it's the flight
 Like so there's a flight of stairs a landing and then another flight of stairs and a landing a flight of stairs and a landing
 It's on the landing that we should be able if it's on the landing directly below us
 So it's like let's say 10 steps up
 Landing then 10 steps up that second 10 steps up is where we're at
 We hear a go
 Like slowly though, I'm not going to prolong it again and it goes up the landing we hear a
 Very clearly
 Like we're dead silent. We heard the walking earlier
 From floor to the floor underneath us and now we're hearing it at our landing basically
 Like below us
 And we're looking and there's nothing there. We clearly hear someone breathing
 And I remember thinking it had gone an hour long intervals
 So I think it was midnight the first time we heard it at the bottom of the stairs and then it was one
 And now it was two and we heard it on that landing and I thought it's happening. I told him I go it's happening every hour
 So whatever is doing this it's taking its time, but I said that means at 3 a.m
 It will be where we're at
 And I was like do you guys want to stay up till 3 a.m. And they're like hell yeah, dude
 We're almost there and we're sitting we're talking
 and then um having a good old time and sure enough
 I
 Walking up the stairs
 And then we don't hear anything
 It's not breathing in front of us. There's no jump scare. No big ghost
 And then we're like, okay, we're going to bed like whatever had whatever was walking had gotten to our floor
 Was where we would have been
 We didn't hear it walking past us
 We didn't look in the mirror and it say help me or anything creepy. It was just this weird
 Exhaired audio experience that we had
 And so we're like, okay, that was weird again. You don't know what's gonna happen
 We didn't know if we were all gonna get like taken to some hell dimension or something like that. Obviously it didn't happen
 Unless the hell dimension is where your friends forget it's your birthday
 however
 I said au revoir to the beautiful young women and went back to my room the next day though
 I was walking around the
 Hotel getting more croissants and there was a starbucks in there too. Oh, no, no, it wasn't a starbucks
 It was a normal coffee shop. So it sucked and
 I was talking to the guy
 We had the counter just like a you know a dude working a job
 I said, hey, what is it with all of these big pipes? I go you got this such a nice hotel
 The wire these giant water like water pipes. They totally ruins the vibe
 He looks at me and he goes
 Happy birthday jay. I was joking. He looks at me and he says
 You know how many fires get started in this place? He goes nobody knows why he goes there's fires everywhere in this place
 And so we have to have a state-of-the-art
 fire suppression system to stop it
 Everyone so the Stanley hotel sits above a town
 And I go, you know is do you think it's ghosts causing these fires and he looks at me and he says everyone in the town
 Has either been injured or know someone who's been injured at this hotel
 The people who live in town wouldn't care if this entire place burned down someday
 And then we my coffee
 I think that's an interesting button on that story because we hear like oh the spooky legends of this place
 But if you lived in the shadow
 Of a building that if it is truly haunted and it's the main source of your economy
 You would have people go. Hey, I'm gonna go get a job at
 Stanley. Yeah, I finally got my job and people would be like don't work there, honey
 Don't work there. You know what happened to your uncle. You know what happened to bruce. You know what happened to tina
 But that's really the only job in town
 It almost is like this shining-esque prison for the people there
 They have these mysterious fires and these
 Hauntings and these accidents and these injuries that don't see that's one thing you can sell people on come stay at our hotel
 It's spooky. You can't sell people on come stay at our hotel
 The people who work here get injured very very often you wouldn't have that
 You wouldn't put that in your brochure. So if people were like working on something like working on a ladder
 And the ladder gets knocked out from underneath them and they fall down and break their arm
 They're gonna quit because there'll be like there's I was the only one in that hallway
 Or some if a maid's cleaning a room and she turns around and a dresser's on fire
 She's going to be like i'm out of here. You're not going to put that stuff in your brochure
 You're going to talk about the spooky ghosts that float around in the ballroom
 Or the room that steven king wrote his
 Stories in but if the guy who worked there if he you know wasn't pulling my leg
 And I don't necessarily think he he he was because I was it was such an odd quack
 I asked him about the water mains and he just was like oh, this is why
 Rather than just being a barista and being like I don't know
 Other than the tour guides and the people being part of the hotel everyone else to them
 It was just a job. It wasn't this spooky adventure. They were on
 It was just them showing up to work. So when they're just like
 This place is cursed. It's not fun haunted
 People get injured here and the people in town wish this place would just be destroyed. That's different than
 You know wearing a colonial costume telling people to go into the closet full of the creepy pervert man
 I wouldn't go back there
 I got that sense of
 Negative energy from that place
 I've went there once
 I would not spend another night at the stanley hotel. That's my personal read on it
 I do think that I think I think it's you're very likely to get injured there
 And very likely for it. You're that world class fire suppression system to kick in
 I don't think it's a fun haunted place like say the winchester mystery house
 I think it's something much more sinister than that if you get the opportunity to go you you might want to take it but
 You know
 You might want to sleep with your eyes open and not go into your closet
