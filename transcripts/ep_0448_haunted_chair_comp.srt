1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
 A young woman in Portland finds herself face to face with paranormal evil.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,920
 And then we wrap up season 9 with a personal story from my past.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,180
 A mystery called The Haunted Chair.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,600
 [Music]

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,880
 Yeah, you guys heard that right. This is the end of season 9.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
 Sorry I haven't been announcing it all week.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,040
 It kind of crept up on me, honestly.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,720
 So next week I'm taking a week off.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,560
 We will have a series of reruns.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,080
 I've already chosen the episodes.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,040
 It's a theme week.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,640
 It's one of my favorite theme weeks.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
 So we'll have that and then we'll be coming back the week after that for the start of season 10.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
 So I thank you guys so much for sticking along on this journey.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
 Now this episode is called Jam Pack Full of Stuff.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
 I'm just pushing. Give me this story right here.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,920
 Put that, you, you, come here, come here.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,520
 Put you in there.

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,880
 Also, if you haven't noticed, I just got done working out.

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,800
 I'm sure you've noticed my physique, but I'm a little more amped up than normal.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 But it is a Friday episode.

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,880
 I literally just jumped off of my Tony Little Gazelle glider.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
 I'm ready to record this episode.

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,320
 Normally I take a shower before my episodes to relax, but there's no time to relax.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,200
 Come here, story.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
 Get in there.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
 Here we go.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,240
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon, A Pack of Wild Asians.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
 A pack of Wild Asians.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,160
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,200
 Really, really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,720
 You are going to be our pilot this hyper frantic episode.

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,800
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,400
 You know what I'm going to say and I mean it.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,040
 Just go ahead and get the word out about the show.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
 That helps tremendously.

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,800
 Word of mouth helps the show grow.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,920
 So if you can't support us financially, support us with your mouth, with vocalizations, or,

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,560
 you know, typing, typing on computer.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,760
 You guys are already irritated by the workout, Jason, but

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,280
 A Pack of Wild Asians, let's hop into Jason Jollopi first off because we're leaving Hood River.

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,600
 We're driving to Portland, Oregon.

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,160
 Now, this is a story from Reddit and I talked to the Redditor who wrote this story.

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
 Her name is Break Your Neck For Me, Baby.

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,760
 But I got to do this and she seems fairly nice.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,120
 She seems fairly sincere.

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,320
 But again, when we're covering the story, I do have to say and it's no insult to her,

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
 but this story may be made up, right?

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,520
 This is a single person's account of a story.

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,080
 It could be a lark, could be a delusion, could be a lot of things.

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,960
 And that is from every Bigfoot story to her story.

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,320
 I'm just saying that off the bat.

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,240
 But I think it's an interesting story.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,000
 Again, I can't 100% say it's true, but let's take a look at this.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
 A pack of wild Asians, let's drive through the empty streets of Portland because

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,560
 things are kind of springing back to life here.

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,320
 The lockdowns are starting to end.

62
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,840
 But we have the streets to our self.

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
 We're just kind of driving through deer, eating grass that's growing out of the sidewalk,

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,240
 mountain lion on the top of a skyscraper looking at him.

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,960
 The perfect hunting ground.

66
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
 Only I can now get down.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,880
 It's like having to walk down 50 flights of stairs.

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
 Goes out, all the deers are gone.

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,880
 We're driving to...

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,440
 This is the thing that made this story pop out to me.

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,800
 Because I get a ton of stories and I see a ton of stories online.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
 That's very vague.

73
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,120
 I was at my grandma's house.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
 I mean, not saying that your grandma's house is vague.

75
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,920
 It's all blurry.

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,280
 You're like, "Grandma, I can't find you."

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,880
 But specifics always...

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,480
 I like, I always like specifics.

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
 And we have a specific address for this event.

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
 It's 1909 West Burnside Street.

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
 Now, there's a car wash there.

82
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,760
 It used to be a Kiss car wash.

83
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
 Now it's a Caddy car wash.

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,160
 What is also interesting about this story is, as I was reading,

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,600
 I've been to Portland a total of four times in my life.

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
 I live an hour away.

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
 I've been to Portland only four times outside of going to the airport.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,120
 Out of those four times, and that's spread across eight years,

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
 out of those four times, I went to this place.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,040
 I went to this place in January.

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
 Coincidence?

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
 100% coincidence.

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,280
 I wasn't being drawn by the benevolent evil.

94
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,680
 But I found that weird when I was reading it.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,200
 I go, "I know this place."

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 I walked by it in January.

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,680
 Been in Portland four times.

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,760
 If you don't know, Portland's a pretty big city.

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,360
 So 1909...

100
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
 I was not going to the car wash.

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
 I was going to the Chipotle.

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,720
 But it actually, it's funny.

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
 I love Chipotle.

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
 It's my favorite restaurant in the world.

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,480
 If there was a Chipotle in town, I would quit keto in a heartbeat

106
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
 and just eat one burrito a day.

107
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
 I'd stick to my diet that way.

108
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,280
 So Chipotle, please come to our town, eat fresh.

109
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,200
 But I have to go to Portland to get Chipotle.

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,360
 That's how much I love Chipotle.

111
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,640
 We walked down this street, Burnside Street.

112
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,720
 And my spidey senses were tingling the whole time.

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
 Like, I grew up in bad neighborhoods.

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,600
 I know bad neighborhoods.

115
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
 I was like, "This is bad neighborhood."

116
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,560
 It's one of those neighborhoods that's trying to fix itself up.

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
 But you know, it's like the Doberman Pinscher.

118
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
 Is that even a meme dog anymore?

119
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,760
 Isn't it now, "Don't you kids, don't you kids,

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,320
 talk about those pit bulls and stuff."

121
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,600
 When I was a kid, Doberman Pinscher was the most dangerous dog

122
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,320
 because they pinch you.

123
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,000
 They take a Doberman Pinscher and you can cover and make up all day long.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
 It's still a Doberman Pinscher.

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,760
 So that's kind of what this neighborhood looks like.

126
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,560
 So walking down the street, my spidey senses were tingling.

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,600
 I'm constantly looking around.

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,640
 But so that gave me, and I still, I finished walking the two miles

129
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,440
 to get the Chipotle.

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
 But we walked past this car wash.

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,880
 So when "Break Your Neck For Me Baby" was talking about this,

132
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
 I go, "This, there might be something to this.

133
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,280
 There might be something to this."

134
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,160
 So let's take it.

135
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,080
 That was all preamble just to let you know that it's not the best neighborhood.

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,480
 Actually, historically, it wasn't the best neighborhood.

137
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,040
 They tried to develop a tram system for it.

138
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,920
 Back in like the 1920s, no one would write it.

139
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,360
 Businesses had a hard time.

140
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
 Like back when the city was being founded,

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,800
 people did not want to work or live on this street.

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
 It was just a bunch of like low life businesses,

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
 and that's where all the sailors hung out,

144
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
 tons of prostitution, stuff like that.

145
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,480
 So that's your background for Burnside Street.

146
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
 If you're a realtor in that area,

147
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,040
 sue "Break Your Neck For Me Baby."

148
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,400
 And sue "Get a Time Machine" and sue the past.

149
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
 It's just not the greatest area.

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,240
 So that, the stage has been set.

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
 A pack of wild Asians.

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
 Let's take this chase in July.

153
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,040
 But we're going to park it at this car wash.

154
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,600
 Now this is the story that has been told.

155
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
 There's this young woman.

156
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
 She's eating a snack in her car.

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,840
 It's late at night.

158
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,080
 Now normally she parks here or parks anywhere,

159
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
 and she's on her phone.

160
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,760
 She's goofing off, and she's eating food,

161
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,240
 and she's throwing the wrappers in the backseat of her car.

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,520
 Which, as disgusting as it is, we all do that, right?

163
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,040
 That's pretty typical, right?

164
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,720
 Maybe it's an age thing.

165
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
 Maybe it's owning a car thing.

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
 I don't have a car anymore,

167
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
 so I have nowhere to throw my stuff.

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,040
 But I used to do that too.

169
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
 I used to just throw stuff in the backseat.

170
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
 And then once a month or two months I'd clean my backseat out.

171
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
 So anyways, that's what her normal routine was.

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,920
 But something different happened this night.

173
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,800
 It was about 10 p.m.

174
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
 This story takes place in August of 2017.

175
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,440
 She gets it in her head that I'm going to throw the stuff away.

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
 And you're like, Jason, that's a good instinct.

177
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
 She's being clean.

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,840
 And I'm like, yeah, it's good, but out of character.

179
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,640
 And she doesn't really know why this thought process

180
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
 kicks in her head.

181
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,760
 But she's parked at this car wash at 10 p.m.

182
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,600
 And again, it's not the greatest neighborhood.

183
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
 But she goes, I should throw this stuff away.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
 Instead of just throwing it over my shoulder,

185
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'm going to throw it away.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,320
 Now, the place isn't super well lit,

187
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,720
 but there's a McDonald's right across the street from it.

188
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
 And then there's Chipotle on the other side of it.

189
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 So it wasn't pitch black either.

190
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,400
 So she gets out of her car and she walks with her garbage.

191
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,840
 Throws it in the garbage can.

192
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,920
 And she's still looking at her phone.

 [MAKING BOOPING NOISE]

194
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,240
 And she finds herself kind of--

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
 She doesn't actually know what's going on at first.

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,200
 She says she's just looking at her phone.

197
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,960
 And then she hears the sound of gravel underfoot.

198
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,160
 And that's when she realized her car was farther away.

199
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
 She'd been walking backwards.

200
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
 After she threw the garbage away,

201
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,040
 she found herself walking backwards into the darkness

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
 of the car wash.

203
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,440
 And what had happened was she had started walking up a gravel hill,

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
 a slight incline of a gravel hill.

205
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
 So she's covered a considerable distance.

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
 It's not a couple of football fields,

207
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,680
 but farther than you want to be from your car in the dark.

208
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,240
 The lights of the McDonald's seem muted, seem gone.

209
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,760
 Everything seems much darker than it was just a few minutes ago.

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,280
 And as she's kind of getting a bearing for her surroundings,

211
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,440
 this is a heavily populated area,

212
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,520
 but everything seems darker now.

213
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,800
 Everything seems off.

214
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,520
 And her head slowly cranes to one side,

215
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,120
 and underneath a grove of trees, there's an old shack.

216
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,960
 About 100 feet away from where she's standing.

217
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,360
 Shack door.

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,160
 She gets a sudden urge.

222
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
 She needs to leave the area.

223
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,280
 What she's looking at isn't necessarily paranormal.

224
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,800
 There really could be a shack behind a car wash.

225
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,360
 You can look at aerial photos of this car.

226
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,800
 Also, don't harass the car wash,

227
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
 because I don't think they have anything to do with this.

228
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
 I don't think it's some elaborate marketing scheme they have.

229
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
 So don't find Caddy Car Wash and call them up and be like,

230
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,280
 "Hey, can I visit your horrible cabin?"

231
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,160
 She sees this cabin.

232
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
 Now, again, there's nothing paranormal about that,

233
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,680
 but she gets this horrible instinct to get out of there.

234
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
 Like, she just feels it in her gut.

235
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,600
 I have to leave.

236
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,640
 I have to run in my car.

237
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
 So she takes off.

238
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,720
 She leaves behind the cabin.

239
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
 She leaves behind the grove of trees.

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,800
 She gets to her car.

241
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
 This is the part where the story does start to get suspicious, honestly.

242
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,200
 But she gets to the car, and she has an intense desire right then and there

243
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,280
 in this car wash area to take a nap, to fall asleep.

244
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,040
 And as she said, she had some comfy blankets.

245
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
 I also think of that she might, and again,

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
 break your neck from me, baby.

247
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
 I hope this doesn't...

248
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
 I get the feeling that at the time of the story,

249
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,080
 she may not have had a place to stay.

250
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,720
 The fact that she's hanging, and I could be wrong on that,

251
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
 because I didn't ask that personal question,

252
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,400
 but she may not have had a place to stay,

253
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,320
 or maybe not a place to stay that night.

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,600
 But she said she had blankets in the back,

255
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,160
 and that's not...

256
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
 I've been homeless before, too.

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,080
 That's not a knock.

258
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
 I've lived in my car twice.

259
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
 Not two nights, like for two prolonged periods of time,

260
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
 just because I had lost an apartment, and stuff like that.

261
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,040
 So, things like that are gonna happen.

262
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
 But she's in her car.

263
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,600
 Now, again, just seeing the cabin isn't a paranormal activity,

264
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
 because there's not a cabin back there.

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,600
 There is not an old man cabin back there.

266
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
 As far as I could tell, I was looking at satellite photos.

267
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
 There are trees, but I could not find creepy old cabin.

268
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,160
 Type that in at Google.

269
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,440
 This address does not pop up.

270
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
 But if you just saw a cabin in a business,

271
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
 you go, "Oh, it's a supply shack," or something like that.

272
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,680
 That, in and of itself, may or may not be paranormal.

273
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
 What happens next connects everything.

274
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
 But what happens next is a dream.

275
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,880
 So, that is where you can go,

276
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,200
 "Oh, Jason, are you really telling us a dream story?"

277
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
 Let's go ahead and finish this.

278
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,520
 She crawls in the backseat of her car.

279
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,800
 She goes to sleep.

280
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,240
 And she says...

281
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
 She says what she begins to have,

282
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
 or what it would be like to have a dream.

283
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
 Could only be described as nightmares.

284
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,080
 And they're all connected to this cabin.

285
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,560
 Her walking up the hill and her seeing the cabin

286
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,800
 was not a dream.

287
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
 That all physically happened.

288
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
 She comes back to the car.

289
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
 She has an overwhelming need to sleep.

290
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,000
 Even getting out of the car was out of character for her.

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,960
 She's normally just slob.

292
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,560
 And she throws stuff over her shoulder.

293
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
 She crawls back into her car and she goes to sleep.

294
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,200
 She begins having dreams of an old man in that cabin.

295
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
 Doing horrible, horrible things to young girls.

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,040
 She's just getting these images of this man doing these things.

297
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,320
 And then the dream ends with the image of the shack.

298
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,800
 So, once again, she's looking at the shack underneath this grove of trees.

299
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,840
 At the end of this horrible nightmare of all of these visions,

300
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,200
 it ends with...

301
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,880
 The shack underneath the trees, 1909 West Burnside.

302
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,160
 And the door...

 Opens wider and wider.

305
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:13,520
 Until the only thing she can see inside of the cabin is a giant eyeball.

306
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,800
 The eyeball of that old hideous man doing those horrible things,

307
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,240
 staring out of that cabin directly into her.

308
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,920
 She wakes up and gets in the front seat, drives away.

309
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,880
 She knew she had some friends in the area, so she went to go see her friends a couple blocks away.

310
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,080
 She jumps out, she's talking to her friends.

311
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,480
 Again, this is another reason why I'm thinking they might have been like street kids or something like that.

312
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,080
 But maybe they were just having coffee.

313
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,560
 I don't know.

314
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,920
 But she pulls over, she jumps out of the car, she's talking to her friends.

315
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,080
 She then hears a girl scream out loud around the corner.

316
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,600
 Like a blood curdling scream of a young girl.

317
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,080
 She takes off from her group of friends, turns the corner.

318
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,200
 Friends follow her, turn the corner.

319
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
 She's on the ground, full seizure.

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
 She wakes up in the hospital.

321
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,400
 She believes that that land is cursed.

322
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,520
 And really if you look at the history, and that's why I was giving that little history lesson in the beginning,

323
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,720
 a lot of sex trafficking, a lot of sex trafficking back then, and according to some people that I saw online,

324
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,400
 a lot of sex trafficking today.

325
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
 I'm not saying that the car wash has anything to do with this.

326
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
 So I'm not saying that.

327
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
 Just the area is known for sex trafficking.

328
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
 Some people say that young women are snatched off the street.

329
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
 But anyway, so there's that stuff.

330
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,720
 People say that stuff's still going on.

331
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
 It definitely went on historically.

332
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,680
 So it wouldn't be a shock if the land had been infused with some sort of dark energy.

333
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,520
 I would actually be shocked if it wasn't infused with that.

334
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,200
 So you do have that dream element.

335
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,800
 And the dream element kind of adds in the connects the two,

336
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
 connects the scream of the ending to the cabin.

337
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,440
 It's also possible, again, I'm not knocking her if she didn't make it up.

338
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,400
 If it's just a fictional story, then it's a fictional story.

339
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,120
 And I got duped.

340
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
 It could also be a fictional story, but she doesn't even know it's fictional.

341
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,360
 It's possible that she saw the cabin that was real, or she did see that part of it.

342
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,280
 And then when she had the seizure, which was supposedly real as well,

343
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,800
 she was in the hospital that can backtrack and create the memories of the dreams as well.

344
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
 Because the brain's a tricky thing.

345
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,560
 Doesn't necessarily work in a linear fashion.

346
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
 So there's a lot of ways we can debunk this.

347
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,760
 But I think it's terrifying.

348
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,720
 It actually includes one of the things I find most terrifying,

349
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,280
 portals.

350
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
 If long time listeners of the show know I hate portals.

351
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
 Portals are one of my biggest fears.

352
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,040
 It's funny because yesterday's episode also was another one of my biggest fears.

353
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
 I find being trapped in a mental hospital absolutely terrifying.

354
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
 Not even like in a straight jacket in a padded room.

355
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,080
 That whatever.

356
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
 Because then I'm so crazy.

357
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,840
 Or I'm the idea of being trapped in a mental hospital and walking through the hallways

358
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,520
 and like going through the routine like doing crossword puzzles every day and eating

359
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,480
 oatmeal or porridge or whatever they had on it.

360
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,760
 They might have real food in there.

361
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,040
 But that terrifies me because it's the normalcy of it.

362
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,080
 If I was in a straight jacket eventually I would just go insane.

363
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,320
 And I'd be like, "Oh, this is just the way things are."

364
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,680
 But if I was sane, I mean I am sane.

365
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,320
 But if I had to wake up every morning and walk to the red call,

366
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,440
 watch the prices right, walk back to my room,

367
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,080
 take my pills, walk to do the crossword puzzle room.

368
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,240
 That is terrifying to me.

369
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,520
 I think I would prefer to be in prison than a mental hospital.

370
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,680
 Because it's tries to still, I imagine them super bright all the time.

371
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,840
 And it makes everything more normal.

372
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,520
 So to me it makes it more creepy.

373
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,960
 So a portal that took me into a mental hospital would honestly be the creepiest thing for me.

374
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,200
 But I find this story interesting because one,

375
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,600
 the history of the area connects with what she saw.

376
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,680
 And we were talking a bit, she didn't really know the history of the area.

377
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,520
 Again, that's what she's saying.

378
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,760
 I could be getting duped, but that's just something that's going to happen with the show.

379
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,960
 The history of the area connects with the phenomenon.

380
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,960
 You have the dream segment, which is a little goofy.

381
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,920
 I normally don't report dreams, but it's sandwiched in between her being led out of her car.

382
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,280
 A young woman led out of her car into the darkness to the shack that preyed on young women.

383
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,080
 We have that aspect.

384
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,200
 Then we have her seizure later on as she turns the corner.

385
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
 She hears the young girl screaming.

386
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,400
 Interesting story all around.

387
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,240
 And again, I'm not telling you to go to Caddy and start calling him up.

388
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,440
 But if you're looking for a day trip ghost hunting adventure, there you go.

389
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,960
 You don't have to drive out in the middle of nowhere.

390
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,560
 You're like, Jason, didn't you just say this wasn't a great neighborhood?

391
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,520
 Think about it.

392
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,800
 You can get your car washed.

393
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,840
 You can poke around the back.

394
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,000
 You can see if there's any haunted shacks.

395
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,320
 And you can buy Chipotle, a delicious Chipotle.

396
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
 And you got to bring me one too.

397
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,680
 Chipotle, eat fresh.

398
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,440
 Thank you so much for that story.

399
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,160
 I did find that one kind of particularly creepy.

400
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,080
 It went on a very long time.

401
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,960
 I didn't expect that.

402
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,920
 This is going to be a long episode.

403
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,640
 It's the end of the season.

404
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,760
 It's going to be a long episode.

405
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,120
 And to make it even longer, I want to do a dead rabbit recommend.

406
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
 So a pack of Wild Asians.

407
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,440
 Let's flip out that plasma screen we have in the back of the Jason Jalopy.

408
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,800
 Now we got to park the car.

409
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,760
 We are at the car wash.

410
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,480
 Let's get in the back.

411
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,080
 And we're going to watch this plasma screen.

412
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,040
 I just watched this movie called Butterfly Kisses.

413
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,920
 It's really good.

414
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,080
 Butterfly Kisses is the story.

415
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,800
 It's very meta, which I liked.

416
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,400
 And it was really, really good.

417
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
 It's a found foot.

418
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,880
 It's a documentary about a filmmaker who finds found footage.

419
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,760
 It's not a real documentary.

420
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,240
 So you have a man who finds some found footage that these college students had made

421
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,440
 involving this local myth called Peeping Tom or the Blink Man, Mr. Blink.

422
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,160
 That was interesting because in the movie, the people in town all had different names for him.

423
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
 That's pretty common with local legends.

424
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,840
 Like the older people called him Blink or Mr. Blink.

425
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
 The younger people were calling him Peeping Tom.

426
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,840
 So that was a really cool little added detail.

427
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:19,040
 So this guy finds a shoebox full of old DV tapes from 2004 about the story of these

428
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,080
 college students trying to investigate Peeping Tom.

429
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,680
 And this guy's trying to raise money to release his movie.

430
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,800
 So he gets like a friend of his, is making it like a documentarian.

431
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 So he goes, "Why don't you make a documentary behind the scenes about me putting this movie together?"

432
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,400
 It was really, really interesting because you get to the point where

433
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,200
 there's basically three plots and they're all done really, really well.

434
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
 Very good ending to the movie.

435
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,080
 You have the plot where we're watching the original found footage movie.

436
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,960
 You have the plot of the director.

437
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,600
 And then you have the plot of the film crew, the documentary film crew,

438
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,160
 who they're starting to think that the guy who finds the tapes, the director, is losing his mind.

439
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,440
 And they're like, "Should we keep making this documentary?"

440
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
 Like that guy's kind of nuts.

441
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,760
 Really, really, it's a horror movie and it's interesting because it's a horror movie.

442
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,960
 And it's a good view of the art of movie making.

443
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
 And I really enjoyed it.

444
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
 I just watched it last night, Butterfly Kisses.

445
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,400
 Check it out.

446
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
 Totally slept on horror movie.

447
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
 Dead Rabbit recommends Butterfly Kisses.

448
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
 There will be a trailer in the show notes.

449
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,280
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story for this episode.

450
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,520
 A pack of wild Asians we're leaving behind are Crystal Clear and Clean.

451
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,400
 Jason Jalopy, thanks to Caddy Carwash.

452
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
 Let's hop in the Carpenter copter.

453
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
 Now we're flying out to Sacramento, California.

454
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,760
 Specifically, we're flying out to Alberta.

455
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,040
 Now I gotta say this.

456
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,200
 This is one of those stories I'd actually forgotten about.

457
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
 It's one of my favorite stories, but I got a lot of them.

458
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
 I'd forgotten about this story.

459
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
 I was talking to Sabine about it the other day and I was like,

460
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
 "I gotta tell this story on my podcast."

461
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,640
 Now, because this story is so old, I want to tell you right now, there are

462
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,640
 details where one person may have done this and I'm going to say another person did this.

463
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,120
 Like I'm going to make it names mixed up.

464
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,840
 But the narrative itself is true.

465
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,080
 It was a 100% true story and it's very, very cool investigation I was involved in.

466
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,240
 And it's funny because I know a couple of my old friends listen to this show.

467
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,560
 Josh Mormeyer listens to it every once in a while.

468
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,160
 Jason Campbell listens to it.

469
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,040
 What's up, Jason?

470
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,400
 You guys will remember this.

471
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,960
 You guys will remember this story.

472
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
 This had to be like in the late 90s.

473
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,680
 Now in the late 90s, I was a pizza delivery driver and I was also a punk kid.

474
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
 Right?

475
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,920
 Just a punk.

476
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,040
 I was always walking around.

477
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,320
 Startin' trouble.

478
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,160
 It was a lot of fun back then.

479
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,960
 I really love the time period that I was born in.

480
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,920
 I really, really...

481
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,920
 And I'm sure that younger people than me love the time period they were born in and that's

482
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,320
 totally fine.

483
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
 I think that's just kind of a normal thing.

484
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,360
 But everything just seemed more chill.

485
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
 Really seemed more chill, right?

486
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,680
 There were obviously inconveniences, right?

487
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,800
 Nowadays we have smartphones.

488
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,440
 Back then, we all had pagers on us.

489
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,240
 That was the big...

490
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,440
 I remember that was the big stylish item where the pagers...

491
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,480
 And you would drive around.

492
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,960
 I don't think they really made noises like that.

493
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
 They vibrated or went "beep beep".

494
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
 And you'd look, you'd see a number, you're like "Jason, I know what a pager is,

495
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,880
 but then you would drive, you'd have to find a payphone, make a phone call."

496
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,560
 Or you could do it or then you know you had to vibrate feature.

497
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,880
 That's usually what you had them on, right?

498
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
 Because you got annoyed by the "beep beep".

499
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,680
 I paid your one off all the time.

500
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,080
 You usually have them on vibrate.

501
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,760
 And then when you go to the movies and stuff like that.

502
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
 But it was just a different time period.

503
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,720
 We didn't have the internet.

504
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,640
 I mean it existed, but nobody used it.

505
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
 When there was an argument, it just went on and on and on.

506
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,040
 It was...

507
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,160
 I really enjoyed that time.

508
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,880
 It was very simple.

509
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
 MTV played music.

510
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,600
 That's a cliche, but it's a cliche because it's true.

511
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,640
 It used to be so good.

512
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,760
 This is the time period this has taken place in.

513
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,400
 Now, I was a thug.

514
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
 I was a punk kid, right?

515
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
 Looking back on it, it was kind of fun.

516
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,680
 But looking back on it, I was just a punk.

517
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,960
 Oh, just a punk kid, right?

518
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,040
 But I was also a paranormal investigator.

519
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,520
 So I was always ghost hunting.

520
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,080
 That's really what I'm known for.

521
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,920
 Oh, big foot story.

522
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
 Let's send it to Jason.

523
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
 Like nowadays people send emails.

524
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,960
 Friends of mine will talk to me about weirdo stuff.

525
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,160
 But I've always been pretty much out of high school.

526
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,760
 I was really in a ghost hunting.

527
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,920
 I don't think I really got into it during high school.

528
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,200
 I was too busy doing other stuff.

529
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,720
 But I was super paranormal investigators looking in

530
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,360
 to investigating magic and demonology.

531
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
 Like exorcism stuff.

532
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,360
 I had all of these books and documents and everything.

533
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,880
 Had to perform an exorcism.

534
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,480
 We've done past episodes on that.

535
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,040
 So it's kind of what I was known for.

536
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,360
 And I also did tarot cards all the time.

537
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,920
 I was always doing tarot cards, tarot readings.

538
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,080
 And I've talked about that too, how they're done

539
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
 and everything like that.

540
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
 What the gimmick is, what the trick is.

541
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,000
 But anyways, I ran with this crew of dudes.

542
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,920
 It was Josh Mooremeyer, Nick Lyons.

543
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,480
 Sorry, guys.

544
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
 You guys are dope.

545
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,440
 I'll just say your names.

546
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
 Josh Mooremeyer, Nick Lyons.

547
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,480
 Jason Campbell.

548
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,600
 And then the Barnets.

549
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,480
 You had Matt, Evan and Troy Barnets.

550
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,520
 And we would cycle through whose house we hung out with.

551
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,800
 I lived super far away.

552
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,880
 I lived way, way, way far away.

553
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
 But I lived in Orangevale.

554
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,760
 I lived in the bad side of town.

555
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,680
 All these guys, they lived in Anilopil, Verda, stuff like that.

556
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,360
 So we really want to hang out in my house.

557
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,160
 But we'd go out there.

558
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,600
 Now I remember one day, we're just all hanging out,

559
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,960
 drinking whatever, eating pizza.

560
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,920
 We all worked at Godfather's Pizza off of a watt.

561
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,360
 They're just memories, man.

562
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,160
 Just memories.

563
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,040
 I love that.

564
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,720
 It doesn't exist anymore, but one day I'm talking to my friends.

565
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,240
 And one of them goes, "Hey, Jason, I don't even know how to say this,

566
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,000
 but I kind of have a mystery for you."

567
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,720
 Like, something's going on in my house.

568
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,920
 And I was like, "Tell me more," as I pull out my magnifying glass,

569
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,200
 put on my Sherlock Holmes hat.

570
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,400
 They're like, "Well, this is one of the Barnets," said,

571
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
 "Our grandfather had passed away recently.

572
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,720
 And he had his favorite chair, this recliner.

573
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,520
 And he would sit in it, and it was one of those chairs that would vibrate,

574
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,760
 which honestly is like the highest form of chair.

575
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,680
 Every chair should vibrate."

576
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,320
 But he goes, "It was one of those chairs, had the massage back,

577
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,040
 and that was his chair in front of the television set.

578
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,120
 He would sit there and turn on."

579
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
 Now I knew exactly what chair they were talking about,

580
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
 because a lot of times when I went over there,

581
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
 that was the chair I sat in.

582
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,960
 I mean, obviously his grand ball was not in the chair at the time.

583
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
 He had gone to bed.

584
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
 But I would come out, sit in the chair, turn it on.

585
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,400
 We'd be watching MTV, Headbangers Ball or something like that.

586
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,360
 Be sitting in that chair.

587
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,920
 So I knew the chair.

588
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,320
 I was like, "Yes, I'm very familiar with that chair.

589
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,360
 Tell me more."

590
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
 And they're like, "Jason, quit being pretentious dork.

591
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,080
 Just listen to us."

592
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,480
 I put the magnifying glass away, take the hat off.

593
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,040
 So our grandfather passed away recently.

594
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,000
 And then we're all sitting in the living room one day.

595
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
 No one's sitting in the chair.

596
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,040
 And all of a sudden...

597
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,440
 [makes a sound]

598
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,920
 The whole family turns and looks at the chair and it's vibrating.

599
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,200
 It stops.

600
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,640
 Now, mechanical malfunction, possibly.

601
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
 But it has...

602
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,440
 You have to turn it on.

603
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,120
 You press the button and it vibrates.

604
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,960
 They go, "It must have just been a short in the system, right?

605
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,160
 It's electronic. Stuff's going to happen."

606
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,080
 They keep watching television.

607
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,880
 [makes a sound]

608
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,000
 Now, the whole chair, it's audibly vibrating.

609
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,280
 And when they touch it, they can feel it.

610
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,560
 [makes a sound]

611
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,120
 Vibrating.

612
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,480
 What?

613
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
 Watching the chair, just waiting.

614
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,120
 Turn the television down.

615
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:01,120
 [makes a sound]

616
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,720
 It has to have a short, right?

617
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,760
 It's not even doing a full cycle of a massage thing.

618
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
 It's only going for a period of time.

619
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,680
 So what are you going to do?

620
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,640
 What do you think, right?

621
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,120
 You're right.

622
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,920
 You guessed right.

623
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,880
 If you guessed unplug it, you are 100% correct.

624
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
 They unplug the chair from the wall.

625
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,400
 No electricity.

626
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,200
 You don't have to...

627
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,160
 Obviously, it's a...

628
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,880
 [makes a sound]

629
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,040
 The chair's still vibrating even though it's unplugged.

630
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,280
 So...

631
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,320
 At that point, one of the Barnettes, I think it was Matt,

632
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 was talking to me.

633
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,280
 And he goes, "We think the chair..."

634
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,640
 I don't want to put words in his mouth,

635
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,680
 but the insinuation is something weird

636
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,880
 is happening in at their house,

637
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 involving the chair of their grandfather who passed away,

638
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
 who he always had it vibrate,

639
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,000
 is now vibrating even though he's gone.

640
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,920
 And it's unplugged, and no one's sitting in it.

641
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,200
 So, we went there that night.

642
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
 We got to check this out.

643
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
 He's like, "No, no, we're having a religious ceremony.

644
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
 This is out of the way, kicking over tables.

645
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,200
 Oh, no, I'll never be a full Catholic now.

646
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,000
 Ah, whatever, smashing stuff over.

647
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
 No, we went over to their house,

648
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,440
 and we show up, and I go...

649
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,320
 I'm going to sit in the chair.

650
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
 I'm going to sit in the chair.

651
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,680
 I'm not afraid of no ghosts.

652
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,560
 I sit in the chair.

653
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,800
 We're watching television, and a period of time passes,

654
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,520
 and you know, I just kind of like hanging out, drinking,

655
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,560
 and then...

656
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,800
 I almost jumped out of that chair.

657
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,560
 It 100% was vi-

658
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
 And I checked it before I go...

659
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,000
 Because I'm thinking these guys are messing with me, right?

660
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
 Whenever you come out of the closet,

661
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,840
 or come out of the casket as a ghost hunter,

662
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,640
 whenever you come out of the nether realm as a ghost hunter,

663
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,880
 people are going to fool you.

664
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
 I mean, that's just going to happen.

665
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,560
 On purpose, on accident, it's just going to happen.

666
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,440
 So anyway, something...

667
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,520
 I remember I came over, and I looked, and it was unplugged,

668
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,480
 and I was like, "Okay."

669
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,400
 And we're watching deftone videos or whatever,

670
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,440
 Limp Bizkit.

671
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,800
 It's just MTV all the time.

672
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,640
 Why can't MTV just be music again?

673
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,160
 You're like, "Jason, that's called YouTube."

674
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,520
 No, I want my music picked out by some other people,

675
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,880
 and this is why.

676
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,320
 Because then I learn new music.

677
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
 If it's just me on YouTube,

678
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,360
 I'm listening to nothing but Ice Cube,

679
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,440
 and Tupac, and Limp Bizkit, all the time.

680
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,600
 I want my music curated.

681
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,240
 Dang it!

682
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,600
 But let's get back to the real story here.

683
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,280
 We're watching music videos.

684
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,560
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling.

685
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,360
 And this chair starts vibrating,

686
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,720
 and I jump out of it.

687
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,680
 100% and you know, again, as a paranormal investigator,

688
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,960
 this is the stuff you want.

689
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,760
 You want proof.

690
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,400
 Sit back down in the chair.

691
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,640
 Wait a while longer.

692
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:48,560
 Now, it wasn't a regular thing.

693
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,000
 You couldn't set your watch to it.

694
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,800
 It would just happen,

695
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,200
 which again made it even more likely

696
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,560
 to have a paranormal answer.

697
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,840
 You know, ghosts don't have wristwatches,

698
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
 at least as far as I know.

699
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
 They might all be assigned one at the pearly gates.

700
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,400
 But it would just kind of come and go.

701
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,200
 And I remember just thinking,

702
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
 "This is spooky.

703
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,080
 I honestly think I stopped sitting in the chair.

704
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,720
 I think that at a certain point I stopped sitting in it,

705
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,120
 and we were all just kind of sitting there hanging out.

706
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,200
 Every so often the chair would start to vibrate."

707
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,360
 And eventually though, it stopped.

708
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
 Stopped doing it altogether.

709
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,280
 Maybe about a week or two later,

710
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,320
 just stopped vibrating.

711
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,640
 So it kind of plays into the idea that

712
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
 and we've talked about this on the shows.

713
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,360
 We've talked about everything on this show, episode 448,

714
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,000
 that spirits most likely,

715
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,240
 the ghosts in South Korea is different,

716
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,480
 but you would think a spirit slowly loses its power over time.

717
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,960
 It becomes more and more through realization that

718
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,440
 Earth isn't, it's supposed to move on to the next plane.

719
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
 So it doesn't disappear.

720
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,080
 It doesn't die off.

721
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,160
 The spirit's power just slowly disappears

722
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,240
 until it finally goes to heaven.

723
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,920
 So that's what you think, right?

724
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,440
 The chair is vibrating for a while.

725
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,360
 And it just goes away.

726
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,320
 It probably had to be a couple months later when this happened.

727
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,680
 I remember we were hanging out again somewhere,

728
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,920
 and Matt, one of the Barnettes, again I believe it was Matt,

729
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,040
 came up to me and goes, "Hey dude, dude, look what we found."

730
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:21,280
 And they hand me a pager, specifically my pager.

731
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,800
 A pager that I had lost at their house

732
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
 while sitting in Grandpa's chair.

733
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,920
 A pager that got paged all the time.

734
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,360
 Pager set on vibrate,

735
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,680
 and there was a groove cut into the side of it.

736
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,720
 Matt goes, "This was in my Grandpa's chair."

737
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,000
 And I remember looking at that pager as he gave it to me,

738
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,040
 and I go, "This is our ghost.

739
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,680
 This is our ghost."

740
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,320
 So what happened was that at some point this pager,

741
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,240
 this really cool pager, is a glow in the dark pager,

742
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,000
 it's like 50 bucks.

743
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 It fell out of my pants,

744
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,200
 and it fell into Grandpa Barnett's chair now,

745
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,800
 because it was a recliner,

746
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,080
 which I don't know if I said that earlier,

747
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,480
 but all great chairs are recliners.

748
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,080
 It actually slid in,

749
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,720
 and as the chair at one point got flipped back up into the seat position,

750
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,920
 it wedged right in between two pieces of metal.

751
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,360
 It was 100% in the perfect position for what happened next.

752
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,920
 But it got wedged in perfectly,

753
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,440
 and it was set to vibrate,

754
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,120
 and my pager was always blowing up.

755
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,600
 And every time someone called that pager,

756
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,200
 vibrated, made the chair shake,

757
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,840
 and it did it over and over and over again until the battery died.

758
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
 And I'm looking at this pager,

759
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,040
 that I mean it was so tight in there,

760
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,880
 it was so in, it was in there so tight,

761
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,400
 it had a groove cut into it.

762
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
 This is our ghost.

763
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,040
 I love that story for a couple reasons.

764
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,920
 One, because it's a story that I was personally involved in.

765
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,160
 I could say, not like I'm a huge egotist, I am,

766
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,720
 but I know the story from beginning to end,

767
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
 even though some of the details I might be iffy on.

768
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,680
 There is no chance for chicanery,

769
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,040
 there is no chance for tricks.

770
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,120
 I was there the whole time.

771
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,080
 And it has an ending.

772
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,480
 It has an identifiable ending.

773
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,920
 Again, it's a paranormal researcher,

774
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,040
 it's not the ending that you necessarily want.

775
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,080
 But we talked about this,

776
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,680
 I've talked about this a couple times on the show,

777
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
 I talked about this with the whole thing,

778
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,960
 with the Civil War aliens, Charles Dawson and Doug Dobbs,

779
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,040
 which is great, they're a great group of guys.

780
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,280
 But stories that have endings,

781
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,120
 even if they're not the paranormal answer,

782
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,760
 are still very satisfying to me.

783
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,120
 And I think most paranormal stories have an ending like this,

784
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
 we just haven't seen it yet.

785
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
 Because that was sheer luck.

786
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,800
 One, it was luck that the pager got stuck in there

787
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
 to create the phenomenon in the first place,

788
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,640
 because it could have fallen any manner of ways,

789
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,760
 fallen out the bottom, got stuck,

790
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,080
 but not in a place that would make the chair vibrate.

791
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,800
 You could have got stuck in a chair that didn't vibrate,

792
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,880
 it just, everything worked out perfectly,

793
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,720
 but then the fact that we found it,

794
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
 because they could easily just pack the chair up,

795
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,840
 given it's to someone else.

796
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
 They could have sold the chair,

797
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
 chair could have been disposed of,

798
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,800
 never have found the pager.

799
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,600
 Or if they sold it and someone finds the pager,

800
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,120
 they're not going to put two and two together.

801
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,040
 But the fact that all of this stuff happens,

802
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,520
 I honestly believe,

803
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,480
 I do believe in ghosts,

804
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,880
 and I do believe in unidentified flying objects,

805
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,680
 and things like that,

806
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,560
 but I honestly believe a good 95% of all of that phenomenon

807
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,400
 can be explained away.

808
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,240
 It's the 5% that can't be explained away,

809
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,680
 which terrifies and fascinates me.

810
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,960
 But I think a good portion of it has a reasonable

811
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,840
 answer.

812
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,320
 Like in the first story,

813
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,240
 that young woman may have had a seizure,

814
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,120
 and then the memories became clouded because of that.

815
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,320
 Worked backwards, as possible.

816
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,920
 I hung on to that pager for a while.

817
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,480
 To be honest, I might still have it in a box somewhere.

818
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,920
 Because I have, I allow myself one box of mementos,

819
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,480
 and it might still be in there.

820
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,320
 And I kept it.

821
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,640
 I kept it as proof that

822
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,120
 not every ghost story has a ghost answer.

823
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,640
 Most of the time, it's a pager.

824
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,720
 Most of the time, it's a rational answer.

825
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,120
 So as we end season 9 and head into season 10,

826
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,520
 let's remember to take a look at the world a little more closely.

827
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,520
 Those things that we see dancing at the edge of our eyesight,

828
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,600
 standing at the foot of our bed,

829
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,480
 may be 100% explainable as natural phenomenon.

830
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,720
 When you walk into your bedroom and you think you see

831
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,280
 something staring out of your closet, ignore it.

832
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,000
 The next time you wake up late at night,

833
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 you go to the bathroom,

834
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,840
 turn the light on, look in the mirror, check your eyes.

835
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,920
 And then right as you shut the light off in that split second between

836
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,240
 illumination and darkness,

837
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,840
 you see a figure behind you, it's nothing.

838
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,480
 When you're walking to your car,

839
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,080
 late at night in that dark parking lot,

840
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,760
 and you swear you saw something human sized,

841
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,240
 scurry underneath your vehicle, just ignore it.

842
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,360
 The scratch at your window,

843
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,400
 the crunch of footsteps outside your door,

844
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,800
 that sound coming from the darkest room in your house.

845
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,640
 There's a 95% chance that all of these have completely rational answers,

846
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,560
 but there's a 5% chance that you'll become the next story on Dead Rabbit Radio.

 I'm going to have a great week.

 Be safe.

857
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,640
