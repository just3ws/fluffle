00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
 Ghosts ghouls and things that go bump in the night and maybe some zombies today on Dead Rabbit Radio

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:18,740
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,320
 I hope you're having a great day too. Happy Halloween

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,600
 You can tell I didn't really plan this out super well because technically the Halloween episode should have come out yesterday

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,340
 Because most people listen to it at day late

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,540
 This is my first Halloween you can the show doesn't have the best planning if you haven't realized that

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,860
 But we get you good stories. I think I think sometimes they may come off a little the timing may be a little off

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,960
 But you know that you get them. I hope you enjoy them. So some quick bits of news

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,420
 I just reminder starting November the week of November 5th. We're not gonna have any shows. I'm gonna take that week off

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,900
 I'm gonna do in it to

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,660
 Partially to relax and partially to catch up on my research the iceberg topics require the most research

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,660
 So that's why I try to do just one a week. Secondly starting season 3

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,500
 We are renaming the show to the Walking Dead Rabbit. It is just going to be a walking dead recap show

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,980
 Because that's all that matters. I'm joking obviously, but

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:21,620
 Man, you know Sunday is Rick's last episode and I know a lot of people still aren't into the Walking Dead a lot of people have kind of

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,800
 Given up on it, but I don't know man. You know, I've been watching it for nine years now and I've been on that journey with Rick

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,020
 It's really the only television show I watch I watch the Walking Dead every episode

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,420
 I watch every episode of it's always sunny in Philadelphia and I'll catch the occasional episode

19
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,540
 The Simpsons the new episodes of the Simpsons. That's it other than that. I'll watch movies

20
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,580
 I don't watch any other television shows. So Simpsons all kind of catch up

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,900
 I'll watch like three or four episodes in a row when I remember

22
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,260
 But it's always sunny in Philadelphia and the Walking Dead are the shows that I every week I watch them

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,900
 I make time to watch them I get my little whatever I'm doing like gonna eat dinner or sit back and drink a soda

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,620
 I watch those shows so it sucks to know that Rick is leaving and I saw the trailer for the new

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,140
 For his last episode and it doesn't look good for him

26
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,820
 And it looks cool because it actually looks like you're going back through his past memories as he's reliving them

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,300
 It looks it looks great. So hopefully he doesn't die and he comes back

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,780
 You know at the end of the show, but it doesn't really look like that's gonna happen

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,780
 But I but yeah, we're not gonna be a recap show

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,020
 But I do really enjoy watching the Walking Dead and I think you guys would too I had given another chance

31
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,300
 If you've stopped watching if you already watch it, then that's cool

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,740
 So I wanted to talk about some ghost stories today

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,740
 I wanted to talk about some story because that's the one thing I think the show

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,380
 Lacks the most for me is the paranormal aspect

35
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:51,180
 We do a lot of conspiracy stuff and then a medium amount of paranormal and very little true crime

36
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,860
 And I'm kind of fine with that, but I'd like to bump up the ghost stories just a little bit

37
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,900
 The problem is is that a lot of times

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,100
 I'm I've become in my age a little more skeptical of ghost stories

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,420
 I think they're really fun and they spook me out. I love talking about them

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,180
 But I can't help I can't help sometimes sometimes accidentally

41
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,060
 Disproving them now not all the time

42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,460
 But that's one of the reasons why I'll look up a ghost story and I'm like, oh, you know, that's really cool

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,420
 And I look at it a little bit more and I'm like damn it. It's totally not true and this is why it's not true

44
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,580
 So for this episode

45
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,420
 I want to look at one of my favorite ghost stories that I'd heard over the years and it is the flight

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,900
 It's flight 401. So some quick background to this. This was a real event

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,620
 flight 401 was an airplane it would well obviously, but I mean it was a

48
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,540
 I think it was like a what was it a lock jet. Is that even a thing?

49
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,060
 Okay, so back in the night back in the year 1972 there was a Lockheed

50
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,420
 aircraft that was flying a bunch of people

51
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,620
 It had 163 people on it and and the crew and they're flying and the

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,820
 They're going to land in Florida now

53
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,780
 What happened was they went to switch on their landing gear and there's a sort of light that's supposed to come on

54
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,300
 To say that the landing gear is locked and ready for use and the light didn't come on and it's nighttime and the guys are like

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,420
 Hey, you know, we can't really get visual on whether or not this is down yet

56
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,980
 And they're fiddling with it and they call ahead to the air traffic control and they said hey

57
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,700
 We're gonna circle around a bit and try to figure out what's going on with their landing gear and air traffic control goes

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,860
 Okay, hit 2000 feet circle around the Everglades

59
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,620
 So they took apart the assembly and they're looking at the light to figure out why it's not on

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,620
 They send a guy down into the cone

61
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,900
 Because they do have down there a way to visually look out to see if the landing gear is down and at one point the captain's like

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,940
 Hey, put on the autopilot while we're doing this

63
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:58,140
 So they clip on the autopilot and something goes wrong either the autopilot gets knocked off accidentally or shuts itself off some sort of glitch

64
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,460
 But the plane drops a little bit in elevation and then slowly

65
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:11,100
 Begins to glide down into the dark swamp and it's happening so slowly the pilots don't realize that the plane's descending and eventually

66
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,340
 It just crashes into the Everglades into the swamp

67
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,700
 The pilots and the flight engineer they died two of the ten flight attendants died and

68
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,200
 96 of 163 passengers died some of them died on impact and some of them died

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,580
 Because they like they're just bleeding out or they took them to hospital and there's nothing they could do for him

70
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,460
 What happened was they took pieces out of this flight flight 401 and

71
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,860
 They didn't have a lot of lockheed jets back then this was kind of a newer jet

72
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,380
 So they began putting the pieces into other lockheeds that were in

73
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,380
 Service I had always heard this story as one of the most verifiable

74
00:05:52,380 --> 00:06:00,420
 Ghost encounters because basically the story went that every plane that had a piece of flight 401 in it

75
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,140
 experienced ghostly sightings

76
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,300
 one of the most notable ones was

77
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,980
 There was a plane I believe it was going to Mexico City and this woman was this flight attendant

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,820
 She wasn't just a woman, but she's flight attendant

79
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,260
 She noticed something out of the corner of her eye and she looks in the oven because she saw something there

80
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,300
 And she saw the face of a man staring at her from inside the oven and it totally freaked her out

81
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,700
 But I don't know if the man said it while he was in the oven or then popped out of the oven

82
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,820
 But anyways, it was the ghost of Don repo who was the one of the flight engineers on fly 401

83
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,940
 He said there's going to be a fire on this plane and as that plane was descending into Mexico City

84
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,740
 one of the engines burned out caught on fire and

85
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,860
 supposedly the ghost of Don repo then went or the captain one of the two ghosts went into the cabin and talked the

86
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,940
 Pilots down so they could land the plane extraordinary story these other planes that have these pieces also had sightings of it

87
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:01,140
 Including like the vice president of eastern airlines, which is the company that ran the jet and the fleet of jets that have these parts

88
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,180
 He said that he saw the ghost of Tom loft

89
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,660
 Who was the captain?

90
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,700
 Stewardesses said that they saw ghosts passengers said that they'd be sitting in their chair and they'd look over and there'd be a

91
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,420
 Like a person in a aviation uniform

92
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,820
 What is that the right word a captain uniform? I guess sitting next to him and they'd be like

93
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,580
 Oh, hey, I didn't see you there and then they would disappear and like other people on the plane would be like

94
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,100
 Oh my god, totally disappeared

95
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,860
 And so the conspiracy was was that eastern airlines like in any flight where they recorded in their logbook

96
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,260
 I saw a ghost eastern airlines remove the logbook and replaced it with a new one

97
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 And the flight where the captain was in the cockpit talking the other pilots down the voice recorder for that

98
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,340
 disappeared

99
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,300
 So eastern airlines was making a concerted effort to

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:55,540
 Shut down this investigation all of this came out when an author wrote a nonfiction book called the ghost of flight 401

101
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,780
 And his name was fuller john g fuller. So he writes this book and it became very popular

102
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,100
 they made several movies about it and

103
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,500
 It's been considered one of those cases that could have been the most like

104
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,540
 concrete way to prove the existence of ghost but

105
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,460
 Eastern airlines they took all the parts out of all the plane like they cannibalized flight 401

106
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,660
 And put the parts in these other planes and that's where the ghost was showing up

107
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,740
 Well, they took all the parts out

108
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,540
 And got rid of them because they were tired of the ghost stories

109
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,580
 And so we were no longer able to verify this now

110
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,340
 I remember reading about that story a long time ago and honestly I

111
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,220
 Probably saw or at least heard of the movie as a child because it's an older movie

112
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,060
 And it's kind of creepy because you're already on an airplane. You're already fairly trapped

113
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,020
 And I was like this would be a good like halloween story

114
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:48,900
 And so I started looking into it. I had a basic memory of it and then I had to kind of like track it down and stuff like that

115
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,220
 and

116
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,620
 There's been a lot of pushback on it in recent years that it's absolutely 100 fake 100 fake

117
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
 And the pushback is is that

118
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,340
 there was

119
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,340
 another author who wrote a book about the history of eastern airlines and

120
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:14,980
 Eastern airlines at the time they were so incensed the fact that this author was saying that there was a conspiracy to hush up ghosts

121
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,540
 That they were going to sue him

122
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,020
 They were actually going to sue him for defamation because they said it's completely foolish to think that one we would care about ghosts at all

123
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,500
 and then two

124
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,980
 Basically punished our employees for believing ghosts the eastern airlines launched their own internal

125
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,220
 Investigation and began talking to people and everyone's like I never saw ghosts the book in the book the ghost of flight 401

126
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,900
 All the names are changed so you can't track down the initial people he talked to

127
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,180
 But eastern airline talked to pilots and all that stuff and they're like no I never saw a ghost. I read the book too. I heard about it

128
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,380
 it's totally nonsense the wife of

129
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,140
 captain loft

130
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
 she tried suing fuller for uh

131
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,700
 Invasion of privacy and things like that and that case got dismissed not because

132
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,620
 It turns out the book was true

133
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,020
 But because invasion of privacy really only works if the person's on a public figure

134
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:10,020
 And you could argue that tom loft was a public figure. He was very well known. He was part of this accident

135
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,420
 And so I'm reading all this stuff and I'm thinking okay

136
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,060
 Well, maybe eastern airlines is just kind of covering like maybe they did cover it up

137
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,460
 And now they have to cover their tracks that they covered it up

138
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,140
 And so I'm doing this research and I was already kind of loot. I was like, oh man

139
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,340
 You know, this is a story that I always liked and and there's some pretty pretty interesting pushback to it

140
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,820
 But then I was reading another website and it put the nail in the coffin

141
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,220
 They said there were no pieces salvaged from flight 401

142
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,340
 None the plane on impact just got shredded and this website I was on it was called sceptoid because I'll look at the

143
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,860
 The skeptical websites they really pop up at the top of the searches a lot of times

144
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,980
 But I was going to tell the story initially and then once I found out that there was some controversy about it

145
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,300
 I was like, well, let's see what the other site says

146
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,180
 And they had an interesting point. They said one that's not common for

147
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,900
 Items that suffer mass like a plane that suffers massive damage for anything to be salvageable out of it

148
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,460
 And they said secondly least of all an oven like ovens are are fairly fragile things

149
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,500
 So you're telling me that this plane crash that killed over 100 people or around 100 people

150
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,100
 But the oven survived so perfectly you could take it out of that plane and then put it in another plane

151
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,220
 And it would still cook it would still be operational

152
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,860
 And I was like, yeah, I guess that makes sense. I guess that makes sense

153
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,340
 So I mean I I'm leaning more I think that it's an interest in again the thing that trips you up with this stuff

154
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,460
 And me especially is if the story is intriguing, it's more believable and it really shouldn't be that way

155
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,940
 But it is if I had a bit money right now if there were ghosts from flight 401

156
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,820
 If that really happened on other planes, I would say no, I don't think it happened

157
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,700
 But I still think it's an intriguing story

158
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,740
 And I would have well, actually here's my question if the ghost was on a plane

159
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,700
 Wouldn't if the plane take off the ghost fall out of the plane like I still don't understand ghost physics

160
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:17,300
 Like do the ghosts suffer inertia? Like if you know how you like you're on a plane and it kind of you kind of stumble sometimes

161
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,540
 And it does something with the goat would that happen to a ghost?

162
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,420
 I don't know still a creepy story

163
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,940
 But I was a little disappointed because I was like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna talk about that on my show

164
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,660
 But again, I like to present both sides. So there we go

165
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,460
 Then the next two stories

166
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,580
 You're like chasing that's a terrible way to have a Halloween episode

167
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,220
 You just told us a spooky story and then you dismissed everything. Well

168
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,100
 The next story we're gonna talk about

169
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,820
 Is also ghost related

170
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,900
 I believe it's true as in I believe this woman

171
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,700
 Believes it's true

172
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,300
 The flight 401 story I it could have been all completely made up and just in the author's head, but this story

173
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,980
 I believe is 100 true that the woman believes it's true. So we're gonna go to

174
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,940
 Britain now so hop in, you know, the carpenter copter is in the shop. I don't want to go flying right now. So let's take the

175
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,900
 Let's take the rabbit rowboat and I know it's going to be a long journey

176
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,100
 But I don't feel like flying after that last story. So we're in the rabbit rowboat

177
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,740
 And we'll hire some dude. We'll hire a ghost to row us across the ocean

178
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,500
 I assume everyone is when you're listening to the show, you're just in my neighborhood and you're like, dude, I'm in Lithuania

179
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,380
 Well, you're in my neighborhood right now. So we're hopping in the

180
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,540
 Rabbit rowboat and we have to go all the way around the tip of South America. I know it's poorly planned out trip

181
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,060
 But in eventually we get to Britain and there we meet a young woman named amethyst realm

182
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,740
 That is like a psychic name and a stripper name mixed together

183
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:57,060
 Coincidentally, she is a psychic. So this woman was married and she's like, you know what? I need to try something else

184
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,780
 This this this mortal man is not doing it for me anymore

185
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,860
 And so she had sex with a ghost and she's like, hmm, that's hmm. Whoa, that was the best sex I've ever had

186
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,900
 So she actually divorced her husband

187
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,820
 And began hooking up with ghosts. Now you'd think Jason

188
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,900
 I can understand someone being lucky enough to have sex with one ghost

189
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:26,100
 She's hooked up with 15 to 20 ghosts. So she's getting around. I don't want to sludge shame

190
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,420
 but um

191
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,260
 15 to 20 ghosts

192
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,780
 I mean, okay, let's let's I'm gonna be clear right now. She's just masturbating

193
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,060
 That's all she's doing

194
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,700
 She's masturbating and pretending a ghost is having sex with her and then she's saying there's a ghost

195
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:52,340
 So by that metric I've had sex with a million ghosts, but that aside, she's masturbating and she's saying that

196
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,420
 She's uh, she's being in ghosts. Now you're like, okay crazy woman. That's fine

197
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,220
 But there's another twist to this story, of course

198
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:08,340
 So she's been dating the same ghost for a while now and they went to australia actually, no, she met him in australia, I believe

199
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,860
 and

200
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,580
 He flew home with her in a jet

201
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,180
 Not fly. Hey ghost on an airplane. I didn't even plan that

202
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,060
 She flew home with him and they

203
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,100
 According to her had sex in the bathroom now again

204
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,380
 She just masturbated in the bathroom, but

205
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,420
 She goes to the bathroom. She's got all hot and bothered. She goes in there. Her ghost lover comes in

206
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,700
 There's a ghost watching from the oven. He's like, oh, yeah

207
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,420
 so hot

208
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,100
 So anyways

209
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,620
 She bangs this ghost on airplane. They've been dating for nine months now

210
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,980
 She's getting ready to marry the ghost. She's getting ready to marry him. I'm assuming it's a dude

211
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,820
 So she's gonna marry this ghost and from what I saw the ghost didn't have a name

212
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,020
 The ghost doesn't have a name from what I saw and I could have just missed it

213
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,940
 But I've read several articles about this young woman. She's getting ready to marry this ghost and she had the quote

214
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,180
 She's like it's not traditional. It's not like he got down on one knee because he doesn't have any

215
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,300
 Why does he only matt does he only manifest from the the knees up?

216
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,700
 If he only manifests from the knees up, does he stand the how tall is he?

217
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,020
 Does he walk on his knees or does he float a good foot off the ground?

218
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,660
 How does this work?

219
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
 I'm glad that's my main question

220
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,980
 Anyways, it's not a traditional marriage. He can't get down on his knee because he doesn't have one

221
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,340
 And if you thought that lunacy wasn't enough

222
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,220
 amethyst

223
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,980
 Amethyst realm is planning to have

224
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,100
 His baby

225
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,180
 Yes, she believes in a thing called phantom pregnancy, which women have all the time where they get in pregnant

226
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,940
 Ghosts

227
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,980
 But they don't carry them to full term because they don't believe in them

228
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,580
 But if she believes in them this ghost can get her pregnant

229
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,260
 She can have a ghost baby the power of imagination

230
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,740
 Is a wonderful thing and the power of sexual fantasies is great as well. Her friends and her family

231
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,620
 They're like, oh, she's always been a little off, but we totally support her in anything she does and and that's fair

232
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,060
 She's not hurting anybody if I had a friend who was trying to get knocked by a ghost

233
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,060
 I'd probably be a little bit concerned, but if I knew all her life

234
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,700
 She believed in ghosts and spirits and all that stuff and then she'd been telling me she was sleeping around with these ghost men

235
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:30,500
 By the time she got to having a ghost baby, I probably would have become pretty in pretty calloused to her lunacy

236
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,860
 She is planning on having this ghost baby now

237
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,380
 I'm assuming because I've read stuff like this for so long

238
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,500
 I'm never going to see this woman appear again in the newspaper

239
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,980
 It would be interesting though to watch her like gain a bunch of weight

240
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,140
 Just like those bridesmaids just like maybe she'll be wearing a tight dress and it gets

241
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,340
 Tighter on her, but I'm assuming she's just simply going to put on a bunch of weight and then

242
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,300
 Say a baby came out at some point

243
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,660
 I think that's what's going to happen. She's just going to be eating donuts until she gets a bit of a belly

244
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,740
 And then she's going to be like it's been nine months since I started eating jelly donuts

245
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,380
 I just gave birth to this baby and she's going to hold air

246
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,300
 And at that point everyone has to decide whether or not to just go along with it

247
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,220
 Do you change a baby's ghost diapers? Does a baby ghost go to school?

248
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,260
 Oh, does a baby ghost breastfeed? These are all interesting questions. Will the baby ghost

249
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,260
 Have knees?

250
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,660
 Will it be like Casper and just kind of be

251
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,820
 Oh amethyst

252
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,780
 You wacky wacky girl, uh, you know again

253
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,740
 It's this is fairly harmless

254
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,620
 The as long as she doesn't come to the conclusion that to be with her husband and her

255
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,940
 Unborn child

256
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,780
 Nonborn child however you want to put it is to become a ghost herself now. That's when obviously you intervene

257
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
 but other than that she's just a

258
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,740
 An interesting personality

259
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,500
 Yeah, just yeah, does will she have a ghost umbilical cord?

260
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,580
 There's a lot of questions I have about um the

261
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:09,780
 The the um physics of a ghost in general, but the idea of a ghost baby

262
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,980
 Where do you buy clothes for a ghost baby?

263
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,660
 What type of toy dude that'd be creepy you like every doll you give it starts animating around

264
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,140
 Okay, we're gonna go ahead and move on to the next story here because I'm just going to be discussing ghost babies

265
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,740
 Probably for the rest of the night with people who would rather talk about anything else

266
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,500
 So you're like Jason you told us about flight 401

267
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,420
 And then you kind of debunked it and then you kind of said that it was creepy and you're kind of skeptical about that

268
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,940
 So that's a that was a wash then you told us about a

269
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,100
 ghost

270
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,540
 Bangin chick and having giving birth to a ghost baby

271
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:53,140
 And that's that so how are you gonna end your halloween episode jason? How are you going to?

272
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,340
 To come back from such nonsense

273
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,940
 Now i'm not i'm gonna double down. I'm gonna double down on my nonsense right now

274
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,500
 I want to tell you

275
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 about a seriously

276
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,340
 spooky story

277
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,340
 to be fair

278
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,500
 So there's a new group of paranormal

279
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,700
 Investigators i'm not even going to be able to keep a straight face. There's a new group of paranormal investigators in town

280
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,500
 They demand to be taken seriously because

281
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,140
 They have proof a lot of proof actually of the afterlife now

282
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,940
 What happened was this guy he just recently leased out or got a new place for his business

283
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:42,100
 And they moved in they're just working there moving stuff in getting everything ready and they started to experience paranormal activity

284
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,420
 I'm gonna quote this article here

285
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,700
 Okay, so i'm gonna read this to you, but i'm gonna leave out a key portion of it

286
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,820
 Lee says from the day they moved in and began to

287
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,980
 blank

288
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,540
 At the site he has experienced bangs moans repeated bumping and things coming right at me

289
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,780
 According to leigh, so they moved into this place of business and from day one they're hearing

290
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,740
 bangs and moans and

291
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,700
 Things are bumping into them and things are coming right at them. Okay, so now i'm gonna read you the whole sentence

292
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:20,180
 I was like this has to be a joke. I had found multiple articles on this unfortunately. It's true

293
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,460
 This is the whole sentence studio owner lee

294
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:30,820
 Says from the day they moved in and began to film porn movies at the site. He has experienced bangs

295
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,420
 moans

296
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,540
 Repeated bumping and things coming right at me

297
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,900
 i.e.

298
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,660
 Everything that happens at every porn set ever if i'm

299
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:48,020
 A pornographer and i'm working late at my studio and i hear someone moaning in the next room

300
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:54,740
 I'm going to assume someone's filming something if i'm getting bumped and things are coming right at me

301
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,420
 Guys that's vivid. That's all porn studios ever but

302
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,340
 okay

303
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,420
 He's obviously talking about ghostly moans and ghostly things coming right at him fair enough still

304
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,300
 They could have been anyways

305
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,300
 So he says that all this stuff is going on and they're catching it on video

306
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,260
 And he's been there late at night and hearing moans

307
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,940
 He's hearing voices now

308
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,900
 He's like we're catching voices on recording and you're like oh that's interesting and then he goes on to say that

309
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,860
 It's from a spirit box, which if you don't know what a spirit box is it's basically a broken radio

310
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,380
 It's a radio that constantly tunes itself. We talked about it on an earlier episode, but it's a radio that constantly tunes itself

311
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,460
 It's like a high tech Ouija board. So

312
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,140
 i'll say

313
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
 Charlie charlie are you here and the radio will go

314
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,860
 By toothpaste

315
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,540
 Wal-Mart and i'll be like oh my god. He's buying toothpaste at wal-mart

316
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:58,340
 So it's basically picking it's basically like bumblebee from the transformers movies. It picks up random transmissions and it's up to you to

317
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,980
 Determine them. So if you sit a spirit box down and ask questions for an hour

318
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,140
 You're going to get a couple hits just from random things just like sometimes

319
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:14,260
 When I used to watch television more I'd flip through the station and you'd have I'd get five stations and the commercials would complete a sentence

320
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,820
 Like you are going to go home now

321
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,860
 And it's just because it's going to happen eventually

322
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,380
 So anyways, he has a spirit box. He also says that he also gets straight up disembodied voices and stuff like that

323
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,380
 But of course we need to see proof of that

324
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:33,140
 And it's hard to say that someone's just not in the corner being like buy toothpaste at wal-mart and they're like, oh my god

325
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,380
 We just picked it up. We just evp evp

326
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:43,380
 Then he has stuff where atmospheric changes the taps turn on by themselves toilet flushed on floors people aren't on again

327
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,740
 These are all

328
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,140
 Things that happen just in general

329
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:55,060
 But so you're like, okay a bunch of a guy has a haunted porn studio. So what he actually he's gotten together and he's formed the

330
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,740
 Paranormal porn stars. This is a new ghost hunting group that is going to have

331
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,300
 It's funny because the articles make it sound like they're going to have their own television show on amazon prime

332
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,700
 But I found one article that made it look like they were

333
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,740
 They it was them sharing the show with other ghost hunters

334
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,460
 And they were all competing against each other

335
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,980
 Well, I mean it's a marketing thing obviously he got some I mean incredibly attractive women

336
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,460
 Incredibly attractive women to do this

337
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,180
 I'm following them on twitter. I'm sure that

338
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,700
 They're either completely making it up and it's a good marketing gimmick for them or they're experiencing things that they absolutely believe that are

339
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,620
 Happening I'm skeptical just because I haven't seen it myself

340
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,900
 But if I went out to their porn studio and and saw this stuff

341
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,380
 I'm not so skeptical that I'm going to be like no no no that's faulty wiring or stuff like that

342
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,700
 And if I don't have amazon prime

343
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,460
 But if this show comes out and they're giving compelling evidence then I'll be like, hey, you know, it's true because I want this that's the thing

344
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,940
 As opposed to most skeptics. I want this stuff to be true. I don't find any pleasure necessarily

345
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,500
 I find I think it's fun to decode a puzzle

346
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,940
 And to look at something and go that's why that probably happened

347
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,020
 But I would rather it be

348
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,460
 That there was a ghost on flight 401. I'd rather it be that a woman is sleeping around with ghosts

349
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,700
 Well, she's just masturbating but again

350
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:21,540
 And then I would rather believe that these super hot porn stars are actually walking around in the dark and picking up proof of life after death

351
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,340
 So I wish them the best. I wish these guys the best

352
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,060
 But again, I think it's an amazing publicity stunt, especially around october

353
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:34,340
 So we'll see I hope they have fun and they do their thing and if it's a publicity stunt then

354
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:40,020
 Hopefully that works out for them. Let's let's see some proof. Let's let's let's get some actual proof

355
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,180
 And you know what it would be hilarious if after

356
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,660
 decades of professional ghost hunters hunting for ghosts

357
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:55,220
 These this porn company captures indisputable proof that ghosts exist

358
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,300
 Like what if the ghosts do

359
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,300
 They're just like they've the whole time they're just rattling chains and they see those hot chicks

360
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,340
 And they're like, you know what we're gonna prove ourselves right now and they walk out of a room

361
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,580
 And they're like we're ghosts laugh after death. I mean I used to be an airline pilot

362
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,380
 That would be amazing

363
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,260
 All of these all of this time and money put into these

364
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,380
 Quote-unquote legitimate ghost hunting groups and these guys

365
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,740
 Actually find proof of them. So it would be yeah, I would like to see this group

366
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,700
 I think it would be hilarious so they actually could show up a bunch of these other paranormal groups

367
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,100
 But again, you know, it's probably just so much people running around in the dark

368
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,540
 With catching orbs, which I have no an orbs just dust give me

369
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,820
 Give me a disembodied ghost or something

370
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,380
 moving something around on screen

371
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:50,820
 Or, you know, really anything that can't be denied by a normal person skeptics will go out of their way to deny stuff

372
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,020
 Most normal people will just watch something and go, oh, you know, that's quite puzzling

373
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,740
 So give us something if you give me something like that then I'm on board with the paranormal porn stars

374
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,860
 And you know

375
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,620
 You guys might just I'd be kind of cool

376
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:10,820
 Maybe dump the porn star part and just become paranormal investigators that might be a a cool vocation for all of you

377
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:16,340
 But dead rabbit radio wishes you the best of luck. Well, that is our halloween episode

378
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,620
 I'm gonna maybe have some spooky music going on here

379
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,900
 And I did promise you zombies at the end of this episode. However, we're running a little bit long

380
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,020
 So I'm taking the zombies out the zombies will be on our season finale, which will be our friday episode
