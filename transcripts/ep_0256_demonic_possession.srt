00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Today is the end of season 5 and I wanted to record a special episode for you.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 It's July 4th, 2019.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 And what I want to talk about today is some real life encounters I've had with demonically possessed people today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 First off, apologies to people who listen to the podcast "Day of" you'll be realizing this episode is late.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 This episode is coming out late. It's 11.40 when I'm recording it right now.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I had recorded it. This is the end of season 5, so I'm going to take a week off after this.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I had recorded a really cool episode, but I realized it was just a standard episode.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 For the end of the season, I like to do something a little special.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 So I recorded the full episode and then went to celebrate the 4th of July.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I hope everyone had a great 4th of July. It's one of my favorite holidays. Not a huge fan of the fireworks, but I'm a huge fan of America.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And if you can't tell, I'm a little drunk.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 But it's really cool. I really like the 4th of July.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So let's go ahead. I want to record this episode because I like to end the seasons with personal stories.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 This is going to be an interesting one, I think.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Because we're going to talk about my interactions with demons and demonically possessed people.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 This is the collection of stories, but they're going to start. Let's go ahead and start these.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 They're all fairly personal and I may not feel super comfortable telling them.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 There may be a little bit of hesitancy, but I think they're really interesting stuff.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I think it'll inform you a lot about my life.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So we're going to start off with my father.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 My father was a Southern Baptist minister. I grew up in the church.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Actually, you know what? Let's even go farther back.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Because I'm kind of wing in this episode. I know what I want to talk about, but every so often I'll probably go off on a tangent.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I don't know how many jokes are going to be in this episode because they're fairly personal stories.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 My grandfather, he's passed away now. Cliff Miller, great man, great great man.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 He's passed away, though.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And he said that he always had the calling to be a minister himself.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But he chose not to go that path.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 He was a country musician and he was the foreman of a construction company, which worked out very well in the end.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Because he retired and got nice benefits and him and his, him and my grandma, they both passed away.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 They both love him so much, but they both passed away.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But it ended up working well for them. He retired. He had great benefits, great retirement.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And he continued to play music pretty much up until a year or two before he passed away.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 He played at most of his grandchildren's weddings and most of his children's weddings and state fairs and stuff like that.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Miller Highlifes, who was the name of the country, Western man.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 But what happened was he had a calling to the ministry.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 But he didn't want to go into the ministry. He resisted the call.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And once my grandma told me this story, she said, "You know, Grandpa felt compelled to join the ministry.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 He didn't want to." And he fought against it.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And for the longest time when he would sleep, he would dream of demons assaulting him, punishing him, after him, for not going into the ministry.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Now, I don't think the demons were actually attacking him because he wasn't being a ministry.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I don't think if anything, if it wasn't the dreams weren't based on the guilt of him not following the path that the universe set out for him,

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I think that it was more of a case that without being a minister, he would open himself up to these type of influences.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Now, he was a good man. He never really did anything too wrong, you know.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Raised us right. He was a good man.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But those dreams haunted him for a long time.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 That's just a little forward to the type of stories you're going to be talking about today.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So my father becomes a Southern Baptist minister.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And one of his first preaching assignments is at Colton.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Colton Baptist Church, I believe was the name. It was in Southern California, where I spent a good chunk of my childhood.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 He was the main minister at Colton Baptist Church.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And he said when he started there, he knew a man who he went to college with.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 So he went to California Baptist College in Riverside. That's where I grew up.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And one of his friends who also went to CBC ended up being a deacon at Colton Church.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And he asked when he went there, his friend was no longer working there.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And he asked one of the other deacons, "Hey, what happened to so-and-so? How come he doesn't work here?"

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And his buddy goes, "He saw something. He saw something in the church when he was here by himself."

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 My dad's like, "What?"

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Deacon says, "Yeah, a good man. He's a good deacon."

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 But one day he was in the church by himself and he saw something here and it scared him so badly he quit.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Never came back to the church.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 My dad's like, "Really? Like, I know the guy. He doesn't seem like the type of guy to do that."

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But the other deacon was like, "Yep, that's what happened."

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 A couple of months later, my father ran into his buddy who used to work at Colton.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And he said, "Hey, man." He kind of joked about it. He goes, "Hey, so I heard something happen at the church and you quit."

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And my dad says, "My friend's face went white. It's petrified."

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And he put his hand on my father's shoulder and said, "It's not a joke. You know me. I saw something there."

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 See, Colton had, like most churches, had intricate stained glass windows all around the church.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 But at the front of the church where the crosses, where the pulpit is and all of that stuff, there's a large stained glass window.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And the deacon said one day he was in there alone and he was praying and he heard a noise, an unearthly noise, a noise that you shouldn't ever hear.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 It was the sound of glass shifting, a noise that most of us wouldn't even be able to describe.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 These stories are 100% true as far as the fact that the people who told them I trust.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And he looks up, the deacon looks up at the stained glass window. And it was just a pattern.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 There was nothing, there was no, as far as I can remember, because I went to the church all the time, there was no cross.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It was just a beautiful collage of multicolored glass.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 But he said he looked up and he saw the glass shift.

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And the stained glass windows, if you don't know, I guess I should say this real quick, it's multi pieces of glass.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 There's like a little piece of like a metal embossing.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And then there'll be like a blue shard and then another piece like a yellow shard and another piece of red shard.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And there's always like these metal lines in between it. It was this multicolored glass.

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 It wasn't a single piece. And he looks up and he's watching the shapes of the glass shift.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And within a few moments there is a recognizable image.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Now before it was just a collage of multicolored glass.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But as he's watching and he's watching the shapes shift, it makes the image, the unmistakable image of a serpent symbolically a creature associated with the devil.

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Now whether or not it became a serpent or it became a lollipop, the point of the story is that he watched something that is not possible physically happen in front of him.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And not only that, it became an image associated with Satan, the adversary of God.

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 He quit and never returned to Colton.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 My father is a very logical man.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So even though a friend of his that told him this that he really trusts, he kind of brushed it off.

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Maybe a little bit of superstition. My father was the type of person who generally in southern Baptist households, they try to stay away from any iconography which can be associated with evil.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 One of those symbols is the owl.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 You will very rarely see portraits or statues or anything resembling an owl in the home of southern Baptist house.

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 They consider that to be an evil omen.

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 My father because of that bought a painting of an owl and hung it in her house.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 He is not a superstitious person.

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 We always had a picture of a beautiful owl in our house.

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So he kind of brushed it off, but he continued to preach at Colton for the beginning of his career.

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But one day he comes home from work and he tells my mom a story.

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 We heard the story later, not immediately, but when the following weeks he opened up to us.

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 He said what happened was he was praying by himself in the church and he heard a loud noise upstairs.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 We are talking about Southern California. This was in the 1980s.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So the gang epidemic was starting.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 My dad at the same time, he worked at the church.

106
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 He went to college. He also worked at Castle Park, which at the time was the world's largest arcade as a security guard in Southern California.

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 His job was when gang bangers would come in to hit him on the head with a night stick.

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Totally different in the 1980s. People would come in wearing red, wearing blue, start mouthing off.

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 My dad would hit him over the head with a night stick.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He's not someone who tends to get scared.

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And I can tell you a ton of stories about my father in that type of setting.

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 But he's praying in the church.

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Here's a noise upstairs. So his first thing is this isn't a very good neighborhood.

114
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Someone must have broken into the church.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 So he goes upstairs and he starts looking around. He's totally alone in the church.

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Doesn't find anybody.

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It's like, okay, must have been my imagination.

118
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 He goes back downstairs. He's now in front of the pulpit and he's praying.

119
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 He's meditating. He's thinking about what his next sermon is going to be.

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 He's communicating with God. And here's the noise again.

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Sounds like someone's upstairs knocking stuff around.

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Now he knows there's no one upstairs. He checked the whole place out. There's no one up there.

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 He knows what happened to his friend, the deacon.

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And he knows that part of being a minister is being distracted.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 He'd always talked about distractions, things that are out to distract people who are on the path.

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And I'm sorry if this episode is a little Christian heavy, but I hope that you enjoy the personal story.

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So he continued to pray and the noise would get louder and louder and louder.

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And it was the noise of someone banging stuff around upstairs.

129
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And no matter how much he prayed, no matter how much he focused on not getting distracted,

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 the noise simply got louder.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And he finally said, I have to find out the source of that noise.

132
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 He stops praying and the noise is continuing.

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 He begins making his way through the church all alone. It was a two-story church.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Begins making his way through the church and he hears the noise coming from the choir room.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And he enters the choir room and there is a closet full of robes.

136
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And he hears the noise and it sounds like someone is just pounding against the inside of this closet.

137
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And he approaches it. He's walking towards the closet and the noise is just getting louder and louder and louder.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And he opens up the closet door and everything goes quiet.

139
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 There's nothing in there. But the robes are slightly moving.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He continued to preach at that church. He didn't let that scare him away.

141
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 But years later I heard another story. This time we're going to shift to a story that my uncle had told me.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 My family's fairly religious family.

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 My uncle was out on a religious camp, a religious retreat with his church.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And he said they were all sitting around the campfire, the minister, the minister's wife,

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 the parishioners of the church and my uncle.

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 It's a beautiful night out. It's warm.

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 You feel the Lord where you're at. You're around other people who believe in what you believe in.

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 You are at peace.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And the minister says, "Let's all close our eyes and bow our heads in prayer."

150
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Which is very typical among the Christian religion.

151
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So everyone closes their eyes and bows their head including my uncle.

152
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And as they're praying, the minister is saying, you know, the standard,

153
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 "Thank you Lord for all that you've given us. Thank you Lord for keeping us together, making us a family."

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Something prompts my uncle to open his eyes.

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And he's the only one who does.

156
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And in the flicker of the flame, my uncle said he was looking at the minister.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And then he looked at the minister's wife.

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And as the minister was administering this prayer,

159
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 the minister's wife sitting next to her husband as he delivers this holy prayer,

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 her eyes are open and slightly rolled back in her head.

161
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Her tongue is sticking out and moving wildly around her mouth.

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 [moaning]

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And he looked at her and he thought,

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 "She's mocking him. She's mocking her husband. She's mocking the Lord."

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And her eyes just sat there, white, tongue wildly moving from side to side without making a noise.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 No one else heard it. No one else saw it.

167
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 My uncle just closed his eyes and pretended he didn't see it.

168
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Didn't say anything to anyone that night.

169
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Didn't say anything for a year or two until he told my mother and my father that story.

170
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 He said, "It seemed to me that she was mocking God.

171
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It seemed to me that something was wrong with her."

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Now obviously the implication there is that she was possessed.

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Demonic possession is an interesting thing because it's something that the church,

174
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 pretty much all churches worldwide, at least Western religions,

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 have terms and cures and things to look for with people who are demonically possessed.

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And the scientific community goes, "Oh yeah, those things actually happen,

177
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 but we think it's this medical thing."

178
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 So it's not one of those things that science can say, "We don't believe in UFOs."

179
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Science will say, "We believe that people can act possessed, but these are why.

180
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 They have to do this mental illness or this type of chemical poisoning or whatever."

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So it's not something that science dismisses out of hand.

182
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 They also see these symptoms. They just think the cause is something else.

183
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 As opposed to science just saying, "Bigfoot doesn't exist, UFOs don't exist, ghosts don't exist."

184
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 They'll say, "Yes, people do act weird and they wag their tongues and they flip around and stuff like that,

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 but it's not a demon, it's X."

186
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So they admit that the symptoms are real. The only disagreement is the cause.

187
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 So I remember hearing those stories when I was younger.

188
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And I remember once, I'll tell this story real quick. This wasn't on the itinerary, but I'll tell this story real quick.

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 I remember once, so I was really sick and I was sleeping in my bedroom.

190
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Me and my little brother shared a bedroom and this was about '87 when we lived in Alameda.

191
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 I was sleeping in my bedroom and I was really, really sick, so my father was sleeping in my little brother's bed to keep an eye on me.

192
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And my mother was, my little brother was sleeping with my mom in their bedroom.

193
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 My little brother wasn't doing too good either. I think we were both sick with something.

194
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And what happened was my dad, there was a hallway separating the two rooms.

195
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 "Maric, you can visit this house if you want to. It's right next to Alameda Baptist Church."

196
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 "Maric's a listener, he lives in Alameda."

197
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So I'm sleeping in my bedroom, my father's sleeping in my little brother's bed, my little brother's sleeping in bed with my mother.

198
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And my dad wakes up early in the morning, two or three in the morning, and he hears the sound of a child crying.

199
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And he's thinking, "Oh, Christopher must be really sick. That's my younger brother."

200
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 "I can hear him crying."

201
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 "Well, I'm sure my lovely wife will take care of it."

202
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 But he keeps crying and eventually my dad goes, "I better check on him."

203
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 "I better check on him so he gets out of bed."

204
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And he leaves my bedroom and he goes into the hallway.

205
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And when he goes into the hallway, my mother is standing there.

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And they look at each other for a second.

207
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And my mom says, "I thought Jason was crying. I could hear him crying."

208
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 My dad just looked at her, then looked down towards the floor.

209
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And in between the both of them, they heard the sound of a child crying.

210
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 In the middle of the empty hallway at two in the morning.

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I remember the next night when we woke up, my father actually had a meeting with me and my brothers.

212
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And he says, "Listen, I got to talk to you guys."

213
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 He goes, "This is what happened last night. I told us the story I just told you."

214
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And he says, "Listen, here's the thing. This is part and parcel with being in the ministry."

215
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "You're going to attract these type of forces."

216
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 These are things to look out for boys.

217
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And like a father would tell a child how to like a boy scout, how to light a fire, how to use a pocket knife.

218
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Or how to catch a ball.

219
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 The things that fathers tell their kids to help them grow as young boys.

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 He sat us down and talked to us about what to expect.

221
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 He goes, "You don't have to worry anything about demons. They can't hurt you."

222
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 "You don't have to worry anything about ghosts. They can't hurt you."

223
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 But these are things you may encounter in this house.

224
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Stuff may move around. You may hear noises calling from a dark hallway.

225
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 You may hear things that will frighten you.

226
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 But don't worry. You are protected.

227
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Interesting conversation that a father has to have with his boys.

228
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 But he felt it was necessary.

229
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Now, I never experienced anything in that house.

230
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 But I experienced things after that on my own.

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 I remember once, now at this point, I'm probably like 23, 24.

232
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 I'm driving through Sacramento.

233
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I'm driving down Madison Lane.

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And I get to the Hazel intersection.

235
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 So I'm driving down Madison and it intersects with Hazel Avenue.

236
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Those are the two major thoroughfares through Orangevale,

237
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 which is where I spent most of my time in Sacramento.

238
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And I remember sitting at a stoplight.

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And I see a car on Hazel getting ready to turn on Madison.

240
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And I'm looking at the car. And what draws my eye to this car?

241
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And this is probably just the normal day.

242
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 This wasn't around Halloween. It was in the middle of the year.

243
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And I'm looking at a guy.

244
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And he's sitting at the intersection.

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And he's wearing a clown mask.

246
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Traditional clown mask.

247
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 White face makeup, red nose, big red puffy hair.

248
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Normal clothes. He wasn't necessarily wearing a clown outfit.

249
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But he was wearing full-on clown makeup.

250
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And I'm thinking that's weird.

251
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And I notice there's two kids in the backseat of this car.

252
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Could be a guy going to a costume party in a weird time of the year.

253
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Could be a professional clown. I don't know.

254
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 But his light turns green and he starts to turn.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Now I'm sitting there.

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And as he's making a turn, he gets closer and closer to me.

257
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And I go, "Man, that's an amazing looking clown mask."

258
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Like, "Look at those teeth."

259
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And that's when I realize that this guy isn't wearing a clown mask.

260
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 He's wearing a monster clown mask.

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 So whatever he was trying to do, he was trying to be spooky.

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Full clown mask. And it had these large razor sharp teeth

263
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 jetting from his gums.

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Now again, we've all seen creepy clown masks.

265
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 It wasn't anything that struck me on.

266
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 But as I'm sitting in the road and his car is getting closer and closer to mine

267
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 as he's turning, I go, "How...

268
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 How does that mask look so realistic?"

269
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Because as the car was turning, he was talking to whoever was in the car.

270
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And I could see, I swear, this is so bizarre,

271
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 but I could see the musculature in his face.

272
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 I could see the teeth move ever so slightly.

273
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I could see the gums recede as he spoke,

274
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 exposing more of these sharp needle point things.

275
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And as he drove past me and I got a really close look at him,

276
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I realized, that's not makeup.

277
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 That's not a mask.

278
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 The best Hollywood special effects could not make a man look like a monster,

279
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 as much as he looked like a monster.

280
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And I thought, the most disturbing part of what I'm seeing

281
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 is the people in the back seat are not reacting to it at all.

282
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Nobody is. No one around me.

283
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 No one's pointing. No one's looking.

284
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 The children in the back seat are talking to whoever is in that front seat

285
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 as if they looked normal now.

286
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Could be they're used to seeing a man wearing a disgustingly realistic clown outfit in front of them.

287
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But as the car drove past,

288
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 then I could actually see the muscles of the cheek move

289
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 realistically, incredibly realistically,

290
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 in the way that the teeth and the gums and the lips pushed against each other as it spoke.

291
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I realized that is a human, but something else.

292
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And you're thinking, Jason, you just saw a man in a suit,

293
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 but I saw something similar a few years later.

294
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I'm sitting in a drive-through of a fast food restaurant.

295
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I'm just hanging out, waiting for my food.

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 We didn't have cell phones.

297
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 You just had to wait patiently for stuff.

298
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And I'm watching the people in front of me.

299
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Now it's Sacramento, and Sacramento is full of weird people.

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 But as I'm sitting behind this car,

301
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 the passenger is talking to the driver, normal conversation.

302
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 You can just see them kind of moving their hands, gesturing,

303
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 kind of moving their hands, talking,

304
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 never show often to look out the window,

305
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 turn back to the driver, say a few more words.

306
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And the driver was violently and as hard as she could,

307
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 punching herself in the face as hard as she could,

308
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 as her neck twitched uncontrollably.

309
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I'm watching her head turn from side to side faster than is possible.

310
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 So fast you could see the blur of her face as she turned to the passenger,

311
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 then spun back, almost in a whiplash type action,

312
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 and punching herself in the side of the face as hard as she could.

313
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It looked like someone in the throes of an epileptic fit.

314
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But what was very odd is one,

315
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 people who have that type of epilepsy don't drive their cars.

316
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And secondly, the passenger continued the conversation

317
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 like there was nothing wrong.

318
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And every so often, she would turn towards the passenger

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and it would actually see her head kind of get stuck in a spasm.

320
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 It would go "err, err, err" and then snap back.

321
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And she would punch herself right in the face.

322
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Sometimes it was like I could see her left fist just punching her right in the nose.

323
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Sometimes her right hand was just hitting her side of the head as hard as she could.

324
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And the passenger just continued to play with her hair

325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 as she looked out the window, turned back, and continued her conversation.

326
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 So we have two incidents of me seeing something that's impossible.

327
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 One is an incredibly realistic clown-esque creature.

328
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 No makeup, no mask.

329
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Nothing like that is realistic as what I saw.

330
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And the people in the back not reacting to it in any sort of way.

331
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Maybe they are used to a creature in their front seat

332
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 or maybe he's a professional monster clown

333
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 who can do on-the-fly special effects greater than any movie studio.

334
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Maybe the woman driving the car in front of the drive-through was hardcore epileptic

335
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 and she just happened to be a good driver

336
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and the person was used to watching another human smash her face and made a conversation.

337
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Possible. Unlikely though. Very, very unlikely.

338
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Now all of this stuff, all of these stories may seem unconnected.

339
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And maybe they are.

340
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 But I think the issue was is that because I could see them, they could see me.

341
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 They could watch me and watch the expression on my face

342
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 and see how I'm reacting to them even though they appear human to everybody else.

343
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I believe they can notice that I noticed them.

344
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Because a while after that last sighting started the lost summer.

345
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 The lost summer is a period of time when things got weird.

346
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Really weird.

347
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 You know it's funny after I moved up to Hood River in 2011. That fall.

348
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Next year I was talking to a friend of mine and she goes,

349
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 "You know what? I swear to God she said this."

350
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 She goes, "You know what Jason? I get the feeling that you saved the world."

351
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I just kind of looked at her.

352
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Because as little memory as I have,

353
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I do know that something important happened during the lost summer.

354
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
