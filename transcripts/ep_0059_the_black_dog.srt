1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 A delusion that makes you think that those closest to you have been replaced by robots and clones

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,760
 and did a ghostly murderous black dog once stalked the halls of a British prison.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:24,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,520
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. It is the beginning of September,

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,480
 which means one thing. It's almost October. October not only is my birth month. October 4th is my

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,920
 birthday. We'll do something special on that. That's kind of pathetic, but anyways, it's October.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,640
 So more importantly, no, my birthday is pretty important, but also equally important is Halloween.

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
 So we're gonna have some cool stuff. I'm really looking forward to doing

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,080
 the Halloween stuff. I've always been a, for whatever reason, a huge fan of Halloween

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,240
 episodes of otherwise normal television shows. And I've always thought it must be so cool for

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,560
 like the cast and the crew and the writers and all that stuff to be able to do something completely

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,200
 different once a year. Like, you know, you know, they can have that Christmas special and maybe

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,440
 Santa Claus might show up, but when Halloween comes around, you can actually have like an

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,760
 otherwise normal sitcom with paranormal activity. And I remember that the sitcom Martin

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:34,560
 on Fox did a ghost episode where there was a ghost of a white man. Okay, so Martin was a

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,240
 comedy on Fox starring Martin Lawrence and it had four main primary characters. They were all black.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,240
 And I remember I was watching it. I must have been around 14 or 15 and it had this weird racial

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,960
 component because there's basically like this, it's this sitcom with like, they're just like

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,080
 partying and dancing and dating and stuff like that. And then there's like this, this unholy

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,240
 white man like stalking them in their house, like where they have all this fun. And I remember

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,600
 like, this is kind of an odd, why don't they just have Martin play a funny ghost? Why do they have

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,360
 this creepy ghost in there? And I remember watching it and the episode ends if I remember correctly.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
 The episode ends, I remember being really creeped out by this really scared by this.

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
 Martin and Gina, his girlfriend are laying down on the couch and they fall asleep and then walking

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,880
 behind the couch appears the apparition of this old white dude and he begins to go to choke them

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,280
 to death. And then he changes his mind and fades away. Now I have a, I already have issues with

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,160
 like sleeping in public. I also have an issue with couches in the middle of living rooms. To me,

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,760
 couches should always be against a wall because I don't want anyone hiding behind my couch. It has

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,840
 nothing to do with any sort of feng shui or any sort of like structural integrity to the couch.

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,040
 A couch should be pressed against the wall. So when I walk into a room, I know for a fact there is

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,160
 nobody hiding behind it. Part of me thinks that that fear of couches in the middle of living room

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,280
 may be because of that episode. I'm not saying 100%. I've lived in houses where couches have been in

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,040
 the living room and I don't remember being particularly creeped out. But I've always been

35
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,480
 creeped out of the idea of like sitting on a couch and someone like slowly creeping up behind you

36
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
 and they're like putting their hands on the top of the couch, but you don't notice and then they're

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,920
 like slowly rising up above you. Creepy. But so again, I've always been fascinated by Halloween

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,040
 episodes of shows. I think that's always a fun, a fun little thing. And so we're going to be doing

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
 our own version of that. We're going to be doing some cool stuff rolling out in October and I'll

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,200
 tell you more about that as we move forward. Let's go ahead and get on with the episode. We

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,760
 have some interesting stories for you today. We're going to go ahead and start with our first story,

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,760
 which is, it's just weird. I think the way the human brain works is very weird. It's a very

43
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,120
 complicated machine and anything that's complicated, a little thing can cause some big problems.

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,800
 Now there was a woman named Mary. I don't believe that's her real name. This is in,

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,240
 I found this link on Psychiatric Times and it has everything sourced through there, but it's

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,560
 sourced to medical journals that you would actually have to go and get access to. There was

47
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,160
 no other links to this, but so there was a woman named Mary and she believed that her nine-year-old

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,600
 daughter wasn't her daughter. And I'm not saying it's not biological that she didn't give birth to

49
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,320
 her, but that her true daughter was taken away and replaced with this clone, with this doppelganger.

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
 She would show up at her daughter's school sometime to pick up her daughter, believing

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,880
 her daughter was there. And when she saw this little girl, she would begin screaming, "Where's

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,760
 my daughter? Who has my daughter? Give me my daughter back." The little nine-year-old girl would

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,120
 just kind of be stunned, school officials would be like, "What's going on?" She believes that one

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
 time she was driving on the road and she saw her true daughter in a car with someone else and when

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,120
 they noticed her seeing them, they took off. She would say that, she would say that sometimes

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 she would be talking to her real daughter, who would show up occasionally, and then when she would

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,280
 turn to talk to her face to face, she would believe not that she had been fooled, but that her real

58
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,200
 daughter was standing behind her just moments ago, but when as she was turning her head, her real

59
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,920
 daughter was taken away by somebody and immediately replaced with the doppelganger. And eventually,

60
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,280
 you know, obviously social services gets involved with this because she's making a

61
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,200
 she's making a scene at school. The little girl's being upset. The little girl said,

62
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,040
 her response to all of this is, "I love my mother except for when she doesn't believe I'm me."

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,080
 And they took the mother and they started to put her on medication and it wasn't working. They

64
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,400
 upped it, it wasn't working, put her in therapy, that wasn't working. And eventually, they did have

65
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,280
 to remove the daughter from the home because the threat of violence was too high. She was acting out,

66
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,120
 she truly didn't believe that this was her daughter. What she was diagnosed with was

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,920
 something known as CapGraw syndrome. CapGraw delusion is what it is. And it's the inability

68
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,840
 to recognize people. Now, it's not like facial blindness. You can, there are people who have

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,440
 facial blindness. I personally feel I have a little bit of facial blindness, but it's only

70
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,840
 towards men where I can see a woman, especially an attractive woman, but I can see a woman and

71
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,920
 I'll know, "Hey, I met her before, but I can walk past the same guy five times and go, 'Hey,

72
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,480
 how are you doing?' Like, I won't realize that I've talked to that stranger five times." It could

73
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,600
 just be that I'm not particularly paying attention to men and I'm always paying attention to women.

74
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,760
 And it could just be that I have other things on my mind. But facial blindness is where you look

75
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,640
 at someone and you don't know who they are, your brain can't register their face. You don't recognize

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,160
 them at all. CapGraw solution is something much, much different. You look at someone and you recognize

77
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,040
 them physically, but you don't recognize them emotionally. So you can look at your father

78
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,560
 and go, "This person is 100% physically my father, but that's not my father." It's not as rare as we

79
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,000
 used to think it was. And what's interesting about it is we don't know what causes it or how it works,

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,600
 but there's been a lot of very interesting theories about it. It has a lot of interesting

81
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,520
 parallels to folklore. So one of the big theories that has come out recently, and I thought this

82
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,840
 was fascinating, was that there's two ways that we remember people. One is by looking at them,

83
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,600
 and the other one is our skin has an electrical reaction when we're around people that we know

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,160
 and have tight bonds with. And you can measure it. They actually have this device, this galvanic

85
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,200
 nadir. I was reading about MIT had made one of these things, and it's a glove that will light up,

86
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,680
 and it will light up whenever your skin becomes more conductive to electricity. And the glove

87
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,880
 that they made was kind of a basic thing. It could light up if you were basically, if you saw someone

88
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,440
 that you'd find attractive or famous, it would light up if you're reading an interesting passage

89
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,360
 in the book because your body's basically becoming this electrical battery. But we have a slider

90
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,320
 version of it, not so advanced where it's lighting up a bulb, where when you see somebody you know,

91
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,600
 you're unconsciously remembering the emotions that they've given you and their history,

92
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,880
 their emotional history. So if I can look at my best friend and say, "Oh, I know her,"

93
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,400
 and then I can also remember in all those good times we spent together,

94
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:49,840
 my skin's registering that. And both of those work to create memories. It's not just about the

95
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,240
 brain. It's about the chemical reaction, the electrical reaction in your body, which is fascinating

96
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,880
 because again, we think all of this stuff is brain related. So one of the theories is that what cap

97
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,640
 bra dilution is, is a breakdown between the brain and the, basically the skin. There's a breakdown

98
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,320
 between that. So you're looking at someone and you remember all of the physical memories,

99
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,400
 but you remember none of the emotional memories. It's like a blank slate, which is terrifying.

100
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,520
 If you turned around and saw someone that you knew for the past 20 years and you looked and you had

101
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,920
 no emotional connection to them whatsoever, you're not getting any sort of read off of them,

102
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,800
 you don't remember ever sharing any emotional time with this person. But they look exactly like

103
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,320
 that person. You would think this person's a clone, this person's a robot. You can't really

104
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,080
 fault, if you don't have access to that information, you can't really fault someone for believing.

105
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,200
 There's all sorts of theories on what it causes us. It normally affects people with schizophrenia,

106
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,840
 but it also, head injuries can do it. You can get hit in the head so hard that you develop this

107
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,760
 dilution. And it usually happens with loved ones. It's not so much just people walking down the

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,520
 street. It's normally people that you do have an emotional connection with. So again, I think

109
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,040
 that's why the skin, the skin electrical impulses plays a big part into it. It's, and it usually

110
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,640
 happens to women. It's not very common among men. It's not, it used to be considered a female disease

111
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,280
 and, but it just now, they're just saying it's more likely to happen with women. So I don't know.

112
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,760
 Maybe that has to do with the emotional context of it as well. Maybe if men aren't tying so

113
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:35,280
 much emotion into relationships, who knows? I think the idea itself is, is what, what's creepy

114
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,960
 about it is that your brain can trick you into believing something that is not true. Your brain

115
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,280
 can tell you can, you can be looking and gaining information and instead of this little conscience

116
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:55,360
 on your shoulder, your brain itself is going, that's not her. That's not her. Creepy. And you know,

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,280
 the way that this ties into folklore is you've, you know, there's always been stories about

118
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,240
 changelings about if you, you know, people's babies being taken away at night and being replaced by

119
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,880
 another baby. And the goal is, is that you raise this changeling instead of the baby. Your baby's

120
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,720
 been taken away to fairyland and you're raising a fake baby. And in those old legends, the way to

121
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,280
 get your original baby back sometimes is to beat the crap out of the fake baby. There was one old

122
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,760
 legend where the woman was instructed to put the fake baby into the oven and then her real child

123
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:40,160
 returned. So, so you have to wonder, were some of these delusions going on back then? And they

124
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,360
 didn't know what they were. They had no idea how to explain something like this because it's fairly,

125
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,440
 you know, you wouldn't be able to be like, well, no, it's the way that your skin conducts electricity.

126
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,880
 They didn't even know what electricity was. And you have to wonder how many times things just

127
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,880
 weird incidents has happened throughout history where someone's come home. It's very sudden. You

128
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,800
 can come home from work and you see your wife and she's not your wife. Nowadays, we have testing and

129
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,240
 protocol and the wife would be like, yeah, of course I'm your wife. And after about a week of him

130
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,320
 insisting he's not your wife, she's not your wife, you would go to a medical professional or the law

131
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,000
 enforcement or whatever. But, you know, a hundred, 200 years ago, you maybe get a priest involved

132
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,120
 and even farther back than that a thousand years ago, you would probably just wait it out until

133
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,560
 he chopped you up with an axe. And why does he care? You're not really his wife. It's creepy.

134
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,320
 And that person would then go on the rest of their lives going, well, I wonder where my real

135
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,520
 wife went as there's like a body rotting in their garden. Just go about your business. I hope my

136
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:55,120
 real wife comes home soon. Hey, Johnny, yeah, you got my shoes ready? Oh, where's Johnny? I'm glad

137
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,600
 that became like a twist ending to like a serial killer running through town with an axe in Old

138
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,960
 England. But that's what it would do. Anyone you had an emotional connection with eventually you,

139
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,760
 that same system may develop because eventually you go into town and maybe you don't recognize

140
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,920
 anybody. They've all been taken by clones. Creepy. Human brain is a very advanced machine, but

141
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:24,240
 very tricky machine as well. Hey, ghouls and guys. Do you like to get spooky and stay spooky?

145
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,960
 next story. This story really creeps me out when I heard about it. So you know the thing about prison

146
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,480
 is on the one hand prison is just another place to live. You do meet a bunch of scummy people in

147
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,200
 there. So that's not good. I mean the chances of me running into a child molestine cannibal out here

148
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,800
 is almost zero, but in prison those chances go considerably up. There are people, a lot of

149
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
 people in prison for you know minor crimes, theft, drug possession. I had a friend who was in prison.

150
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,280
 I think it was tax evasion or something like that. And menbezelman is what he went in for.

151
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,560
 He's a nice guy. So you get a weird mix. But what creeps me out about prison is you can't go

152
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,240
 anywhere. And you're like obviously Jason, that's the point of a prison, but if something goes wrong

153
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,200
 you're stuck. Now you know I like I said I finished Twin Peaks the other day. There was a scene early

154
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,440
 on I think it was episode three of Twin Peaks. There was a man played by Matthew Lillard oddly

155
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,680
 enough. There was a lot of cameos in that movie that that television show that I didn't expect.

156
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,160
 But so Matthew Lillard sitting in a jail cell crying just sobbing and the camera pans over

157
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,480
 slowly, real slowly, because David Lynch loves to take his time and the camera pans over real

158
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:02,080
 slowly until it goes a couple cells down and there's a hobo painted all black, clothes or pitch

159
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,680
 black. The only thing that is is visible really is his eyes. And he's staring right at the camera.

160
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,640
 And that goes on uncomfortably long and then he turns into a ghost face and starts floating

161
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,760
 around the cell. That scene chilled me to the bone. And when you listen to me describe it,

162
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,040
 you're like it's kind of ridiculous, but it creeped me out. Because the thing is is that if

163
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,280
 you're in a prison and there's something like that, you're stuck. Like I think the worst thing to

164
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,440
 be would be to be trapped in a haunted prison. I guess there's probably worse things that can

165
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
 happen in prison, but you're in prison and there's a ghost a couple cells down like here I can like

166
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,120
 leave or I can like, I don't know, keep the lights on or something. But if you're in a cell and there's

167
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,920
 like a monster next to you, there is another jail monster later on in Twin Peaks that was

168
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,560
 equally terrifying. He's ripping his face off and yelling the whole time. But yeah, you're stuck.

169
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,120
 So when I came across the story of the Black Dog of Newgate, I was like, oh, this is like a great

170
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,240
 combination of a couple of my fears. I'm not a huge fan of dogs either, but I've gotten better

171
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,840
 with that. So this story is an old English legend. When people say that they still see the Black

172
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,160
 Dog of Newgate today, still where that prison is. So the way the story goes, this is back during the

173
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,800
 reign of King Henry III. So we're in England. There was a horrible famine going on. And at the same

174
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,440
 time, there was this scholar who was accused of being a sorcerer. So he was arrested. And they

175
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,880
 take him and they throw him into Newgate prison. And because this famine is going on, the people

176
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,040
 outside the prison are having a hard time finding food. The last thing that the community that the

177
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,680
 society at large is going to worry about is feeding the inmates. So the inmates become cannibals.

178
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,280
 Because they're just, you know, they're just crazy because they need their food. Another bad

179
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,360
 reason to go to prison. Everyone might be accountable. So this scholar is thrown in and almost

180
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,440
 immediately he's descended upon by other inmates and they just tear him to shreds and eat him.

181
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,320
 And they get their little meal for the day. Maybe they save some. Maybe they smoke a little bit of

182
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:16,240
 them, make some jerky. But what happens is a couple nights later, inmates begin to complain that there

183
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:24,800
 is a giant black dog stalking the holes in between the cells. And of course, you know, it's creepy.

184
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,000
 You're trapped in there. You're a cannibal. You're starving. It's pitch black and super hot in there.

185
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,400
 Prison's just stuck in general. And now there's this giant dog walking around your cell. And what

186
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
 happens is one night the dog gets into the cell of one of the inmates and just eats some shreds of

187
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,400
 him. And everyone's just like, oh my God, it's like, eat some. And then a couple nights later,

188
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,960
 it's walking through the cells again, snarling big and black. Blood still dripping off of its

189
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,320
 fangs from its last meal and it breaks into another cell. Eat him up. And this continues. And what

190
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,840
 happens is they start to put together that he's eating everyone who ate the sorcerer. So it's

191
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,520
 obviously if you'd taken a bite of this dude, if you did, someone's like, hey man, you want a little

192
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,920
 bit of this scholar? No, I'm good. Your dog wasn't going to eat you. But if someone's like, hey man,

193
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,560
 you want a you want a toe? Oh yeah, do I'm so hungry? I'll totally eat that dude's ugly old dirty

194
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:25,200
 toe. How dirty was humans back then? It'd be the dirtiest cannibals ever. Anyways, like if I was

195
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,160
 going to cannibalize someone, I would want them to like wash them at least put a little deodorant

196
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
 on them. Anyway, so the dog's walking and it's eating and eventually like it's this countdown

197
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,560
 clock. So if you haven't been eaten yet and you know you ate the sorcerer, you're like, dude,

198
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,640
 we got to get out of here. So there's this huge prison break, a bunch of guards are killed.

199
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,520
 The inmates run out. The dog chases them out. And so even though the inmates get out to freedom,

200
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,840
 they're out of the prison, they're out of Newgate, they're out of this absolute hell hole. The prison

201
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,640
 itself was called a prototype of hell. It was just a terrible place to be. They're out into the free

202
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,360
 English countryside. Yes, there's a famine going on. But at least they don't have to worry about

203
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,680
 being devoured in their cell by this big black dog. But it continues to stalk them and take them out

204
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:20,000
 one by one until finally the last person who ate that sorcerer is killed somewhere in the middle

205
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,760
 of the night in some lonely English field. This black dog is standing over the last man

206
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,160
 who took the sorcerer's life and just was eating his guts, killed him, devoured him,

207
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,280
 got his vengeance, and then left. Now what's interesting is this was a very popular legend.

208
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,720
 It was turned into a series of books, you know, because it ties into everything that we're scared

209
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,120
 of. We're scared of the unknown, we're scared of the evil in humanity, we're scared in retribution.

210
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,480
 We also like the idea of people who do evil acts are eventually punished for them. The book itself

211
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,440
 is based on this, is told by a narrator. And the book itself is interesting because it's very

212
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,360
 clickbaity. So it's interesting. So the book itself says the story that you just read is 100%

213
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,360
 fake. And the narrator of the story of the black dog in Newgate prison is going, "The only black dog

214
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:23,520
 I know of is the one that stands at Limbo, the one that sits there and kills the condemned prisoners,

215
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,160
 the ones that when you were imprisoned in life when you go to Limbo, your brains are dashed out

216
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,400
 from all of your horrible things that you've done." Now right there you go, "Well that's kind of clickbaity.

217
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,480
 That's kind of clickbaity. Like I'm reading this whole book, I'm reading this wood carving book,

218
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,560
 so I'm getting like splinters because I know that's not what a wood carving is, but you know,

219
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,880
 I'm looking at this book that has pictures of made from wood carvings and you get to the end

220
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,200
 and you're like, "What? It's all fake. That's lame." But this legend is actually older than the book.

221
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,920
 So I mean, it could be one of those stories that's completely made up. It's most likely not 100%

222
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:07,120
 factually true, but I think there's this, it does play into a lot of those things that we find creepy.

223
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,600
 They say the legend even predates the book, this idea of prisoners committing some sort of atrocity

224
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,600
 against a man and then his vengeful spirit coming back. Nowadays people go, the ghost still stalks

225
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,480
 the prison and you can look up some times and see the shape moving, all that stuff.

226
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,000
 I think that's tourist trappy stuff, but I think the real truth might lay somewhere in between.

227
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:38,000
 The real truth of a man being wronged in prison and taking vengeance against his captors

228
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,760
 and then the other side of the truth, a man being killed in prison and bringing about the

229
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:51,920
 form of this black dog to take vengeance on his enemies. I think the real truth probably lays

230
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,960
 somewhere in between there. I'm not the type of person to say it's 100% impossible for someone

231
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,440
 to conjure up some sort of creature to take vengeance on their enemies. I will say I think it's

232
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:10,320
 incredibly unlikely. I think that it's probably not super common, but I'm also not going to say

233
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,600
 it's absolutely impossible because I think there's a lot of stuff that can happen. I think this story

234
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,600
 itself is very entertaining. I wouldn't put money on it, that was true, and I'm not buying a playing

235
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,400
 ticket to go out to England to see a big black blur standing on top of a prison, but if anyone

236
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,680
 ever asks me, "Hey, do you know any creepy stories about black dogs?" I tell them this one, and

237
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,640
 that's one thing. I wanted to wrap the episode up with this. I said during my episode about

238
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,760
 Ted Bundy's ghost, I was like, "Stuff needs to be better sourced. This is completely ridiculous,"

239
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,320
 and all that stuff. I think I need to clarify something. There's a difference between an

240
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,920
 interesting ghost story, a creepy ghost story, and a story that purports itself to be true.

241
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,640
 When someone tells me a creepy ghost story, they're not trying to convince me that ghosts exist.

242
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,720
 Generally, they're trying to scare me, and then it's totally fine. That's a form of entertainment.

243
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,680
 This story, the Newgate story, is a story that's supposed to be a morality tale. There's nothing

244
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,440
 wrong with it. I'm not going, "What cell was he in? What's the name of the scholar?" Because that's

245
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,440
 not the point of the story. The Psychology Today article, I mean, I read it multiple times, unless

246
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,400
 they were trying to be tongue-in-cheek. I didn't pick up on it, and the person who wrote the

247
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,880
 articles written books about ghosts and crime scenes and stuff like that. The Psychology Today

248
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,720
 article was trying to be more factual. There wasn't really a creepy ghost story. It was trying to say,

249
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,000
 "Ted Bundy is floating around here." And you can call it, you know, I think the headline was,

250
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,880
 "Is Ted Bundy's ghost still haunting us?" That actually might have been my headline, but you

251
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,600
 know what I mean? Like, you can crib it differently. So I love creepy ghost stories, but if you want

252
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,360
 me to believe in ghosts, you want me to believe in UFOs, you're going to have to source it. And I

253
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,440
 think maybe that distinction was last in that last episode, so I wanted to clarify that. You

254
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,760
 don't have a problem with creepy ghost stories, but if you want people to believe in this stuff,

255
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:01,120
 source them. This story is just to creep us out. It's just to teach us a lesson. And hopefully,

256
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,200
 hopefully, it teaches a lesson that you shouldn't eat people who know more than you do. Don't eat

257
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,840
 scholars. If you're going to eat someone eat like a hobo, or eat like, I don't know, someone who

258
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,480
 you had like, barely passed math. I don't know. That's not good, because I barely passed math.
