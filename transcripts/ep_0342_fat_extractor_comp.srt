00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 Today we return to the city of Malta to take a trip underneath its tunnels to explore more of the mysteries that lie beneath that city.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 I think.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,500
 And then we learn about one of the most disgusting urban legends that I've come across.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:26,500
 Does the country of Spain really have a problem with people eating other people's fat?

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:36,500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carvin or I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Yes, I did say eating other people's fat in the intro and doing other stuff with human fat.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 It's just gonna be a fat, tastic episode.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Pretty gross stuff. We're gonna be getting to that in a moment, but first off,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 let us go to Malta.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Now I'm gonna put a big asterisk next to the story because I'm pretty sure I covered this before.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 This is one of the perils of doing a daily show.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I don't remember. And I've tried all of my tricks to see if I've recorded this episode before.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 You're like, "Jason, what tricks? Just simple memorization?"

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 No, generally if you go to the website, if you go to DeadRabbit.com and go to the podcast page,

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 you'll see every episode I've ever recorded you can listen to online.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And you can even use the search... this isn't like a built-in pitch. This is what I do.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You can use the search tab. And this is why it's so important for me to put show notes

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 because I'll type in Malta or I'll type in tunnels or I'll type in Russian or whatever it is.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And it'll pull up every episode that those words are in the show notes.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 So it's a really good resource for me. You can actually use it too if you're like,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 "What was that episode where he was talking about?" Larry David. Type in Larry David.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 The show notes. So all of that being said, I'm pretty sure I've covered this before.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 But I think I might have just read about it and never covered it. I don't know.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It's totally messing with my head. A conspiracy maybe? Dun dun dun.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I should actually get a sound effect. Now I like doing the noise instead.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Dun dun dun. A conspiracy. Let's go ahead and though, let's hop in the Jason Jalopy.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 We're driving to Malta. Now I'm gonna be honest with you guys, and I don't think this will shock a single one of you.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I'm not for sure where Malta is. But, oh, I know it's somewhere.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So you have the Middle East, and then you have Europe, and then there's that stuff in the middle.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I.e. Italy. Italy is technically part of Europe, but not really.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And so you have Italy, and then I think Malta is somewhere around there.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I don't think it's in Italy. Most likely in Ireland. If the Middle East is the Middle East,

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 and Europe is Europe, what's Greece in Italy?

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Mediterranean! Oh, there we go, Mediterranean.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. We're going to the Mediterranean country known as Malta.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 In Malta, there is a place called the Howe, South Fellini, Hypogeum.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Hypogeum is a fancy word for tunnel or underground structure.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So just call it tunnel. Everyone knows what a tunnel is.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Not everyone knows what a hypogeum is. There's three levels of caves underneath the city of Malta.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Some people say there's more. Some people say there's a lot more.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Some people say that you go through... Some people say that the moon is made of cheese.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So some people say it's kind of useless. But anyways, some people say you can go down to the third chamber,

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 and then there's this little, like, walkway that's, like, super tiny, and you crawl through there,

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 and it opens to even lower portions of the city. There's this old Freudian thing

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 that people who like to be underground really want to crawl back into their mom's womb.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So, like, people who fantasize about building bunkers underground and stuff like that,

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 they really just want to crawl back inside of their mom.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So I don't know what... I personally don't believe that, but there are psychiatrists who, if you said,

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "Oh, I'd really want to go to Malta! I'd really want to walk around underneath the city of Malta for nine months."

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 The psychiatrist is like, "Hmm, tell me more." Apparently your psychiatrist is curming the frog, the rainbow connection.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 So anyways, also that says people who want to build, like, doomsday bunkers.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Does that mean, like, the entire U.S. military living in that mountain where we keep the Stargate,

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 they all want to crawl back into their mom's? I don't know. I think a lot of times,

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 psychiatrists just make stuff up and then other psychiatrists go, "Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Let's also say that ridiculous thing." But anyway, so apparently back in time, everyone wanted to be back inside mom.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And they built this giant city underneath Malta. Or it was a survival mechanism because the city kept getting raided

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 or they wanted to move old-timey drugs. I wonder what old... I wonder what, like, Romans did for cocaine.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 That'll... all that stuff from South America. But I don't believe... I don't think that Europe was, like, totally sober.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Like, sure, they drink, like, ale and mead. But you know there was, like, what was the old-timey equivalent of meth?

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Because it... listen, hear me out here for a second. You're like, "Jason, don't go on these rants.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Tell me about the ghost of Malta." I will in a second.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So if humanity never did methamphetamines or cocaine for 10,000 years or 100,000 years,

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 we're cavemen, we were bastion in the endothal skulls, we take over the planet, we start building societies,

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 we're drinking a little ale on the side, a little mead. And then, all of a sudden, I just answered my own question,

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 but I'm gonna go ahead and go on with this narrative. All of a sudden, in the year 1927, people started doing methamphetamines.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 It should completely destroy... it should have completely destroyed people. It was this new thing.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It was totally different than what had happened before. And as I was explaining that to myself, as I was thinking out loud,

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I realized that actually did happen. I thought about doing an episode on this.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 That's what happened with gin. That's what happened with gin. You had society drinking alcohol, but it was...

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I mean, it was strong, but it was like cider or ale or mead, stuff like that.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Conan's like kicking back casks of it and then going out and just smashing serpent dudes in half.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But then when gin, when this super strong, cheap liquor infiltrated Europe, it completely destroyed economies and towns and stuff like that.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I read this big article on gin recently, and I guess this has become a gin episode, but it's just gone off memory.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I don't remember what the article was. Basically, gin became such a problem that it was considered like the woman's disease

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 or the drink of wasting mothers because women would get so drunk on gin they would pass out and their babies would roll off their boobs.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Trying to breastfeed their baby and the baby would roll away. Kids would just be wandering the street.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 The parents were just completely lousy the whole time. And the government wasn't doing anything about it.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 You had these huge gin companies that weren't letting the government regulate them.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And then they got to the point where it became so, it reversed, it became so like black market, gin did, that you had to go down a street corner.

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 You had to like go down a dark alley and there would be a hole in the wall and you would give someone like a copper coin or whatever their pincis over there.

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And then a ladle would come out with gin and you would put it in a cup and then walk down the street.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Because originally it was just something you'd go to the bar and just drink and it was super disgusting. I hate gin.

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But they didn't think it was super disgusting. That was me editorializing.

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 But you could go to the bar, you could drink it. It was called "Mother's Ruin." That was this nickname for gin.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Completely devastating England society.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And then it became this huge thing where you started regulating it and gin producing companies were getting shut down.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And bars were getting shut down. If they sold gin, you couldn't sell gin anymore.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But that's what people were addicted to.

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 So you were having to drink it out of a dirty ladle in a street alley.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And now you can go to the gas station or not gas station.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Now you can go to a corner liquor store and get leaders of it.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And it's disgusting. It's gross. It's made out of juniper berries.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 But actually that answers the question.

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 If you have a society and then all of a sudden you introduce a new cheap drug and it's not reined in right in the beginning.

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It will destroy the society.

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I don't want to keep going off on rants, but I just saw a documentary about how meth fueled Nazi Germany.

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 There's crosstops are being given out to men and women.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Here take these. They'll keep your pep going and then Hitler was all junked up all the whole time.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Anyways, there's nothing to do with where we're going.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 But I do wonder if there was an equivalent of old timey like hardcore drugs in Roman era and Greek era.

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 That were not just like the oracles were doing it and tripping out and seeing you know Leonidas killing a bunch of Persians.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Like something that was more easily accessible for the common person, but it's just lost the history.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Nothing to do with what we're talking about. We're in the city of Malta now.

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Okay? I just went on that huge rant as we're walking around a dark cave.

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So apparently in these caves in Malta.

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I tell you this part of the story after I already tricked you to coming down here.

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I got you drunk on gin. You're like, "Uh, baby babies are falling off of you."

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 You're like, "I didn't even know I was a mother. There's a bunch of babies are rolling around in the dirt in front of you."

111
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 I'm like, "Pick those babies up. Let's keep going." Apparently the story is this.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Back in 1940. 1940 Malta.

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 There was 30 kids and their teachers. They went on a field trip.

114
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Now they weren't from Iowa. They were like, "Okay kids, field trip. We're going to Malta."

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 They were already in Malta and the field trip was to go into the tunnels underneath the city.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Tell me this doesn't sound like an urban legend.

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 30 kids and their teachers go into underground vault in Malta and they're never found.

118
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 They go missing a couple hours later when they're supposed to come back. No one can find them.

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They start sending search parties for them. Can't find them.

120
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And for days afterwards, mothers throughout the city could hear their kids crying, "Help me! Help me! Help me!"

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Apparently they're falling down. They're falling down huge gaps.

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 "Ahhhhhh!"

123
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 But mothers were saying, "I can hear Bobby. I can hear Bobby in this tunnel down here in the cops."

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 They're like, "We're looking for a man. We're looking for him. But there's no Bobby. There's no 29 other kids in there either."

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And he's falling down a cliff apparently as well either.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 So the idea is that this happened. Now obviously that sounds incredibly stupid.

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And that's why I get making jokes about kids falling down cliffs.

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Because the idea of 30 kids and two teachers going...

129
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 It's not like they were in the tunnels in... What was that dude? Like in the Philippines?

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Remember recently those kids got trapped in that tunnel as though they were filling up with water?

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 We found them. And they were... We didn't have any idea where these guys were.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 They had an idea that they entered into a cave, but even that was kind of spotty.

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I guess they knew that. Otherwise they wouldn't have checked caves.

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 They weren't looking up trees the whole time. But this place wasn't filling full of water.

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It was just a not super well explored thing.

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 But the idea of 30 kids and their teachers just wandering into the tunnels and getting lost and then not being found.

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 No bones, nothing. Yet you could hear the kids crying late at night.

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I mean you would just go, "Hey, stay there and I'm gonna dig down."

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Problem solved. So it sounds ridiculous.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 However, this story was supposedly published in the 1940 issue, in A 1940 issue of National Geographic Magazine.

141
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And what's weird is that the people who dispute this story, who goes, "There's nothing wrong.

142
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 There's nothing spooky about the tunnels of Malta."

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Don't dispute the fact that it was published in National Geographic.

144
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 They say, "Yes, this story was published there."

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 What they dispute is the fact that it's true. They go, "Yes, National Geographic did publish this article."

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 However, we believe they publish it as a cautionary tale to make it so kids don't get lost in these tunnels.

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Since when has National Geographic posted fake news?

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 They've never run a story, "Watch out kids, Boogieman on the loose in the cover."

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Is this holographic Boogieman coming at you?

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Boogieman spotted in your hometown.

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Ask your parents for more details. Come home before the street lights come on kids.

152
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Boogieman, you know, like, they don't do that.

153
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 They don't post fake stuff to scare kids.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 So they don't dispute that the article's real. They just think that it can't be real.

155
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Just like how I assumed it can't be real.

156
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So if the National Geographic published it, then there must have been another reason.

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 But here's the thing. As much as I was joking about kids falling off cliffs and poking holes in the story,

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 the fact that National Geographic did cover it makes it sound more legit.

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 It doesn't make sense as logically as a story, but a major magazine that's been around for over a hundred years

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 that focuses on stuff around the world published a story about it.

161
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So that's all in the show notes. You can see the article yourself.

162
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 There's another component of the story before the kids went missing. Apparently there were...

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Now this one is far more... The lineage of this story is far more ridiculous.

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 There's a woman, a journalist named Lori Jessup, supposedly.

165
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I mean, I don't know if this is a legit person or a pseudonym or whatever, but anyways.

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 So we have the first story was told by National Geographic magazine.

167
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 This one is told by Riley Krabs. Riley Krabs Borderlands Science Magazine.

168
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 So, pfft. I mean, like, that is not a legitimate magazine by any measure.

169
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Right? I'm sure it's a lovely magazine. I'm sure it has a lot of great articles in it,

170
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 but it is not where I'm going to get my historical information.

171
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Lori Jessup apparently writes for Riley Krabs Borderlands Science Magazine.

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 She goes underground. This story is absolutely ridiculous.

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 She goes underground. She's pestering a tour guide.

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 She has her little press cap on. She's like, "Come on, guide. Why don't you give me one of your private tours?"

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 "Wink, wink." And he thinks she's coming on to him. She's like, "No, I'm not that kind of broad."

176
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 "I want to know the real scoop. I want to know the straight dope."

177
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 "I want to know what's really in these tunnels."

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And he's like, "Dude, please. You're the most irritating journalist stereotype ever."

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And she's like, "What do you say? What do you say?"

180
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 So he finally says, "Yes, please, go away. I will allow you to go through this passage

181
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 that I don't normally let people go through."

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So she goes through this passage and apparently a couple other people come with her.

183
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Now this is 1940, so they don't have flashlights. This is like old-timey stuff.

184
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Apparently she's carrying a candle.

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I don't believe that. I don't believe that at all. I've never seen a human carry a candle.

186
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 You know why? Because you get hot wax over you and you're like, "Jason, now you're just splitting hairs."

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Maybe she had some sort of candle holder. Fine.

188
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 She's walking with now. She all of a sudden has a candleabra underground.

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 She's walking through, fan-movey opera style.

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 She goes into the secret passage which people aren't supposed to be in.

191
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And she comes to the edge of a cliff.

192
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 [Gasps]

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 The cliff supposedly is bottomless. That's detail number two. That's utterly ridiculous.

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 But it could just be 10 feet deep and it's super dark.

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Candleabra doesn't reach down there.

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 She stands up and she sees this huge gap.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And on the other side of the gap is this doorway.

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And then these giant white-haired creatures.

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 [Groans]

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Walk out of the darkness, but they're on the other side of the doorway.

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 [Gasps]

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And just then her candle goes out.

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 She's in pitch darkness and she feels something wet.

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Walk by her.

205
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 [Growls]

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Just imagine getting covered in slime and gack.

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Just slide by you.

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 [Groans]

209
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And that panics her, obviously.

210
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And she runs and she goes to run back into her tour group.

211
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And at that point other people are trying to follow out.

212
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And she's like, "Get out of the way! Losers, get out of the way!"

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 White-haired monsters are right behind me and she gets back there.

214
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And she goes, "Ahh."

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 She gets with the tour group and everyone else comes back.

216
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 She doesn't warn them there's a bottomless cliff there, but none of them fall off.

217
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And she's catching her breath and the tour guide apparently looks at her and in her words,

218
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 gives her a knowing look.

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Like, "I told you so, you stupid idiot.

220
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 But you are annoying me, so I let you go."

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 All those words were conveyed with just a simple nod.

222
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And then eventually she leaves the tunnels.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And then she said she wanted to go back again next week.

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 She was scared the first time, but she wanted to know more about the bottomless pit.

225
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 She wanted to know more about the white-haired creatures,

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 the wet monster that slid past her, and the mysterious force known as "wind" that blew her candle out.

227
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 She needed to know all of these things.

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 She goes back into the tunnel.

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 The door she went through is blocked up now.

230
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And when she started asking other tour guides,

231
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 "Hey, where's so-and-so? He was working here last week."

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And we were doing on this tour and everyone goes,

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 "Why that tour guide has never worked here before?"

234
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Ever.

235
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Now people believe that story, by the way.

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 That story is completely stupid, but I think it's funny because here we have two contrasting stories.

237
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 One story is reported in National Geographic.

238
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 It's very, very, it's maybe two paragraphs long.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Basic information.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Kids go missing, no one can find them.

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Parents hear the kids crying at night.

242
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 It's spooky. It may be true, but it just seems very unlikely.

243
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 You think if it was true there would be more news sources covering it,

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 unless it was something the city was trying to cover up.

245
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Now you can no longer walk freely.

246
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 We know that as a fact.

247
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Used to be you could kind of walk freely under the city of Malta.

248
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You can't do that anymore.

249
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And I think that changed around the late 1940s.

250
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So that is not, you can't go down there and walk around.

251
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So something probably did happen, but it could just been a 30-kid spring.

252
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 They're ankle one day or over the course of 30 days. Who knows?

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But anyways, so you have that incident happen.

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And then you have this story that involves Yeti, underground societies, bottomless pits,

255
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 wet slime monsters, a tour guide who never existed, all this ridiculous details.

256
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And both every time you look at the story of the Malta tunnels, both of these stories are connected.

257
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Well, you know, like you'll read the first one and you'll be like,

258
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 "Oh, that is kind of interesting. Why would National Geographic report that?"

259
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And then they go, "Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. If you think that one was a good one, look at this one."

260
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It stars the story of Lori Jessup.

261
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 It's Lori Jessup's great-granddaughter literally nudging you with her press cap on.

262
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Read all about it. Read all about my great-grandma story.

263
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Like, knock it off, dude.

264
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So one is super, like, is totally dialed into what people, all the conspiracy paranormal dudes believe in

265
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 with the hidden societies and magic controlling the wind and all sorts of Pocahontas nonsense.

266
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And then you have a story that's actually realistic, but there's so few details on it.

267
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Who knows? It could be true. It could be not true.

268
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's the Battle of National Geographic versus Riley Crabb's Borderlands Science Magazine.

269
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And in true conspiracy theory paranormal fashion, Riley Crabb, the Riley Crabb crowd, usually wins out.

270
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 The story of a ghost, like last episode, I'll talk about this, last episode was about Haditha Dam.

271
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 The story about a ghost in Haditha Dam, that's fine.

272
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 That's a scary ghost story that US soldiers tell each other so they can, you know, poop their pants.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 But then someone added in the four-horsemen of the apocalypse are trapped underneath it,

274
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 and it's this huge demonic conspiracy monster man stuff going on underneath his dam.

275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 One is at least a slightly realistic ghost in a dam.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And then the other one is just fantasy nonsense.

277
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I mean, whether or not the four-horsemen exist, I don't know.

278
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 But I don't think that they're trapped underneath the hydroelectric dam in Iraq, if they do exist.

279
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Which I'm sure they exist in some form, but again, I'm not going to get into all that.

280
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 So, well, I guess I could, because it is a paranormal podcast, but really I want to talk about fat extractors.

281
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And I'm running out of time. So guys, suck your tummies in.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 But it won't help. It won't help. You'll still look nice and juicy to those fat extractors.

283
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 So, when I use the term "fat extractor," that's a term, those are two English words that are put together.

284
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 "Fat extractor." It's not its own thing, right?

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 If I said, "Oh, I'm a fat seller. I sell human fat." You'd be disgusted.

286
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And you would make sure you weren't eating Twinkies around me.

287
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But you'd go, "Oh." Now, if I'm saying those words in other languages,

288
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 if I said "candle maker" in French, it would be like "candle maker," right?

289
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 It would be another word for "candle maker."

290
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 You could travel around the world. I've learned this this week.

291
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And you could travel around the world and you'll find all sorts of combinations for words.

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 You can go to other countries and English, the word automobile, may take two or three words to say in another language.

293
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Spain has such a problem with people sucking the fat out of other people.

294
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 They have their own terminology for it.

295
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They're called saca... It's close enough to my own old hometown, which is kind of creepy.

296
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Saca... Saca mentecas, which means "fat extractor."

297
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Or mantequero, which is a fat seller, because you have to distinguish those two.

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Some people just love to pull the greasy fat out of you.

299
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Other people are capitalist about it. They want to take that fat and turn it into stuff.

300
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 You can actually get jars, like apocrythary jars.

301
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Now, you can get apocrythary jars here. You can get them with, say, mints on them, or homeopathic nonsense,

302
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 or stuff that doesn't work. Just put it on your mantle, along with all of your homeopathic garbage.

303
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 These ones say "axungia honinis," which means "human fat."

304
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 So you could go to apocrythary in Spain in the 1700s and you'd be like,

305
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 "I need some mint and I need some vat that Jason can't think of a word for."

306
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And then it's just a jar that says "Jason can't think of a word for."

307
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And then I'll take two scoops of human fat.

308
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Spain has such a problem with human fat that there are multiple stories regarding people,

309
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 killing people just to take the fat out.

310
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So many stories. We're going to have to cover them over three episodes.

311
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 This is the first collection. This is going to wet your appetite for some sweet, sweet human fat.

312
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 It's the late 1800s.

313
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 We're falling back through a time port.

314
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Luckily, we're going to Spain, so half the landscape is human fat.

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 We hit the ground, fighting our way out of the fat, the gooey human greasy yellow fat.

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Sorry if you happen to be eating chicken during this segment.

317
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Eating it. You just got your rotisserie chicken. You're all taken a huge bite.

318
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 I knew a guy. So I used to work at Best Buy in Sacramento.

319
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And right across the way, there was a Burger King restaurant.

320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And I've always loved working at... I love working retail,

321
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 but I've always specifically loved working retail where there was restaurants nearby

322
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 because then you never really had to leave anywhere for eight hours to go to a restaurant.

323
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So I was like, "Oh, sweet Burger King. I'm going to walk from Best Buy and go Burger King."

324
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And I remember when I started there, because I was one of the first to pull out this story,

325
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 just opened up like a month before I got started.

326
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 At that time, too, I was actually the fastest promoted member,

327
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 like fastest promoted employee in Best Buy history.

328
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I went from cashier to manager like in a month, or maybe like a month and a half.

329
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I remember there like no one's ever been promoted this quickly.

330
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 But anyways, there's nothing new to the story.

331
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 It should be bragging about working at Best Buy.

332
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I ended up... I'd go to Burger King all the time.

333
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And I remember asking my boss, I go, "Hey, do you ever go to Burger King?"

334
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And he goes, "Never again. Never again."

335
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I'm like, "What? Why?" And he goes, "He went this very first day working at Best Buy.

336
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 He walked over to the Burger King. He got a grilled chicken sandwich.

337
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 He got a grilled chicken sandwich. And he takes a bite out of it.

338
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 And he goes, "Argh!" And his teeth bite...

339
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 You know how human mouths work? His teeth bite into the sandwich.

340
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And then what you normally do is you move the sandwich away from your mouth

341
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 and go "um, num, num" and you eat it.

342
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 You bring it to your mouth, take a bite, then you pull the sandwich away from your mouth

343
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 and then you chew the peas. It's a weird human thing.

344
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 You don't keep the burger right next to your mouth and go "um, num, num, num, num, num, num."

345
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You take a bite and then you drop your hands.

346
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 He said, "I take a bite of the sandwich, arh!"

347
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And then he goes, "As I pulled the sandwich away from my mouth, there was a vein coming from his mouth

348
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 from the bite he had taken. And the vein was this gooey, stretchy thing.

349
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And as he moved the sandwich away, the vein kept stretching longer and longer.

350
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And he's just looking at this thick, red vein coming from his mouth, disappearing into the meat of the chicken of the sandwich.

351
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And he said he would never, he threw it away and he said he would never eat a burger king ever again.

352
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I thought that was a funny story.

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 But anyways, so this dude, we're in Fatland, aka Spain.

354
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 There's this guy named Juan Diaz de Guerreo.

355
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 He was killing prostitutes.

356
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 He's actually considered one of Spain's earliest serial killers, if not their first.

357
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 One of the first recorded serial killers in Spain.

358
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Now he started off, he would walk down the street and he would see like an old woman.

359
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Not an old woman, sorry, he would see a poor woman, difference.

360
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 You can be poor and young or poor and old, but you can't be old and young.

361
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 He'd see a young woman who was poor and being like, "Hey, you want to make some money?"

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And she'd be like, "Yes, I would."

363
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 So they would go down an alley and they would bang.

364
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And then he would go, "Here's three reals," which is their currency over there.

365
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And she goes, "That's not enough."

366
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And he'd go, "Fine."

367
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And he goes, "Here's four."

368
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And she goes, "That's not enough."

369
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And then he would choke her to death.

370
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 He'd kill her.

371
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And then that went on for a couple years.

372
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 He kept finding these young women and he would go, "Hey, you look kind of down in your luck."

373
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 She's like, "Yeah, it's been a real kind of crappy year.

374
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Luckily I still have all this sweet, sweet human fat in my body."

375
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And he's like, "That's an odd comment to make."

376
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 She's like, "It is."

377
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 He goes, "Hey, you want to have some sex for money?"

378
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And she goes, "Yeah, sure."

379
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And then he would offer her three bucks or three reals and she would say, "No."

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Then he'd offer her four and she'd say, "No."

381
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And then he'd strangle her.

382
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And then there was this weird thing that he did.

383
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And he was fairly successful at this for a long time.

384
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 People kept finding these bodies around town and they weren't cluing on.

385
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 They weren't like figuring out who this dude was.

386
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Then he just started attacking random people.

387
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 This young girl walks by and he's like, "Hey, knock, knock her on the head."

388
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 No lead up, no sex for money, nothing.

389
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 He's drowning women, he's choking them out.

390
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I thought one of the saddest ones was...

391
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 This was actually one of his last ones.

392
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 He was out in the middle of a country because people were starting to get suspicious.

393
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 He's out in the middle of a country sleeping on her bridge.

394
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 This young woman's coming back from a fair.

395
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And he's like, "Oh, where have you been?"

396
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 She's like, "Oh, I was just from the town fair and I bought this bread and this wine."

397
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And yeah, just kind of having fun.

398
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 He's like, "Oh, that's cool."

399
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And then he beat the crap out of her and ripped her intestines out.

400
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And then sat and drank her wine and ate her bread.

401
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I've always thought, and I've covered that type of thing before,

402
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 not the girl again, her intestines ripped out,

403
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 but that normalcy thing where there was one of the Zodiac killers victims

404
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 with some guy coming home.

405
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 He worked at a Coca-Cola factory for like 30 years.

406
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 His favorite thing was he...

407
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Every day he got like a bottle of Coke and his favorite thing was grabbing his...

408
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 "Hey, buy Harold." I don't remember his name, but...

409
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Yeah, see you guys later.

410
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He grabbed his bottle of Coke and he'd walk home and he'd sit and he'd watch TV and drink his Coke.

411
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 That was his thing.

412
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And Zodiac killer blues brains out.

413
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And that's such a normal thing.

414
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 It's the same thing with her.

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 You have this woman who goes out and she's looking whole week to go to this fair.

416
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 She goes to the fair.

417
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 She buys her bread and she... her wine and she's so happy.

418
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 She's coming back through the countryside.

419
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 It's a beautiful Spanish day and some dude rips her intestines out and then eats her food.

420
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Like, that is such a bizarre...

421
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It's the normalcy of it is what is striking to me.

422
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Though those stories are always more chilling.

423
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Yes, obviously killing prostitutes is just as wrong.

424
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I'm not saying that.

425
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 I'm not saying...

426
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 This woman may have been a prostitute.

427
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 I don't know.

428
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 I'm not saying...

429
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 But I'm saying like the idea of...

430
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 There's just routine things we do.

431
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 That you go to the store, you get...

432
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 You're like, "You know, I can't wait.

433
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I can't wait to go to the store, get my chili beans and rice.

434
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I'm gonna come home.

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 I'm gonna watch a new episode of The Mandalorian.

436
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And I'm gonna go to bed.

437
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Or maybe I'll stay up late and play video games.

438
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And while you're thinking about that, some dude comes out of the darkness and puts a box cutter through you.

439
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 That to me is terrifying.

440
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 That the normalcy being interrupted by violence is terrifying.

441
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Now, this guide...

442
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And to get back to the actual narrative of the story,

443
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 I did not try to ruin your day and to scare you.

444
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 The reason why his modus operandi changed now.

445
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 He'd been drowning women.

446
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He killed dozens of women.

447
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And they don't really even know the full amount of women he killed.

448
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 But, first he was just drowning them and choking them,

449
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 because that was his most affected.

450
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 His first murder was drowning this woman.

451
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 He took her to the river to have sex with her and then drowned her.

452
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 The reason why he ripped this woman's guts out,

453
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 because at this point, when the police are starting to figure out there's a serial killer in the area,

454
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 people are super panicked at this point because there's been tons of bodies found.

455
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Nobody seems to know who this person is.

456
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 People believed he was a sacramentucca.

457
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 He was a fat extractor.

458
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 This was a boogeyman that existed in Spain.

459
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 The story of somebody that a monster really,

460
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 who prays on the populace to eat their fat,

461
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 or to turn their fat into medicine,

462
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 or to turn their fat into soap.

463
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But Spain had a weird fascination with human fat,

464
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 to the point that they had a boogeyman that specifically worked on

465
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 eating, consuming, murdering just for fat.

466
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 So the rumor was that whoever is killing these women

467
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 is a sacramentucca.

468
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Even though this serial killer had not been taking their fat out,

469
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 people did not know why someone would be murdering so many women.

470
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 So Juan had not disemboweled anybody,

471
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 but this time he did.

472
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 He ripped her guts out specifically to make the people think

473
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 that there was a mythical creature on the loose.

474
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Now while these crimes were going on, these murders last,

475
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I think it was about two or three years,

476
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 other people began, because this guy wasn't getting caught,

477
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 you had three other people begin murdering women in the same area.

478
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Because if this guy is not getting caught, I'm going to do it too.

479
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 They all got caught. Juan eventually got caught as well,

480
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 and he got sentenced to death and he was executed.

481
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 But you had three other people inspired by these crimes

482
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 who killed like one person and got caught.

483
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And one of those guys ripped the woman's guts out as well.

484
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So the society was in a panic.

485
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Now again, if you had a town where people,

486
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 if in Detroit you had four people murdered and they were disemboweled,

487
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 people in Detroit aren't going to be like, "They're eating their fat!"

488
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Don't use soap, because the soap might be human fat.

489
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 But Spain has such a weird issue with human fat extractors

490
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 and drinking human fat and turning it into medicine.

491
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 They have crime after crime after crime where this is a thing.

492
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And that's going to be a teaser for our next two episodes.

493
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Because I could not, there's so much fat for this story,

494
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I couldn't fit it all in one episode.

495
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Tomorrow's episode, we are going to tell the story of a man

496
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 who was also considered a sacramenteca and a werewolf.

497
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And then the episode after that, for a three-part fat eater episode,

498
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 we are going to explain how the idea of fat extractors

499
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 left Spain and moved to the New World.

500
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 To the point that even today, people in South America believe

501
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 that the Spaniards continue to kill the indigenous people

502
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 simply to eat their fat.

503
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 What is Spain's bizarre connection with human fat?

504
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 We will explore those issues and more greasy goodness

505
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 on the next episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
