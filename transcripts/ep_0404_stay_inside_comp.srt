00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 As parts of the world begin to shut down, as self-isolation is taking place during this coronavirus pandemic,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 you may be thinking, "I can't do this. I can't be trapped in my house."

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But today we're going to profile a couple stories that show what happens when you do leave your house.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 So while you may be fuming mad that you're stuck at home, or you might live in a country where this isn't a problem, I don't,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 but if you are trapped in your house, I want you to reflect on these four stories and go, "Man, I sure am glad I'm staying at home listening to Dead Rabbit Radio."

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I am sick. I do not have the coronavirus.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I might have a coronavirus, but I don't have COVID-19. I have a bit of a head cold.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I feel a lot better than I did the other day. My bones are no longer aching.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Sabines for sure. I had a fever last night because I was like, "Man, it's so hot in here. Windows open.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm standing in front of a fan. It's organ in March. It was like 50 degrees. I'm like, "Oh, why is it so hot?"

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 She's like, "Because you have a fever." I'm like, "No, I don't."

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 But all the only thing I'm battling right now is some congestion. My nose is stuffed up. I have a bit of chest congestion,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 but I have no problem breathing. I'm totally fine. If you're a longtime listener of this show, you've heard this voice before

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 because I get sinus infections quite commonly. So I know what the effects are.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 However, just to let you guys know, I am in a hot zone. They're shutting down all schools in Oregon.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 We've had outbreaks in the DOWs, which is 30 Minutes One Directions. We had outbreaks in Hillsboro, which is about an hour in the other direction.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It's most likely that COVID-19 is here. So I am taking the steps to self-isolate myself for a while so I don't get infected or I don't infect others.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And that's where we're at right now. And obviously, guys, my health situation changes. I will go to the emergency room.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Like, if I stop, if I have trouble breathing, I'll go to the emergency room, but I feel better today than I have yesterday or the day before.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I apologize too this episode's coming out late, but again, I'm sick. But I want to keep a sense of normality going on here.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So I'm getting better, even though this episode is about a day late. I wanted to get an episode out for you guys.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I know a lot of people are scared. Don't be. Now, I often say I'm an old man. I'm 43 years old. I've lived through all this stuff.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 To be fair, I have never seen anything like this in my life. I know there are people in World War II that remember like stuff shutting down, but I didn't serve in World War II or was alive.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 But at the same time, this is temporary. Just keep yourself healthy and don't spread it to others. Like, that's the key thing.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Like, I'm not worried about getting it myself. It's possible that what I have right now is, is it, but it's so low.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I'm one of the 80% that it doesn't really affect and I'm getting better because a lot of my friends have been getting the flu.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 The flu is kind of working its way through town, which it's the flu in March. Could be the flu, could not be the flu.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 But I'm feeling better. If I start to feel worse, I will go and go to the emergency room, but I don't foresee that happening.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 All that being said, that's kind of rambly, but I just want to let you guys know that I'm going to continue to do this podcast.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 We're going to go back to our regular schedule starting Monday. I don't want you guys to panic, but I think you guys should be prepared.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I have stocked up on food just in case the store starts shutting down.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Let's go ahead though, actually, and before we go any further, let's thank our newest Patreon supporter, our pandemic Patreon supporter,

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Charlotte Renee. Thank you Charlotte for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot, especially now because I'm not going to be going to work for a couple days,

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 and I haven't got to work for a couple days. So the Patreon support does help in those moments where I need a little bit of extra cash.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 So I really, really appreciate that, Charlotte, and all other Patreon supporters.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine. Get the word out about the show. That really helps a lot.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Getting new listeners for the show helps really just as much as new Patreon supporters, but I really, really appreciate both of you guys, both groups of you.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So let's go ahead and move on to our first story now here. Now, all of these stories, the theme is, stay inside.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Don't go, don't, these, all these stories are going to make you scared to go outside.

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 First off, Charlotte, we're going to talk to you about the keys to the Carbindercopter. We are flying out to Churchton, Maryland.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's February 18th, 2020, and there's this woman named Katie Peters.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 She's just gotten done shopping. She's putting her shopping cart away.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Makes that noise when the, that satisfying noise when metal hits metal goes in.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 That's a pretty good sound effect. Thank you. Complimenting myself now.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And as she's getting ready to leave, a man walks into the grocery store.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Now that's not suspicious. Men often walk into grocery stores. It's not going to raise any alarm bells, but when he passes her, she feels a, "Ow!"

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Pinch, poke on her butt cheek. "Ow!"

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And as the man passes by her, he looks at her and says, "I know. Feels like a beasting, doesn't it?"

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 What in the world? Just some weirdo walking by. She goes out to her car, puts her groceries in the car, driving away.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Now she's driving on the road and, surprise, her butt cheek starts to hurt.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 "Ow! Man, right where that mysterious guy passed me, made a reference to a beasting, and me getting poked."

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 That same area hurts now. Very curious, she thinks to herself.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 She ends up like feeling kind of woozy. Now, I think this is exaggerated.

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I think she's probably a hypochondriac, because what we're going to learn, what we're going to learn happen does not make you go, "Ow! No! Where am I going?"

57
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's not, you know, maybe the guy was high-dosed on Ella-Steva. I'm getting ahead of myself. She's driving on the road.

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 She calls up her son, and she's like, "I think I'm going to die. I love you so much."

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I guess I shouldn't be walking that part. But she's like, "Oh, no. If I don't make it home, I love you. I love you so much."

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And her son's like sitting at home playing Fortnite. I mean, like, what?

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Like, what in the world? That would be the worst call to get from your mom or any human.

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 You get a call in the middle of the night, or you're just playing Fortnite, and it's, "Oh, no. I don't know if I'll be able to make it home."

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Terrifying. But she does make it home. And she does go to the doctor, and she has a little poke in her butt.

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So she calls the cops, and she's very suspicious. Obviously, she's like, "That's weird. I didn't have that one."

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 "I didn't have that needle puncture when I woke up. I didn't sleep on a bed of needles."

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 The cops end up being like, "Yeah, that's pretty suspicious. The guy's saying something."

67
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 If the guy hadn't said anything, it's funny now to think about it. He probably wouldn't have gotten caught.

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 They review the footage. They see this dude. They track him down.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 His name is Thomas Brian Steeman, which is quite ironic.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It's probably pronounced "stemmon," and it's not ironic at all, but Steeman, 51 years old, when they pull him over, he has two hypernaric needles.

71
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 He has one in his pocket, one in his car, both of them filled with semen.

72
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Steeman semen, to be precise.

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 So it's a weird fetish, right? This guy has a fetish.

74
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 We've done episodes on this in the past, not this particular dude.

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But there's a fetish called, I don't know the exact word, but basically you stab women in the butt with either knives or needles.

76
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 That was the episode "The Maniacs of England," and I really like that episode.

77
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Listen to that in your self-isolation. That's a good one. That's pretty funny.

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But there's a fetish called "frodigene," where you rub up against women.

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I mean, I guess you can do it to dudes, too, but it's mostly dudes who have the fetish.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 They're doing it towards women.

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 If you do it to a guy, it's still a crime, and it's still called "frodigene," but generally it's a male-driven fetish.

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 "Frodigene" is where you rub up against someone against their will.

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And then there's one where you prick them with a needle or a knife, which if you--

84
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 If I have a choice, if you pull out a sewing needle or a stiletto knife, I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'll take the needle."

85
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 But not this guy's needle, not a needle full of semen semen, because that's gross, right?

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 So apparently he was walking around, he poked her in the butt, and injected semen into her.

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Now, I'm sure it would hurt, and I'm sure it would cause an infection, and I'm sure it's like super gross,

88
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 and right now you guys are drinking milk, and you're like, "Damn it, Jason! I'm just about to eat my yogurt, too."

89
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Well, it is gross.

90
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I don't think if someone injected you with semen in your butt cheek, you'd be like, "Whoa, man, totally.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I don't know if I'm gonna make it home," like unless she's allergic to semen.

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And the fact that she has a son probably means that she isn't.

93
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 But again, maybe if it's injected right into the muscle tissue, maybe it does cause you to like trip out,

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 which if that's the case, would be an amazing new drug.

95
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 So there you go. That's one reason to stay home.

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Someone might poke you in the butt with some semen.

97
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Now, you may be going, "Jason, that's an extreme example, plus I'm not a woman in church in Maryland,

98
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 plus this guy was arrested, so what do I have to worry about?"

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I'm going to work, and I'm gonna say, "Listen, dude, do not go to work.

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Charlotte, let's fire up that carbon-de-copter again. We're headed out to Perm, Russia."

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 [imitates car engine]

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 We're defying all travel bans. The military is hot on our heels. We're releasing shaft.

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 [imitates car engine]

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 All that aluminum stuff. We're just throwing aluminum foil out the back.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Missiles are still hitting us.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 [imitates car engine]

107
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 We're gonna fly, relieve U.S. territories, the F-18s. They don't know what to do.

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 We're headed to Perm, Russia. The year is 1989, and it's one in the morning.

109
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Now, this story, we don't have an exact date on, but so usually that means it's made up,

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 but not all the time. Not all the time.

111
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 What happened was in 1989, we had the fall of the Soviet Union, for the most part,

112
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 it was starting to crumble, at least, and you had information finally leaving the Soviet Union.

113
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 I have this website called ThinkAboutItDocs.com. It's not mine, but I go to it all the time.

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Every UFO sighting by year. It's been a fascinating resource for me.

115
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 In 1989, when I just recently went through 1989, and found all the great stuff from there,

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 massive amounts of stories coming from former Soviet-blocked countries.

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It was weird, because I did it in 1986, '87, '88. You know how to count.

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I did it a couple years in a row, and it was standard thing in Kansas, thing in Argentina,

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 thing in Europe. Not a lot of stuff coming from Russia, Soviet Union, stuff like that.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 But in 1989, you finally had all this media pouring out from behind the iron curtain,

121
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 and a ton of stories coming out in 1989. We're in perm Russia.

122
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 You go, "Jason, I'm not afraid." I have to start the gimmick again, because I got sidetracked.

123
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 You're saying, "Jason, we're hopping off the carbonar copter. I'm not afraid of being outside."

124
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I don't care if someone tries to stick me in the butt. I wear a pan, a metal pan in my pants,

125
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 like I'm a Donald Duck cartoon. I'm not worried about it. I'm going to work.

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And then I put my hand on your shoulder, and I push your head over, and you're like,

127
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 "Have you washed your hands recently, you sick dude?" And I'm like, "No, I haven't."

128
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I move your face over, not your face, I move your whole head, and we're looking at a female security guard.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 She's working in Russia in 1989.

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Her job is to, it's like she's a security guard for a local garage, like a parking garage.

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 So you have like a parking structure. You know what a garage is, right?

132
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I'm trying to think of it. What's the term for it? The concrete one with all the cars in it and stuff like that?

133
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So this woman, let's call her Mary. She's a security guard at this garage.

134
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 She's just doing her business. She's reading magazine or something like that.

135
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I don't know. The specifics don't matter. The lead up to it doesn't matter.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 The fact is that Mary's sitting there, she has a dog, and she's sitting in her little police booth.

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Damn it, a little guard booth. Apparently I've given her a promotion. Now she's a member of law enforcement.

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 There's a glowing red light in the garage.

139
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 [imitates car noises]

140
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And it's like a parking garage, right? So she can't really see what it is. She can't really see around the corner.

141
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And she's like, "What? I can have that?" "I don't know. I'm gonna keep reading my magazine."

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And then she hears someone say, "Come into the garage."

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 She's like, "What?" She looks over, she sees the red light.

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 [imitates car noises]

145
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And then she's thinking, "Wait a second. Someone didn't say that over there."

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 She realizes the voice came from inside her booth.

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And she looks down, came from her dog.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 The dog looks at her and goes, "Come into the garage."

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 She sees it, say that to him, and she hears it.

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And she starts laughing hysterically, because she doesn't know what to make of it.

151
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 She thinks it's the funniest thing in the world. And then she realizes, "Wait a second. Dogs can't talk."

152
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And at that point, the dog bites her sleeve and begins to drag her towards the red light.

153
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 When she gets into that part of the garage, she sees what she describes as "transparent people."

154
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 So she can see right through--you know what transparent is, right?

155
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 She sees the outline, but she can see right through him.

156
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And her dog's just sitting there next to her, not talking now. Not what it really is necessary.

157
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 The dog needs to say something, be like, "Look out!"

158
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 The dog's just sitting there. She goes--she looks at these and she goes, "You're not people. You're not people, right?"

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And they say, "Yes, we are not people. And we have come for you."

160
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 All of a sudden, a powerful vibration goes all over her body.

161
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 [makes a loud noise]

162
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 I love this. This is a line from the story. This is something that can only happen in Russia.

163
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 In a true Russian twist of the story, it notifies us that the vibration is so powerful, her fur hat flies off of her head.

164
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Nowhere else in the world would a UFO encounter involve a fur hat, but this one--woah!--fur hat flies off the head.

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And then she realizes, in the blink of an eye, she's in another building across the street. No dog around.

166
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 When she goes back to her guard post, several hours have passed.

167
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And this story has an interesting ending. She obviously realizes something was off, right?

168
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 First, she thinks it's a dream, but then when she's like, "Wait a second, all these hours have passed. What was I doing in this other building?"

169
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 She's perplexed. She's trying to find her fur hat. She ends up going to a hypnotist to do the regression, to see if she can remember what happened in those hours.

170
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And according to this account, she did it for a couple minutes, 20 minutes while they were doing this hypnosis, and she goes, "Nope, done. I don't want to know anymore."

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Done. She gets up and leaves.

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 This is an interesting point. It's interesting that they specifically came there for her, that they used the dog to speak to her.

173
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 A lot of times aliens will use telepathy, which I guess that's what it was, but she heard the dog talking.

174
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I'm also curious how the dog sounded. Did it sound like Scooby-Doo? Did it sound like Goofy?

175
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 But it's all around interesting. But the fact that she finally had a chance to figure out what had happened in those hours.

176
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I'm sure it had been very, very troubling to her to lose that much time and not know why.

177
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And then halfway through the hypnotic regression, she just gives up.

178
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 So what did she see? What did she experience? What did those aliens do to her?

179
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 We will never know. She probably experiences it in dreams or nightmares every so often, but we'll never know.

180
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 But we do know this. That wouldn't happen if she had stayed at home and self-isolated.

181
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 She would have just been hanging out at home, and that dog would have abducted somebody else.

182
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Unless, although for this story, I guess the aliens were specifically looking for her.

183
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So I mean, maybe that doesn't fit the theme, but I know what you're thinking. I know what you're thinking.

184
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 You don't live in Russia. You don't have a dog. You're not a security guard.

185
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You don't listen to dogs that give you commands because your last name isn't Berkowitz. I get it.

186
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Still, don't leave your house because I still have more stories to convince you in this extra-long episode.

187
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 This one's going to run long. It was late anyways.

188
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Don't leave your house because if you think that, oh, I don't live in Russia, or that you don't go into grocery stores

189
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 because you grow all of your food like a big old weirdo, like a big old hippy weirdo, and you don't go into grocery stores,

190
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 do you travel? Let's fire up the carbonar copter again.

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Actually, you know what? Let's put the brakes on the carbonar copter. Let's get on the Jason Jalopy because this next story takes place on the road.

192
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 We're going to Camden County, Missouri, and it's February 25th, 2020, and we're driving to the Jason Jalopy, and we're just following a couple cars.

193
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 We're having fun. We're listening to my Britney Spears mix tape. We're driving to the road.

194
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Now, we see in front of us a pickup truck that has what's known as "deer stickers" on it.

195
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I kept seeing that in the article. This truck has "deer stickers" on it, which makes me think it's like "deer tags" like they're allowed to hunt.

196
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I know nothing about hunting. I know barely anything about "deers." But either this guy had like hunting tags, meaning he could shoot deers in the face,

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 or had so many stickers, like animated stickers of deers, like comically large deers on his car that it was easily identified.

198
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Or both, maybe?

199
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Anyways, there's a truck driving in front of us with "deer stickers" on it, and there we see it. It's kind of weird looking, right?

200
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I mean, aside from all of the deer memorabilia, the wheels are just giant hooves that rotate tearing up the pavement.

201
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 The truck itself is an actual carved out deer with an engine in its chest. That's just ridiculous, Jason.

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 The coronavirus has taken over your brain. We're watching this truck. It seems suspicious.

203
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 It used to be alive. It used to be a four-legged animal. It is following another car.

204
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 So in that car, this is getting confusing, okay? Whatever. There's a woman driving on the road. There's a woman driving on the freeway on February 25, 2020.

205
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And a truck drives up alongside of it, and the driver looks in at her, and then speeds off.

206
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It takes off super, super fast, and she's like "Oh, that's kind of weird."

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And then as she's continuing to go down the highway, she gets to a point where she sees that truck is pulled over, and she passes the truck and the dude is standing outside of the truck masturbating.

208
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 She's like "Oh my God, that is so not what I expected. Maybe the truck broke down or something like that. Maybe he saw a deer and was going to kill it."

209
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But she calls the cops. Cops are like "That is quite suspicious and criminal, so we will take care of that."

210
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Shortly afterwards, the cops get another phone call. This woman says she's driving down the highway.

211
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 She sees a truck driving the opposite direction. The truck then makes a U-turn and begins following her.

212
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 What? That's weird. It's also weird that it's furry, and it looks like a giant deer.

213
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 The truck passes her. Okay, well at least it's out of my way. Maybe he forgot something.

214
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Maybe he had to go to the grocery store or go to his job in Russia. Who knows?

215
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 She just sees him make a U-turn and then pass her.

216
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And then she sees the truck pulled over the side of the road. I don't know. Well, that's weird.

217
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 But when the truck drives past it, the dude is masturbating.

218
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So at this point, I believe these both took place on the same day.

219
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I mean, this guy definitely has a problem, right? I mean, I guess even if it took place months apart, he has a problem.

220
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 But the police are now on the lookout for a masturbating man driving a van that may or may not be made out of a deer carcass.

221
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 They catch him, surprise, surprise, at the local Walmart. His name is Logan Hopwood. He's 20 years old.

222
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But the thing about this story, that's horrible. Like flashing people, masturbating in front of people, it's crime, it's public indecency, it's gross.

223
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 No one wants to see that. But the best part about this story is when this dude gets nabbed by the cops.

224
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So when he gets down to the police station, the cops go, "Listen, we have a report of you driving past a woman, pulling over, masturbating as she drove past."

225
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 What? No way. I would never do that. That's ridiculous. Absolutely not.

226
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Like, "Well, do you have an alibi?" And he goes, "Yeah, yeah. My girlfriend was leaving work and I was following her. I didn't pull over. I had a kid home, you know, with my girlfriend."

227
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Even though we took several cars for some bizarre reason. We hate the environment and we want to burn as much gas as possible.

228
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And the cops go, "Okay, we can check that alibi." And at this point he's probably like, "Uh-oh."

229
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Or maybe not. Maybe he's so stupid that he just figures that, you know, his girlfriend's gonna lie or the cops are gonna just forget about the cases that are leaving the interrogation room.

230
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And they're leaving the interrogation room to the phone and be like, "What was I doing?" "I don't know." And then they start investigating something else and he sneaks out.

231
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 They call up the girlfriend and say, "Hey, was he following you home? Easy alibi to check." She says, "No." "No, we took totally different routes."

232
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 They go back in there and they go, "So, your girlfriend says you're lying." He's like, "Dang it."

233
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 He was like leaving card games and little electronic devices around hoping to confuse the detectives on their way out.

234
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 They're like, "Oh, look at all of these seeds. I better count each one of the cops or vampires. I have to count all these seeds before I do anything and he sneaks out."

235
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 But anyways, they come back in. That doesn't work. They go, "That, your alibi didn't wash." And he goes, "Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was thinking about something else."

236
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So, you're right. You're right. I did pull over and I did pull my penis out, but I was just peeing at the side of the road.

237
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So, I was driving and I looked over and I saw this woman and then I go, "Oh, no, I drank a bunch of water."

238
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And so I sped up because I was trying to find a place where I could go in the bushes to urinate.

239
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And the cops are like, "Okay, okay. You're being honest with us. It's possible, right?"

240
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Some woman drives by at 60 miles an hour. She sees a guy relieving himself in the bushes, which is still a crime.

241
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 If you are ever like, "Oh, I'm so drunk I have to pee outdoors." You can get arrested for public indecency.

242
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 You can be a registered sex offender for urinating in public. So, don't do it.

243
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 That's another reason not to go outside. Another reason is self-isolate. So, you don't become a convicted sex offender.

244
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 But anyway, so he's like, "I was peeing." And the cops are like, "Yeah, that makes sense. You know, the man and the woman exchange looks.

245
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 She got a weird funny feeling from him. If the next time she sees him, his pants are down and he has his penis in his hand. Sure."

246
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 She might think that he's masturbating. That explains the first story. However, please say, a time later,

247
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 another woman says that you busted a U-turn, drove past her, pulled onto the side of the road and was masturbating.

248
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And his response was, "Oh yeah, that's second time. Totally masturbating. Oh no, no, no, no. That one was legit.

249
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I just didn't think anyone could see me." So, his alibi for the first one worked.

250
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 His alibi for the second one was like, "Oh no, the second time I was totally masturbating.

251
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 I thought I was enough in the bushes that no one would see me, but I really needed to get a little relief."

252
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So, he was arrested. No bail. So, he's locked up, which nowadays it's a lot harder to get no bail.

253
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 He's of two felony charges of sexual misconduct. And then the next sentence, I'm like, "That's weird. No bail for pulling it out, whipping it out."

254
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 He's a registered sex offender, so this guy definitely has some issues, some deep...

255
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Obviously, the masturbating in public showed deep-seated issues, but this has been an ongoing thing for him.

256
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 He's only 22. This guy's going to have a real, real hard life. Real hard life going ahead.

257
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 If he can't get this stuff under control. So, yeah, another reason why you should stay inside sex predators.

258
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Sex predators may masturbate as you drive by. And possibly, if you're going slow enough, onto your car itself.

259
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 So, that's gross, right? You're like, "Oh no, it's pretty cool. I got all these needles in my car, these hybrid-herbic needles. Now I don't have to fill it myself."

260
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I have a plethora of needles ready to go. But you're not a super villain, I'm hoping. You don't have needles.

261
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Another reason why not to leave your house, because someone might masturbate in front of you.

262
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So, that's another reason. So, if alien abductions don't get it, masturbating menaces don't get it, steaming semen,

263
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 you're still ready to take the risk of going outside, because you know why you have a friend.

264
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And you, we're friends, me and you, we are friends. That's one thing I want to keep this podcast.

265
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I wanted to get this episode out today, because this friendship, mine and yours, is important.

266
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And I want to keep the normalcy going in these troubling times. But, you go, "You're metaphorical friendship aside, Jason. Yes, we're friends, but you exist in the audio realm."

267
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I've never met you. I have a real friend. I have a real friend. And that's the one thing all these stories lacked.

268
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Everyone was solo. I have a buddy. I'm allowed to go outside, because I have a friend.

269
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Well, friend, traitor, who's this other person you've been hanging out with? Hmm? Hmm?

270
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Do they listen to Dead Ravra Radio? Because if they also listen to Dead Ravra Radio, then I'm totally fine with you seeing someone on the side.

271
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But let's take a look at somebody else who had a friend and went outside.

272
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I like to call this story, he was a good friend to the end.

273
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 We're going off to Wadley, Alabama, December 4th, 1989.

274
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Taken to Jason Jalapi, we're just driving out there. We're nice countryside, autumn leaves are falling. Beautiful, beautiful sight.

275
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And we meet two hunters. They're both hunting deer, ironically. I didn't plan that.

276
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 So we could probably ask them about deer stickers, but we're not going to. We're going to stay hidden in the shrubs while we watch this play out.

277
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 So this dude and his buddy are walking through the woods. And we'll call the main guy, Lucas.

278
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Lucas is walking through the woods with his buddy, Gary. And they haven't really caught any deer, they haven't really shot bullets or anything, brains.

279
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 They're kind of disappointed. They wanted to see dead animal carcasses before they went home. But they didn't.

280
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And because of that, the long winter will starve their families. But for now, they can't think about that.

281
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 They just have to keep hunting for deer. And Lucas sees his buddy, Gary, walking a bit in front of them.

282
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And then Lucas turns, something prompts him to turn and look somewhere else. It's late afternoon too, I didn't tell you that.

283
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Look back at my notes, it's late afternoon. He's still gotten plenty of time to shoot deer.

284
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 He turns and he looks off and he sees 80 feet away from both of them.

285
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Three gray aliens standing in the forest. A terrifying spot to run into aliens anywhere.

286
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 If you run into aliens in your house, you have home field advantage. You know where all your knives are, where your samurai swords are, where your giant walking sticks are, your baseball bats.

287
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 My house is decked out. If any alien ever appears in my house, they're getting completely... I'm gonna have to dispose of a problem.

288
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I wonder if you can throw an alien in a wood chipper, or if you can just gum it up with your alien guts.

289
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I guess we'll find out this weekend when they try to abduct me.

290
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 But anyways, in a forest, it's super spooky. I have a fear of forests, so maybe you're just like, "Dude, these guys are armed. They know the forest.

291
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 They know the forest better than you know your apartment." Maybe, maybe. I just find forest spooky because there's trees everywhere. You look up. You can't see anything.

292
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 If you look in any other direction, other than you look down, you can't see anything to see dirt.

293
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 If you look in any other direction, it's just a bunch of things blocking your view.

294
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 So behind every tree can be a predator. In the tree branches and stuff, there could be predators like bobcats and stuff like that.

295
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Mountain lions. And I don't like it. I like to be able to look in directions. I wouldn't much rather be trapped in a desert with ample food and water.

296
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 But I like to be in flat places where I can just kind of look around. I can walk down the street, no problem.

297
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 But walking through a forest, nope. Not at all. Even a trail going through a forest, I'm real iffy on.

298
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 But anyways, my paranoia aside, there's three great aliens standing in the forest, right? Which is pretty spooky.

299
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Jason, it's not spooky. You're trying to convince us that, I mean, yeah, it's kind of spooky. But three great aliens are spooky anywhere.

300
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 It's not spookier. It's a December afternoon. People are walking through the forest.

301
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 There's like just leaves everywhere. And there's three great aliens. That's not any scarier than a parking garage.

302
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 See, to me it is. Absolutely is. A parking garage, at least I figure I have a fighting chance, because everything's flat. Right?

303
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Because, you know, like the garage has ground. But in a forest, there's like tree roots. Plus, it would really suck if you're like outrunning an alien.

304
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And let's be honest, I'm never outrunning an alien. That's why I have to stand and fight.

305
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 But let's say I defeat the alien and then a mountain lion gets me or a bear. Or what if I'm beat the alien up and I throw the alien to the side and behind the alien is a baby bear.

306
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And I'm like, great. And then the mama bear gets me. I have to worry about that stuff in a parking garage, maybe in Russia, because there's bears everywhere.

307
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 But let's get back to the actual story here.

308
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Lucas is standing there. He sees these great aliens 80 feet away from both of them.

309
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Gary doesn't notice them at all. Gary still walks through the forest. And Lucas, he goes to say something to his buddy.

310
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Look how he's doing with the great aliens around. And he gets a telepathic message.

311
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Quote, "Keep your mouth shut."

312
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 So apparently these aliens belong to the mafia. They're like doing the slit-throating thing.

313
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 But because of their anatomy, their throat is in their stomach. They're like running their finger across the stomach.

314
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Lucas is like, "What? What does that mean?" And he's like, "It means to keep your mouth shut, idiot!" He also gets the impression that if he says anything to Gary, he gets two impressions.

315
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 He sees these three great aliens. They telepathically tell him to keep his mouth shut. And then he says that he gets two impressions.

316
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 One, if he says anything, he will be harmed. And two, they're not here for Lucas anyways. They're here to get Nefcari.

317
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 They're keeping an eye on Gary. They're going to abduct him. Lucas is like, "Ugh!"

318
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 He sees three great aliens standing in the forest in the late afternoon. He's told telepathically, "Keep his mouth shut."

319
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 He's told, "Don't worry. We're not going to hurt you unless you say something." And then we're going to hurt you.

320
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And don't worry. We're not here for you anyways. We're here to take your friend.

321
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Let's go to this actual excerpt from this website. Think about it.com.

322
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 "Without saying a word, him and his partner left the area. The beans were described as having big black almond-shaped eyes and about four feet tall. Their skin texture was rough gray. The witness's friend was apparently abducted on a later date."

323
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 So he didn't say anything. He sees these three great aliens. They're running their finger across their belly. "You gotta be quiet. I'll slit your throat."

324
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 He's like, "That's not even where the throat's at." He's like, "We know we should have abducted more cows to figure out where the throat's were."

325
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Doesn't say anything, and it was "buddy." His buddy ends up getting abducted by aliens. Imagine--

326
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Okay, here's the thing, dude. Like, part of being friends is looking out for each other.

327
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Now, to be fair, obviously, like, there are limits to that. I've always told my friends I will never help you dispose of a body. That's just not what I do.

328
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 I don't help people dispose of bodies. That might seem like a high bar to you, but I grew up in Sacramento, so I mean--

329
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you've grown-- Yeah. So, you may go, "Jason, there's a bunch of stuff I wouldn't do before not helping someone dispose of a body."

330
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Yeah, Sacramento gets a little rough in certain areas, but the point is this. You gotta be clear with your friends.

331
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Now, I don't-- I get that Lucas was scared of being harmed by aliens from another dimension or from another planet with technology that far exceeds ours.

332
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Trust me, I get that. But at the same time, if something like Mafioso was like, "Hey, we're gonna catch your friend and we're gonna do stuff to him,"

333
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 don't tell him. I'd tell him. I'd be like, "Hey, listen, like, I wouldn't feel good about myself if I didn't say anything to you. These guys are looking for you."

334
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 I mean, that's just-- I think that's the type of friend I am. And then he goes, "Murder's with them," and he goes, "Hey, well, you helped me bury the bodies."

335
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And I'm like, "Mmm-mm. You got yourself into that mess. I never told you to murder anybody."

336
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 If somebody was looking for someone at my age, I'd just always say, "Call the cops. Call the cops."

337
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 "What? No, I can't do it. I'm gonna just call the cops, man." Like that, when you're younger, you're like, "I'll take care of it."

338
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Because you think life is a Punisher comic book. But as you get older, you're like, "Dude, I'm too old to be chasing around three kids, you know, who dissed me.

339
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 I'm in my 20s and they're in their 20s and they talk trash about me. I'm gonna go beat them up. I'm too old for that. Too old.

340
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 I just call the cops now. I know a couple cops in the river just call up their cell phone number.

341
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 "Hey, what's up, man? Yeah, I got this dude messing with me. So I've gotten to that age."

342
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 But, yeah, what a terrible friend. Like, you have to imagine that Lucas still feels really bad about it.

343
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And you honestly would feel worse about it if Gary gets abducted by aliens and then is one of those cases where he doesn't remember.

344
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 So you're Lucas, you're hanging out with Gary and it's like poker night at the house.

345
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And Gary's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go hit the head. I'm gonna go to the bathroom."

346
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And Lucas is like, "Oh, yeah, no problem, dude. I'll just sit here with my poker cards and prepare for you to come back and Gary leaves."

347
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 And then like four hours pass.

348
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Lucas gets up after about 15 minutes. Lucas gets up, knocks on the door. He's a red glowing light.

349
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 "Woom, woom, woom, woom, woom." Coming from the bathroom.

350
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 An hour later, he checks on him, opens the door. There's no one in the bathroom. He looks all over the house.

351
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Gary's completely gone. He's sweating. Lucas is sweating bullets now. He's like, "Uh-oh. Should I have warned him about this?"

352
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 "I guess it's too late for that."

353
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Oh, man, I hope they don't do anything so horrible. He goes to calm down. He turns on the news.

354
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 It's like Fox Alien Autopsy. He's like, "Ah, mutilated cow reports." He's like, "Oh, dang it."

355
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And then after about four hours, he hears a noise in the bathroom. He goes in there and Gary's like, "Ugh, what happened to me?"

356
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 I went into the bathroom and then I just was sitting here. Still sitting here.

357
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And then Lucas is like, "Oh, no, he has lost time. He's changing all the clocks."

358
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 He's like, "No, no, no. Only two minutes have passed. Why is my food so cold?"

359
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 "Ah, because it's French and it's like I put it in the fridge while you were gone."

360
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And then he has to be spent the rest of his life changing all the clocks around Gary so he never realizes he lost four hours of time.

361
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Or, and that's pretty, pretty insane, or Gary just magically appears and does realize he lost four hours of time.

362
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And Lucas is like, "I don't know, man. Pretty weird. Everyone poops different."

363
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 You went to poop and you passed out for four hours. Why didn't you call the cops?

364
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 "Well, you know, I don't know. I mean, everyone poops different." That's the name of his book he wrote.

365
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 "Everyone poops different." And so, and then Gary would always wonder like, "Oh, I wonder what happened during that time period."

366
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And Lucas would know the truth. Lucas would know the truth. He was abducted by gray aliens.

367
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 That would actually be the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is Gary gets abducted by aliens.

368
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 He remembers everything. They're constantly like, "Where is your throat?"

369
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And he's like, "It's right here." And they start cutting. And they're doing all of these alien things to him.

370
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 They're probing them. They're pulling stuff out, putting it back together.

371
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 And he remembers all of it and he shows back up at Lucas' house and he's like,

372
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 "The aliens told me you saw them in the forest and not to say anything."

373
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And you're like, "Those bastard aliens. I kept my mouth shut. Where's my payment for being part of this alien conspiracy?"

374
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 So that would be the worst case scenario, that Gary remembers the torture and they also ratted him out.

375
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Ratted out Lucas being like, "Haha, you know you came close to not getting probed tonight. What do you mean?"

376
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 While your friend Lucas in the woods, he saw us and we told him to keep his mouth shut. No!

377
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 So that's another reason not to leave your house, right? Because you may find yourself walking through the woods in 1989.

378
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And the worst thing about that story is that he probably did get abducted while he was at home, Gary.

379
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 But the worst thing about that story is that you can't even trust your friends, man.

380
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 You can't even trust your friends. So you can actually. You just can't trust this jerk from Wadley, Alabama.

381
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 I'm sure you can trust your friends. However, that episode is for reasons why it's okay to be inside for a couple weeks, right?

382
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 That's how long we're pretty much going to be trapped in here.

383
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 They're going to probably start shutting down the city soon in Hood River.

384
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 So I know it's scary and I know self-isolation. I'm lucky that I have enough sick time with different places that I work

385
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 and that I can miss days of work and I'm totally fine. I'm fine with that.

386
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 So I can self-isolate and keep myself from getting sick and keep other people from getting sick and we'll just go from there.

387
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But as far as supplies go, I have at least probably two weeks worth of food and water.

388
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 So I'm not too worried about it on that front either.

389
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 And I have a sneaking suspicion that most of the Hood River is just going to shut down.

390
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 And all the workplaces are going to be canceled. All the restaurants are going to be closed.

391
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 I have a feeling that's where we're headed.

392
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 But for now, I'm just going to use some sick time and take some time off of work.

393
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 And employees around here are totally fine with that because they know I'm sick.

394
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 They don't want me there anyways.

395
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And even when I'm feeling better, they're like, just take some time off.

396
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And so I think everything's going to get shut down.

397
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 But we can't be afraid. This is unprecedented and that's fair.

398
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 But this has an ending to it.

399
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 This isn't something that's just going to keep getting worse and worse.

400
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 We see that even in Wuhan, even in these other cities, more people have recovered than have it.

401
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 So there is going to be an end to this.

402
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 So I don't want you guys to worry. You guys can't panic.

403
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 But you guys also can't not take it seriously at all. There's a middle ground.

404
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 And that's where I'm at.

405
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 I'm just prepared for the worst.

406
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I'm stocked up on stuff. I'm using sick time so I don't even have to go into work.

407
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 And I'm just going to still be putting out episodes.

408
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Still talking about what we normally talk about, aliens.

409
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 And apparently this is episode, a lot of masturbation going on in this episode.

410
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 But then usually that's not the norm. Aliens, ghosts, stuff like that is what we'll be talking about.

411
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 So I'm glad I was able to eventually get an episode out for you guys.

412
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 I am feeling a lot better.

413
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 I thank you so much for everyone who hit me up on Twitter and email and YouTube comments.

414
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Talking about wanting me to get better. I want you guys to stay healthy if you're currently sick.

415
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 I want you to get better.

416
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 We will be back next week with more episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio.

417
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 I will be broadcasting throughout this pandemic.

418
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And we will get through it. We will get through it.

419
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address.

420
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000

422

 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

423
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

424
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 I'm very thankful for your patience and have a great weekend.

425
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 And be healthy.
