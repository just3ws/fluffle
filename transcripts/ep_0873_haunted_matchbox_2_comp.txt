 Is there life after death? This is the question that has plagued humanity since
 the first dude went "UGHH MY GUTS" and fell down and died. Today we're gonna take a
 look at two stories that have opposite answers to that question. First off we
 take a look at the story of a young family who starts renting a house but
 they have no idea this house is already inhabited by a ghost who can make solid
 objects appear out of thin air. And then we take a look at a scientist who spent
 his entire life skeptical of the idea of life after death until one day he got
 sick and died himself only to suddenly be reawaken in a world of endless
 jello. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio. Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of
 Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you
 guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are gonna have a lot of fun this
 weekend. And this will probably be the last reminder. Next week May 13th I will
 be in McMinnville Oregon at the McMinnemins UFO Festival. On May 14th I'll
 have a Vinter booth out. We're gonna be handing out stickers and we're gonna
 have a ball. It's gonna be a lot of fun. If you happen to be traveling through the
 area swing on by. Say hi to me and then all the other weirdos and freaks that are
 there talking about UFO stuff. It's really gonna be cool. And the following
 week there's only gonna be four episodes coming up that week because I do most of
 my production stuff on Saturday. All my research on losing that. To be there
 and to be meeting people. Maybe meeting you. Who knows. But someone who I'm
 meeting right now because you're walking into Dead Rabbit Command. Everyone on
 your feet. Give it up for one of our Christmas livestream contributors.
 Sawyer Elliott. Wooo! Yay! He's coming in dressed like a Christmas tree. It's a
 couple months too late Sawyer. But come on in. Ring them little jingle bells.
 Sawyer you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't
 support the show financially I totally understand. Just help spread the word
 about the show. That really really helps out a lot. Now Sawyer let's go ahead and
 get things started by tossing you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna
 leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're driving all the way out to a house in the
 middle of nowhere. Now I found this story posted online by someone named
 Mandans. And Mandans said you know this didn't happen to me. This happened to my
 friend. This was a story that Mandans has heard. And we don't have a year. We don't
 have a location which is pretty common for a lot of stories online really. Anyways
 we're gonna go a couple years ago is when this story reportedly took place.
 There was a young couple and their dog moved on to this rental property.
 As they're moving into this new place this young couple they've already had
 their own share of hardships. The girlfriend let's go ahead and call her
 Mandy had already had back-to-back miscarriages. And the husband will call
 him Jack. He probably has some bad stuff happen to him. I mean obviously miscarriages
 affect both people and the couple but I don't have anything specific for him.
 Maybe he stubbed his toe as he was moving into this house. But this couple
 you know they're getting ready to have a nice fresh start in this brand new
 rental property and they got their dog. We'll call him Rover.
 I don't know why he's trying to talk. He's trying to talk for the very first time.
 They looked at Rover they're like what did he just try saying something and the
 dog's like nope. They're like oh okay. So you got Mandy, Jack and Rover moving into
 this house and almost immediately after starting to live here Mandy starts to
 have these experiences. It started off with things like feeling her hair being
 tugged. Huh what? Huh? Who did that? And Jack's like in the other room. Rover's all
 laughing like that dog from those old cartoons. But it's not him. It's not an
 animated dog. It's Rover. Something was pulling her hair and then occasionally
 she'd be sitting there and something would tickle her feet. Pretty creepy
 right? She starts going up to her husband and me like Jack, Jack you won't believe
 what just happened. Somebody pulled my hair and it's not the dog. Very
 suspicious of him already. He's trying to build a blimp to enter some sort of
 race. It's not the dog and then my feet got tickled and you weren't anywhere
 around. I was just sitting here with my shoes off reading a book. Something
 tickled my feet and Jack because of the things that they had been through and
 the and because specifically because of the things that Mandy had been through
 with the miscarriages he starts to think that it's probably just her
 imagination. Oh you're just imagining physical sensations on your body. You're
 just imagining your hair being pulled so he doesn't put much stock into it but
 this happens so much. She starts to say hey we got to move. I'm actually too
 scared to be here. It's not just by myself. I'll have these sensations while
 you're in the house. Like we got to move. You know they're renting this property.
 It seems to be a pretty good piece of property so Jack's like listen we're
 not gonna leave just yet. We're gonna wait until the polder guy sets you on fire and
 then we'll leave. He goes we're not gonna leave just yet. Let's go ahead and see if
 your sister wants to move in with us. Maybe that will calm you down because he
 doesn't believe that it's anything ghostly. So anyways the sister does end up
 moving in and one night the three of them are sitting in the living room and
 all of a sudden the husband and the sister hear a they hear a very loud
 slap echo through the living room and both of them look around. I mean it's it
 was an audible sound that came into nowhere. The husband and the sister are
 kind of looking around like what in the world caused that and Mandy was sitting
 there rubbing her forehead and she said as we were all just sitting here an
 invisible force slapped me in the forehead and now everyone had had a bit of
 an experience. I mean she got slapped. She was the one who got assaulted but the
 husband and the sister knew something was in the house now because they clearly
 heard the slap and there was nothing there to make the slap. I mean sure
 there was sure there were six hands in there but none of them slapped Mandy
 and she didn't slap herself. So the very next day the husband calls up the
 landlord and says listen. It's gonna sound super weird but my wife keeps
 getting tickled and my wife keeps getting tickled. Oh man my wife's getting
 tickled and my wife's getting her hair pulled and then you know last night we
 all heard a loud slap and my wife got slapped in the face by something so she's
 ready to leave. Like is there something we need to know about and then the
 landlord on the phone goes "Uhhh... Uhhh... Yes yes I was afraid this day would come."
 The tickling, the hair pulling, the slapping of women. Oh it reminds me of a
 memory I thought I had gotten past. You see seven years ago I used to live in
 that property but I moved away. Obviously I'm not there right now. The landlord
 jumps out of the closet and he's like "surprise I wasn't when he slapped your
 wife." The landlord goes "I moved away because seven years ago my own son Matthew
 drowned on that property. He died and knowing how precocious my five-year-old
 son Matthew was I'm sure that's him. He's probably his ghost running around
 slapping your wife, tickling your wife, pulling her hair." So... wait wait wait what?
 What? You're telling me your dead kid might be here beating up my wife. The
 landlord goes "probably like that's that's my best guess right when I lived
 there there was no ghosts my son died now there's a ghost it's probably how it
 worked out and the landlord begins yelling over the phone and he says quote
 "Matthew if you're here stop playing tricks on this poor woman you're scaring
 her." The the abuse stopped. Hair pulling and tickling and I wouldn't really
 classify as abuse I guess if you didn't want it it would be abuse. Obviously
 slapping someone in the head you shouldn't be doing that ghost or
 otherwise but after the dad was like Matthew I told you once I told you a
 million lifetimes quit slapping people after the landlord yelled at his son
 over the phone the physical abuse stopped but the haunting never stopped as long
 as they lived there and they lived there for a few more years they begin to
 encounter all this other activity. Some of them is pretty benign right and you
 could chalk it up to other things like the toilets would flush on their own you
 know whatever that's cool like maybe it's like a plumbing issue and or maybe
 it's a helpful ghost you're sitting there you're going to the bathroom and
 you're like "phew I better flush the toilet" and then before you can flush it
 it flushes itself. "Thank you five-year-old boy who just watched me
 defigate you've done your duty" and they hear a little voice go "he he he duty"
 actually another thing about it that would be quite terrifying I don't know
 if it was flesh in the toilet while it's all they're taking a shower and he's
 flushing the toilet they're like "ah I don't know if it was flushing the toilet
 while they were sitting on the toilet because that would be creepy right to
 think that there was a ghost I guess I wait if you live on at house you have to
 make the assumption that while you are doing anything there is a specter of a
 bloodied woman standing in the corner watching you do it I just I think that's
 probably I think it's probably fair to assume anywhere you go so be on your best
 behavior even at your home there might be some woman standing there in a
 stained old ripped-up wedding gown with her face clawed off by her own fingernails
 and she's watching you play Minecraft for nine hours no that that is probably
 happening at some point but Matthew is not only flushing toilets he also would
 play with their dog so remember Rover he's still a part of the story he rovers
 running up and down the hallway sometimes and the two sisters and the
 husband would kind of be like what that's weird Rover would run up and down the
 hallway and they said the way that he was running was like someone was running
 alongside him playing with him hey this way Rover wee
 no let's go back the other end of this hallway I'm a dog I'm an idiot even I
 think this is boring ghosts is like wee it's just like a three-foot hallway they
 just run it back and forth Rover's like and so all that stuff is interesting
 right no not really you're like I guess it's mildly interesting I don't know if
 it's really worthy of a Friday episode but this is why I really wanted to cover
 this the toilets flushing the plane with the dog getting slapped by a ghost this
 is why I really wanted to cover this one day the young couple was sitting in
 their living room and all of a sudden a matchbox car rolled down the hallway and
 Jake and Mandy look at each other and they go we don't own any matchbox cars
 do we they didn't have been wondering about a story if they're like oh yeah I
 want a bunch of matchbox cars and the sister was playing with them they didn't
 have any kids at this time they owned no matchbox cars but here was a matchbox
 car rolling down the hallway and I think the implication is that the ghost
 manifested it which is one of the most curious things I've always found about
 some ghost stories and it seems to always be brushed over there's a lot of
 times you hear about phantom coins like people in haunted houses hearing coins
 drop and they turn around and there's a coin on the ground we covered a story
 like that on the show or I mentioned it on an offhand comment before it's a
 weird subset of hauntings physical manifestation of an inanimate object
 that remains behind that's magic like ghosts are one thing you can explain
 ghosts away in a bunch of different ways but if things are manifesting out of
 reality now we've crossed fully into the world of sorcery and you would think how
 come we don't look more into that how come that's not a bigger mainstay of
 ghost stories physical pennies dropping out of the sky in haunted houses again
 that's it's common and you think that would be a place you would just be like
 come you know you know you just bring a couple buckets you're like ah now I'm
 gonna make all my I'm gonna make my riches one ghost penny at a time and
 you figure you could take this matchbox car right I would try to find out like
 when it was manufactured like was it like the Batmobile little matchbox car
 from the newest Batman movie like because there's so many weird ways you could
 look at this like if the kid has access to he's dead right he's a dead kid maybe
 he has access to all matchbox cars past present and future because it wouldn't
 matter to him right he's just like sitting at home he's like oh that dog is so
 boring and he starts floating around and where did he get it from did he go to a
 toys RS and he's like you're linking takes them off the shelf and that's why
 when this is my new conspiracy when you go to a toy store department store and
 you find a package just empty like the package is there but the item is empty
 ghost it's ghosts it's not shoplifters it's ghost like where did he get the car
 was it a car from his original collection that he played with that he
 manifested into reality was it a car that he found in his ghostly travels around
 he's not Casper but I don't know how else to explain that he's floating down to
 the local Walmart and checking out the toys or was it a car that was even ever
 made by matchbox was this car actually produced because the thing is when they
 find the pennies pennies are pretty obviously have dates on them matchbox
 cars have dates on them as well but you know maybe they didn't pick it up and
 look at it if you saw me you look at it it's like the year 3022 who knows I
 there's so many ways you can look at this how did the matchbox car get there
 why did he choose that car and we're all talking about the reasoning why how did
 he make the car appear in ghost stories we all and I've never taken it for
 granted I remember hearing about ghost coins a long time ago and I go this is
 this should be studied way more phantom coins money coming out of nowhere are
 they making the money or are they stealing the money from somewhere else like
 did the penny have to be minted and then he's taking the penny from someone's
 person dropping it on your head in the haunted house and it really opens up a
 whole door to like the law of attraction imagine if you could corral 20
 ghosts and some sort of like call center right and you just make them
 constantly make matchbox cars you get a bunch of ghosts of kids they're like oh
 I just want to see my mom you're like you can see your mom when she dies and until
 then you're sitting in my call center and you're gonna make matchbox cars for
 me and they're just sitting there like and they're mentally creating toys from
 their childhood and then I take them down to like collector shop antique
 roadshow stuff like that and they're like whoa how did you get this original
 raggedy Andy doll this thing's like in mint condition and then I look at the
 camera don't look in my basement there's a lot of dead kids in there be around
 and then I get possessed by all the kids my body before that happens for that
 nonsense happens I wonder if you could industrialize basically let me let me
 say what I want to say but I'm trying to avoid what if you can industrialize
 dead children to manifest objects that then you can resell now that I think
 about it who wants to buy much stupid matchbox cars I have I have like a
 little I have like a little toy stand outside my house and I'm selling the
 matchbox cars for a dollar each the neighborhood kids and kids are coming by
 to buy them I'm like you don't happen to be sick you look kind of sick they're
 like no I'm feeling good you're like oh man I bet you really like matchbox cars
 don't you I bet you can make all the matchbox cars in the world they're like
 ah running away so yeah it's weird it's weird my weird money-making idea but how
 do ghosts manifest though from this fairly mundane haunting right it's just a
 poltergeist is just someone who's kind of messing around we have to look at the
 theory that ghosts can create things out of nothing and that goes beyond ghost
 powers like knocking on walls and flushing toilets and flicking lights and
 standing in the corner while you're taking a shower all that creepy stuff
 that's creepy stuff but the fact that they can actually manifest stuff out of
 nothing who's to say you can't be sitting in your house one day and that bloody
 woman in the corner of your room gets so tired of you she manifests the bullet
 right into your heart and then she manifests the suicide note what that'd
 be super crazy right that'd be insane and then you're standing there next to her
 all bloody and stuff like that and you're like and now some other guy moves in
 he's like oh what a nice place it's time to sit on my laptop and play Minecraft
 for nine hours and you're like she's just gonna keep doing this so Sawyer
 let's go ahead and be more profound I don't know why it became my slave labor
 camp I was really gonna focus just on the fact that you can manifest stuff but
 Sawyer Elliott let's get us out of here get us out of this ghost suicide pact
 we're leaving behind this house we're waving goodbye to little ghost kid
 we're headed all the way out to Lynchburg Virginia and there's a man his
 name is dr. even Alexander and he's a neurosurgeon he works on people's
 brains and one day he's sitting there in the operating room and he's like oh do
 this guy's brain it's like totally nuts but I gotta heal it give me some of that
 needles and thread he's like so he's also in the brain together he's like there
 it goes nice and smooth they're like doctor no he's working on people's
 brains and stuff like that and he saves this guy puts his skull back on and the
 guy sits up goes thanks doc he's like you betcha that's what I do I save people's
 brains and then as he's walking out of the operating theater this young nurse
 walks up to him she goes dr. even Alexander that was so cool how you
 didn't let that guy die the other doctor just loves to kill people that's so
 cool how you didn't let that guy die but doctor what do you think what happened
 if he had died doctor even Alexander goes hmm I've thought about this a lot
 because my job it makes me focus on life and death one wrong stitch one wrong
 needle into the brain he's so sad with sewing the brain together one wrong
 twist of my wrist and that guy could be dead and I think there's probably nothing
 after life right it's probably something that when you die your brain is flooded
 with chemicals and you just dream of something that's where all these so
 called near-death experiences happen and this was kind of his view for around
 25 years he worked in the industry for 25 years but on November 10th 2008 he
 wakes up and he's like oh my back oh dude this totally sucks and as he's like
 complaining about how bad his back hurts his brain starts to hurt too no I
 need that I need that to work and he's has this splitting headache the worst
 headache he's ever had in his life severe back pain and he's like oh dude I
 must be super sick with like the flu or something right because apparently he's
 not apparently he's not a regular doctor knows those aren't flu symptoms he's
 like maybe I just have the flu I'm gonna go back to sleep and his wife's like okay
 honey but remember you have that brain operation soon he's like I'll do it later
 he falls asleep a couple hours later his wife comes in to wake him up for that
 brain thing he's supposed to be doing and she can't wake him up she's like even
 even wake up bro wake up dude and he's just all and that's when she calls 911
 he's all convulsing and stuff and his eyes have rolled back into his head she's
 like oh no so she calls 911 ambulance shows up they throw him on a gurney and
 he's all convulsing they're like strapping him down they're like I know
 this guy this is dr. even Alexander he's the best brain surgeon he's the best
 brain surgeon I know and I only know one we must save this guy's life so they're
 taking him to the hospital it turns out he didn't have the flu right anyone
 would have known that if you have a horrible backache and the worst
 take ever probably not the flu he had bacterial meningitis it's this virus
 that was eating at his brain and he goes to hospital and they're like dude this
 dude is toast like even if we save him this virus has been eating so much on
 his delicious brain that he'll probably be a vegetable but we'll try to do that
 miss Alexander we'll try to save him and so they put him in a medically induced
 coma now on dr. even side this is what happened and obviously this is where you
 do get a lot of skeptics to say well you know it's all the chemicals and stuff
 they're bumping into your body and all the stuff the body's naturally doing plus
 he did have a brain-eating virus that's probably not gonna help your
 cognitive skills but what dr. even saw was he was no longer dr. even Alexander
 he died and was in this dark underground place his form his his essence was
 trapped in Jell-O and he's just sitting there completely surrounded by Jell-O
 in a pitch black underground cavern now he says I don't know how I knew it was
 underground I just felt that it was underground but I'm sitting there and
 I'm completely coiled up in this sea of Jell-O he goes I couldn't talk he says
 nothing was in focus I couldn't see I had no memories before being inside the
 Jell-O and I had no idea of a sense of self I didn't know I was an individual
 I was truly a blank slate I didn't know who I was or where I was or how I was
 and none of that mattered to me I was in the Jell-O he said there were these
 black roots surrounding him as he's just sitting there in this war I'm trying
 to think of another word for Jell-O as he's sitting there in this warm Jell-O
 he's sitting there in this warm Jell-O-Ton and he has his quote about it
 because he's been telling people about this he goes I died I died and I ended
 up in the next life and I had no memories and no sense of who I was I was
 just this new thing and people go that sounds horrible you're just like trapped
 in this place and you don't know who you are or why you are you have no idea
 about your family you don't remember anything and he has this quote he goes
 quote people think going through this experience in this state of almost
 amnesia must have been very horrific and yet I knew nothing else is a
 possibility and therefore to me it all just seemed natural this was existence
 that's a really interesting quote because again if I conch you over the
 head right now with a billy club and me and that bloody ghost dragged you out
 of your house and I took you underground and poured Jell-O all over you and then
 you woke up right because you would know oh no I have a family I'm gonna be late
 to work and I'm allergic to Jell-O he starts swelling up but if you didn't
 know anything other than the Jell-O then why would you be scared you would have
 no idea that there was a life outside of this Jell-O prison underground really
 really interesting way to look at it and then this is so this is super
 interesting so we have I love that detail to this the idea that when you
 die you can end up in a place and not know anything of life so there's no
 mourning there's no loss you just simply are as unique as that experience is
 what's interesting is then it transfers into a very very by the book life after
 death experience it's so basic there's a gate that shows up there's this
 beautiful music playing and he's like floating through the Jell-O and then
 he's taken to a paradise where marshmallow clouds of pink and white are
 slowly gliding over a valley and then like there's a bunch of people in
 peasant clothes dancing around come on over here over here take a bath take a
 bath get the Jell-O off you and then come over here and then he climbs on
 top of a butterfly and he's like flying around on a butterfly and then there's
 like this beautiful woman sitting next to him she's like you're loved you're
 loved here really basic life after death obviously to him this was a life
 change and experience I kind of glossed over it because we've covered stuff like
 that before and even if you've never listened to that show before that's the
 standard life after death story right where you're walking a paradise there's
 people in peasant clothes you feel like this joyous acceptance and everything
 like that but the opening where he's in the Jell-O I find absolutely fascinating
 I've never heard anything like that before with a life after death experience
 that I can recall the second the middle part is a little boring it's a little
 redundant blowing around paradise with a butterfly but then it ends with all of a
 sudden paradise is replaced with pitch blackness an infinite dark void and in
 the center of it is a bright pulsating light and he's looking at it and he
 realizes that this is the creator this is the person who created everything and
 it is at this point when he remembers who he is even when he was in paradise
 climb on the back of a butterfly he's like is his family's mourning him he's
 in the hospital he doesn't even know his family exists when he's in this black
 void that's when he goes oh I have a family like I have people who love me
 back on earth and I have co-workers and stuff like that and I have that brain
 surgery to do and I have family members and stuff like that and then he remembers
 his life on earth for the first time and then he sees five faces appear in the
 darkness and they all have this concerned look for him and he wakes up comes out of
 this he does have a long recovery it takes two weeks for his brain to even
 start to fully function he's just laying there for a while but he doesn't make it
 and when his brain is finally fully healed and he's opening his eyes he's
 able to interact with the world he realizes because people are coming in to
 visit him he realizes that four of the faces he saw in the darkness were family
 members you didn't recognize them at first but now that he's seeing them in
 the hospital room he's like you were there and you were there and you were
 there he goes but there is a fifth face and I don't know who that was and
 apparently what he says was he found out later there was a relative of his who
 claims to have psychic powers and they were trying to contact him
 telepathically while he was in his coma it wasn't there in the room but was
 somewhere else trying to telepathically contact him a fascinating story
 fascinating story doesn't like the wizard of Oz that's true but we have this idea
 the really the most fascinating part was the beginning the rest of this story
 about miraculous life after death I'm like boring get back to the Jell-O the
 idea of paradise being there we've covered that before find that very
 fascinating the idea though of not knowing who you are when you are dead is
 infinitely fascinating to me because that goes against what most major religions
 preach at least the Western religions right you you are reunited with your
 loved ones in the afterlife but if you I mean I guess eventually he was right he
 was running around I maybe his loved ones also flying around dragon flies are
 playing jobs and you're like a John fly away and you're a little slow butterfly
 the idea that you can not know the idea that you exist here and you learn and
 you grow as a person and then when you die you basically forget all that stuff
 and you're in this such a natural state and everything's wiped clean is
 fascinating and a little terrifying I'm not gonna not gonna lie like I think
 that's why I kind of glommed onto that that's terrifying state but if that's
 all you knew right this is all we know that's what's so fascinating about life
 and life after death we don't know what happens after you die I think there's a
 common some people go I don't know and they literally mean they don't know like
 they don't know if there's life after death but people like me I do believe in
 life after death I will also say I don't know because it's such a weird question
 if someone asks what do you think happens to us after we die I will say I
 don't know but the full answer is I believe we go somewhere but I don't
 know what it is or what that experience will be like will there be gravity in
 paradise will there be enough butterflies for everyone or will some
 people get stuck with caterpillars and they're just going they're just riding
 that caterpillar around who knows like that's the thing when I say I don't know
 I'm talking about the specifics and I think a lot of people when you ask them
 what do you think happens to you when you die I think a lot of people when they
 say I don't know they mean the specifics they're not talking about the big
 question about life after death this is really fascinating and there's actually
 been a big push lately I've been seeing more and more of these articles
 psychology today just ran a big article on Monday about how it is obvious that
 there is life after death there has been so many accounts of people having these
 experiences and you can caught you can keep saying well it's just the chemicals
 firing in your brain you can keep saying that over and over and over and over and
 over again but that is that really the answer is that really the answer and
 what's interesting is they say people who are not religious have these
 experiences people who did not believe in life after death before this
 experience afterwards said like was like a huge conversion right a huge amount of
 people say no it's obvious there's life after death and what I thought was so
 interesting they did this study and that's what this psychology today
 article was referencing one of the things that constantly popped up in this
 study was when people die and have these experiences these near-death experiences
 they almost always say the world I went to was the real world like it felt more
 real than anything I've ever experienced here that was a common refrain when I
 died it felt like I woke up it felt like that was reality and this is a place
 we're at while we're learning things or a place that we're at while we're
 killing time together that's so interesting that that was a common
 statement when I died I went to the real place I was home there that's where
 I'm supposed to be as they're doing the interview they're like you have any
 cyanide on you or maybe I don't know like is this building on the tenth story a
 lot of people are saying that that was realer than anything here in reality
 fascinating way to think about it and again tying it in with the ghost story
 and we'll wrap it up like this which one is accurate how can you have both how
 can you have a soul die like a young boy drown and then his ghost trapped on
 earth and then this doctor have a brain disease and go to paradise like how well
 how do the physics of ghost work we've talked about that a lot on this show and
 it's a question that I'll always wonder not gonna talk about slave labor camps
 for kid ghosts again but I'm talking about why are some people ghosts and
 some people go to paradise I don't understand I mean you can look at it
 from a religious perspective right you could say well maybe Dr. even Alexander
 followed this religion maybe the five-year-old boy was a dirty heathen
 but I don't think it's that because you do have people that of all religions that
 end up as ghosts and then you have people of all religions or no religion go to
 paradise have these visions or go to these places a place realer than the
 real world how do you get slotted into what how do you I think it'd be dope to
 be a ghost honestly for a while but I want to want to do it for like six seven
 thousand years right but to be honest I think paradise would get a little boring
 after six or seven thousand years fascinating story what happens to you
 after you die my answer is something happens to you but whether you become a
 ghost or you go to paradise or what paradise is like whether you're reincarnated
 or sit next to the creator I don't know I don't know the specifics I it's so
 bizarre to me that you can either end up in an endless sea of jello and then
 dance with other joyous humans in this lush verdant valley and then hit your
