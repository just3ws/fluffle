1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 Are the highways of Mexico becoming a real-life example of Mad Max's apocalyptic road warfare?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a look at a battle that everybody knows but nobody remembers.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then we take a look back to the conspiracy iceberg for the theory known as French Viper Releases.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Were farmers really telling the truth that poisonous snakes were being dumped all over their countryside?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Or was it just another case of mass hysteria?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 We'll get to the truth today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. It's Friday and it's funny, I don't know why I said it like that.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It's funny because I was saying that this week's recommendation week, but just to clarify, we're going to be doing a lot of recommendations.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I'm really going to just kind of in season four be going through more of those because I got a lot of them backed up.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 But first off, I want to start off with the story that I saw in the news recently.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Headline was very evocative. It's a very short story, but I think it's definitely one that's really interesting to cover.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 The headline was Mexican truckers fight highway robbery with armored semis.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Now obviously, I immediately pictured a like, Fury Road where the semis have like bus-saw weapons.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 [Ring ring]

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Shopping up cars running next to them, but they're having a real problem in Mexico with highway robbery.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 They get 30 a day. The semi-truck... It's not like... Yeah, why do they call them semi-trucks?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Is it only because it's only half a truck and then you attach the other part on the back?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Or is a semi a different type of engine? Like a Hemi, but with an S?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I think it's actually a semi because it's only half a truck, right? And then you attach the trailer in the back.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Semis, the semi-truck company, they spend in Mexico for security. 6% of their revenue was spent on security on their trucks.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 The global average is 0.5%. That's how bad it is down there with highway robberies.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 That's an astronomical... It's not technically astronomical. You can do the math, but it's a very, very high upgrade of money being spent for security in Mexico.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So at this point, the insurance company says, "We're not going to ensure your transportation company unless you get armored semis."

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Most bulletproof, quote unquote bulletproof glass is only bulletproof versus handguns.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 It takes another type of stronger material to be resistant to like rifle fire.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And the insurance companies are like, "No, no, no, no, you don't need the handgun glass. You need to make your cars impervious to AK-47 fire."

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And the transportation companies are saying, "Well, we need the insurance where there's 30 robberies a day."

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 30 robberies a day since 2015, by the way. This isn't a recent thing. It's not just happening this month.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 So they've had to start heavily armoring their semis. And they tell the driver, "Trust the truck. You stay in the truck, you're not going to get killed."

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 When you get in, the little stairs disappear into the truck.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And no one can get in the truck. As long as you don't get out of the truck, if they block you off, just stay in the truck.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 We have transponders and stuff like that. We'll get cops out of there or anything like that.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I think it will come to the point where they're going to have to go straight up Mad Max and put spikes on the trucks down there.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And little bus stalls and like have warped pups on the back throw and Molotovs at people.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Because eventually you can say, "Okay, I'll just trust the truck."

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And whoever is robbing the trucks are going to have to one-up it. And they're like, "Well, if we can't get in the truck, if we can't get in the semi-part, the cab, with our AK-47s, then we're just going to have to start blowing up the cab."

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So there's going to be this weird arms escalation race down there. And they're shipping television sets. They're shipping high-end electronics.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 This isn't like they're shipping these aren't armored cars. These are just semi-truck drivers now having to basically get encased in armored car plating.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Not themselves like Robocop, but the cab has to get that hardened so people can buy a flat-screen television set for $99 at Walmart down there.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It's absolutely insane, but I think it's only going to get worse. I think they're just going to start seeing this escalation.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And who knows, in two years from now you could have warped pups international.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 They are the number one transportation company in Mexico driving their little dune buggies with all the spikes and stuff like that.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story. The next story was one that I found very interesting to me.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 It's actually quite fascinating to me. It was so fascinating. I was out with a girl and as she's sitting there smoking a cigarette, I go...

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Have you ever heard this story about the battle between the parliamentarians and the royalists?

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 As she's smoking her cigarette, she's like, "No." That's how excited I was about the story. It wasn't a random girl.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It was a friend of mine, but I was telling people it in real life.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Now you're going to be like, "Jayson, thanks for hyping it up." But anyways.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So, the year... I don't know the exact year. The century? 17th century.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 It is the height of the English Civil War.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 The war was between the parliamentarians and the royalists who were royal to the king.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And quite fans of Lord Scyth's Royals.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Sorry, that was dumb.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 The parliamentarians, their nicknames were called the roundheads, which I think is hilarious because that's how you generally describe every human head.

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I'm assuming they had some sort of stupid looking helmet that made their head look rounder.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 But if someone's like, "Hey, roundhead!" I'd be like, "Oh, are you talking to me? That is quite apt for the shape of my head."

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So anyways, the royalists and the roundheads are going to war. There's this city.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I really hope I wrote it down. I didn't here. Hold on.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Oh, yeah, I did. Here it is.

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Clochester. Now at this point people are like, "I know where this story's going, but not everyone does. Don't spoil it. Don't spoil it."

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And when in fact everyone's like, "I have no idea where this story's going."

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 We're the city of Clochester. It is controlled by the royalists.

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 The roundheads are going to advance on the city.

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Now, Clochester has two advantages going for them. It's a hardened target. It's a city that has a ton of weaponry.

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So they're not really worried about being invaded. They know that they can repel an invading force.

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But they really put their faith in a giant cannon that's posted on this wall, like on this tower of this church.

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And it's operator, one-eyed Jack Thompson. One-eyed Jack Thompson.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So you have this church tower, so you had a wide field of view.

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 This massive cannon, the biggest cannon in the city, probably one of the biggest cannons in the region.

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And one-eyed Jack Thompson. Now, one-eyed Jack Thompson had only one eye. That's why he got his nickname.

73
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 But he was a crack shot. He knew how to use the cannon. He was a veteran.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 There was no way that the roundheads were going to take this city.

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 They try it, though. The royalists hold them off.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 The roundheads keep trying over and over again. And again, a key to their defense was one-eyed Jack Thompson and his massive cannon.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Just launching these cannonballs.

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Green grass goes everywhere. Little weeds, leprechauns are getting blown to bits.

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And so are much of roundheads as these giant cannonballs are rolling through the ranks, breaking everyone's legs, bouncing off the ground, hitting them in the head, just smacking...

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I mean, this cannon was having a devastating effect on the roundheads.

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And the roundheads are like, "You know what? We're just going to lay siege."

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 At this point, we're going to pull back to a certain area. There's lay siege. No one gets in, no one gets out.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Now, it was a range war at a certain point because they wanted to lay siege, but the giant cannon could shoot farther.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 So the roundheads are like, "Listen, we can lay siege to this thing, but that thing's going to keep chopping us up."

85
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 But what else? We can't take the city right now. We're just going to have to hope we don't get crushed by these giant cannonballs flying at us constantly.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And we can't get our cannons close enough to knock it down.

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Seed goes on, and they're like, "Just keep shooting cannonballs at the city. We can't get to this one. We can't destroy this giant one just yet.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Keep laying cannonballs into the city."

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

90
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And the roundhead general says, "You know what? We've got to take this cannon out."

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 They don't know how bad it is in the city. They can kind of guess because it's been so long, but they know how bad it is out there when all of their troops are mangled by this giant cannon.

92
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So let's push our cannon forward. They're going to be in the range of 1A Jack Thompson and the giant cannon.

93
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Let's push them forward. We're getting there, and I want every cannon concentrating fire on that tower.

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 So how many of our guys gets taken out? Because if we don't take this out, if we don't take that tower out, we cannot take the city.

95
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So they moved in their troops, they got their cannons, and just [whistling]

96
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 1A Jack Thompson is lobbing these massive cannonballs and just [explosion] blowing up.

97
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But they get enough cannons close enough, and they aim them just right.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 [whistling]

99
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 When I Jack Thompson looks up, sees a bunch of cannonballs coming at him, turns to the camera and goes, "Today is a good day to die."

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 [explosion]

101
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 The cannonballs miss Jack Thompson and the cannon, but hit the wall underneath, and the church tower collapses.

102
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 [explosion]

103
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Now the people in the city are very, very panicked at this point, because that was their death star weapon.

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 That was the only thing keeping the roundheads from coming in any earlier.

105
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 The royalists show up, dust everything off, one of them picks up the crumpled body of 1A Jack Thompson and goes, "Noooo!"

106
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And they're like, "Dude, put them down and help us move this stupid cannon!" Because they got to get that cannon in position.

107
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It's pretty busted up, but at the end of the day it's just a giant cast-iron thing that holds gunpowder and balls.

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 But like the hinges, the wheels and all that stuff are jacked up.

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And they're like, "We gotta move it somewhere. We gotta get it on another wall, and we have to do it now."

110
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So all of the troops are trying to move this cannon. Roundheads are approaching and they're like, "Crap, this is not gonna go well."

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 They start lashing it to their horses. They start trying to drag it through the street to anywhere else where they can elevate it, but it's too heavy.

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 They can't move it. The roundheads, they take the better positions.

113
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 The town leaders say, "Should we hold out? Should we hold out? What do we do? We lost our super weapon."

114
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 We have these other cannons. We're kind of able to hold them at bay, but not for any amount of time.

115
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And they start getting word that other cities that are loyal to the king have started to surrender, so they surrender too.

116
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So the roundheads invade the city. And the general of the roundhead says, "I want to see that cannon. I want to take a look at that cannon."

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So they ride their horses over to the cannon, and it's just laying there on the ground.

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 The general is like, "So many men, so many lives destroyed by that hunk of metal."

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 He sees a little street urchin walking by. He sees a little street urchin walking by.

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 He goes, "Hey son, what was the name of this cannon?" The street urchin looks up at him and goes, "Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty."

121
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So that story, I just... First off, that story I just told you.

122
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Imagine me telling that story to a young woman smoking a cigarette outside of a restaurant.

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Almost word for word and about as long. She sat there, smoked the cigarette.

124
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 She didn't know me as well as she did. I would assume she would have walked away, or thought I was some sort of psychopath.

125
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 But that is the true story of the story of Humpty Dumpty.

126
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

127
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 All the king's horses and all the king's men could have put Humpty back together again.

128
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 There are people who say that no, no, no, the Humpty Dumpty thing references the fall or the power of the pope.

129
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 There's a little bit of dispute to that. But back in those olden times, Humpty Dumpty was the term for a fat person.

130
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Just like how when we invented the nuclear atom bomb, I guess I should say, fat man and little boy.

131
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It was the same thing. They invented this giant cannon and it probably had some official name,

132
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 but because it was huge, people just called it Humpty Dumpty like it was some fat dude.

133
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And that was the slang term for the cannon was Humpty Dumpty.

134
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And that again, some nerd will be like, "No, actually Humpty Dumpty is referenced to King Edward VIII."

135
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Humpty Dumpty's story of about a badass cannon that fell off a wall and in the last stitch effort to get it moved into another position.

136
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Oh, and I should say the entire story I told you was true, except for the general showing up at the end and asking the urchin.

137
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 That's all historical. So whether or not the nursery rhyme is related to that, that cannon was no one as a Humpty Dumpty a big cannon.

138
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I don't know, I really like the story. I'm sure I mean, there's a human smoking a cigarette.

139
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And she goes, "Yeah, I think I heard that before." I was like, "Oh, that's all the only response I got from my animated story."

140
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 She doesn't listen to the podcast so I can say whatever I want about her.

141
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 That's the power of the podcast apparently. I've made that comment a couple of times.

142
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 She doesn't listen to the podcast. I can say whatever I want.

143
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 So the last story we're going to cover this night is an interesting one.

144
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It was one on the conspiracy iceberg, but there's so much on the iceberg I never really noticed it before.

145
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And it was a request. Someone sent it to me. It was a young man, I'm assuming.

146
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It was an email from Astoria, not the country. Is there a country called Astoria?

147
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 The entire country emailed me at once. But there was this urban legend.

148
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 This is really fascinating because it's one of those things that you start peeling back layers.

149
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Now, my research consisted of reading an article that was so well written that that was it.

150
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And because most of the sourcing, most of the articles about this are in French and it's an older story,

151
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 it was really the only one covering it, but it was a very... I wasn't even really an article.

152
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 It was more like a research paper.

153
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 There is this research paper known as Viper Release Stories, a contemporary French legend.

154
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And it's an onion man. It's a weird onion story. So this is the conspiracy theory in the nutshell.

155
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It started off in the 1980s in rural France. You'd have farmers, you'd have, you know, people walking through the countryside.

156
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And they'd see a Viper and they'd be like, "What the...?" Well, that's weird. There's normally not snakes in this far.

157
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I mean, I know there's snakes in France, but that's weird. Snake scurries on by.

158
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 They walk a little bit further and they see another snake and they're like, "Okay, now that's really weird."

159
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Because there's definitely... I've never seen two snakes on the same day. Keep walking a bit.

160
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And then they see another snake and they're not just like, "Well, that's super weird." It's a different snake.

161
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's not the same species. So now they're like, "Okay, now I've seen three snakes and one of them was completely...

162
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Like, this is really weird." They'd go home, they'd sit in their little thatch-tut.

163
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I guess they probably still live like that in the 1980s in France. They have a little thatch-tut.

164
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 They're smoking their hobbit weed and they go, "You know, Antoinette, today I saw the most curious thing."

165
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And the Antoinette goes, "That's weird. You sound like an old British guy." "Wee-wee, yes."

166
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 "Today I saw the most curious thing."

167
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Now he sounds like the Count from... It's just me sure, apparently.

168
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 He's like, "You know, today I see all the most..."

169
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 "Well, okay, now he's Italian. Forget it. No accents." He goes, "Today I saw the most curious thing."

170
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 "I saw a bunch of snakes." That is weird, right? And she's like, "Yeah, that is weird."

171
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And it's even weirder because I saw a bunch of snakes. The other day, I just figured it was worth talking about.

172
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And the legend grows. People in rural France start saying somebody is dumping snakes in the countryside.

173
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And as bizarre as that sounded, the proof was there. They said, "Look at all of these snakes."

174
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 "There's normally not this type of snake in this region. There's definitely not this many snakes in this region."

175
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 There's a ton of them. And the legend starts to grow until it becomes... Until they start to create these conspiracy theories.

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 One, snakes are being dropped off in unusually large numbers. So it's not just like two or three snakes,

177
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 but you'd see a lot of different snakes. And generally, as you were walking through the countryside,

178
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 not only would you start to stumble across snakes, like literally, you're like tripping into them like Indiana Jones,

179
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 but you would see proof they were dropped, like a box or a bag nearby. That was one part of the legend.

180
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Second part, when you would stumble across the bunch of snakes, there would be an aircraft, most likely a helicopter,

181
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 leaving the area. Three, you would find boxes, bags, and parachutes in the middle of nowhere.

182
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 So there would be no snakes around, but you'd find a box in the middle of a field.

183
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 That sounds a bit of a stretch to me. And four, the new variety of vipers.

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So you would see different types of snakes that were never in that region.

185
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 It exploded in popularity in rural France. Rural France.

186
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And what happened was two magazines ended up covering the story.

187
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Now, they were called, one of the magazine was called Rumors, and the other one was called Liberation.

188
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I don't know what those are, I don't know what type of newspapers those are.

189
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I don't know if they're like weird newspapers or just like regular newspapers.

190
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 But anyways, it was covered in two newspapers. But by then, people were already talking about it in rural France,

191
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and they're starting to complain about stuff. They're starting to contact their government officials and say,

192
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 "Why the hell are there a bunch of snakes in my area?"

193
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Now, the French government, because this is the 1980s, they're starting to get all like, protect every animal, you know, type of thing.

194
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 They said, "You can't hurt snakes." That was the French set up this law saying, "You can't hurt snakes."

195
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Very specific law. And so the people in rural France thought they're part of the cover-up.

196
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Like, why would they have a particular law protecting snakes, and then a bunch of snakes show up in our backyard?

197
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Another interesting thing was the conspiracy theory started in the 1980s. In 1979, the government made the sale and exploitation of snakes illegal.

198
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So France does have a snake population. When I think of France, the first thing I don't think of is like, oh, snakes.

199
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Actually, if I had to think of what animal lives in France, I can't even think a cow maybe?

200
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 A council of everywhere? Like, are there any animals indigenous to France?

201
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Whenever I think of snakes, I think more like Middle East or Africa or something like that.

202
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 But they have enough snakes in France that they had to pass a law saying, "You can't sell them and you can't exploit them."

203
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And then a couple years later, there's a bunch of snakes everywhere, and the government's like, "You can't hurt them at all."

204
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 "You can't hurt them at all." So people started thinking about the cover-up.

205
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 But, so the people in rural France are having to deal with all this stuff.

206
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 They're reporting these snakes, and people are originally saying, "It's just an urban legend."

207
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 "There's no helicopters dropping off snakes. It's a mass hysteria."

208
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 "Maybe this person saw one snake, this person saw one snake, and it becomes this over-exaggerated story."

209
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 "You guys are just country bumpkins. You don't know what you're talking about."

210
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And all the reports were firsthand. They weren't like, "Well, my cousin saw a bunch of snakes."

211
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 "I saw a bunch of snakes in middle of nowhere. They shouldn't be there."

212
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So you have these two groups of people, one of them saying, "I know what I saw. I saw snakes."

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And the government's saying, "There are no snakes there."

214
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 "No one's dumping them in the middle of nowhere. You don't have to worry about it."

215
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And it's funny because it's close parallel to, "You could replace snakes with UFOs."

216
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 "You could replace snakes with UFOs, and it's the same story."

217
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 "I saw UFOs. There's no such thing as UFOs." That's what was going on here, okay?

218
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But, the next part of this story, so it turns out after these rumor, these Viper Snake release stories,

219
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 went on for like a decade. It kind of petered out.

220
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But, in the 1980s, it really started.

221
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So, in rural France, there was the, okay, so, and let me say this too, the bad guys in this story.

222
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 So it wasn't just, "There's a bunch of snakes magically appearing here."

223
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 The farmers were thinking that it was, people were dropping off snakes for one of three reasons.

224
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 One, ecologists trying to help endangered species.

225
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 So they were like, "Oh, we want to make more snakes appear?"

226
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 So they were dropping them off in the middle of nowhere where they could breed un-molested.

227
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And then the second theory was, it's ecologists still, but they're providing food for birds of prey to help their population.

228
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Now, I think you can kind of guess that the farmer people weren't a big fan of ecologists,

229
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 and that seems to kind of be a trend across the world.

230
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Because I need to put the right, like, nitrates into my soil and do the right stuff for my farm,

231
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 and you got some scientists going, "Uh-uh, you got to use sunflower oil for that stuff."

232
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And they're like, "Well, that doesn't work. I have to use this nitrogen."

233
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 They're like, "Nope, it's not natural."

234
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 So you have a lot of that happening here too, in America, where you have ecologists saying,

235
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 "You have to save this. You can't do anything there because the, you know, like, metaphysical tadpole,

236
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 this is only breeding ground, and you're like, "That's where my cows drink."

237
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And so you kind of always have the headbunny.

238
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So the farmers, the rural people were saying it was either ecologists trying to help endangered snakes

239
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 have a safe place to breed, ecologists were trying to provide food for birds of prey,

240
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 or that scientists from pharmaceutical laboratories were taking them out in the middle of nowhere,

241
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 letting them breed so they could extract the venom from them and then make anti-venom and cell and stuff like that.

242
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Those sound oddly specific, but that was kind of in the town, because they didn't have any proof,

243
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 in the town they're thinking, "Maybe it's this local ecology college doing it, or maybe it's this guy."

244
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And then, you know, as the helicopters start getting brought into the story, they start thinking,

245
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 "Oh, maybe it's a pharmaceutical lab. They're dropping the snakes off." Whatever.

246
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 So let's go back to when I said that the government said, "You can't sail or exploit snakes."

247
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 There was a specific clause in that. There was a specific clause in that law.

248
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 So they said, "You can't sail them. You can't harass snakes at all. Leave them alone."

249
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 "You can't do crank calls in the middle of the night. You can't pull their pants down."

250
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Pharmaceutical companies go, "This is true. We talk about all the rumors."

251
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But pharmaceutical companies say, "We need to be able to take anti-venom from snakes,

252
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 so we can produce anti-venom and sell it and also use it to save people's lives."

253
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And the government says, "That's true. We will allow you."

254
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 This is in the law. "We will allow you to take snakes and extract venom as long as you release them."

255
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 After you're done. So pharmacists are like, "Oh, that's okay. That sounds like a thing."

256
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Now you would think it's not like they would take one snake, take his venom,

257
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 and then let him go out the door and take another snake and take his venom, let him go out the door.

258
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 They're in the industry, so they're going to milk a thousand snakes of their venom,

259
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 put a thousand snakes in a box, and take them somewhere.

260
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 They would release them. There's no law saying where they had to release them.

261
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So the fact that all of a sudden mass amounts of snakes were showing up in the middle of nowhere.

262
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Now when the conspiracy theory was starting, people were just seeing the snakes everywhere,

263
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 and from what I gathered, they came to the conclusion that it could be the pharmacists

264
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 releasing them due to the venom because of this law.

265
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 But the pharmacist, the pharmacologist I guess is a better term, or yeah, the pharmacologist,

266
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 were saying, "Oh no, that's not us. That's not us."

267
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And the government was denying it was a problem at all.

268
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And then, and then, between 1980 and 1982, there was an ecologist who was releasing snakes into a swamp.

269
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So it was bizarre. Both conspiracy theories actually turned out to be true.

270
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 That guy got caught. He was releasing snakes into the swamp because he wanted to help them breed.

271
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Whether or not those people were seen doing that, or they were caught afterwards,

272
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 or the urban legends started first that these are the people who are doing it and they just happened to do it,

273
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 it could be a mixture of all three.

274
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Because they didn't like the ecologists anyways, so they were going to place blame on them,

275
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 and then when it turns out one of them was actually dumping snakes in rural areas of France,

276
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 it just kind of fit perfectly.

277
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 I think the people in France who were walking around and stumbling across snakes had seen the law about snakes

278
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 saying that it was okay for pharmaceutical companies to milk them as long as they dropped them off,

279
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 and they just assumed they're just flying helicopters and throwing them out of boxes on parachutes and stuff like that.

280
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 But the whole time, even though it said in the law that pharmaceutical companies could release snakes wherever they wanted,

281
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 whatever amount, the government completely denied the fact that there was as much snakes running around out there.

282
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It was considered an urban legend among stupid, uneducated country folk in France.

283
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 The same way that if you say you saw a UFO, someone could be like, "Yeah, you're hitting that moonshine, right?"

284
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 You know, like, it was the same disregard for people basically saying, "You're stupid for believing that."

285
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 That's not true.

286
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Even though everything linked up.

287
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Now, to be fair to the upper crust, witty or bane people who are sneering at these country people,

288
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 we know that ecologists dump the snakes.

289
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 We know that the pharmaceutical company could milk snakes and release them.

290
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 It's possible that the country people were exaggerating the amount of snakes in their area.

291
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 But I think it's interesting because we have, the two groups they suspected, actually have been caught releasing snakes.

292
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 The only disagreement is could they have released as many as the people in rural France say that are out there?

293
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 But the disregard for their real experiences is what's so bizarre about it.

294
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 You have these people who live in that area reporting an ecological disturbance, i.e. a mass amount of snakes.

295
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And the government's simply shrugging and going, "There's no snakes out there."

296
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Not anymore than would normally be there.

297
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 So why don't you go back to your farm and let us handle things?

298
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And then the farmer goes back there and is like, "Whatever."

299
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And then three weeks later, he reads a report about a guy dumping snakes in his hump.

300
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 It's a bizarre story.

301
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And even today it's considered an urban legend.

302
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Even today it's considered that's just something people believed back then.

303
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Even though all those pieces fit together.

304
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Is it just like a bunch of conspiracy theories, a lot of weird coincidences that happened so close together that a little bit of mass hysteria kicked in?

305
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And one snake became 20?

306
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Or were multiple groups actually dumping snakes in the middle of nowhere, hoping no one would ever find them?

307
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 The government knowing these groups are doing that.

308
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And when people complain about it, the government simply shrugs and says, "There's nothing to see here."

309
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It's just your imagination.

310
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 The parallels between Viper Release stories and UFO sightings is obvious.

311
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Or any sort of paranormal activity, but specifically UFO because you have the government kind of poo-pooing the whole thing.

312
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Government doesn't really come out and say ghosts don't exist. They really don't care.

313
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 But you have the people saying, "We're seeing this phenomenon in our area that's not natural."

314
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And then you have the government and the scientific community saying, "That's not true. That's not true."

315
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 When in fact the government and the scientific community were actually taking part in their own ways of creating the snake outbreak.

316
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But I also like it because it's a fairly harmless conspiracy theory.

317
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 No one died. There's no tragedy to it. It's just a farmer getting mad.

318
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 He goes to Melchus Cow and a bunch of snakes come out.

319
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 It's just that level of a conspiracy theory.

320
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 A conspiracy theory nonetheless.

321
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And again, I think it's important to look at these ones that are much more grounded in reality.

322
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Because it gives us clues on how to find these mysteries.

323
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 It's easy to sex everything up and make everything super dark and super violent and throw some aliens in there.

324
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Make aliens drop the snakes. Yeah, yeah, let's do that. It's really easy to do that stuff.

325
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 It's just a harmless, fun, conspiracy theory. And it's a great way to end the week.

326
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I like these stories. I like these positive conspiracy theories. It's still a little wacky.

327
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Still a little mysterious.

328
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 But not everything has to be doom and gloom. Not everything has to be so dark.

329
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 I think the key to paranormal stories and ghost stories and UFO stuff is entertainment.

330
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 We want to shed light on these mysteries and we want to find out more.

331
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 But not everything has to be so grim.

332
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Sometimes it's just a farmer.

333
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 A bunch of snakes.

334
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 An empty box.

335
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And a mystery.

336
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
