1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
 Would you be willing to play a video game that if you died, you die?

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,320
 And then we end season 19 with a terrifying look at our possible future.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,440
 We always hear stories about the great reset, an idea that eventually we will be forced

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,200
 to eat bugs and be happy about it.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,280
 Well, what if things are actually worse than that?

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,080
 What if it's not bugs that we'll be forced to eat?

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,040
 You knew this would end the season.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,440
 What if it's not bugs that we will be forced to eat?

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,400
 What if we have to eat poop today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:56,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,840
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,520
 We got a bunch of announcements too.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,600
 So let's get started right away for the last episode of season 19.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now was our newest Patreon supporter.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,480
 He's carrying a spear and a shield.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,040
 I don't know, maybe he's just carrying a 32 on sprite.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone give it up for Harun Shaik.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,760
 Yeah, everyone's like, "Dude, learn how to pronounce people's names.

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
 I'm trying.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,960
 Harun, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,040
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that I do.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,520
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
 That helps out so much.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,720
 If you get any value from this show, please help the show grow."

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,600
 This is also the last episode of season 19.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
 I'm going to be taking a break until December 1st.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,800
 So I hope you guys stick around until the break's over.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,520
 I'm hoping you play some Dying Light.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,320
 I just got that game on a steam sale not too long ago.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,600
 I'm a huge fan of Dead Island, so I think it's like Dead Island, but faster and spookier.

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 We'll find out.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,920
 But even though I'm not coming out with brand new episodes until December 1st, on November

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,680
 24th at 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, we will be doing our annual Thanksgiving livestream

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
 special.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,320
 I hope you guys are able to join us for that.

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,800
 Listen, I get it if you can't.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 It's a huge holiday.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,880
 You guys are out doing stuff as well.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,000
 But if you do have some free time, stop on by November 24th, 12 p.m. Pacific Standard

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Time.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's always been fun.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 We've done a lot of these.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 We'll for them.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Or this will be the fourth one.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
 Over the years, that's a lot of fun.

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,360
 And lastly, before we get the episode started, there's a billion cars driving by today.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,560
 I don't know why it's so busy and I'm recording in my living room again.

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,480
 But before we get started, one more thing.

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,160
 Let's take a look at this submission for Fanart Friday.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 Look at this little bunny.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
 This little bunny man.

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,640
 It's technically a dead wrap radio logo.

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
 It's not a man.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,760
 But this was sent to me by Lyssa on the Patreon Discord.

58
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
 I love it.

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
 I love these little sketches.

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,760
 It never stops humbling me when I see people take time out of their day to do a little

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
 sketch.

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
 That's really cool.

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
 Or just even to listen.

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,200
 People constantly sending me emails that they listen to the show during their work or during

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,720
 their commute or while they're washing the dishes.

66
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 That's really cool.

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,800
 That's honestly really cool because that's how I enjoy podcasts.

68
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,240
 And it's cool that I'm part of that day for you.

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 I really, really enjoy it.

70
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
 And that's why I keep doing this show.

71
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
 Haroon.

72
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,920
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
 This episode I'm really excited about.

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
 This is some cool stuff here.

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
 Haroon.

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,880
 I'm going to touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

77
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,160
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

78
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:41,600
 Take us all the way out to an eSports arena.

79
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,680
 Haroon pulls up outside of this arena and he's like, "Is this the place?"

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,040
 And I'm like, "No, this is an actual sport being played.

81
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,640
 There's football going on in there.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
 Keep driving.

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,320
 We need to find an eSports arena."

84
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
 So he's driving.

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,760
 He gets to a college campus and there's like a little room off to the side and we see people

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,680
 walking in with their laptops and they're like, "This LAN party is going to be great.

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,040
 Doom emulators for all."

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
 And I'm like, "Nope.

89
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
 Nope.

90
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
 We're not going here either."

91
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
 And you're like, "Where are we going?"

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,760
 And I mean, those guys definitely were the definition of an eSport.

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
 In 1999, Jason, who's still having LAN parties.

94
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
 How old are you?

95
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 Okay.

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 Come on.

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 Get back in the car.

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 Haroon.

99
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 This isn't the right eSports arena.

100
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
 Keep driving.

101
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,360
 So he's driving through the city and we pass like all these other arenas.

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,400
 And finally, he pulls up to this auto mechanics garage.

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
 I was like, "Here's the place."

104
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,760
 Apparently, I turned into a prospect.

105
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,360
 They're all of a sudden, "Here's the place.

106
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,360
 This is where the gold be."

107
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,000
 So we walk into this mechanics shop and there seems to be no one around.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,920
 And I was like, "It's pretty clever.

109
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,520
 It's pretty clever hiding spot, isn't this?

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,200
 I saw this on an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I hit a button and all

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,480
 of a sudden the lift that lifts the car up, it lifts up and now you see there's like a

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,520
 staircase descending under the ground, which seemed great on an episode of Teenage Mutant

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 Ninja Turtles.

114
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,320
 But now that I think about it, it's kind of a different story.

115
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,160
 I think it's a bit of a dead giveaway because people would be like, "Hey, can you work on

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
 my car?"

117
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
 And they're like, "No."

118
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,080
 You're like, "There's a lift right there.

119
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,160
 Just lift it up.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
 Use my car.

121
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
 Fix it."

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
 And they're like, "No."

123
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,600
 Because there's a hidden passageway down there built by Baxter Stockman.

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,160
 We go down this staircase and we hear this, "Oh yeah.

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
 Woo, go yeah.

126
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
 Woo."

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
 We're like, "What in the world was that?"

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,840
 We keep walking down the stairs and we keep hearing like, "Yeah, yeah.

129
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
 Place your bets.

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 Place your bets.

131
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
 Who's going to win this time?"

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
 Yeah, yeah.

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,640
 And we walk into this massive underground eSports arena.

134
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
 We see two teams.

135
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,080
 They're both maybe 32 people in each team.

136
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,320
 Pretty standard for first person shooter, player versus player.

137
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
 Hold on.

138
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,000
 I got to move my studio back into the closet.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Yeah, I moved it out last night.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,160
 I was hoping to record it out here.

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,400
 But apparently, Autobots and Decepticons are fighting in the front yard.

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 It's so loud here.

143
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,000
 Give me a second.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Okay, sorry about that.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,520
 That was super annoying.

146
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,520
 It's like every car in the neighborhood decided to test out their snow tires on dry roads

147
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
 today.

148
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
 That's why everything is so loud out there in the living room.

149
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,700
 We're in this underground eSports arena.

150
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,960
 We see on opposite sides of the room two different teams.

151
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,040
 And there's about 32 players on each team and they're playing a first person shooter.

152
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,480
 But seated all around them.

153
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,960
 This really is like a sports arena.

154
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:46,040
 We see the rich and powerful and the dark and mysterious as well.

155
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,280
 Not Darth Vader, not Darth Vader, although he fits both of those descriptions.

156
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
 Well this isn't just any old eSports.

157
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,080
 I'm sure you could have guessed that the fact that we had to walk through an underground

158
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,700
 tunnel in a hidden passageway in a mechanics shop.

159
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,760
 This isn't any old regular old League of Legends nonsense.

160
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,000
 This is truly a one of a kind event.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,800
 It is a gaming competition where if your character dies in the game, your head blows up.

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,960
 Can you go chase him?

163
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,400
 Yes, I'm sure this is possible like in science fiction.

164
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,440
 I've seen tons of stuff with this in it.

165
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,480
 From the lawnmower man to the lawnmower man too.

166
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,560
 The idea of dying in the video game makes you die in real life.

167
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,720
 Well it was a work of fiction until just recently.

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,520
 Well to be fair, it still is a work of fiction.

169
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,400
 The situation I laid out has not happened yet.

170
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,760
 But recently Shananigans, a long time supporter of the show, Shananigans on Twitter sent me

171
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,280
 this article about this man named Palmer Lucky.

172
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 Palmer Lucky.

173
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,800
 If anyone sounds like a character from a Philip K Dick novel, it's this guy.

174
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,760
 Palmer Lucky, apparently he's the co-founder of the Oculus, the VR headset.

175
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,920
 He also has defense contracts.

176
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:19,280
 And he has created a VR headset that has three bombs in it.

177
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,680
 Right now he says this is kind of a piece of art sitting around the office, but he's

178
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,520
 constructed this.

179
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:33,200
 He goes, the idea is it's a VR headset that if you die in the game, you die in real life.

180
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,240
 And you go, why would anyone invent this?

181
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
 Why would anyone invent this?

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,240
 Well apparently he's a big fan of an anime called Sword Art Online.

183
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,000
 And the premise of that show is people put on VR headsets and then get teleported to

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
 this completely realistic VR world.

185
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,520
 Well it's not realistic, I guess there's dragons and stuff, little talking mushrooms.

186
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,720
 But you think that you're actually in this world, but in the real world, you're hooked

187
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,200
 up to this VR system and if you die in the video game, you die in real life.

188
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,400
 He's a big fan of that and he goes, you know what, I used to be a big fan of Godzilla.

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,160
 I irradiated a bunch of Agones that didn't do anything.

190
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,880
 Maybe I'll be a big fan of this cartoon.

191
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,440
 Maybe I should invent something that will kill you if you die in the game.

192
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,640
 And you're going, why would anyone, even if someone's a big fan of something.

193
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,520
 I mean, there's two elements to it.

194
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
 One, you die in the game.

195
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,360
 Two, the game is awesome enough to want to take the risk of dying.

196
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,280
 The Sword Art Online world is so vivid that it's worth that risk.

197
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,920
 If you're hooked up to this headset, you're playing Medal of Honor for the PS2.

198
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,840
 I mean that's not worth it, right?

199
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,240
 But imagine if you could go to a virtual world that was so beautiful and everything was amazing

200
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,040
 and it was everything that the real world isn't.

201
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,640
 Would you risk your head blowing up?

202
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,160
 You might be shaking your head no, but remember talking mushrooms, talking mushrooms.

203
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,760
 You have those guys as well.

204
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,760
 He's invented this and he goes, listen, there are a few things I need to work out.

205
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,460
 There are a few glitches I need to work out with this bomb you strapped to your head.

206
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,280
 He goes, first off, we'd have to make it so the charges don't accidentally go off, which

207
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,160
 is yes, that's a pretty big problem when you're dealing with bombs.

208
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,160
 He goes, the way I envision it is that the bombs will detonate when a specific frequency

209
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,440
 of red flashing lights appears in the game.

210
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,080
 That'll cause the bomb to go off.

211
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,640
 So that way you could have it for different video games.

212
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,320
 The developer of the video game would know the frequency that would be game over, not

213
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,900
 just the frequency of somebody flashing a flashlight in your face.

214
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,700
 You're just floating around Neopets and some dudes like click, click, click, click, click

215
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,200
 and your head blows up.

216
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,060
 You could trigger it to be a specific frequency of red lights.

217
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,060
 That's the first thing he has to get that thing done.

218
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:08,940
 He goes, secondly, the game world and then the kind of what I was saying, he goes, you

219
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:17,080
 would have to have a game world that was so vivid and so amazing that yes, it would be

220
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,560
 risky, it would be worth the rest to get your head blown off.

221
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,000
 Like otherwise when you put the goggles on, if you are playing like Chester Cheetah's

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,040
 jail breakout that you got free when you ordered a Pizza Hut Pizza, obviously, that would be

223
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,200
 the most stressful platformer you'd ever played, but you would know when that prickly

224
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,620
 cactus was shooting its thorns at you that you're not really in danger.

225
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,620
 I mean, you are, you do have a bomb strap to your head, but in the game world you would

226
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,740
 just be like, oh, that's just a guy shooting sprites at me.

227
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,500
 Now, that would be the last thought you had as your head disintegrates into a pile of blood,

228
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,220
 brain matter, skull and half chewed pizza.

229
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,500
 He goes, the game would have to be indistinguishable from reality to make it all fit.

230
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,180
 That is something that I think game designers are working towards and what's funny is that

231
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,160
 I, I would love a system like this.

232
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,560
 Not necessarily my brain blowing up, but when I play Minecraft, I play in hardcore mode

233
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,240
 and that's where when you die, your whole world gets erased and I'll drop like 30, 40

234
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,280
 hours into a one world and I like find a village and I build a wall around it and I do all

235
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,360
 this stuff and then I make up missions for myself.

236
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,400
 I'd be like, oh, I must go find a treasure chest.

237
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,380
 So I'm walking around and I basically playing this Minecraft game, which is okay to be

238
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,100
 fair for me, making fun of League of Legends multiple times.

239
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,900
 I get it, Minecraft's for babies, but I love Minecraft.

240
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,660
 I play in the hardcore mode and then I put 30, 40 hours and it was single world and then

241
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,940
 Creeper blows me up and it makes the impact so monumental.

242
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,220
 So I get like the need for it.

243
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
 He has a quote.

244
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,820
 He goes, quote, pumped up graphics may make a game look more real.

245
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,920
 But only the threat of serious consequences can make a game feel real to you and every

246
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,280
 other person in the game.

247
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
 And I do agree with that.

248
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,760
 I've, I would love the idea of a game that if you died in it, the game's deleted.

249
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 Like you have to buy another copy of the game.

250
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,160
 I think that would be great.

251
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,160
 I think it'd be great if you had a first person shooter and if you die in the game, there's

252
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:37,340
 then like a five to 10 minute unskippable cutscene of the army going to your wife's

253
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:43,180
 house and knocking on the door and you see her sobbing and then they cut to a scene of

254
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
 a mom.

255
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,100
 It's actually your mom before you can play the game.

256
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,300
 You have to get digital photos of everyone you know.

257
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,580
 And your mom's like, no, not my son.

258
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,580
 No.

259
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,580
 And then there's like a full, there's a full length funeral and it would really make the

260
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,800
 dying in the game be more consequential.

261
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,280
 Imagine GTA, but you get a car accident and the cops arrest you.

262
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 They're like, that's it.

263
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,800
 We're going to find you $1,000.

264
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,200
 We take all your weapons and you can't play this game for the next 10 days.

265
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,080
 Palmer Lucky says, as far as he knows, this has never been done before, but the genie's

266
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,400
 out of the bottle.

267
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:29,200
 And this would be awesome for the Illuminati that we talk about.

268
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,420
 We recently did an episode on this guy named Donald Marshall who talked about underground

269
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,580
 gladiator combats and they use clones and he fought Mick Jagger and Brendan Fraser stabbed

270
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,580
 him in the intestines and all this stuff.

271
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,280
 They were clones by the way if you're a huge Brendan Fraser fan, don't give up on them.

272
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,260
 It was his clone, but he believes that celebrities from around the world have killed him and

273
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,220
 the gladiator and this cloned gladiator arena.

274
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,020
 And as foolish as that is, what you're really doing in essence is you're taking two people,

275
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,080
 you're giving them weapons and then you're like, fight, fight to the death.

276
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,160
 And then you as a businessman are standing about 20 feet from them or sitting in some

277
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,680
 arena as these two people you've kidnapped are hacking at each other with swords.

278
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,920
 Now we've all watched enough movies where you have the two people being like, you know

279
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,160
 what, we're the ones with the swords.

280
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,080
 They're just some rich guy in a suit.

281
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,680
 Let's team up and we can hack our way out of here and all of a sudden the guy's like,

282
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,760
 no, no, don't kill me, I'm from Wall Street.

283
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,920
 And the two guys start a slave revolution.

284
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,000
 Just them, it's a revolution of two, but it works.

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 You would think that, right?

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,200
 But you'd basically be getting these trained fighters and locking them up and being like,

287
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,560
 you will fight to the death until you become too weak to fight anymore and then you will

288
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
 die.

289
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,280
 And then the prisoners like, or, or you just start beating you up now.

290
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,200
 And I'm assuming they'd also have goons with guns.

291
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
 The Illuminati people would have goons with guns in around.

292
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,360
 But my point is, is that you can do it like that.

293
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,680
 You can have people place wagers.

294
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,520
 But when you look at something like the Squid Game, that Squid Game show, they had to build

295
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,320
 these massive sets.

296
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 Massive sets.

297
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,520
 And even when you had like, I think it started off with like 460 people, they did have guards

298
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,360
 with guns.

299
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,960
 But you could easily have these uprisings.

300
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,800
 But imagine if the Squid Games were just people with bombs on their heads playing, playing

301
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,560
 Squid Game mods on Roblox and they're like, all the controls totally suck.

302
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
 What are you talking about?

303
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,920
 Oh man, my keyboard stuck and their heads are just blowing up.

304
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,960
 I totally could see that happening.

305
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:48,600
 I could totally see some sort of underground group forcing people to fight to the death,

306
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,280
 but instead of giving them weapons.

307
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,600
 And you figured this would even the battlefield.

308
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,520
 Like imagine if a super buff dude got kidnapped and then next to him got kidnapped to scientists.

309
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,720
 And he's like, oh man, never worked out my muscles except for my brain.

310
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,480
 Obviously, I mean, is a, when you're betting, you're going to be like, is this a joke?

311
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,920
 I'm going to bet on the buff dude.

312
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,880
 And if everyone was in a VR world and they died, it would be more even playing field.

313
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,400
 I mean, obviously the nerd would have an advantage there.

314
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,040
 But a fascinating thing, he says that this is the first time as far as he knows they've

315
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,200
 been invented.

316
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,200
 I'm sure there have been other versions of this.

317
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,320
 Okay, I guess I can't say I'm sure it is pretty science fiction even.

318
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,960
 Now that the cat's out of the bag, I can see people going, make us 64 of these.

319
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,280
 We're going to hold a tournament and whoever sucks at this first person shooter, their

320
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
 brains blow up.

321
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,560
 Although now that I think about it, you would imagine the Illuminati would have better things

322
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,360
 to do than hosting these types of summits.

323
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,880
 And actually that's a great segue into our next story.

324
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,600
 Harun, let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the Carbindercopter.

325
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,720
 We're taking it out one more time this season.

326
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,520
 Rise away from this gladiator arena, there's only one dude left with his brains intact.

327
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
 He's the winner!

328
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,160
 I mean, he's covered in brains.

329
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,560
 Did you imagine playing a first person video game with a VR headset on and you know it's

330
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,720
 to the death and when another player, like the guy sitting at the computer next to you,

331
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,240
 when he died, you're playing a game, right?

332
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,560
 You have a perfect sniper position and then all of a sudden two feet away you hear a BAM!

333
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,600
 And you're just covered in brain matter.

334
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,480
 Like it would totally freak you out.

335
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
 That would be the worst possible thing.

336
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,280
 Well I guess the worst possible thing would be the guy sitting next to you with no head.

337
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,440
 That would be the worst, but the second worst possible thing is you're trying to not die

338
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,760
 and all of a sudden you're just getting covered in that loud explosion, you're getting covered

339
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,480
 in brains and guts and gore.

340
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,920
 I don't know why I just had to leave you with that last horrible image.

341
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,240
 Harun, take this Carbindercopter away from this arena, we're flying all the way out.

342
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,640
 To a weightlifting gym.

343
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,280
 *imitates a drum roll*

344
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,200
 There's a company called Fit Biomics.

345
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
 They're probably just pronouncing that.

346
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
 It's probably Fit Bi...

347
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
 Oh I don't know, is there another way to pronounce it anyways?

348
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,360
 Fit Biomics is closer to probably what it is.

349
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,960
 There's a company called Fit Biomics and at Fit Biomics they have this new product invented

350
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,640
 by Dr. Jonathan Scheiman.

351
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
 It's called Nella.

352
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,640
 That's not a bad name right?

353
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,920
 Reminds you of Nutella.

354
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,320
 Well be prepared to not eat anymore Nutella.

355
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,480
 Dr. Scheiman, he has invented this thing called Nella.

356
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,200
 He goes, "Here's the thing, I've discovered through my research that to be a super athlete

357
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,160
 it's more than just your training, it's more than just your diet, it's even more than just

358
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,680
 your genetics.

359
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,320
 A large part of it is also your gut biome."

360
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,640
 So then we're standing there in this weightlifting gym and we see this muscle bound dude like

361
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
 doing all these reps.

362
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,560
 He's like, "Oh yeah, look at me, look at me."

363
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,960
 He definitely has some issues.

364
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,440
 He's like, "Life doesn't matter unless people look at me."

365
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
 He's lifting all these weights.

366
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
 He's like, "Look at me."

367
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,640
 And Dr. Scheiman goes, "Have you guys ever wanted to be as thick and muscular as this

368
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
 dude?"

369
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,480
 Here, take this pill I've invented, it's called Nella.

370
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,680
 He's holding this pill out to us.

371
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,200
 On the one hand, yeah, sure would be awesome to be this total buff dude who has issues

372
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,080
 with people paying attention to one, but on the other hand, hey doc, didn't you just

373
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,160
 say something about gut biome?

374
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,240
 Trying to figure out how athletes and what's inside their guts is actually helping them

375
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
 out.

376
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,040
 As you were asking that question, I put my hand up over my mouth.

377
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,560
 I'm like, "Hmmm."

378
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,720
 As you're asking that question, he flicks the pill in your throat and you're like,

379
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,920
 "Ugh, ugh."

380
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:08,280
 If you take the Nella, you can actually become an elite athlete.

381
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,120
 Now Nella, before you get too excited before you run to the store, you're like, "Oh, I've

382
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,680
 got a marathon coming up.

383
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,240
 Can I get one box of Nella?

384
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,600
 Let me tell you what's in it, what he does."

385
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,760
 And this is what he discovered.

386
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,440
 He said, "He drove around Boston for two weeks, eight hours a day.

387
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,080
 He's driving around Boston.

388
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:34,880
 He's collecting stool samples from elite runners."

389
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,880
 And what he realized was if you look at elite runners, they have this thing called, well,

390
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,680
 I guess most people have it, it's called bacterium vellanella atypica.

391
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,960
 And he goes, "When you look at elite runners, they have very, very high, consistently high

392
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,560
 levels of this bacterium."

393
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,680
 He said, "In a normal person, this spikes during exertion and this is one of the reasons

394
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,600
 why your muscles get sore.

395
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,920
 But if I took the stool samples from these elite athletes, he didn't tell me to snuck

396
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,680
 into their house late at night.

397
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,920
 He's all hiding in the closet, waiting until they go to bed."

398
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,840
 And then he crawls out in the darkness with a little spoon, with a little wooden spoon,

399
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,200
 a taster spoon from Baskin Robbins, go up in their butthole.

400
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,280
 He realized that they have this in them.

401
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,760
 They have a lot of this bacterium vellanella atypica.

402
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,840
 And this is part of being an elite athlete.

403
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,280
 He injected this bacterium into mice.

404
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,820
 And what could only be described as the funniest and cruelest experiment?

405
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:49,480
 He injected this bacterium into mice and they were able to run 13% longer than normal.

406
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,280
 So I mean, that's something you get the intern to do, right?

407
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,840
 I'm sure Dr. Shyam is like, "No, no, I want to inject them.

408
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
 I did all the work.

409
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,560
 I get to have all the fun."

410
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,440
 He's injecting it into the mice.

411
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,440
 But then you make your intern just watch two mice run, two mice run around on these wheels.

412
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,420
 So like, tell me how long the one with the gut biome stuff, tell me how much more he runs.

413
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,300
 And then he goes out on another fecal gathering mission.

414
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,860
 So if you take a mice who's injected with this, he could run 13 times longer.

415
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,160
 Now others go, "Uh, you know, sure, the science might be there.

416
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,540
 We do know that your gut biome is a huge part of who you are."

417
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,620
 They say 90% of the body serotonin gets produced by your gut bacteria.

418
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,480
 I think it's really interesting when people go, "I have a craving for sugar.

419
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 I have a craving for that."

420
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,960
 That's all your gut bacteria.

421
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,880
 If you've ever gone a couple days without sugar, because I very rarely have sugar, but it's

422
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,520
 weird when I do have sugar, then the next three days I'm craving it.

423
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,560
 It's because all the flora in your stomach is there.

424
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,300
 It pops up when you eat sugar and it's sending signals to your brain going, "Eat more sugar.

425
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 Eat more sugar."

426
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,760
 Because if it doesn't get sugar, it dies off the whole life form in your stomach.

427
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,780
 It's almost like a parasite in there and it's controlling you.

428
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:10,220
 That's why when you start overeating, it's hard to stop and you'll have food addicts.

429
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,300
 It's different where you're like a gambling addict.

430
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,940
 That's like a serotonin thing in your brain or your heroin addict.

431
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,500
 That's the heroin interacting with the dopamine receptors in your brain.

432
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,820
 Food addiction, sugar addiction is actually a new life form in your stomach developing

433
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,920
 and then releasing chemicals into the bloodstream saying, "Feed us.

434
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,040
 Feed us."

435
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:41,160
 You're building up this new life form in your stomach and when you stop eating sugar, it

436
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,520
 takes three days for this life form to completely die out.

437
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
 Then it will stop sending the signals because it's dead.

438
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,320
 It can no longer talk to you.

439
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,480
 It's totally different.

440
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,160
 It's super weird.

441
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,760
 The addiction to food is different.

442
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,380
 There's a new life form in you trying to get you to eat more of what it needs.

443
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,380
 Fascinating stuff.

444
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,860
 We know that gut biome is super important, but he's saying you can take this Nella and

445
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,860
 you now have the gut biome or you take it regularly, of course.

446
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,620
 There's a monthly subscription for $59 a box, which you can either go, "Wow, that's really

447
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,860
 low to be an elite athlete," or, "Wow, that's really high to eat someone else's poop."

448
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,320
 You can get a monthly subscription of Nella and they're saying that if you take this,

449
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,880
 you will be able to run longer than normal.

450
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,200
 I'm sure that's not the only thing on the box because otherwise you're like, "Oh, no,

451
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 I'm good.

452
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,320
 I don't run that much anyways."

453
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,440
 I saw that and I go, "Okay, the VR brain thing, that's something that I could see in a sci-fi

454
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,680
 movie and then I could see someone building it in real life.

455
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,680
 If you wanted to have real life gladiator combat, this would be the way to do it.

456
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,740
 It would be the safest way, I mean, not for the participants, but for you or it could

457
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
 just be a novelty."

458
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:06,020
 This one, this is really being produced and it is a performance enhancing supplement.

459
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,220
 Imagine a world where if you want to compete in sports, you have to eat human poop because

460
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,580
 everyone else has eaten human poop.

461
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,800
 Now, to be very clear, to be very clear, 20, 30 minutes into talking about this, he is

462
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,240
 not selling, I guess I should clear this up for the lawsuit, for the inevitable lawsuit,

463
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,480
 he is not selling pills of human poop.

464
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,800
 I keep human poop.

465
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,760
 I also accuse this guy of hiding in people's closets with tiny wooden spoons and taking

466
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,200
 their poop out without their knowledge.

467
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,240
 That's just hearsay, your honor.

468
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,940
 That's just hearsay, I heard it in my own head and then I said it.

469
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,060
 He's not selling pills of human poop, but he's selling pills of this bacterium cocktail.

470
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,820
 But in essence, I mean tomato, tomato, right?

471
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,700
 You're taking a pill that at one point, this bacteria was in some dude's butthole.

472
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,420
 Now maybe, and once I said that, okay, maybe it's not that, maybe he cultured this bacteria,

473
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
 right?

474
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:15,160
 He could then breed more of it in his laboratory, but I would still argue in this upcoming defamation

475
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,920
 case that if you, this is a philosopher's question, right?

476
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,220
 If you took a piece of poop out of a man's butthole and then isolated a small piece of

477
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,800
 that poop and then used that small piece of poop to create a chemical, are you still not

478
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 eating a man's poop?

479
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,440
 Are you still not, that was the origin point.

480
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,980
 Are you still not eating something that came out of some other dude's butt?

481
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,620
 Now I'm not a runner, I don't run for nothing.

482
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,900
 But if I was a runner, I would be thinking, well everyone else in the race is eating human

483
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
 poop, why aren't I?

484
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,620
 There's some guy just scooping it up, he's like what?

485
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,700
 Oh you're supposed to think this is in a form of a pill?

486
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:05,040
 This is a supplement that you could see almost you having to take if you are doing any sorts

487
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,700
 of sports at all, you're going up against people who are eating human poop and you're

488
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
 not.

489
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,160
 There's a lot of stuff that we would never do if we were forced to, no one, no one would

490
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,380
 want to live in a society where people go you gotta eat this poop, it'll make you work

491
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,380
 harder.

492
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,660
 Dude I work at Best Spy, I already have to work, I'd have to eat human poop.

493
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,980
 But if it's voluntary, right, it's voluntary, this is something that you could see athletes

494
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:37,120
 going if I want to compete at an elite level, I gotta eat the poop.

495
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:45,120
 I almost feel like this isn't a social issue or a science issue, it feels, I know I tossed

496
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,480
 a word around demonic, I know I tossed a word demonic around a lot on this show but

497
00:28:49,480 --> 00:29:00,920
 it sounds like something that is so anti-human to eat something that came from fecal matter.

498
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:10,820
 Now, I have to be very very clear, I am going to go and check and see, cause now I'm thinking

499
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:16,300
 about not being accused of this guy, not being accused of Dr. Scheinman of hiding people's

500
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:23,140
 closets, taking stool samples without their permission, getting enjoyment out of injecting

501
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,100
 fecal matter into mice, I'm starting to think, I'm starting to think of something here,

502
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:35,500
 there's gonna be two things, one, I either in the episode going, is it possible we'll

503
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,920
 live in a world where people aren't taking fecal matter, fecal matter, to win sports

504
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,840
 but really they're enacting some sort of ancient right to an old pagan god, like really this

505
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,520
 is what it sounds like, devouring fecal matter, that's like belphagore, there's a demon who

506
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,440
 loves poop and every time you use the toilet, I believe his name is belphagore, I'll double

507
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,740
 check that but every time you go poop you're basically worshiping him and this sounds almost

508
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,900
 like a demonic plot and people having like, this is really what it comes down with deals

509
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,980
 with the devil right, you can train hard and you can do your best but eventually everyone

510
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,300
 else in your sport is taking human poop, now you have to make a deal with the devil, are

511
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,100
 you going to stick up for yourself and say, you know what, I run for the enjoyment, I don't

512
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:25,180
 run to win so I don't want to eat human poop, that's what a deal or you know I am gonna

513
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,720
 eat poop, I am gonna eat poop to win, that's really what a deal with the devil is, you're

514
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,160
 making, you're compromising your own idea of what it means to be human and somewhat argue

515
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:44,200
 what it means to be fair in sports, you're eating human fecal matter to become a better

516
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:55,120
 athlete and that sounds like a demonic pact, you're giving away a bit of your humanity

517
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,780
 for a simple contest, something that's meaningless on the grand scale of things but you're eating

518
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:07,580
 poop to do it and all the while this great demon is watching all of this with glee, while

519
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:13,600
 the world became more sanitized as we cleaned up the streets from just logs of poop rolling

520
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,500
 down the open sewers of London to a world that's so sanitized that kids get peanut allergies

521
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,260
 because they're not getting exposed to germs and bacterium that they normally are in childhood,

522
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,640
 we've come a long way in a very short period of time, any sort of demonic entity that fed

523
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,240
 off of filth and disease would be losing power but now in the guise of a pill that makes

524
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,560
 you a better athlete, people are willingly ingesting fecal matter, this demon who had

525
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,160
 been slowly but steadily losing influence over the world is now in its own way being worshiped,

526
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,720
 when people are taking the Nella pill they're not like this is for you grand demon of fecal

527
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,180
 matter, but in a way they're doing that sacrament, it's more than that, it's more than that throughout

528
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:06,260
 all of human history people hated waste products but now they're willingly eating it and so

529
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:13,980
 is this the return of this belphagore type character, this demon who lives in the waste

530
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,540
 waters, a demon that lives in the filth, you're taking the sacrament just like you were taking

531
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:26,280
 the Lord's Supper, taking the consecrated wafer and a little bit of wine, could this

532
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,560
 be his way back to power?

533
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:41,380
 If you want to win, you have to ingest the poop, if you want to win, you have to worship

534
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,300
 the demon of the toilet.

535
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,120
 That's one way I can end the episode but I am going to say this, I'm recording this for

536
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,340
 a little bit of safety, there's a possibility, I thought about this as I was recording it,

537
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:01,300
 that he's not actually giving people pooped, I thought about this, like wait a second I

538
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,500
 never heard of me until I was reading over my notes and I'm recording the last episode

539
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:16,180
 of season 19, maybe he wasn't feeding people poop, maybe, I'm sure there was a bunch of

540
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:21,920
 you shaking your heads this whole time and you were like, does Jason actually think that

541
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,480
 these Nell-a-bills are like brown, there's a little piece of corn, there's a little

542
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,600
 piece of corn in some of them, no I don't think that, but I'm thinking now that the

543
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,720
 stool samples were just for the experiments, in the sense that he goes, I wonder if there's

544
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,260
 something different in an elite runner's stool, so he went, he didn't do it the creepy way,

545
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,500
 he didn't do the creepy way like I said, he asked people, hey can I have some of your

546
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,120
 stool please, which that's actually super creepy as well, but he gets this stool of

547
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,060
 elite runners and he gets stool of regular people and then he matches it and goes, wow,

548
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:07,540
 if you're an elite runner your stool has more of this bacterium, this vellanella atypica,

549
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,960
 interesting, so then no stool involved in the production process, I didn't even think

550
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,200
 about this, I totally didn't even think about this, then he throws away all of the poop

551
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,760
 and he is able to produce vellanella atypica in some other sort of way, like he puts out

552
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,760
 like a piece of bread, like he's doing some sort of science project for fifth grade, he

553
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,160
 leaves a piece of bread out for a couple of days and it grows mold and he's able to isolate

554
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:43,500
 the vellanella atypica, maybe he was able to produce this sans butthole and that's what

555
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,300
 the pill is, the pill, just like probiotics when you go and buy him at the store, it's

556
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,500
 possible just to be clear, I'm gonna double check before I release this episode, he's

557
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,260
 gonna be like, clearly you're all, this man has no idea what he's talking about, he disparaged

558
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:04,820
 me for three minutes, he called me a freak, a freak who's hiding in the shadows of people's

559
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:12,960
 closets, so maybe he didn't, I will record this part just in case, maybe he didn't, maybe

560
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,520
 he wasn't hiding people's closets, maybe this has nothing to do with human poop in its final

561
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:29,720
 form, that might have just been the experiment, or maybe tonight when you're getting ready

562
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,640
 to go to bed, you go, you know what man, season 19 that sure was a wild ride, dead rabbit

563
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,460
 who talks a lot about poop, the whole season, it wasn't just last episode, some weird stuff

564
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,780
 this season, you're like, you know, it's time for me to go to bed, but I do have that big

565
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:51,300
 marathon tomorrow, well I'll figure it out later, you fall asleep, then your closet

566
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:58,700
 door opens in the middle of the night, and you see a doctor shyman shaped silhouette

567
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,980
 start to creep out and you're like, oh no, oh no, you know exactly what the silhouette

568
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,360
 looks like, it's doctor shyman, it's doctor shyman, and you see him pull up a little wooden

569
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,440
 spoon and you go to get up, then you realize there's four super strong men surrounding

570
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,320
 your bed, they've had all the fecal matter they want, which is oddly a lot, there's some

571
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,560
 weird fetish cult, they're holding you down with their fecal empowered muscles, you're

572
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,560
 like no, no, and doctor shyman's walking closer and closer with his little taster spoon, he's

573
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:39,060
 like, ah yes, for $59 a month, requires a lot of poop, it's like that old, what was

574
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,340
 it, the outer limits, or the twilight zone tells from the dark side about the box, you

575
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,420
 got the box, and if you pressed the button, someone you didn't know would die and you

576
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,300
 would get a million dollars, but if you don't press the button, then you don't get a million

577
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,380
 dollars, and you have like an hour to decide, and the woman presses the button, I mean she

578
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,720
 gets a million dollars, and then the guy at the ending goes, ah yes, everyone presses

579
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:10,200
 the button, I will give this box to someone else now, someone you don't know, that's this,

580
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:18,200
 if you order, if you order Nella, what you really do is give in your address to FitBioMix,

581
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,240
 and now they're also gonna make you part of the food chain, if you order this you're like

582
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,860
 alright my Nattella, I mean my Nella, it's finally here, ohm, and then your address went

583
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,660
 into a database, they're going to drive up to your house and start harvesting your butt

584
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,460
 hole, because how else are they gonna produce enough of this, probably, probably without

585
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,580
 butt holes, he's probably culturing it in some other way, but in the world of conspiracy

586
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:48,620
 theory, who knows what is possible, who knows what, who knows what defamation is, can you

587
