1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 "What would you do if there was a cure for being you?"

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,320
 Then we meet the madman known as Max Kramer to delve into the mind of a maniac.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,560
 And then finally, we travel to Sri Lanka to meet a young man headed back home after college

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,760
 break.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,280
 He thought he was warmly going to be embraced by his family.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:33,000
 Instead, he found his soul in the icy grips of the recently deceased, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,720
 "I'm a dead rabbit radio, actually I'm a walk radio"

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,720
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, I need to get a new chair, this one's squeaky, hold on.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 [Music]

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 [Music]

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,720
 There we go, it wasn't like I could go to IKEA and buy like an office chair.

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,720
 I have a selection of folding metal chairs from Walmart.

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,720
 I'm telling you man, Walmart has everything you need.

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 I have some metal folding chairs from Walmart, that is the piece de rÃ©sistance of my studio.

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,720
 Another piece of my studio that I like to keep as a collector's item, he's frozen in the corner.

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,720
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, one of our newest Patreon's.

19
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 Give it up for Johnny Thunder, everyone we have a round of applause to Johnny Thunder.

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,720
 Returning Patreon, he used to support the Patreon and he's back and we appreciate that.

21
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 Johnny, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,720
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,720
 There's flyers you can print out in the show notes, I hang those up around my town.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,720
 That gets a lot of listeners and there's also a merch store as well.

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,720
 I don't mention the merch store enough, we have a merch store and that is in the show notes as well.

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
 Some really cool merchandise.

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,720
 Johnny, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command here.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,720
 We're starting off our story by flying all the way out to a laboratory.

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 [Durgible sound]

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Now we're high in the sky, we're up in this Durgible, we're drinking some RC colas, kicking back.

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
 Classic Dead Rabbit Radio style.

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 But beneath us in this laboratory, there are some serious decisions to be made.

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,720
 Now, I got to give credit to, there's a journalist named Damien Gardy,

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 and he was the first one to cover this or maybe he wasn't, maybe he played you right, someone else's work, I don't know.

37
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 But I got all my information from his article in the Stat News, which is a biomedical journal, biomedical news website.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,720
 There's a really, really interesting story that's going on right now.

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
 There's a group called Bio-Marin Pharmaceutical.

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 And they are sitting there in this laboratory one day and there's this baby in front of them.

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 And there's like a, this is not realistic depiction of events.

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 Do not sue me Bio-Marin, please don't sue me.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,720
 There's a baby, an innocent baby sitting there, gaga-googoo.

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,720
 And one of the evil, evil scientists from Bio-Marin is walking around with this syringe and he goes,

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 "Gentlemen, we've perfected the formula."

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 And they inject this little baby with this needle and the baby cries.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 And then they laugh, they all laugh, they go, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:17,720
 At both ages of 5 and 18, you can take a daily injection called Voxzogo and this treats anchroplasia.

49
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 This treats anchron-dro-plasia.

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,720
 This treats achondo-dro-plasia.

51
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
 So I did three takes of that.

52
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
 One of those pronunciations are correct.

53
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,720
 This is a disease that causes dwarfism.

54
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,720
 Now apparently there are other causes of dwarfism, but one of the causes is that word I pronounced three times.

55
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
 And this will fix that.

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
 They said, "If you give a child these injections every single day,

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
 what it would do is you would add an extra like 1.6 centimeters."

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:01,720
 So in like non-nerd speak, that is 6 inches.

59
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 That is 0.6 inches.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
 Wait, what?

61
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 That's super tiny.

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,720
 Why would I want to grow 0.6 of an inch?

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 Can you imagine getting injected every single day, your entire childhood, with the Palmarin guys,

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
 like, "I volunteer to do this one.

65
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
 I'm extra evil.

66
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 I like coming out here injecting children myself."

67
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:32,720
 Every single day you get a needle in your flesh and it only adds to an extra 0.6 inches a year.

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 How did they write?

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
 Because then I'd be like, "Look at me, Mom.

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
 I'm Goliath."

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
 0.6 inches a year.

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,720
 So if I wanted to grow, that would be two years to grow an extra inch.

73
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,720
 So I guess like, I mean, here's the thing.

74
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 Despite the fact that I don't want to get injected every single day to grow 0.6 of an inch.

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
 That's not a lot at all.

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 I thought it was more.

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
 Anyways, the point, it's not to make you into a basketball star.

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,720
 It's to make it so you don't suffer from dwarfism.

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,720
 What I love about this story is I love, I think this is the science fiction nerd in me,

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
 I love to see how science affects society.

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
 That's what we have going on right here.

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
 There are so many layers and levels to this story.

83
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,720
 The main thing is Biomaran has invented this shot.

84
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,720
 You take it once a day and it can make it so even if you have the genetic condition that causes dwarfism,

85
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
 you will not be a dwarf.

86
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
 You will be the height of your peers.

87
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,720
 And so Biomaran goes, "This is a breakthrough therapy for people who suffer from dwarfism."

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
 But then you have people who go, "No, no, no, dwarfism isn't a disability.

89
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 It's nothing that needs to be cured in the first place.

90
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 What are you talking about?"

91
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 Like, I am proud to be a dwarf.

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 You have a bunch of people who have dwarfism.

93
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 You have these support groups as well that are saying, "We don't need to be cured."

94
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
 We think there's other...

95
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 We think you basically saw a market and exploited it.

96
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:17,720
 And because 80% of parents who have children with this androcaplasia are not dwarves themselves,

97
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,720
 they are now given decisions as the child's being born saying,

98
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
 "No, we want to correct this. We don't want our child to be a dwarf."

99
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
 If your parents were dwarves, they'd be like, "Hey, there's nothing wrong with this.

100
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 We live totally full and functional and fulfilling lives."

101
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 So you can be a dwarf too to their little baby.

102
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,720
 But adults who don't suffer from dwarfism, they may see it as an affliction that needs to be cured.

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 This product doesn't come cheap either.

104
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,720
 It costs $320,000 a year to grow 0.6 of an inch.

105
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 $320,000 a year.

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,720
 Now there's rebate. That doesn't include insurance and stuff like that.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
 There's rebates you can get and everything like that.

108
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,720
 But it's still very profitable for biomarin, correct?

109
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,720
 So people are saying you've basically created a product to cure something that people don't really need cured.

110
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 Biomarin goes, "We're not just..."

111
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
 It's really interesting this back and forth.

112
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 Biomarin goes, "We're not trying to eliminate dwarfism."

113
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
 We're not trying...

114
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,720
 Well, okay, we kind of are, but we're not trying to eliminate dwarfism because we don't like dwarves.

115
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,720
 They said there's a whole host of medical problems that come along with ancro-draplasia.

116
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,720
 There's a whole other host of stuff. They get sleep apnea, they have spinal damage, their bones don't work right.

117
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
 We're not just trying to get rid of dwarves.

118
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,720
 We're trying to make lives better through all the other medical stuff.

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 And to fix all the medical stuff, we need to have them grow.

120
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,720
 You have within the dwarf community some people saying,

121
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,720
 "This is wrong, we don't need to cure, and if they cure these children in the future, our community is going to disappear."

122
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 Like, this is something that's very special to me and to my brothers and sisters.

123
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 Then you have other people in the dwarf community go,

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,720
 "I wish this was around when I was a kid. Like, I don't want to be a dwarf.

125
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,720
 I wish that I could have been the size of a average adult."

126
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 And then to make everything even weirder.

127
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,720
 So, if all these divisions, and this is just coming out,

128
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,720
 this medicine is just really being released, you have all these different divisions,

129
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 it turns out this is where the conspiracy comes in as well.

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 There's this big debate going on and there's a group known as the Little People of America.

131
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,720
 And they do not take stances on growth treatments.

132
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,720
 There are some people who do the broken bones thing where you break the legs and you stretch them out so you can get a little bit taller.

133
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,720
 They've taken no platform. If you want to do something for your dwarfism, that's fine, but we're going to celebrate the people.

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
 Little People of America takes no platform on these issues.

135
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,720
 Well, it's recently come out that although they have a history of not taking platforms on these issues and saying,

136
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
 "No, don't do that. Let's stay as a culture,"

137
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 they recently took a $130,000 donation from Biomirin.

138
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
 And that has caused an uproar as well.

139
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,720
 Like, it's one thing to say we're not going to speak on the issue.

140
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
 It's another thing to say we're not going to speak on the issue.

141
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,720
 And also we got a bunch of money from the people who are causing the issue.

142
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,720
 So just a fascinating look. I love subcultures.

143
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,720
 And this is a subculture that's been around for ages, right?

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,720
 It's just part of humanity is dwarfism.

145
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,720
 And it's possible that this may get removed from the gene pool.

146
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 If you're able to go in and with 80% of parents not being afflicted by this and you find out your child would be a dwarf,

147
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 I think a lot of parents would go, "Well, I don't want that.

148
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,720
 There's nothing wrong with being a dwarf, but I don't want my own kid to be a dwarf."

149
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 And you do that for so many times, and eventually the community does completely dissolve.

150
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 So what do you do if someone develops a cure for you?

151
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
 Super, super fascinating thing.

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,720
 Johnny Thunder, we are now running out of the Biomirin facility.

153
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
 We've exposed all their secrets.

154
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 Stop them, the evil sorcerers of science being chasing us down the hallway.

155
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 Running down the hallway is luckily we over-tip an entire wheelbarrow full of babies on their way to the lab.

156
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 Whoa! They slip on them and we get away, Scott Clean.

157
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
 Johnny, I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

158
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 Let's burn rubber and get out of here. We are headed all the way out to California.

159
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,720
 [beatboxing]

160
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,720
 Driving on out to sunny, sunny California palm trees.

161
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
 We're waving at movie stars. Pamela Anderson's walking down the street.

162
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 "Hey, Pamela. Tupac's walking down the street. What? We thought you were dead." He's like, "Nah, I was just kidding."

163
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 "Give him a high five. He's in the car now."

164
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
 And we're just having a good time, right?

165
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 But then we see a hobo.

166
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,720
 This is the first hobo we've seen the entire time we've been in California.

167
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 That's the most paranormal part of the story.

168
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,720
 We got all the way into the middle of Santa Monica, LA, all of a sudden California never saw one homeless person until now.

169
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,720
 And then Tupac is like, "You guys stay behind me. I'll break a shot."

170
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 The hobo steps into death. We're like, "Tupac, no! Are you faking this?"

171
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
 He's all, "Ugh."

172
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
 And the hobo goes running off down the alleyway. And we have to chase after him.

173
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,720
 I mean, I guess we should probably call 911 for Tupac, but I'm sure he's faking as he's turning blue.

174
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 "Oh, yeah, he's faking. Really good at special effects, that guy, Tupac."

175
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 We're running down the alleyway and we corner Max Kramer.

176
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 He turns around. He's all extra hobo-y.

177
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 Now, Max Kramer, we've covered before on this show.

178
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 Most famously, he's this man. He's a video game developer.

179
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
 He's a home-- I always bury the lead on this one.

180
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,720
 He's a homeless video game developer who also comes up with these crazy plans.

181
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
 He has a website. He has two websites at this point.

182
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
 And we'll get into the second website.

183
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 I'm still going through the first one that was given to me by listener Oogs. Thank you very much.

184
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 But he's developed this website and he has all these crazy rambling thoughts.

185
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,720
 We've covered him on this show a couple times. One time, he wanted to kill you and wear your flesh,

186
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,720
 and then to go after your children.

187
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,720
 And then the second-- there was no top in that one. That was the problem with Max Kramer.

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,720
 That was the first time I covered him. So everything I've looked at after the fact, I was like, "Whoa, nothing's as crazy as this."

189
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 First time, the second time we did a story about he thought that white supremacists were wiping diarrhea on a kosher bread.

190
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 What? So anyways, and that-- I don't even-- I probably shouldn't even brought that up because now I gotta go find the episode and I'm reminded about it.

191
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:31,720
 Anyways, but Max Kramer has all these crazy thoughts, and I found a bunch more of them. I was digging through the archives the other day.

192
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,720
 It's always interesting to look into the mind of a maniac sometimes.

193
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 And he wrote-- this is so creepy to me. He wrote this a while back.

194
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,720
 You guys remember Jessica Simpson? Movie star, pop star, reality star, all that stuff. She's pretty starry.

195
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,720
 She's in the public eye. Right? Very, very beautiful woman in the public eye.

196
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,720
 And she has a baby. And remember, we're talking about a guy named Maxwell Kramer, homeless man who wants to wear your skin.

197
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,720
 And Jessica Simpson, very, very famous woman, probably has never even seen a homeless person in real life.

198
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,720
 She assumes they are all just simulations she sees on television. They're like, "What? No one can live like that."

199
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 Jessica Simpson has a daughter named Maxwell.

200
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:24,720
 And that really, really confuses Max Kramer. He can't wrap his head around the fact that his name is Maxwell and he's a man.

201
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,720
 And Jessica Simpson's daughter is named Maxwell and it's a girl. He can't figure it out.

202
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:42,720
 He goes on to say, "Is that a strange coincidence?" I talk about Sims on my website and Jessica Simpson named her daughter Maxwell 18 months ago.

203
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,720
 Hmm. You can actually go, "Hmm." That was a little bit of my editorializing. Let's continue this.

204
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,720
 Did she patent my video game technology too?

205
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,720
 My aunts and uncle live in Beverly Hills and I have been homeless in public in LA for multiple times of three to six months.

206
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 Is she Jewish? I'm Jewish. My LA family is part of the LA Jewish community.

207
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,720
 Well, if Jessica and Maxwell Simpson are Sims, then I guess it doesn't matter.

208
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,720
 But things similar to that accumulate into my living in a twilight zone.

209
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 As another example of a male named Maxwell is Maxwell Detailer, a World War II hero who was an army airborne that rose from major to a four-star general.

210
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:41,720
 Note, I am not MDT, although it is hypothetically possible for World War II soldiers to have been frozen and reanimated into the 1980s.

211
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 That is...

212
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,720
 To be honest, I started my show because of stuff like this.

213
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,720
 I originally, when I thought about doing this show, I thought, "I just want to read the ramblings of madmen."

214
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 I wanted to sit at work and listen to someone read manifestos because I just...

215
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
 These are glimpses into someone's life that...

216
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,720
 I'm sure he's ranted this walking down the streets and people just tune him out.

217
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,720
 But to him, this totally makes sense.

218
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,720
 And I find this absolutely fascinating. It's that rambling sense, but also, it's creepy.

219
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
 Let's work through this backwards.

220
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,720
 The chain of thought for him to say, "I know of a other man named Maxwell and it's Maxwell Detailer, a World War II hero."

221
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,720
 He just kind of tails off into this weird thing. It has nothing to do with the original thought, but he goes into it full sale, right?

222
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,720
 He ends his diatribe. That was the end of the whole thing about Jessica Simpson.

223
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 He was talking about it's possible for World War II veterans to have been frozen in Captain America, right?

224
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,720
 It was in this documentary I saw called Captain America.

225
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
 They can be frozen in World War II. They can be brought to the 1980s.

226
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
 So he's saying that it's possible he is a four-star general from World War II.

227
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 He's not discounting that fact. He goes, "I'm not him, but it's hypothetically possible that I am him."

228
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:12,720
 And that ending of itself is just weird, and I can see someone muttering that when they're walking down the street.

229
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
 "Hey, did you know there's really a four-star general? Attend Hutt! Attend Hutt me!"

230
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 And you're like, "What? Should I attend Hutt him?"

231
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
 And he just stands there until you salute him and then he walks away.

232
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:27,720
 That would be a weird story. What makes this creepy is you have a woman. You have Jessica Simpson, who's already in the public eye.

233
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 And we know people in the public eye. I have weirdo stalkers, right?

234
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,720
 Everyone in the public eye has weirdo stalkers, and really you don't even have to be in the public eye to have weirdo stalkers.

235
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
 They just exist. That's just the way life is.

236
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:48,720
 But when you're at Jessica Simpson level, she has a baby, and she picks the name Maxwell Simpson because she loves the name Maxwell,

237
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
 and she thinks it's a cute girl's name, and it is a cute girl's name.

238
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:59,720
 But across town, there is now a maniac who has you on his radar.

239
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 That's so creepy.

240
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
 Imagine doing something fairly mundane.

241
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 And this is where we go to, like, with gang stalking. I mentioned this on episode before.

242
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,720
 I go, "When I'm walking down the street and I, like, itch my stomach, or kind of brush something away from my nose,

243
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 or I walk through a spider web and I'm kind of waving my hands in the air,

244
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,720
 I'm just doing those things. It's a 99.999% of humanity."

245
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 They're go, "Oh, that's funny. I must have walked into a cobweb,

246
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
 and the only reason why you would do that motion is walking down the street."

247
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,720
 But there's always that chance that some person who thinks they're being gang stalked sees you

248
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,720
 and thinks that's a symbol, thinks that you're motioning to another gang stalker.

249
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
 "Hey, he's coming."

250
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
 Because you have this delusion that everyone's stalking you, and now I'm on this dude's radar.

251
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 Gang stalkers look at stuff and they go, "It's so weird whenever I go outside, everyone's wearing a red shirt."

252
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,720
 And you don't know that. You don't know that he has the psychosis.

253
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 And one day you go, "Oh, it's Autumn. I'm going to start wearing this red shirt.

254
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 It's kind of a burnt orange, but whatever."

255
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 And you go outside and all of a sudden you see some lunatic glaring at you.

256
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,720
 Jessica Simpson, totally normal person, up here, she is now,

257
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,720
 because she named her child the same name as a lunatic, she is now on his radar.

258
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 And it almost feels like they're linked.

259
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,720
 And it's making him, he has a lot of questions about his own sexuality.

260
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,720
 He's constantly talking about people trying to make him gay,

261
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 and Koreans are dressing up in black people's skin and hitting on him,

262
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 and trying to turn him gay.

263
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,720
 And he just has reams and reams and reams of writings online about stuff like that.

264
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
 And he's so confused and perplexed.

265
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 How can a girl have his name?

266
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 And it's a girl, and it's a boy's name.

267
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,720
 And their name is Sim-Sin.

268
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
 And he talks about Sims.

269
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
 It's creepy.

270
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
 We know he wrote this entry a couple years ago.

271
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,720
 But, so we know he didn't stab everyone to death in the household.

272
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 That's my name, that's my name, and kill them all with a sharpened rock.

273
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
 We know that hasn't happened, but it's just creepy.

274
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 Because this is how those weird stalker events happen.

275
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,720
 Somebody watches a movie and goes, "Whoa, Jodie Foster looked right at me the whole movie.

276
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
 I should go shoot a president."

277
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,720
 So, yeah, inside the mind of a lunatic, inside the mind of a maniac.

278
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
 Luckily he hasn't hurt anyone yet.

279
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,720
 Right, I keep talking, I keep making him out to be this big threat.

280
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
 He has not hurt anyone yet, and I hope he doesn't.

281
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,720
 But he's still giving it the old college try.

282
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,720
 We're gonna talk about what he's doing nowadays.

283
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 And it is equally creepy, but we'll talk about that on,

284
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,720
 because this story took place a while back, but he's still up to nonsense.

285
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 We'll talk about that on a future episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

286
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
 Right now, Johnny Thunder, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter.

287
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
 We are leaving behind Southern California.

288
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,720
 We are headed all the way out to Sri Lanka.

289
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 [imitates car engine]

290
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 We're in Sri Lanka because there was a post online written by Fuwa Aika.

291
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,720
 So, Fuwa, thank you so much for putting this together.

292
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 I don't know if that's your real name.

293
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,720
 So, we're gonna call you Jerry, and if that is your real name, it's just a shot in the dark.

294
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
 We're in Sri Lanka.

295
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,720
 It's the early 1980s, and Jerry is telling the story that he has heard.

296
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
 He's talked to the primary people in this story.

297
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
 They're members of his family.

298
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,720
 But, so, Jerry has heard the story from his uncle, and we're gonna call his uncle Bruce.

299
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,720
 Now, back in the early 1980s, Bruce is going to college in the nearby city of Colombo.

300
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
 But, you know, during break, no one likes to hang out at colleges when no one else is there.

301
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
 That's the spookiest time to be in college, right?

302
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,720
 So, he would travel back to his town.

303
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 Now, his hometown was so far away from Colombo, it was a 13-hour train ride to a bus station.

304
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 And then he had to get on the bus and go a couple more hours to actually get home.

305
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,720
 So, by the time he would get home, he wouldn't do...

306
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 This wasn't like a daily commute for him, but when he would take these breaks or come home for the holidays,

307
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 it would take a while.

308
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
 He'd usually get home.

309
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,720
 He'd like the bus would be pulling up in front of his neighborhood around 9 p.m.

310
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 And a lot of times, he'd be the only person on the bus.

311
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 Well, one year, Bruce was coming on the bus, and it's almost his stop.

312
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 And he does this.

313
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
 He's the only person on the bus.

314
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
 I used to write... I miss writing the bus.

315
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 I used to love writing the bus.

316
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
 It's so weird.

317
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
 It's so weird.

318
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
 I have a hundred bus stories.

319
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
 I should start telling you about the time I picked up a girl on the bus.

320
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
 That ended badly.

321
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
 Yeah, that was an adventure.

322
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
 And then, you know, like cops on...

323
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
 I have a hundred bus stories, actually.

324
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
 Cops...

325
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
 But none of my bus stories are as interesting as this one.

326
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 Maybe I'll do a whole episode about bus stories and Tia and...

327
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
 When we were yelling at a narc, me and this other guy, we're yelling at a guy the entire time on the bus.

328
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
 You talked to cops.

329
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
 You talked to cops.

330
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
 It's hilarious, dude.

331
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,720
 We were basically like, "Okay, anyways, forget that I just did some tampering of witnesses.

332
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,720
 Let's get back to this story, which won't get me arrested."

333
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
 Bruce is on the bus.

334
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,720
 He gets up and he walks to the little set of stairs and he's standing up and he's waiting for his stop.

335
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
 We all do this on the bus, right?

336
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,720
 And as he's standing up now, he's the only one on the bus other than the driver,

337
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,720
 he drives past the funeral and he goes on looking at this massive funeral gathering.

338
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 And it's only like a block from my house.

339
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 So I'm coming down the road and he sees us going on and he thinks to himself,

340
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
 "This is very, very interesting."

341
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,720
 A lot of people said this story's not true, but this is the details that make me think the story's true

342
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 because this is how people really think.

343
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
 He's watching this funeral.

344
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,720
 It's happening a block away from his house and his first thought is, "That's awful.

345
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 I hope it's not someone I know."

346
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
 And I read that and I go, "That's a detail that people forget to fake."

347
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,720
 Because that is how when we see a horrible car accident, we go, "Oh, that's horrible.

348
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 I hope they're okay."

349
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,720
 And you do have that thought, though, that I hope it's no one I know.

350
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
 Especially if it's right in your neighborhood.

351
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,720
 That's such a detail that people usually forget to make up, something that realistic.

352
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,720
 So he looks and he goes, "Oh, I hope that's no one I know."

353
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,720
 The bus continues a block away to his house.

354
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 Bruce's mom is in the house and she's waiting for her baby boy to come back from college.

355
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
 She's so happy to see her little boy.

356
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,720
 And she sees the bus pull up and she sees Bruce get off the bus and she's like,

357
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
 "Yay, she's doing a little mom dance on the window. Yay!"

358
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
 Here he comes.

359
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,720
 And Bruce walks into the house and walks past his mom.

360
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,720
 And mother's no sons. Mother's can read sons incredibly well.

361
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,720
 And as Bruce is walking by, she looks at him and she thanks for a second.

362
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 Something's wrong with him.

363
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,720
 She didn't want to admit it, but she could tell in his eyes something was gone.

364
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,720
 A joy? A spark?

365
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,720
 She describes it as it looked like his soul was gone.

366
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,720
 He had soulless eyes as he walked faster.

367
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,720
 She asks, "Are you ready for dinner?"

368
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,720
 That's what you ask when you see his soulless husk walking.

369
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
 "You want corn on the cob or mashed potatoes?"

370
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
 He just walks past her.

371
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 And as he's walking through this house, he kicks a lamp over and just keeps walking.

372
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
 Now this is Sri Lanka in the 1980s.

373
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 That was not a lamp that you plugged into the wall.

374
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,720
 He kicked over an oil lamp and a small little fire starts.

375
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
 And he just keeps walking through the house.

376
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:47,720
 Now they put out the fire, but they don't know what's going on.

377
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,720
 He walks into his room, throws his bag down, and then walks into the backyard.

378
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,720
 Where his sister is just kind of watching through the window.

379
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
 "What is up with Bruce?"

380
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,720
 And the mom's like, "I don't know. He almost burnt an entire house down. Something's wrong."

381
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,720
 But maybe he just had a long train ride.

382
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
 Maybe he's just super tired.

383
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,720
 Maybe he didn't see the burning oil lamp on the floor.

384
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,720
 So it seems like everyone else in the house just kind of puttered around nervously waiting to see what happened,

385
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
 which was no big deal.

386
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,720
 But his sister was watching him in the backyard rummage around in the shed or the shack.

387
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:31,720
 And he pulls out a length of rope and begins to tie a noose.

388
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,720
 The sister begins screaming, "Oh my God, oh my God, Bruce! Bruce, no, no!"

389
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 And it alerts everyone else in the house and they all run into the backyard.

390
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:47,720
 As he's throwing the noose up over the tree, he's trying to hang himself.

391
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 His family has to throw him to the ground and hold him down. He's fighting them.

392
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,720
 He's trying to get up. He's trying to take his own life.

393
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
 And his mom's like, "Someone call a priest! Someone call a priest!"

394
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
 He's possessed!

395
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 I saw it. I should have done something immediately. He had soulless eyes.

396
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,720
 So they're holding him down and he's freaking out and the priest comes over and he does this exorcism.

397
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:19,720
 And eventually Bruce gets calmer and calmer and then just kind of passes out.

398
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
 Now there's a couple questions about this story.

399
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,720
 You have to wonder, are nighttime funerals traditional in Sri Lanka? I don't know.

400
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,720
 Was it a funeral? Was it a wake? Was it like a mass gathering or was it just a funeral party?

401
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,720
 I don't know. I don't know of many places that have funerals at night but it might be normal in Sri Lanka.

402
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,720
 You have the case of them holding down Bruce and them calling for a priest and him getting there.

403
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 Like a priest on call in Sri Lanka to solve exorcisms.

404
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,720
 Is that even something I know in America if you have a serious problem, your minister, your rabbi, your iman will come to you.

405
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,720
 But I don't think it's just if they're rolling around in the backyard.

406
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,720
 But maybe. It's 1980s, the author did say, you know, very, very superstitious area of Sri Lanka.

407
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,720
 So it's possible that this is what the priest does. This is just another Tuesday night for the priest to come over here and do this exorcism.

408
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,720
 So we don't know how long they were holding down Bruce. Was it 10 minutes? Was it...

409
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,720
 Because after about three hours your arms are going to get tired and you're like, oh come on buddy.

410
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
 Just quit being possessed. I'm getting sore.

411
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 So there are little questions that I have about the story.

412
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,720
 But the way that it ends, I'm willing to kind of put aside my skepticism because it's cool, right?

413
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
 It could be totally made up. We don't know, but it's cool.

414
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 What happens is as they're holding him down, he keeps saying the same thing over and over again.

415
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,720
 He keeps saying, if I'm going to die this young, why does he get to live?

416
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 If I'm going to die this young, why does he get to live?

417
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 If I'm going to die this young, why does he get to live?

418
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,720
 And he's repeating this over and over again.

419
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,720
 And the people holding him down can't really make any sense of it.

420
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,720
 Like they understand the words, but what does it mean?

421
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,720
 Well, after he is exercised of whatever was inside of him, and even the author goes, I think this is a case of mental illness.

422
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,720
 He goes, I've talked to my uncle about this and I don't really believe the exorcism angle.

423
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,720
 I don't know what it is, but my uncle remembers the story, Claire is there and so does my aunt, the sister who was there.

424
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,720
 They all remember this.

425
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:45,720
 The very next day they found out that the person who died, the bus stop away, was his exact same age.

426
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,720
 He was just as old as Bruce.

427
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,720
 So what that means, or what we can surmise from that, it's really creepy, right?

428
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,720
 Is he was driving on the bus and the ghost of the man who died possessed him.

429
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,720
 And didn't possess him for any unfinished business.

430
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
 Didn't possess him because he wanted to live a little bit longer.

431
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,720
 It possessed him because it was jealous.

432
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
 Because it was vindictive.

433
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,720
 The ghost was basically saying, if I have to die, it's not fair.

434
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
 Why does this guy get to stay alive?

435
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:26,720
 If I'm dying, he's dying.

436
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,720
 And it came after him because it was some petty vengeance.

437
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
 It was misplaced vengeance.

438
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:42,720
 Bruce didn't kill this guy, but that spirit was just leaving that body, was still trapped on earth and saw someone

439
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,720
 and didn't think it was fair.

440
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 The creepy implications of this is, what if Bruce lived alone?

441
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,720
 He was described as very happy-go-lucky by his family.

442
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,720
 They thought it was super weird that he would attempt to commit suicide.

443
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,720
 It was super weird that he didn't want to choose between corn and the cob and mashed potatoes.

444
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,720
 That soulless look in his eyes. It was so bizarre.

445
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
 They said he was normally a really happy person.

446
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,720
 One thing we know about suicide victims is they tend to be the happiest right before they kill themselves.

447
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,720
 Because they finally have made the decision to take their own lives.

448
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,720
 They finally have committed to that, so they're actually happy for the first time in however long.

449
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
 So that's not always an indicator.

450
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,720
 If someone's really happy before they commit suicide, it's actually more of a clue that they did take their own life

451
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,720
 versus guards breaking into Jeffrey Epstein's cell and killing him.

452
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,720
 So if everything was going great for him and everyone at school really liked him

453
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,720
 and his family just considered him a really nice guy and he came home.

454
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,720
 But he was staying in an apartment instead of going back to his mom's place.

455
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,720
 And he walked in and dropped his bag and grabbed a rope and hung himself.

456
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
 It would be a tragic story.

457
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,720
 And his family and his friends would always be left wondering what happened.

458
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
 Why did he choose that?

459
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,720
 But this story says that he didn't.

460
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,720
 That something chose him.

461
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
 And that's the creepy part.

462
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,720
 The creepy part is had he not had anyone watching out over him

463
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,720
 he could have easily taken his own life and he would have just become a tragic story.

464
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
 A cautionary tale.

465
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
 But what are we being cautioned against if we don't know what this threat is?

466
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,720
 And the creepiest part is what if this is not an anomaly?

467
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
 What if this is the norm?

468
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,720
 Now let me back up. I'm not saying everyone who commits suicide was possessed by a ghost.

469
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,720
 But what if some of them were?

470
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,720
 I'm trying my best to be super tasteful here guys.

471
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
 I'm really really trying.

472
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
 What if some of them were?

473
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,720
 They were driving home, not a care in the world.

474
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,720
 And a vengeful spirit latched onto them.

475
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,720
 And drove them to suicide.

476
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,720
 That may seem like an extreme belief but I personally,

477
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,720
 one of my personal beliefs is like gambling addictions and suicides and alcoholism and drug addictions.

478
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:15,720
 I do think, I don't think demons necessarily cause those things but I think they're attracted to people who have those ailments.

479
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,720
 Porn addictions.

480
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,720
 I think dark forces love that stuff because you're giving so much energy to something

481
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,720
 and anyone with an addiction hates it as well.

482
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,720
 It drives them, they love gambling but they also hate what gambling has turned them into.

483
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,720
 They love gooning, they love watching their porn but they hate the fact that they're about to lose their job cause they're constantly late

484
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
 or just calling in so they can masturbate all day watching porn.

485
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,720
 I think these dark forces are drawn to this.

486
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
 And it's always this chicken and egg argument.

487
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,720
 Are dark forces drawn to people in utter self-created despair?

488
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:01,720
 Or do the demons cause you to go down that path in the first place?

489
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,720
 But either way, the ending's the same.

490
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
 It's an absolutely abysmal place to be.

491
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,720
 And we were always told, hey, don't play with Ouija boards.

492
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
 Don't try doing stuff with the dark arts.

493
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,720
 You're going to invite demons into your life and open yourself up to possession.

494
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,720
 But what if it's far less complicated than that?

495
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,720
 What if they can enter your life in, what if they can enter into your life at any moment?

496
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
 With or without your doing?

497
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,720
 Sure, making Ouija board playing with that thing can put a spotlight on your soul.

498
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,720
 But what if it's as simple as driving down the wrong street at the wrong time?

499
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:48,720
 And this vengeful, bloodthirsty spirit sees you and is so jealous of that spark of life in your soul.

500
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,720
 It wants to destroy it. It wants to put it out.

501
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,720
 It wants to pull you into the void with it.

502
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:05,720
 It may not take you being curious about demons and practicing dark arts

503
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,720
 and opening yourself up to these negative influences.

504
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:18,720
 Your life being destroyed in a moment could be as simple as you traveling down the wrong street at night.

505
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,720
 What if this isn't an anomaly? What if this happens all the time?

506
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 How can you even defend against something like this?

507
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:39,720
 At any given moment, anywhere this entity can slip inside of you and take you down the darkest paths known to man.

508
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,720
 The only thing you can hope for is that you have people around you who pull you back from the brink.

509
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,720
 But if you don't, or if they can't and you keep sliding into that abyss,

510
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 soon you'll just become a devouring spirit haunting the world, looking for fresh souls to destroy.

511
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:11,720
 You have become just another part of an everlasting cycle of violence and despair.

512
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,720
