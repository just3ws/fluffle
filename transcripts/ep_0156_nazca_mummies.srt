1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 Can you die from being tickled?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,700
 Did they really find a set of mummies in Peru that includes a bird human?

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,380
 And then we explored the...

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:20,340
 Conspiracy? No one has the McFly code. A lot of people say that back to the future predicted the future presidency of Trump

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,340
 But did it actually predict?

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,860
 9/11. A lot of people think it did and we'll explore that today on Dead Rabbit Radio

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:35,860
 *music*

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Parfiner. I'm having a great day

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,620
 I hope you're having a great day too. I think you can tell from the intro we got a lot to talk about today

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,620
 So we're gonna jump right into it. Weeeeee

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,540
 It's just jumping all at the same time and we all say we so the other day

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,140
 I was kind of just I don't remember how I came across this story actually

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,400
 I think it was just kind of clicking around on Wikipedia. I was reading about gibbets

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,140
 I think because I realized that I didn't define them right in the past episode the hand of glory episode

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,780
 I thought a gibbit was a place like a box you put someone until they died. No, it's actually kind of gross if not

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,180
 It's a thing that holds your guts together

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,340
 So after you die they can just post your body up by the like on a sign post and you just like stay there until the birds eat you

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,980
 And then your bones fall out they they use them for pirates

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,900
 They posted them out like as the boat would come into Harbor you just see a bunch of corpses hanging in gibbets

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,140
 Notorious criminals they would want to put in a gibbit so people could see them

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,540
 Nowadays, you know, they'll well not nowadays but back in like the Western times too

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,060
 They would display the body but the gibbit was all about just letting the body decay like you didn't get a Christian burial

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,100
 So it's gonna clean you know how you start falling down the rabbit hole in Wikipedia

24
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,540
 I and then you go Jason. Why are you even researching gibbets?

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,820
 It's stories done, but I was like, I think I got it wrong anyways

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,260
 So it's kind of jumping around and I clicked on tickle torture now. I hate being tickled

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,560
 I think most people have a love-hate relationship with being tickled. Yeah, you laugh a little bit

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,060
 But it's not never really that comfortable. I actually don't like it a lot

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,020
 But when people like think of tickle torture you think like, you know, someone said on top of you

30
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:20,020
 He he he you're like, no, stop it. Stop it. And that's it, which is not I mean that would be torture to me

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,580
 But it's it's actually a very effective torture method and it can kill you. It's not completely harmless

32
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,340
 So when people start laughing it can indicate many things

33
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,740
 Sometimes pleasure sometimes humor, but it can also represent panic and so tickle torture. It's so funny

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,060
 I just imagine like Elmo like in a dark Guantanamo base cell tickle torture has been used for thousands of years and

35
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,900
 It's quite effective

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,940
 Oddly enough in China during the Han dynasty

37
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,300
 They used it when royalty committed a crime because it was

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,020
 Did suck no one liked it, but it didn't leave any bruises

39
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,860
 It didn't leave any mark and I left very little psychological damage

40
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,320
 And you're like Jason didn't just just say it could kill you and I was like, yeah

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,140
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can kill you but you have to do it long enough in ancient Rome. This sounds quite brutal

42
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,060
 It sounds kind of cute at first an ancient Rome

43
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,540
 They would take someone who committed a crime and they're like well

44
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,240
 It's not crucifixion level crime, but it's not you know, let them go level crime either

45
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,740
 It's kind of in between they take their feet and get them wet the criminal not just any random person

46
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,700
 it would take a person get their feet wet and then

47
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,040
 Rub like dip their feet in salt so now they have salt all over the soles of their feet and then they bring a goat in and

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,440
 the goat licks the salt off and then

49
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,680
 They do it again

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
 They put their feet in salt prop them up goat licks the salt off and very quickly

51
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,720
 It became painful because you have the mixture of like the rough goat tongue the salt on the skin and the constant like tickling

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,680
 And it was not a pleasant experience. It doesn't sound very pleasant

53
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,900
 There was a book called the men with the pink triangle a book about the Holocaust during World War two

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,520
 I guess you guys know when the Holocaust took place and one of the the book was a first-person

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,660
 Narrative that the guy was saying what he saw over there. He said he saw a guy tickled by SS officers with a feather

56
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,460
 Kind of an odd story

57
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,300
 There's a lot of bad stuff going on over there. I don't know why they're like, yeah

58
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,980
 Let's just see what this guy is gonna do with this feather

59
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,640
 But so that's in a book called the men with the pink triangle in ancient Japan. It actually had an official name

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,320
 Cuz sir, Giri

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,800
 Zimi which means merciless tickling

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,700
 Sounds a little menacing and in England when people were trapped in stocks kids would take their shoes off and tickle them

63
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,200
 So it has a

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,240
 It has a long history has a long history of being used, but it still is used today

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,880
 To extract information

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,980
 If they're like we don't want to leave any bruises on this guy, but we really want to know what's going on

67
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,160
 They can tie down and inmate and tickle them

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,540
 Yeah, the information they want it's it's weird because you'd think oh, you know

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,020
 If he had like pliers and they're like threatening to put out their eyeballs and stuff like that like that would be more effective torture

70
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,880
 the interesting thing about torture is that

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,820
 Once the physical pain begins torture actually becomes less effective

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,060
 Because one of two things are gonna happen one

73
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,880
 They're gonna just say whatever that you need to hear to get it to stop or

74
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,620
 Once the physical pain kicks in their body can start to kick in and they can either go into shock or

75
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,800
 The body goes this isn't as bad as you thought it was going to be threatening someone with a hot poker is

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,760
 More effective than putting the hot poker on them

77
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,680
 Psychologically because as long as your poet like you and I'm gonna put this on you

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
 I'm gonna put this on your hand. I'm gonna put this on your hand

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,040
 You have the worst case scenario imaginable in your brain

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,220
 But once it actually touches your hand and it burns and all that horrible pain happens

81
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,900
 Your brain then starts to recalibrate itself being like it's not that bad

82
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:01,500
 So the most effective torture is the threat of violence over actual violence and we're talking about torture to extract information and

83
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,820
 Probably most likely to extract information from most people of the population

84
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,900
 People who are hardened psychologically against torture you may have to go to that level if you're just torturing someone in your plan

85
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,200
 I'm killing them in the end. It doesn't really matter either

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,160
 But for governments, you're just like we're gonna beat you up if you don't tell us that threat is more to an average person that threat

87
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,280
 psychologically is worse than

88
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,080
 The actual beating

89
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,760
 Oddly enough, but yeah, you can die from being tickled and what happens is

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,440
 You tickle long enough you can start to vomit which you'll choke on your vomit and we're assuming you're restrained

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,480
 It's not like you're running around the living room and your little sister's chasing you with a feather

92
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,260
 You're restrained they can typically use so much you'll vomit and choke on the vomit or

93
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,340
 You'll simply laugh so much you can't catch your breath and you die and

94
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:57,220
 They're saying the reason why people that the tickling especially on the soles of the feet are so effective

95
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,460
 So because that's where all your nerve endings end

96
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,620
 so they're super super sensitive and

97
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:11,260
 It takes a very short amount of time before the tickling actually becomes painful. So that all being said

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,760
 Like I said, I'm not a fan of tickling myself

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,160
 But we're gonna segue into a quick dead rabbit recommends here a friend recommended this movie to me

100
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,500
 He's like this movie's totally off the wall. I'm not gonna tell you anything about it

101
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,220
 You just got to watch it now. I'm gonna tell you my friend a little bit about it to kind of pique your interest this movie

102
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,140
 It's a documentary. It's available on Netflix. I believe it's called tickled

103
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,400
 it is okay, so what it is is there is a

104
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,700
 Young journalist a young gay journalist in New Zealand true completely true story

105
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:51,300
 Who is he does articles like the pot like this podcast does he highlights weird stories from around the world?

106
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,820
 He come across this thing called competitive tickling and it's young fit men

107
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,740
 Tickling other fit men and there's videos posted online

108
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,680
 And it's this competitive tickling league and the gay guys like this this seems kind of gay

109
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,900
 It seems funny cheeky, you know these young hot men are tickling each other and trying to win prizes

110
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
 This would be a good story for me to cover

111
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,420
 so he contacts the

112
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,660
 Head of the website this woman and he goes hey, I'm so and so I work with this newspaper in New Zealand

113
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,960
 We covered the weird in the wacky we would like to do a story on your

114
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,660
 competitive tickling teams and

115
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,740
 He goes I expected either a yes like that sounds like a great idea or no

116
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,720
 We're not interested in being like a wacky news story

117
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,480
 Instead he got an email back full of anti-gay slurs and

118
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,120
 Talking about how they don't want to be associated with some gay kiwi and he needs to stay in New Zealand blah blah

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,840
 He's like what the hell like that was not the response

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,640
 He expected at all he thought that it was kind of gay to begin with he thought there was some sort of gay undertone to this

121
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,080
 Because of that one email the New Zealand guy starts to think there's something more to this

122
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,100
 Organization very very weird organization. So he starts digging into this and again totally true story

123
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,540
 the documentary is

124
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,680
 Him and his team traveling to America trying to unravel this mystery and it is a true

125
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,420
 mystery conspiracy

126
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,860
 story

127
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,020
 Young men's lives are ruined. There's blackmail. There's threats of violence

128
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,340
 Other men get thirty thousand dollars in a brand new car

129
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,480
 They become the part of this web of lies and deceit all

130
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,560
 Based on a bunch of tickling videos

131
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,440
 this fun website where young men are tickling each other and competing for cash prizes

132
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,160
 Uncovers this huge criminal enterprise

133
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:54,120
 Led by one person who will stop at nothing to get their next tickling video. It is

134
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,060
 Absolutely bizarre it is absolutely bizarre and it's a true story

135
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,900
 You can go and read all the news articles after the fact of what happened

136
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,580
 But it was all because of this one young journalist in New Zealand who got that email and thought they're summing up with this

137
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,500
 Conspiracies are real

138
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,420
 Conspiracies are real

139
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:22,380
 The big mega conspiracies that involve these crazy world connections and stuff like that most likely aren't and the thing is that so many people

140
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,960
 Are looking up at those mega Illuminati conspiracies. They don't see the conspiracy happening in Gary, Indiana

141
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,360
 It's this it's such a good mystery movie. It's such a great conspiracy movie tickled check it out

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,200
 Dead rabbit recommends tickled not tickling

143
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
 But the movie tickled

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,240
 So our next story actually came as a recommendation from I got an email from a gentleman named Austin s

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,040
 Austin s. Thank you for this story

146
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
 very very interesting story

147
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,460
 Very very hard to really get some meat out of because most of the meaty stuff is in Spanish

148
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,780
 But it's slowly trickling out into the English and it's it's like operation plate where it's kind of like an explosive

149
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,260
 UFO alien story

150
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,300
 But it's just slowly trickling out into English, which is kind of the bra

151
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,180
 That's really where most conspiracy stuff is covered in English and there's a lot of pushback on it

152
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:23,480
 A lot of pushback on it. It's interesting is we're gonna get into what the what the debunkers actually have a problem with so

153
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,000
 The Nazca region of Peru Nazca is most famous for the Nazca lines

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
 It's the huge drawings in the sand that when you go up in the air

155
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,720
 You see like a bird or a person or a goat or whatever now we covered the Nazca lines long time ago

156
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,660
 I'm of the belief the Nazca lines were created by

157
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,240
 locals to

158
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,680
 Basically, they were signs for the gods to see I don't think there was any aliens doing it if there was aliens making the Nazca lines and

159
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,480
 Aliens making the pyramids they kind of shorted Peru on that because you know Egypt got these huge monuments and Nazca

160
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,640
 Just got some lines in the dirt

161
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:03,280
 But I think they were made by the locals to celebrate the god and they could figure out how to draw them and they usually come around

162
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,780
 The either point near water or are near water can prove that area doesn't have a lot of water

163
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,420
 So it kind of lines up to the idea. It's a religious thing, but in 2015 in Peru

164
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,800
 Archaeologists we have a lot of archaeologists this week archaeologists. Oh wait. No, no these guys aren't archaeologists actually now

165
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,680
 Remember these guys are even funnier. It is a group of treasure hunters

166
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,520
 Led by a guy named Mario now. I feel bad for people named. I don't pity people named Mario

167
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,600
 But Mario is one of those names that when people hear it they immediately think of

168
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,740
 Mario Brothers like all the time so I imagined a treasure hunter and I saw I didn't ever told you this guy story

169
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,220
 I have to tell you guys a story real quick

170
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,620
 I saw Mario and Luigi in real life once wasn't on drugs wasn't hallucinating. I was driving down the street

171
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,620
 I was driving by American River College out in Sacramento and I saw a

172
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,700
 short squat

173
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
 man with a mustache

174
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,660
 walking next to a tall taller guy with a mustache and the short guy was wearing a red hat and

175
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,740
 The tall guy was wearing a green shirt and the short guy the Mario basically took his hat off and like it was like

176
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:19,620
 Three stooge's sq. He took his hat off and he hit the tall guy on the head and the tall guy rubbed his head like over

177
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,740
 Dramatically like it actually hurt just getting there

178
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,240
 It was Mario Luigi. It was Mario and Luigi in the real world. I should have joined

179
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,740
 I should have walked up to him said can I join you on your quest and they're like, yeah, we're gonna go paint a house weirdo

180
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,300
 Treasure hunt. Sorry. I got off of it. It ran there Mario. No. No. No. Yeah treasure hunter named Mario

181
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,460
 discovers in the war zone. He's in Nazca. It's year 2015

182
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,500
 He finds five mummies

183
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,220
 Now he had found mummies in the past and he has some of the stuff he's found in the past

184
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,660
 Some people said have been controversial and other people are like, no, it wasn't controversial. It just

185
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,220
 He was mistaken. He wasn't trying to pull a fraud. So there's been debate over this gentleman in the past

186
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,220
 Anyways, but he discovers these five mummies and he contacts

187
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,140
 Gaia.com now Gaia.com is like a alternative

188
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,380
 spirituality

189
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,340
 Mental consciousness type of website. I looked into him

190
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,740
 I was like, I wonder if I can work with them and I was like, no, we're really not on the same wavelength

191
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,860
 But because I know they do videos and stuff like that

192
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,140
 But so they started investigating it and they went send a journalist out to take a look at these mummies

193
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,260
 And I think they had a team with them as well because eventually the mummies do catch the eye of

194
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,420
 anthropologists and archaeologists

195
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,140
 And they like what is up with these things? Apparently there's five mummies

196
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:51,940
 They've been carbon dated to being 1700 years old back when that area was flourishing and you got these mummies the one that really

197
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,220
 Is sparking the imagination. There is a mummy that is about two to three feet tall

198
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,740
 And it looks more like a humanoid bird than a human

199
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:11,300
 What's interesting is that that mummy is not talked about in most of the debunking articles

200
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,260
 This is really where the schism lies. So

201
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,340
 Gaia.com says we found these five mummies. They appear to have metal parts in their body

202
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,780
 this one appears to be like a bird baby and

203
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:31,620
 According to x-rays, it looks like it may have eggs in its tummy. The pushback is

204
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,340
 Testing was done on one of the mummies one of the weird-looking mummies and it came back a hundred percent human

205
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,340
 They never say it was the end the debunking ones. They never say what which one it was

206
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,620
 They just say it was a hundred percent human the whole thing's fake. You don't have to worry about it. Mario is a fraud

207
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,980
 It's totally fake

208
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,900
 They say that the mummies are actually a bunch of other body and a bunch of other mummies

209
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:58,780
 Reassembled to look like weirdo people and then remumified. That's that's their argument

210
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:04,580
 They take these body parts Mario took all these assembled like he just had a bunch of mummy parts laying around in his garage

211
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,420
 It's the Sunday afternoon. What else are you gonna do? He made these five mummies and then displayed them

212
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,540
 So if that's a weird it's weird that they don't really talk about the the alien-looking one

213
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,580
 They talk they go this and really a lot of the there's a lot more debunking on this guy a comms

214
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,740
 Really the only one pushing the story again at least in English

215
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,580
 Everyone else is like other people involved like guy a comm what if they know those guys are wacky they believe in all this stuff

216
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,380
 So most of the debunking is actually attacking the sources rather than the subject

217
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,820
 This is the weird part of the story and that was if that wasn't weird

218
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,100
 What happened and this is how it came to my attention Austin emailed it to me and he emailed me this four channeling on

219
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,380
 November 19th 2018 so just a couple months ago

220
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,540
 Gaia TV and a bunch of scientists went to the Peruvian Congress

221
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,380
 to present their evidence

222
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,180
 Outside of the Congress you had the Peruvian Astrobiology Association

223
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:14,260
 Protesting it wanting to debate and what's weird about that is normally it would be the other side around like normally you would have the

224
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:21,540
 You would have a bunch of scientists people talking about 9/11 to Congress and how it happened and military personnel and outside you would have the

225
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:28,740
 9/11 truthers going no no debate us debate us, but this was the fringe theory

226
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,720
 Going to the Peruvian Congress. It's not like a shack. It's not some like weirdo group in there

227
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,860
 They're talking to the elected body of Peru

228
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:44,260
 About their findings and outside are the quote-unquote reputable scientists being locked out of that conversation

229
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,220
 So here is the oh and to be fair on the people

230
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,540
 Disputing and saying that they don't mention the little alien bird, baby

231
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,660
 To be fair that information may have come out after those articles were published. I've noticed that a couple times

232
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,940
 I've held

233
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:07,060
 Journalists to task. I'm like how come they didn't include this and then I found out that that was revealed much later, but this is what

234
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,940
 This description was what was posted on 4chan. It was a translation from

235
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,660
 A Spanish description that was being presented to the Peruvian Congress

236
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,220
 So we are playing a bit of a game of a telephone. It's going from a presentation in Spanish into English and then post it on 4chan

237
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,980
 So lose, you know, you you don't know exactly who's posting this, but

238
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,740
 This is what apparently was stated to the Peruvian Congress

239
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,700
 about these mummies

240
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,980
 No indications of artificial manipulation of the body. It was a biologically functioning entity

241
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,140
 They're talking specifically about the bird, baby organs intact humanoid form with reptile characteristics

242
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:51,300
 No hair. No ears. No nose. No nipples reptilian skin hollow bones similar to a bird

243
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,780
 two feet tall

244
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:01,380
 Bipedal bipedal, right bipedal with natural wear on the femur junctions that couldn't possibly be reproduced by artificial means

245
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:09,540
 Large head elongated skull retractable neck orbital cavities would have provided the thing with more than 180 degree vision

246
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,860
 So on and so forth

247
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,860
 Says it has a beak three-fingered claws bird shaped dinosaur feet and that's where they're like no that was the

248
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,100
 Mario made that fake looking hand

249
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,660
 didn't really have three claws

250
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
 and they said that

251
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,140
 it seemed like it was

252
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,940
 unisex where it's basically had two sexual organs and had eggs in its bodies and things like that

253
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,780
 So and then when they were talking about the mummies, there was five of them

254
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,780
 And they said one is confirmed to have been ritually mutilated

255
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:48,260
 So one had been chopped up or changed one is confirmed at least partially human but has abnormalities

256
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,700
 Josephina is the one they named this little bird baby

257
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,340
 And then there are two smaller ones that had him tested before the congress controversy

258
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,500
 One thing that was interesting and again according to gaia.com and the researchers who presented this information to peru

259
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,900
 They said that Josephina shared

260
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,460
 Human dna. It was 30 shared with de human dna

261
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,140
 And you're thinking well, okay, you know, that's not bad and I was going through the four-champ post and people were saying a banana has

262
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,820
 90 percent human dna like pretty much anything on this planet

263
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,260
 shares a ton of amount of percentage of dna with humans because we all evolved together

264
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,940
 So to find something that is 30 percent human would basically be a complete alien

265
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,540
 That shouldn't exist on this planet if a banana has nine, which I thought was so funny

266
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,940
 We're basically a banana is 90 percent human actually. No, they say that it's kind of gross

267
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,860
 Eat little people. But so again, this just happened in november

268
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,940
 This was the first I ever heard of this story even though it really popped off in 2015 a gaia.com for me

269
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,780
 Is or is not a reputable site. I know of them. I never really look into their stuff because it's mostly like

270
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:02,260
 Middle-aged mom magic. It's one of those types of sites where they just talk about like self healing and oh and I got nothing

271
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,260
 But gaia.com ads on youtube for the past two weeks because I was looking into this story

272
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,140
 But it's all stuff like how to make your life better. Which I guess is a good thing

273
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
 But you know what? I mean it's stuff that

274
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,860
 Women are into and to like boost their mental health or something. I don't know why I'm disparaging that but you know what?

275
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,540
 I mean, it's opra level metaphysics. I guess is a better way to put it

276
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,620
 So it's kind of cool that they're actually pushing this. I think that's an interesting story

277
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,780
 And we'll see what comes of this. This is still unraveling. Again, there's a bit of a language barrier

278
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,420
 But we'll see I think it's interesting that gaia.com is pushing this

279
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,460
 I think it's interesting that they presented this and they were accepted to present it in front of the peruvian congress

280
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,820
 And uh, we'll see what comes out from this. We'll see if the debunkers have some better stuff other than just

281
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,420
 Look at gaia.com, which I guess is what I just did, but I'm not dismissing it just because

282
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:01,540
 They're putting forth this story. I'm just not a fan of that that type of entertainment to begin with but if they're pushing

283
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,220
 Now I sound like a dick, but I think you guys know what I mean, like

284
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,860
 I hope that this is true. I hope that gaia.com doesn't make a breakthrough with this

285
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,740
 I think this is a really fascinating story and it would add another little twist to the

286
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,300
 human story

287
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:23,780
 Now I should say human slash banana story, but so we have run out of time for

288
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:32,260
 The McFly code and I know you guys are disappointed you guys are like you I've listened to 30 minutes of you talking about tickling and baby bird aliens

289
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,380
 But I guess we're just going to have to move McFly code back

290
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,700
 Oh, we're going to move it back in time slash. Well, no that would be forward in time because it's on the next episode

291
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,220
 But close enough think about it now. You're going to think about it for a day

292
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,980
 Did back to the future predict 9/11

293
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,780
 I'll tell you this man. I will tell you this there is one piece of evidence that is so bizarre

294
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,540
 It may it it may it may

295
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,420
 May put a little nugget in your brain because I was watching it and I'm like that

296
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,460
 is weird

297
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,780
