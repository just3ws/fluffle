00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
 What happens when your soulmate turns out to be a

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:09,480
 Bigfoot and then we take a look at a story of two boats crashing on the exact same island

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:18,400
 At the same time and depending on which boat you're on you either live or get eaten today on Dead Rabbit Radio

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,920
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,220
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I want to start this episode off with the correction a

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,520
 Long time ago to remember what episode it was on I said that I was not a fan of post Malone

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,640
 That is wrong now that kid slaps dude like I've been listening to the radio a lot post if you're listening to this podcast I

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,160
 Apologize for saying that I didn't like your music. It's pretty good. It's really good. Okay now that that's out of the way now that

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,440
 That correction is out of the way. I want to give a shout out to our newest patreon supporter Dennis

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,640
 key recall

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,000
 Dennis key recall. Thank you so much for supporting the show

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,560
 It really really means a lot and if you can't support the patreon that's fine, too

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,240
 Just help get the word out about the show

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 We also have a merch store and you can jump on the Minecraft server

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,760
 That doesn't help me in any way shape or form, but it's fun to play with you guys, but Dennis. Let's go ahead

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,880
 We're gonna start off in the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We haven't taken that for a while

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,280
 We're gonna take a nice slow trip from the United States to Russia, which is actually where Dennis is from

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,240
 I actually didn't plan this so that's perfect. He's like he has to fly all the way out to America now. He's all he's all tired

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,040
 He's slowly flying the Durgible. I'll fall asleep by the control wake up wake up. Don't fall asleep. We're about to hit something

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,960
 What was like 10,000 feet in the air? Yeah. Yeah, I just didn't want you to sleep with the wheel

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,160
 So eventually after 10 cups of coffee and us constantly pestering him we finally fly out to Russia

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
 It's the mid-1800s

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,080
 And we're flying over Mongolia is really the area where he's like I thought we were flying Russia's idea

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,240
 We're flying over Russia's what I meant to say. He's like oh man. I was gonna check my mail

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,760
 Flying over it's the mid-1800s now. There's a Russian author named Ivan

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,720
 Turganov now he reportedly told this story

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,360
 I'm about to tell you to a guy named guy. That's actually his name guy D

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
 Guy D. Mopazin so he's the one who tells the story to us

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
 Basically, it's a game of old-fashioned tell before telephones are invented. This was a game of telephone

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,920
 I also saw a note that this guy guy is thinking this guy D

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,080
 Mopazin't he was considered the master of the short story and on Wikipedia

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,000
 They said his first story was considered his greatest work that would suck dude

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,120
 The first thing you ever did was the best thing ever and he wrote like 200 stories

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
 Everyone's like yeah, it's not as good as your first story

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
 Anyways, so that's why he had to tell us when he's like no no no no. I'll tell you a really cool story

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,560
 We're going back in time. There's this guy named Ivan who's also an author

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,560
 But when he's not writing he's hunting so he's out in the woods. He has it's in the mid-1800s

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,680
 So he has like a musket and stuff. He's like I better make this shot otherwise

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,160
 It'll take me two days to load a new one. He's blowing stuff up

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,440
 And then he's like oh

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,640
 Man that sure was hard work killing all those animals

42
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,120
 I think I'm gonna take a swim so he sits there and he takes off his little wooly cap his wooly jacket

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,080
 His wooly pants. He's totally naked and he's like nothing like a brisk Mongolian morning to really wake you up

44
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,280
 He jumps into the river

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,720
 And he's swimming there now we're standing on the shore and Dennis looks over and he goes

46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,800
 Did you really bring a bring me out here to watch a naked guy swim and I'm like wait for it

47
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,720
 Splashing around he's swimming he's swimming he's swimming in the river and he feels something on his shoulder

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,280
 You kind of shake it off. You know, maybe it's a spider. Maybe it's a spider, right?

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,840
 And then he thinks wait no why would a spider be in the middle of the river and he slowly

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,080
 Turns around and he sees a big ol hairy hand on his shoulder

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,040
 And he's like I should turn around a little more fast

52
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,520
 But I'm gonna slowly turn around for dramatic sake and then he starts to see a hairy wrist and he's like oh this isn't good

53
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,760
 He's still slowly turning around. He sees a hairy arm. He's like I'm gonna turn around a little bit more the rest of it

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,260
 Better not be hairy he turns and

55
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,040
 There's a big foot behind him, but not just any big foot

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,940
 It's a woman big foot has a big ol smile on its face and a look in her eye

57
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,120
 She's ready for some loving

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,660
 Now I don't know about you first off

59
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,880
 I'm not a swimmer, but that really has nothing to do with this if I was walking through the woods or just sitting at home

60
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,900
 And I fell tall and on my shoulder. I'm turning around much quicker than Ivan did but if I saw like a big foot lady

61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,200
 And she looked like she wanted to have sex with me. I'd be a little flattered

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,080
 I'd be a little curious

63
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:51,160
 But I would be I'd leave right right. I mean actually not that she think about okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you'd leave you'd leave right because

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,800
 Like it's an animal

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,440
 That's actually not well. No, is that the only thing stopping me from banging big foot if it was like a big foot and she had already

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,000
 Attended college and I knew she was like a rational person. She's all wearing glasses and long hair and it's all done up

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,760
 She didn't have glasses. I'm like what you don't have glasses. I'm not having sex with you big foot lady

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,920
 If you saw a female big foot and you knew that it wasn't an animal. It was just like this

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,920
 It's just a human a hairy human. I guess am I saying what I have sex with a hairy human female?

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,840
 Yes, I would I don't even know why I have to qualify that

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,320
 But if it was a monstrous beast if it had the brain of a monster, I'd beat feet right and you don't know

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,600
 Plus he's in a river so he doesn't have much time. He couldn't be like hmm

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,040
 Can I do an IQ test on this thing? He panics right? He's not as progressive as I am

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,360
 He starts swimming away from this thing. It's almost like blind fear and he's splashing in the water

75
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,960
 And then he hears it swimming behind him splash splash splash splash splash over the raging river

76
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,080
 It might have just been a bro. I don't know what anyways has their dodging rocks boulders are coming down him hot law the shooting

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
 I'm making it so more dramatic. He's swimming the creature swimming after him

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,800
 He jumps up now

79
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,160
 He's totally naked right and he's thinking there are my clothes. There's my gun, but right behind me is this giant hairy woman

80
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,640
 He takes another look. He's like maybe no no no

81
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,520
 Bloze that thought up should I grab the clothes should I grab the gun, but then he thinks it's a musket

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,560
 It's gonna take me two weeks to load it. He takes off running in the woods and he hears a squealing

83
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,920
 Jump out of the water not the sound effect. That's big foot jumps out of the water and make that noise

84
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,000
 Female big foot is now chasing him through the woods

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,880
 Apparently it's the crypt keeper

86
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,580
 He's running he's running and then like oh no, which way do I go? I guess there's only one way to go

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,340
 It's a forest I can go straight. He sees a young boy in the distance and he's running. He's running

88
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,340
 He doesn't know why but he's thinking I

89
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,540
 Have a feeling that young boy is going to solve all of my problems and is he

90
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,500
 Probably because whatever is behind me will eat the child and then I can definitely get away

91
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,080
 he's running he's running and the creatures right behind him and

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,280
 Then the kid pulls out a whip and straight Indiana Jones style

93
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,620
 Which starts whipping lady bigfoot?

94
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,660
 She stops in her tracks, right? I think a whip will stop anyone

95
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:26,600
 She's holding her arm she turns and she runs in the other direction and the kids like non-plus about the whole thing

96
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
 He basically rolls a cigarette afterwards

97
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,800
 Smokes it and Ivan's completely out of breath now

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,760
 He's embarrassed because he's just having clothes on and he was being chased by a female bigfoot

99
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,600
 So Ivan walks up to the little kid little kids standing there with his whip bigfoot ladies running off still squealing

100
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,440
 Ivan's like yo, what was that like you were just standing there waiting for her and

101
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,880
 Little kid looks at looks up at Ivan roll rolls a little cigarette puts it in his mouth

102
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,280
 He's not making kissy faces. He's smoking the cigarette. He goes

103
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,840
 Yeah, we're not scared of her around here. It's just normal

104
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,000
 Ivan's like, what do you mean normal little kids like tell you what why don't you go to the village?

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,040
 They'll take care of you get you some clothes. They'll figure stuff out you go

106
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,440
 You know you're getting kind of weird just standing in the forest naked just go go so he go Ivan goes to the village

107
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,760
 He walks in and he goes guys guys

108
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,000
 You won't believe what just happened to me and everyone's everyone's sitting around smoking cigarettes

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,800
 Let me guess let me guess

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,240
 Apparently something involved you taking your clothes off so I'm not for sure what that is but

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,480
 We imagine that you probably met the bigfoot lady taking drag everyone takes his jacket to cigarette at the exact same time

112
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:44,040
 Yeah, why is nobody shocked that you're more shocked than I'm naked than the fact that there's a bigfoot lady walking around

113
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,200
 And he's like and there was a little kid out there too with the whip. They're like, oh, yeah, Jerry

114
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,960
 Jerry's one of her Jerry's that he's supposed to be doing his choice. Uh, yeah, whatever his name was he wasn't scared at all

115
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,740
 He just started whipping this big old monster lady and they're like, yeah

116
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,360
 Welcome to Mongolia dude. They said that the woman was actually a local crazy woman living in the woods

117
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,000
 That she wasn't a monster. She was just some tall hairy

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,780
 squealing woman who they have to deal with from time to time aka run her out of town with whips

119
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,360
 And Ivan's like

120
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,960
 He's a little dicey on that he does eventually go get his clothes

121
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,000
 He's not naked when he's telling this story to guy years later

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,080
 He's like and that's the reason why I'm naked in front of you right now and everyone's like what it's a weird story

123
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,120
 He did eventually go get his clothes and his gun. He thought about it

124
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,320
 He goes that doesn't really make sense that doesn't really make sense

125
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,120
 But over time he started to go well, maybe it was just a crazy lady

126
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,000
 But when guy retells the story later on he goes

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,960
 Yeah, I even started to kind of believe that explanation, but this is the last line of guy story

128
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,420
 Yet it was known in the 19th century that people do not get covered with thick hair all over their bodies

129
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,520
 Even if they lived alone in the woods

130
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,820
 So guy believes that it was some sort of

131
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,400
 Obviously the word Bigfoot wasn't around in the 1800s in France or England or anything like that

132
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
 But you would have had mountain man or yaoi or any other word

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,260
 But the term Bigfoot is fairly new sasquatch things like that from people who'd been traveling around the world hearing these stories

134
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,080
 But I've been in the end believes the story. I think but guy doesn't I think it's interesting because you would want to

135
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,900
 Yeah, as opposed to this as I want to believe is just a picture of a hairy woman like read in the newspaper

136
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,340
 You would want to believe that it was just some hairy chick chasing you down as opposed to an actual Bigfoot

137
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:40,360
 Because what would that say about you? Yes, I did say that I would have mixed feelings about going on a date with a Bigfoot, but

138
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,480
 Like if an ugly human woman is attracted to you at least she's human if you're attracting

139
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,580
 biological creatures that are known for their size strength and smell

140
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:57,220
 What does that say about you? Ivan's like at night. He's like no it was a human. It was a human. It was just a human

141
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,060
 It's just a human girl. It's just a hairy human girl. He's rocking as he's rocking back and forth in his bed

142
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,400
 And guy pops up in the window. No, it was Bigfoot. Bigfoot likes you

143
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,300
 I don't know. I think I'd be flattered if a female Bigfoot had a crush on me

144
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,620
 I don't know what I would do if she was a rational consenting adult Bigfoot

145
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,940
 I might at least take her out to the movies, but

146
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,500
 Wouldn't you I mean like you're curious obviously, right? You're like hey everyone just now goes no, it's it's Bigfoot

147
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,680
 It's Bigfoot

148
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:38,020
 Is Dennis's like can we hop in the carboner copter we can good sir we can let's go ahead and hop in that carboner copter

149
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,000
 I'm waving goodbye to my new girlfriend. She's on

150
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:49,740
 Blowing cuz is that me I'm like see she's cool. We're taking off. We're leaving behind Mongolia Dennis fly that carboner copter

151
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,440
 We are headed out to the Auckland Islands

152
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,240
 We're going back to your 1864. This is actually pretty much just a few years after this

153
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,960
 Bigfoot and love story

154
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,640
 We're going to the Auckland Islands. There's a boat called the Grafton

155
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,360
 It's a whaling vessel and we're looking down at it and it's just getting beat up by the water

156
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,960
 Water's punching it the water forms a hand and it's ripping it up. They're like what's going on?

157
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,680
 We thought we knew physics, but apparently not water is doing a body slam on it

158
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,920
 It's getting bad and it's midnight and captain Musgrave is on the deck. He's watching these waves come over

159
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,780
 The black sea in front of him and he sees an

160
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,600
 Island way too close to where the boat should be and he's like well

161
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,580
 Either we move the island moves and we can't move with these waves the islands not gonna move because it's part of the globe

162
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:52,100
 The boat crashes into the island. He starts giving out orders as the boats taken on water grab the food the tools the gun

163
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,000
 The ammo materials let's start getting whatever we can off this boat now before it sinks

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,660
 they make it to the island and

165
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,620
 There's a ton of animals there and luckily they have all the materials they need they got their guns

166
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,320
 They can hunt seals they're shooting birds. They're eating fish. They secure a clean source of water

167
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,920
 They build a really quick shelter at all the debris of the boat and then they start to build a permanent one

168
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,000
 They're like you know what this is this is a great shelter and all but we might be here for a while

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,760
 Let's build ourselves as something else stand up to the elements

170
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:33,240
 So under the command of captain Musgrave they build like a house of stone and timber at a chimney and a desk

171
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,460
 Basically, but I just imagine he's sitting on a bunch of coconuts

172
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,140
 Everyone has everyone had their own little bed. They're sitting there and he's writing letters dear Margaret

173
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:49,740
 It's the 14th day we've been trapped on this island and I already live in a better house than I have at any time in my life

174
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,340
 It's amazing here. I wish you could join us. It's a tropical paradise

175
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,140
 The captain you know to pastime starts reading classes everyone's sitting around

176
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,280
 They all have made salvaged a bunch of glasses. They're like I feel smart now

177
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,220
 I feel super smart now the one guy fashions a chess set. They're making dominoes

178
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,340
 They start making beer and then eventually they go listen. This is this is pretty awesome

179
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,920
 This is almost like a working vacation

180
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,580
 But we should try to like figure some way off this island everyone's like, oh, and he's like I know I know I know it's pretty dope

181
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
 We do have this beer, right?

182
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,980
 If you guys all do know how to read now, but we eventually should probably get back to civilization everyone's like

183
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,660
 Yeah, I guess they made a raft that could carry three of them

184
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,040
 So that crash happened on January 3rd 1864

185
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,080
 on July 24th 1865 is

186
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,920
 When they launched the raft so they were there for about a year and a half almost

187
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,560
 The raft goes out they end up seeing a rescue ship. They flag it down

188
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,960
 the rescue ship comes in and

189
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,200
 Everyone's like just kind of chillin rescue ships like do you want to be rescued and they all look at each other like yeah, I guess

190
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,340
 Because I have to all right, you know, we were running out of food

191
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:07,240
 We're not all these seals were breeding seals. They started wearing seal skin clothing and they go yes

192
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,100
 Yeah, let's go so they get on the boat and the boat starts going away

193
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,340
 And on the other side of the island that they're trapped on they see a plume of smoke

194
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,720
 I'm looking at each other and they knew the island was deserted they go

195
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,520
 We should probably send another ship over to check that out because there might be more survivors, right?

196
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:30,820
 This is one of those interesting stories where everything comes down to basically a handful of decisions. It's 1864

197
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,300
 It's May 11th, so we're going back in time

198
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,760
 This is five months after the Grafton had crashed on

199
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,380
 The other side of the island. There's a boat under the control of captain George Del Garneau

200
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,420
 It's 2 a.m. Waves are crashing over the boat. Ah, it's super dark. You can't see anything

201
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,420
 Why this happened in the middle of the day or not happening at all waves are crashing over the boat?

202
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:01,220
 It's 2 a.m. In the morning and the captain goes you did to do something and you I don't know just walk around in circles

203
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,140
 I don't know what to do and then you had the first mate being like no no no don't walk around in circles

204
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:11,660
 You idiot walk around in an octagon and every the crew is completely panicked. They're getting contradictory orders. It's super dark

205
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,140
 Everyone's wet

206
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,260
 Which they kind of expected that on the boat, but they didn't expect it to crash in the panic

207
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,180
 Four people drown as the boats going down and there is a guy in the sick bay laying in bed

208
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,800
 What's going on guys just woke up from a deep nap. Why is the water up to my nose?

209
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,820
 They don't even rescue him

210
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,940
 six people drown and one man

211
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,460
 Didn't even have a chance. He was in sick bay

212
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,180
 They get to shore and their boat is still sinking and they go okay

213
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,740
 Here's the plan when the sun comes up when we can see what's going on. We'll go back

214
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,180
 We'll get the food we'll get the supplies

215
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,220
 We'll get the guns and the ammo and all that stuff

216
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,420
 We'll be able to shoot seals and shoot birds and build a temporary house and all that stuff

217
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,660
 Maybe you get one of those chess sets you've always been talking about yippee, but in the morning we'll go out there

218
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,860
 They were able to get a couple pounds of biscuits and some salted pork and had just enough wood to build a little

219
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,980
 lean-to shelter

220
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,540
 But by the time morning came the boat had completely submerged the boat was sinking when they left it

221
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,620
 So by the time the morning came they were like oh, it was kind of a restful night

222
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,260
 I had dreams of people drowning, but I wasn't one of them. So I'm okay. Let's go salvage the

223
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,140
 It's just boats gone like I don't know what they were expecting

224
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,020
 But anyway, so they do have some food and they have a couple pieces of wood

225
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,860
 They built a little lean-to they had two packs of matches. They're like, okay these matches are wet

226
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,260
 So let's dry them out

227
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,780
 Let's set them out in the sun because we'll probably need them later

228
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,180
 So let's start this spend a long time starting this fire. They're rubbing the guy, you know doing the stick rub thing

229
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,460
 Trying to you hear my hands rubbing together. I'm gonna start a fire just doing the sound effect. They start a little fire

230
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,620
 Oh, this is awesome

231
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,200
 So the matches that they'll use later to make it easier in the future sitting out in the sun and they go whoa

232
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,860
 I got a better idea those matches. Sure. We can leave them out in the sun and they'll drive very slowly or we can put the matches

233
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,300
 Next to the fire which is hot right fires on we'll put the matches next to the fire and the matches will dry

234
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,220
 Matches catch on fire the matches catch on fire. So they're like

235
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,900
 Well, okay, there goes that now. We just have to not leave this fire this little fire

236
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,100
 We built will be totally fine May 11th 1864 four days after the boat sinks

237
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,380
 They're already out of food and they really don't have a way to hunt

238
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,540
 They don't have any of the guns that captain Musgrave was able to get I

239
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,340
 Think you can kind of see

240
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,580
 Where this is going they see a cliff they see a 2,000 foot cliff then they go

241
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:48,020
 We should probably climb up the cliff and start looking for food because maybe there's would they see these delicious seals

242
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,360
 Floating around but they can't get them and they go maybe there's like pigs on the island or something like that

243
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,020
 So let's climb up the cliff and we'll go look at now

244
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,460
 There's one guy is like I'm too sick to move. I'm just gonna lay here. He's faking it. He's like I got bit by his seal

245
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,740
 I got the seal disease. I can't move slowly turning into a seal. I can't move. So anyways

246
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,220
 He's not a fake. He's actually very very ill

247
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,100
 But this everyone goes to climb up the cliff. They've run out of food. Let's climb up this cliff now

248
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,780
 One guy says I'll stick around on the beach. I'll stay with this sick dude

249
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,140
 You climb up there and when you find food just bring the food back and everyone's like oh, that's a great idea

250
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,140
 Is there I shit from side to side?

251
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,140
 They climb up the cliff

252
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,340
 They do find pigs up there and they immediately just spear it and they're like oh wait

253
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,900
 Oh my god, I cook it sir. Rubbing the sticks together rubbing the sticks together eventually start a fire now the dude on the beach

254
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:49,020
 Apparently he lives in a looney Tune cartoon because from a 2000 foot cliff he smells

255
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,860
 Cooking pork I can just imagine like little wavy lines and it makes that makes a finger and it's like

256
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,180
 Do it like goes under his nose it's tickling his nose the guy sitting next to this dude on the beach and

257
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,500
 He smells the food cooking up there and he hasn't eaten in a while and he's like hey buddy

258
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,960
 I'm gonna go climb up this cliff and I'm gonna go eat some of this food

259
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,180
 I'll be right back, bro. I'll be right back and the dude on the beach obviously knows knows the jig is up

260
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,100
 No, man. Don't leave me. Don't leave me his buddy though

261
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,820
 I couldn't climb up a 2000 foot cliff to to save my life

262
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,500
 But apparently just the smell of bacon this guy is able to scramble up and

263
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,140
 No one ever went back to help the guy on the beach. He dies on the beach

264
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:41,980
 They're eating the pig. They're eating roots. They're basically eating really whatever they can get their hands on and while this is going on

265
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,340
 The body count starts to rise

266
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,660
 They eventually made it to another whole different part of the island. They never went back for that guy

267
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,680
 You started to have disagreements in the group people are dying of exposure seven people go. You know what?

268
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,500
 We're going to break off on our own. We're gonna go and we're gonna try to find food on our own

269
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,580
 You have they're at each other's throats and everyone knows what's coming, right?

270
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,980
 Everyone has the same vision. They're looking they're talking to their buddies and they're imagining chickens standing there

271
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,340
 They're imagine broiled chicken standing there again like a loony toon cartoon. They know they

272
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,540
 They're able to eat roots. They're able to catch a pig every once in a while

273
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
 But every seamen knows

274
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,300
 cannibalism is not far from now so seven people go you know what?

275
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,860
 We're gonna leave this group. We're gonna strike out on our own and Captain Del Garna goes whatever like

276
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:36,020
 The less people we have to feed the better those seven people walk out into the jungle. They're never seen again

277
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:42,260
 Their remains are never found. No settlement is ever found. They're gone from the face of the earth

278
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,380
 They get to another beach

279
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,620
 They've walked all the way from one side of the island to another they get to another beach

280
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,740
 They find some delicious seals. They're actually able to at this point at this point

281
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:59,100
 I'm sure they are very hearty men who are great with a spear because they've now been fighting their way across the island

282
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:06,700
 Spear and pigs you got a lot of practice now. You just have to what is what is a seal but a slippery pig a more slippery pig?

283
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,780
 People are still dying off though

284
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:17,180
 Three months later people are still dying off. They can't get enough food. They're dying off one by one by one by one

285
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:24,900
 They end up making a canoe out of seal skin so definitely they've ranked up their experience level as far as seal killing goes

286
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,420
 They put a lot of points into their hunting skill. They have a seal skin canoe. They go to another neighboring island

287
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,420
 It's full of rabbits and they're like

288
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,420
 Why couldn't we crash on this island? They're eating rabbits. They're having an okay time

289
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,380
 May 20th 1865 more than one year since they crashed a

290
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,620
 Boat happens to come in on repairs

291
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,780
 She's a bunch of dudes standing there

292
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,780
 You won't believe the year we had a bunch of people died and

293
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,780
 We left a couple on the boat and we left from the beach to die

294
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,740
 But we're alive and the rescue crew again, they were just there to make repairs in their boat

295
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
 they're like, oh, that's awesome and

296
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,980
 From what it sounds like nobody resorted to cannibalism everyone's eyes kind of shiver inside a site again

297
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:16,180
 One of them did actually I did these two guys were fighting one of the guys false cracks his head open and dies and

298
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,820
 The buddies like well, I guess I won that argument and they starts eating his buddy

299
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,340
 So they did resort to can one guy resorted to cannibalism according to their story

300
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,540
 And as that boat was leaving on May 20th 1865 they were leaving

301
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:38,060
 They got back home and that was a huge story because obviously cannibalism at sea always gets headlines

302
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:44,500
 It's just the most barbaric practice and it's the story of survival and it really was juxtaposed because what happened was by the time

303
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,340
 They get back so they're leaving on May 20th 1865 and then in July of

304
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:55,100
 1865 the Grafton shows up and they're all like super they have like three piece suits made out of seal skins

305
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,900
 They've gained a muscle. They're super fit. They're like, oh, yeah, do that island's totally dope dude

306
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,100
 I mean if you prepare for it if your boat sink and you just grab what you want and

307
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,260
 Del Garne was like, oh man, I should have thought of that

308
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,460
 You have these two ship crashes at the same time roughly the same time two completely different captains

309
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,820
 And what boat you on depended on whether or not it was a vacation paradise or a hellscape

310
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,940
 Where at least one person ate one other person

311
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:30,420
 But remember it was in July when the Grafton was being rescued and they saw the smoke coming from the other part of the island

312
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:38,100
 So that means that that group of seven people were definitely still alive when both rescue ships showed up

313
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,540
 Signaling for help or was it a fire destroying their camp?

314
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,940
 Was there a war over who would be eaten first?

315
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:53,180
 Nobody knows nobody has ever found their remains on that island. I find that story really interesting

316
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,740
 Because it is a story of survival, but I find the story very interesting

317
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,180
 I think it's something that we can relate to our own lives. I tell people and this is a Bible verse

318
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,620
 I didn't make this up, but I always tell people this steel sharpens steel

319
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:13,220
 Who you hang out with who you have company with is a very important thing to how you are in that steel sharpen steel

320
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:20,460
 Two great people will make each other greater. I don't hang out with scrubs. I do not hang out with scrubs

321
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,460
 I hang out with people as good as me or better

322
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,380
 And I tell my friends that steel sharpens steel

323
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,820
 Steel sharpens steel you hang out with the people that you want to be like you you hang out with the people who aren't better than you and

324
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,860
 You continue to try to be great every single day steel sharp and steel

325
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,140
 Depending on you had these two different captains

326
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,780
 But they weren't different captains just on that particular day

327
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,860
 Those crews would have been completely different and if the crew members on Del Garno ship had been on

328
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,060
 Musgrave ship

329
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,900
 I believe that over the course of that journey. They would be better crewmen. They would not panic

330
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,500
 The set their circumstances were the same, but because you had different crews

331
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,780
 It wasn't just the captain because you had different crews

332
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,540
 They had one disagreement with Musgrave

333
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:13,540
 They had one disagreement when they were playing chess for a while people started getting in fights over chest

334
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,500
 So Musgrave just threw the chest set away and goes if you guys can't be nice

335
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,740
 Everyone's like yeah, that's probably a pretty good idea steel sharp and steel

336
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,260
 You want to hang out with the people who are going to make you a better person?

337
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,460
 Because while this may seem like an extreme example, you never know who you're going to be in a

338
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,220
 Crazy situation with and it might not even be this insane

339
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,700
 But you never know when life is going to throw you a curveball

340
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,580
 And when you turn to those people around you for assistance the people you've gathered throughout your life to help you

341
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:49,980
 Are they going to take you on a fun adventure that everybody learns from or are you guys going to start cannibalizing each other?

342
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,980
 In a metaphorical sense

343
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:59,980
 Steel sharp and steel who you hang out with not only determines if you survive, but if you thrive and

344
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,540
 if in the end

345
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,700
 You are a better person

346
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,180
 We're in a snazzy seal skin suit
