1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 The following episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains highly disturbing audio.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,000
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,800
 A recent scientific experiment shows what may happen if you traveled backwards in time

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,400
 and had sex with a caveman.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,680
 Spoiler alert, nothing good.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,920
 Nothing good is going to come out of it.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,680
 And then we travel to Virginia to take a look at a bizarre mystery that is currently going

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,120
 on and one that is barely being investigated by the Lynchburg Police Department out there.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,120
 When a young man is found dead in his apartment, the police quickly call case closed.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,560
 He died of natural causes.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,840
 But how could they come to that conclusion when not only was his apartment full of blood

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,560
 and feces?

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:58,080
 There is also videotape of him screaming for help as he is brutally being murdered today

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,560
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:11,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
 day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,080
 Trust me, you probably won't be by the end of this episode.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,760
 We got two stories, one's a nice fun one about having sex with cavemen.

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,280
 The second story is pretty disturbing even for Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,880
 We'll get to that after the fun one after I've gotten you to laugh a little bit.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,800
 Oh man, it makes me mad, that second story really makes me mad.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,440
 But we'll get to that in a second.

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,200
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command, right now let's give it up to one of our long

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,640
 time Patreon supporters, everyone on your feet for Banked Sassy Pants.

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
 Woohoo!

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,600
 Yeah, come on in Banked Sassy Pants, walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
 I'm recording this episode at 10pm, I probably shouldn't clap so loud.

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,960
 Banked, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too, I totally understand.

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,720
 Just helps to spread the word about the show, that really, really helps out a lot.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,280
 You can also right now help us with our wiki project, started by Jerm.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,600
 The Dead Rabbit Radio wiki is in the show notes, we're really looking at building that

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,080
 up, so thank you so much.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,320
 Banked Sassy Pants, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the hare hovercraft.

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,360
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:33,440
 Glide us all the way out to the Salt Lakes of Utah.

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,880
 Banked is driving us all out there, he's doing donuts in the salt, everyone's eyes are all

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,280
 raw by the time we get there.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,760
 Every show often I play this game with myself, I do a lot of this stuff.

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,440
 I had the amnesia game, I talked about that before on the show where I walk around like

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,520
 the movie section of a Walmart or a Best Buy and I pretend I had amnesia for the past 20

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 years and I'm amazed at all the movies, I keep myself highly entertained, I spend a lot of

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 time alone.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,040
 So I'll be like, oh my god there's a Transformers 4?

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 Like what?

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,280
 I didn't know they made a Transformers 1 and I'm like looking on the back of the movie,

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,760
 something like oh my god I can't wait to watch these movies and people are like okay maybe

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,120
 after Transformers 3 you should curb your expectations because they get pretty bad after

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
 3.

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 I play this game.

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,800
 Wow, there's an Avengers Endgame, what?

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,920
 And you find out, imagine if you found out today there was 20 years worth of superhero

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,600
 movies, I mean only 7 or 8 of them are worth watching but that doesn't matter right?

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,000
 You have 20 years of Marvel movies and you're like what?

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,800
 You have that, like I play the same amnesia game with myself when I'm alone in a big store.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 I'm like what Kiwi?

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,560
 It's 3 for a dollar, what's Kiwi?

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,240
 The other game I play with myself is sometimes when I'm walking down the street because I

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,520
 always have a backpack on because I don't have a car.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,840
 I walk everywhere and shop and I'm carrying stuff around.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,240
 Like a hobo, I basically outed myself as an amnesiac and a hobo.

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,640
 I play this game and I go what if I got teleported back in time right now?

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,280
 I got teleported back to the Knights of the Roundtable age right?

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,760
 Like that famous documentary The Black Knights starring Martin Lawrence, you get teleported

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,160
 back and there's like castles.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,840
 Yeah I know that's on another continent, just play with me right?

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,200
 You get teleported back in time and I'm walking around this castle and there's like this old

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,000
 man and he's like I'm looking for a new dude to be on my court and then there's like a mean

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,520
 bad advisor who's trying to take over the court basically.

71
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,600
 I imagine that I've been at Disney Channel movie and walking around, you know the tropes

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
 right?

73
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,160
 And I think, here's the thing, if I traveled back in time right now and I had to defeat

74
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:53,040
 an evil advisor to this aging king and I traveled back with the items I have on me right now,

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,320
 how well would I fare?

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,720
 How well could I get by?

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,400
 Now in The Black Knight, Martin Lawrence had a CD player.

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,720
 I don't know why that movie left such an impression on me.

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,940
 If you guys don't even know what I'm talking about, Martin Lawrence worked at a medieval

80
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,920
 theme park and then he fell into some hay or fell into the river and when he came out

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,240
 of the river or the hay, I don't remember, he was back in time and it was basically the

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,200
 same thing there was an evil guy trying to take over the thing and I remember it was

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 so funny.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,480
 Wait, actually another thing about it was this Martin Lawrence or am I thinking of a Disney

85
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
 Channel movie?

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,920
 It could have been in one of the movies and it was either in The Black Knight starring

87
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,440
 Martin Lawrence or some children's film that I don't remember the title to.

88
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,280
 They defeated the evil bad guy because the bad guy was really good with swords right?

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,600
 They couldn't beat him with swords and they had a CD player.

90
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,320
 Remember those little portable CD players and you know CD players use as a laser to

91
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,280
 read the CD.

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,520
 They use the laser, you can't do this in real life, which I also can't teleport back in

93
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
 time either.

94
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,400
 I don't know why I was so hung up on this detail.

95
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,680
 As the bad guys coming at them to kill them with the sword, whoever was the star of the

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,600
 movie opens up the CD player and shoots the laser beam out of the CD player, which is

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,320
 again just used to read a compact disc and it blinds the guy and then he fell off the

98
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
 building into the river or into hay.

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,880
 I don't remember.

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 That was the end of the movie.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,960
 But the point is, imagine if I was walking on the street or you were walking on the street

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,640
 and you were sent back in time 200 years with only the stuff you had on you.

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,840
 So normally I have a backpack that would seem magical.

104
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,720
 I have phones but the battery is going to die soon so I could be like I'm a wizard.

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,520
 Look at this phone and they're like can I see it and you're like nope and you shut it

106
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,440
 off because you'd have to conserve that battery power, right?

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,200
 You could show them some images.

108
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,280
 You're showing your like webm's and gifs that you have saved on there.

109
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,720
 They're like oh that kitten is trapped in your phone.

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 Can I see it?

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
 I'm like nope.

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,440
 Well I'll pull it out in another convenient time.

113
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,960
 But the magic only works every once in a while and once the better runs out and the magic's

114
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
 gone.

115
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,080
 I usually have, what else do I have in my backpack?

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
 I have medicine.

117
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,840
 I have like muscle relaxers so I can be throwing those into the Black Knight's mouth as he's

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
 about to go in.

119
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,160
 He's like oh I'm getting sleepy.

120
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
 He can't hold up the sword anymore.

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,680
 But yeah it's like what could you, I usually have like a knife and pepper spray and stuff

122
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
 like that.

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,160
 I mean those are actual weapons.

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,800
 I probably should have named those first.

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,120
 I think about this, I would say all the time but it does pop up in my head.

126
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,360
 I do think what would happen if zombies attacked right now?

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
 What would happen if a dog attacked right now?

128
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,280
 That's a pretty constant thing going through my head.

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,320
 I'm constantly turning my head on a swivel because we have a whole episode about the

130
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
 dog attack.

131
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,360
 And then I'll put it in show notes.

132
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,800
 And then what if I traveled back in time with what I have on me?

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,480
 Now obviously I would appear as a god because I have like all of this metal.

134
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,440
 I guess they had metal back then but I have all these, I have these devices that I only

135
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,640
 show them occasionally.

136
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
 My clothes would be magical right?

137
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,200
 I have really cool boxer shorts.

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,120
 And actually that's a good segue because what I'm going to be looking at here is not,

139
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,160
 this is not an episode about the things I do when I'm alone.

140
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,640
 It's about, I've defeated the black knight right?

141
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,160
 He's sleeping in the hay, he's dying of an overdose of muscle relaxers.

142
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,760
 I poured him on his mouth, I go I'm the villain now.

143
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,440
 And now it's time to boink the beautiful princess right?

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,880
 That's part of it, that's part of the story.

145
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,480
 You get to have sex with the princess because now you're the king and she's your queen.

146
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
 That's a cool end of the story right?

147
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,840
 You find true love, you're trapped back in time, you're going to die of dysentery in

148
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,560
 about two weeks.

149
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,040
 But until then you're going to have the hand of this fair maiden.

150
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,480
 Now I always thought you know we'd be compatible.

151
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,360
 But according to this recent science that's coming out, yeah we'd be compatible in some

152
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:50,560
 ways, but is it possible that my 21st century body would actually kill?

153
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
 Not on purpose.

154
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,200
 Even though I just declared myself the villain.

155
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,360
 Is it possible that my 21st century body could accidentally kill a 14th century princess?

156
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
 It's an intriguing thought isn't it?

157
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,640
 And it's quite disturbing.

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,920
 Let's take a look at this scientific experiment that just went on.

159
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
 There's a guy named Nicholas Rode.

160
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
 Well I'll tell you right now, when he did this experiment he never once thought it would

161
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,640
 be extrapolated to could Jason have sex with a princess.

162
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,160
 He never once popped into his head.

163
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,560
 But Nicholas Rode works for the Center for Functional and Evolutionary Biology and he

164
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,920
 goes "I want to run a test on something."

165
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,120
 He goes "See Monkeys."

166
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,320
 See Monkeys, those little things you used to be able to get out of the back of comic

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
 books.

168
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,240
 They're, they're, they're, they're a little tiny sea creatures and what's interesting

169
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,840
 about them and the reason why you can ship them across the country is once they lay eggs,

170
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,280
 those eggs are dormant until the environment is just right for them to hatch.

171
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,200
 So you can have these eggs last for decades, decades, these eggs can just sit there and

172
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,880
 once you add the right amount of water they'll hatch.

173
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,400
 Now the interesting thing about sea monkeys is that they evolve very rapidly because they're

174
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,240
 constantly giving birth, right?

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,560
 They're constantly having new little babies and so we can actually see adaptations in

176
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,200
 our lifetime of the sea monkey.

177
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,200
 And so Nicholas Rode goes "What if we actually introduced a current sea monkey to a sea

178
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,440
 monkey from the past and made them have sex?"

179
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,240
 Like what would happen, because what we know is the mating procedure of the sea monkey

180
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,240
 is the dudes grab on to the girls and they don't let them go.

181
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,680
 They'll hold on to them, they'll impregnate them and they'll hold on to them a little

182
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,080
 bit longer, not because they want to cuddle, it's because they want to make sure that these

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,440
 female sea monkeys don't go out and have sex with other male sea monkeys.

184
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,880
 They want their genetic offspring to be birthed by this female.

185
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
 So over time the sea monkeys have developed pretty, the male ones, have developed pretty

186
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,080
 strong hands.

187
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,840
 They've developed pretty well-defined strong hands and the ones who could grab on to the

188
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,680
 females the longest and hold them the longest were the ones whose children would be birthed

189
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,840
 and the ones with the tiny little hands they couldn't grab on to the women they wouldn't

190
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,040
 pass on those tiny little hands.

191
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,400
 Now evolution is always an arms race so the females, because they want the strongest males

192
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:33,240
 of the species to have babies with, they've developed over time to become better wrestlers.

193
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,640
 The strongest females are the ones who can get away from the dudes quicker and then they

194
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
 choose their mate.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,840
 They make sure that they're mating with the singular strongest man they can come across

196
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,920
 and they're passing on their wrestling genes to their female descendants.

197
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,960
 So we've seen this within our lifetime and what Nicholas said is he goes, "Let's take

198
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
 sea monkeys."

199
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,440
 He didn't use the term sea monkey over and over again, that's me.

200
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,000
 I just love that word.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,520
 Let's take some brine from the Salt Lakes in Utah because we know that they're there

202
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,640
 and because these eggs last for so long and because we know the geological history of

203
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,600
 these different areas, I'm going to gather eggs from 1985, I'm going to gather eggs from

204
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,880
 1996, and I'm going to gather eggs from 2007 and we're going to hatch them.

205
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,640
 We're going to put them in water, we're going to watch them hatch and then I'm going to

206
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
 introduce them to each other.

207
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,520
 It's a little dinner party.

208
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 He goes, "What happens if you took a 1985 female who has not evolved to be a strong

209
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,640
 wrestler, she has not been giving offspring off this whole time.

210
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,440
 Her offspring has not been getting stronger and stronger and stronger to counteract the

211
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,680
 physical strength and the grasping power of the male sea monkeys.

212
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,320
 If you take a female from 1985 and introduced it to a male from 2007 who has the little

213
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,120
 hands, better articulation who has more strength.

214
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,040
 If you introduce those two groups and they're separated by about 160 generations, you had

215
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,720
 a 12% chance that the female would die.

216
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,680
 She couldn't wrestle out of the grip of this guy.

217
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,960
 He was too strong.

218
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,040
 He was killing the women and not only that, this was during copulation, the woman would

219
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,520
 either be killed just by the strength or the dude would never let go, like even after impregnating

220
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
 it.

221
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,480
 So, just hanging out, now the dude, now the dude's just swimming around doing his own

222
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
 thing.

223
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
 The woman couldn't feed.

224
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,520
 The woman could not escape to go and raise the children, to eat, to just get a second

225
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 alone.

226
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,400
 They died, 12% chance.

227
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,760
 So what I thought about that, like if I went back in time, let's pass the princess, let's

228
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,040
 pass the European Fifedom Princess.

229
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,480
 If I went back in time and banged a cave woman, I think she would probably kill me.

230
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,400
 I think she would probably physically be so much stronger than me, right?

231
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,760
 She sure she'd probably be enamored by my charm even though she can't understand a

232
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
 word I'm saying.

233
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,920
 I keep holding up my phone and like, huh, huh?

234
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,360
 She would probably physically be able to overpower me.

235
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,280
 I'm sure a cave woman, a Neanderthal woman, could overpower a modern man.

236
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,200
 So I don't know how well it correlates to humans, right?

237
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,240
 But I imagine like if I went, I'm just, if I had sex through the ages, I'm sure by the

238
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,800
 time like the Egyptians were walking around and you had like Cleopatra, I think we would

239
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,040
 have sex and that would be fun because the only thing about Cleopatra she was played

240
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
 by was Elizabeth Taylor.

241
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,080
 I think like there are certain time periods where I could have sex with women in the past

242
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,440
 and not die.

243
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,760
 And then you, I think you would start to hit a point and I'm sure some pilgrim woman,

244
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,200
 I don't know why these women are all trying to kill me.

245
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,040
 I'm not saying that they would ride me so hard.

246
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
 But you know what I mean?

247
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,080
 Like I'm trying to think like at what point would I as a 21st century man, because I think

248
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:11,240
 like pilgrim, let's take pilgrims for example, if you had a pilgrim dude and a pilgrim woman,

249
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,120
 that pilgrim dude is stronger than that pilgrim woman.

250
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,240
 But I'm going to bet a dollar to a donut that a pilgrim woman is stronger than me.

251
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,640
 Because she's out there with like pitchforks and stuff, throwing hay, finding Martin Lawrence

252
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
 in the hay.

253
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
 She's like, get out of there.

254
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,480
 Sewing, I imagine that's really good for your forearms, right?

255
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,320
 They didn't have sewing machines, so she's constantly sewing stuff.

256
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
 She's like, oh, another flag.

257
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,760
 How many of these do I need?

258
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
 50?

259
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
 Oh man.

260
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,560
 I'm sure like she, I'm sure like pilgrim women were pretty like, I wouldn't say like

261
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,080
 I yoked, but I'm sure one of them could take me to Christmas, basically what I'm saying.

262
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,440
 The European princess, I don't think could kill me.

263
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,920
 Let's go forward in time.

264
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,560
 You're like, no, Jason, please stop.

265
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
 Go to the disturbing story.

266
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,800
 This is actually creepier than I thought it would be.

267
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,840
 I wonder if I went forward in time, would I be able to have sex with women from the future?

268
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,360
 Because I imagine that they would be like frail and stuff because they wouldn't be doing

269
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
 nothing.

270
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,280
 I imagine robots to sew all those flags.

271
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,000
 You just have robots walking around.

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
 I could probably beat up a dude from the future.

273
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,760
 I bet you there is that moment where you could look, you could pretty much take any warrior

274
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,520
 from the past and they could beat me up.

275
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,000
 And then you could probably take any peasant from the past and they could probably beat

276
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,500
 me up.

277
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,960
 But in the future, like when everyone's kind of just like walking around being all philosophical

278
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,600
 and stuff and being like, what, robots do everything.

279
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,960
 I just get to sit and do art.

280
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
 Dude, I would.

281
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
 I would control.

282
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,080
 I would be like Wesley Snipes and Demolition Man and just be walking around pushing everybody.

283
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,400
 I think I could take them.

284
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
 I think I could take them.

285
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,360
 And I think that's where the danger would be.

286
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,020
 Like if I went far enough in the future, who knows how frail the human body will be, right?

287
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,080
 So I probably could have sex with people from the past is what I'm saying.

288
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
 I think I could be in danger.

289
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
 I don't think they would be in danger.

290
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,800
 But basically, I'm just about to warn women of the future.

291
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,940
 Look out.

292
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,680
 You might be killed if I have sex with you.

293
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,200
 I'm talking like hundreds of thousands of years that future women that I meet from here

294
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 on out.

295
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
 Don't be worried.

296
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,400
 I'm talking about like evolutionary wise.

297
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,560
 Is it possible that the huge, because I think that's kind of the theory, right?

298
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,840
 One of the theories is that great aliens are humans from the future.

299
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,780
 The human body becomes more and more frail.

300
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,240
 So if I went into the future, that might be cool because I get to like float around on

301
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
 Saturn and stuff.

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,720
 But I would be super celibate.

303
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,200
 I'm like, oh man, I don't get to have any sex.

304
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,980
 And they're like, well, we got these sex robots.

305
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,340
 And I was like, OK, that'll work.

306
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,900
 And then I get crushed by one.

307
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,060
 So I guess the moral of the story is be careful who you have sex with.

308
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,380
 This is a really long PSA because people in the past could probably physically kill you

309
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,900
 if things gone wrong.

310
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,020
 In people in the future, you might accidentally kill them.

311
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,740
 Let's go ahead, banked sassy pants.

312
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,300
 Let's go ahead and move away from that fascinating story slash fascinating look at my psyche.

313
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,400
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

314
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,440
 We're leaving behind the salt lakes.

315
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,920
 Take us all the way out to Lynchburg, Virginia.

316
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,200
 This is an interesting story.

317
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,920
 And it was sent to me by someone on Twitter named psych for fun.

318
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,560
 I'll admit.

319
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,840
 First off, thank you very much psych for fun.

320
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,440
 I'll admit.

321
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,620
 When psych for fun first sent me this story, I thought I was being trolled.

322
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,900
 This story is so unbelievable.

323
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,220
 I thought this might have been a parody news website.

324
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,900
 Like I actually started googling some more and I was like, what, this is this is insane.

325
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,380
 This story is nuts.

326
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,300
 Like I skimmed it at first and I was like, this can't be real.

327
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,740
 This can't be as bad as this article is making it out to be.

328
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,400
 And the more I dug in the way it is true, it's horrifying.

329
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,920
 And I'm going to play a piece of audio in a bit.

330
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,480
 I will warn you before it comes up.

331
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,640
 It is terrifying.

332
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,920
 And I debated whether or not to play it for you.

333
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,200
 And the reason why I want to play it for you is because it will make you mad.

334
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,160
 It will infuriate you at the Lynchburg police department in Lynchburg, Virginia.

335
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,760
 Let's go ahead and get this story started.

336
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,620
 And again, psych for fun.

337
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,020
 Thank you so much for sending this over.

338
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,260
 Also want to give a shout out to Noreen Turin.

339
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,140
 She covered this for ABC 13 news.

340
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,340
 That's pretty much the only media outlet covering this.

341
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,420
 This story is shocking.

342
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,700
 It is graphic.

343
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,860
 It is disturbing.

344
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,100
 And it will make you mad.

345
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,980
 April 14th, 2022.

346
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,060
 Very very recent story.

347
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,940
 In Lynchburg, Virginia, there's this young man named Johnny Cashman.

348
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,520
 He's 38 years old.

349
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,880
 Johnny Cashman, Jr.

350
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,400
 Johnny's family, they lived in Maine.

351
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,600
 He was living in Virginia.

352
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,760
 And even though they were apart, he stayed in contact with them every single day.

353
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,960
 He talked or texted his mother every single day because he struggled with depression and

354
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,720
 alcoholism.

355
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,600
 Two very horrible things to be dealing with.

356
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
 And he knew that his family was worried about him.

357
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,780
 He was worried about himself and keeping in touch with his family was a way to let them

358
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,020
 know that he was still there.

359
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,020
 He still loved them.

360
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,100
 So April 14th talks to his mom.

361
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,140
 Everything's totally fine.

362
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,260
 April 15th, he doesn't contact them.

363
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,300
 April 16th doesn't contact them.

364
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,420
 April 17th doesn't contact them.

365
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,680
 They're very very concerned about what could be happening with Johnny.

366
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:05,120
 So on April 19th, 2022, his mom calls the Lynchburg police and asks, "Can you do a welfare

367
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,800
 check on my son?"

368
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,320
 He normally talks to me every single day.

369
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,160
 I haven't heard from him in five days now.

370
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
 So they do.

371
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,520
 They go to his apartment and they do a welfare check on him.

372
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,800
 And then they call the mother back and they give just the worst news that any parent could

373
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,140
 hear Johnny's dead.

374
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,020
 Johnny has passed away in his apartment.

375
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,020
 The father starts talking to the police and the father goes, "So what happened?

376
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,620
 What happened with my son?

377
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,620
 Was he murdered?

378
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,940
 Was there any sort of violence?"

379
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,260
 Like he specifically asked those questions.

380
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:47,100
 So the police said to the father, "It looked like he died of natural causes.

381
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,620
 Like that's what it appears to us that he just died of natural causes.

382
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,940
 He was just kind of slumped over as if he had died instantly."

383
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,620
 The father goes, "Totally natural?"

384
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,080
 You're like, "Yeah, totally natural causes.

385
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,280
 We're not going to do an autopsy on him.

386
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
 We know how he died.

387
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,860
 It just happens, you know.

388
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,000
 We're not planning on doing an autopsy on him.

389
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,040
 Sometimes these things happen.

390
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,720
 We know it's sad for the family, but it's just medical illness."

391
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,900
 The father goes, "Are you sure?"

392
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,620
 The police said, "Yeah, the case is closed.

393
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,860
 It's just natural causes."

394
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,740
 So the family from Maine contacted a mortuary service in Lynchburg.

395
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,940
 They had the body picked up from the morgue and cremated.

396
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,220
 And the ashes sent back to Johnny's family.

397
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,500
 On April 29th, Johnny's ex-girlfriend and the girl's mother, the girlfriend's mother,

398
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,840
 will call her Trisha.

399
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,040
 She didn't give her real name.

400
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
 That's totally fine.

401
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,280
 I'm just making the name up.

402
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,180
 Trisha, they contacted Johnny's family and said, "Hey, you know, I have some of my stuff

403
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,540
 at Johnny's apartment.

404
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,080
 Do you mind if I go in there and get this stuff?"

405
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,480
 And the family said, "Sure.

406
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
 No problem at all.

407
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 You can do that."

408
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:14,480
 So Trisha and her mom show up at Johnny's apartment and what they saw boggles the mind.

409
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,860
 Trisha walked in to a blood bath.

410
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,260
 There are bloody fingerprints on the wall.

411
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,620
 There's blood streaks across the chair.

412
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,060
 There's blood on the floor.

413
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:35,300
 And in the bathroom, there is so much blood.

414
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,340
 It looked, I thought I was being trolled.

415
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:49,000
 It is like a human exploded like a Pennywise balloon and not just blood.

416
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,400
 It's blood and fecal matter in this pool on the base of the toilet.

417
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,520
 Like just if someone just blew up, it's all over the bathroom.

418
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,880
 Trisha gets freaked out, obviously, by this, right?

419
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,020
 She was told that he died a natural death out of some sort of medical thing.

420
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,540
 Now, listen, you can have gastrointestinal issues, right?

421
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,180
 One of the ways that you die, like they always say this, when you're taking too much ibuprofen,

422
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,240
 you can rot a hole in your stomach.

423
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,220
 You begin bleeding out your stomach, your poop's black.

424
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,980
 You're dying a very, very short period of time.

425
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
 It's very painful.

426
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,380
 You have to get to the hospital right away.

427
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,220
 He has an alcohol problem.

428
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,500
 Any sort of medication he takes can cause stomach bleeding.

429
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,080
 So it is possible, right?

430
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,560
 Medical illness, but the blood's everywhere.

431
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,960
 Now if that was it, if that was it, if it was just these photographs, these horrific photographs,

432
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,120
 the police could argue, "Yeah, I know it's gross, and I know it's horrific, but you've

433
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,320
 got to understand, we go to crime scenes all the time, and we've seen people die from

434
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,560
 murder, we've seen suicides, and we've seen natural causes, and sometimes natural causes

435
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,840
 are super gross because someone's running around the apartment.

436
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,780
 They're freaking out, they're vomiting blood."

437
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,620
 That's what the police were saying, that a lot of it looked like someone was vomiting

438
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,780
 up blood, and then they die.

439
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,220
 Not just this neat, tidy thing like Elvis on a toilet.

440
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,340
 It can be very graphic.

441
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,700
 If that was it, if it was just the fact that we had this young man who bled seriously,

442
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,820
 seriously bled out in his own apartment, that's not what's at stake here.

443
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,580
 That's not the only piece of evidence.

444
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,560
 What happens next is jaw-dropping.

445
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,320
 The fact that it exists, and the fact that the police continue to just sit on this story.

446
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
 Check this out.

447
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,520
 She leaves the apartment, right?

448
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,840
 She sees all this stuff, she's horrified, she comes out of the apartment.

449
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,960
 She just happens to run into a neighbor out of this apartment complex, and she tells him,

450
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,560
 "Oh my God, I just came out of the apartment, there's blood everywhere.

451
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,920
 I thought it was natural causes."

452
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,020
 That's what I was told too, natural causes, but I mean, it just looks like a crime scene

453
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,060
 in there, and it's just disgusting.

454
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,660
 The neighbor goes, "Well, Trisha, I have a door cam.

455
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,380
 I have a camera that records everything in the hallway.

456
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,580
 It won't let us know what happened in Johnny's apartment, but maybe it'll give us some idea.

457
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,140
 Let's take a look."

458
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,980
 So the video footage is basically three clips.

459
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:34,440
 The first clip is Johnny walking up the stairs, and this is about like 3.03 in the afternoon.

460
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,400
 You see Johnny, and this is on April 14th, the last day he talked to his family.

461
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:48,560
 The footage is just a long stairwell leading up to a little hallway, and then to the right

462
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,600
 is Johnny's apartment.

463
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
 That's the whole shot.

464
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,720
 You just see the stairways kind of descend into darkness.

465
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,060
 Going back to the first floor, presumably.

466
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,180
 The first piece of video footage you see is Johnny walking up the stairs.

467
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,300
 Now this is footage of Johnny the day he died.

468
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,900
 We know for sure this is the day that he died for what's about to come up.

469
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:12,980
 He's walking up the stairs, and this is not what a man who's about to poop out a gallon

470
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,140
 of blood in a bunch of vehicle matter would walk like.

471
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,540
 I don't have any scientific experience.

472
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,820
 I don't have any scientific experience on what you would walk like.

473
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,080
 He's just John Talley walking up the stairs.

474
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,560
 He goes in the apartment.

475
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,240
 Now what's interesting is he showed the neighbor when the police were there.

476
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,760
 He told the police, "Yeah, I also have a camera," and he says, "We watched some footage."

477
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,200
 But when Noreen was doing the interview on him, he goes, "Listen, I don't know exactly

478
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,560
 what footage we watched," and I'll tell you this right now.

479
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,240
 We didn't have any audio.

480
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,840
 He didn't have any Bluetooth speakers or anything hooked up, so we were just watching

481
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
 the footage.

482
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,500
 But even if, and we'll allow that, right, the police did not hear the audio that you're

483
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,620
 about to hear.

484
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,340
 They've heard it now.

485
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
 They've heard it now.

486
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,220
 They heard it back when Noreen started talking about this, when the family started playing

487
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,860
 this audio for the police.

488
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,260
 The police, the Lynchburg Police Department of Virginia, has still been sitting on this

489
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
 story.

490
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
 Absolute incompetence.

491
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,500
 They are not investigating this.

492
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,160
 You have video footage of Johnny walking up the stairs and going into his apartment.

493
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,160
 That's at 3.03, at 3.11, just eight minutes after he enters the apartment.

494
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:40,800
 Now, this is very, very graphic audio, so if you want, jump ahead about two, three minutes.

495
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,080
 Same camera angle.

496
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,920
 You're looking down a stairway.

497
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,140
 To the right is Johnny's apartment door.

498
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,140
 You hear this audio coming from Johnny's apartment.

499
00:28:53,140 --> 00:29:16,260
 What the fuck?

500
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:45,780
 One minute after Johnny entered his apartment, we have audio of an assault.

501
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,900
 It's a video of a murder.

502
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,380
 Same shot all the way down the staircase, Johnny's door to the right.

503
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,940
 You hear that sound coming out of Johnny's apartment.

504
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,460
 If you skip that part, here's the transcript.

505
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,780
 It says, "Dude, what the F?

506
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
 What are you doing, man?

507
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,580
 Yo, what the F, dude?"

508
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,100
 Then you hear banging noises and you hear someone yelling, "Stop multiple times."

509
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,780
 Eight minutes.

510
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,060
 Eight minutes passed watching that video footage.

511
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:20,540
 They have all this footage in this article on ABC 13.

512
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:28,620
 Eight minutes after Johnny walked in, seven minutes after you hear those noises, a man,

513
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:35,200
 an unidentified man whose face is clearly visible on camera.

514
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:45,940
 This man on video leaves the apartment, walks all the way downstairs, turns around, walks

515
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:54,040
 back up, covers his hand with the sleeve of his jacket, wipes his fingerprints off of

516
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,500
 the doorknob, walks back down the stairs.

517
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,280
 And then there's a few moments of silence and you begin to hear Johnny yell from inside

518
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,240
 his apartment, "Help.

519
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
 Help.

520
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,740
 Help."

521
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:17,080
 So the family contacts the police and they go, "You told us that this was a natural death

522
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,800
 and we cremated his body.

523
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,720
 All of that evidence is gone.

524
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,360
 All of it."

525
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,000
 And this is an actual quote from the detective regarding this.

526
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 You said it was okay.

527
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 We could cremate the body.

528
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 In this case, close.

529
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,280
 The detective said, "What I was trying to convey was it was a medical emergency and

530
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:46,280
 I was talking to your mom and I tried to clarify what I said originally and explain what I

531
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:55,200
 meant by the medical emergency being vomiting blood everywhere uncontrollably."

532
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,160
 He is not saying we were wrong.

533
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,280
 He is not saying sorry we need to investigate this as a murder.

534
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,960
 He was saying, "Oh sorry, miscommunication bro.

535
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,920
 Sorry you destroyed that evidence when we said case closed."

536
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,120
 Here's a quote from the notice of the medical examiner case record.

537
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,360
 "I actually got this screenshot from a really cool video done on this by a channel called

538
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
 Analyze This."

539
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,320
 I'll put that in the show notes.

540
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,040
 They really went over a lot of stuff.

541
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,120
 One of the things they said was he wasn't slumped over.

542
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,160
 He was flat on his back in the living room.

543
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,680
 They really went over all these documents.

544
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
 It's a cool channel.

545
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,120
 It doesn't have a lot of subscribers.

546
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,320
 So if you're into true crime, it's a good place to check out.

547
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,880
 I got this quote from the screenshot.

548
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:48,720
 It said, "Blood with fecal matter mixed in found around home likely gastrointestinal

549
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
 bleed per investigators.

550
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
 No trauma, no drugs.

551
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,400
 Nothing suspicious."

552
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,600
 So they looked at this guy.

553
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,640
 They saw the blood and the poop and go, "I must have just blood and pooped himself to

554
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
 death."

555
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,760
 Which happens, you rot your stomach out, right?

556
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,440
 The family says though that he had just had a recent medical checkup in January.

557
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,240
 He had no gastrointestinal issues.

558
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,680
 Too much ibuprofen can do a lot of damage in a very short time period.

559
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,800
 It's not going to make you scream out what the FU do and do.

560
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,840
 Stop, stop, stop.

561
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,880
 And then a guy wipes his fingerprints off of a doorknob.

562
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,000
 Ibuprofen doesn't do that.

563
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,360
 Ibuprofen doesn't cover its tracks.

564
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,720
 Now what's so interesting about this is I was digging and that's the end of the story.

565
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,880
 The police have completely been like, "Well, we're kind of doing an ongoing thing now because

566
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,400
 now we got a bunch of egg on our face because it turns out that they're not actually even

567
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,960
 saying we got egg on our face that we were wrong or anything like that."

568
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,640
 And not only that, they're actually intentionally or incompetently misleading people because

569
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,920
 what happened was I started looking more into this.

570
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,880
 On May 2nd, 2022, they started the police released images from the stairwell and they

571
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,080
 said, "We're looking to talk to this man."

572
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,760
 They identified him in the video at Stephen Church from Elizabeth Town, Tennessee.

573
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,160
 On May 23rd, they located him and he provided a statement.

574
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,680
 There was no arrest.

575
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,400
 And I was like, "What in the world?

576
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,720
 You have video footage of this guy entering the apartment.

577
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,640
 You hear a guy screaming for help and we see him wiping his fingerprints off the door.

578
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,400
 We see that."

579
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,600
 What is his statement?

580
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,920
 What was the statement he gave to the police?

581
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,960
 What is the clarification?

582
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,020
 Now the police said they were specifically looking for him.

583
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,880
 They said that he was, quote, "seeing leaving an apartment just before another man's death

584
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,200
 from apparent medical complications," unquote.

585
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,360
 So they're still sticking with that.

586
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,120
 They're still saying that this dude died of medical complications.

587
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,600
 So let's play devil's advocate for a second.

588
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,880
 Let's play devil's advocate for a second.

589
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,400
 Adding this in because I'm editing the episode and I thought, "Let's look at the other side."

590
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
 Because here's the thing.

591
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,480
 In the articles, it never specifically says it is Johnny's voice going, "What the F, man?

592
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
 Stop, stop.

593
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,600
 What the F?"

594
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,160
 Never specifically says that.

595
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,920
 We know he's the one yelling, "Help, help," because he's the only person in the apartment.

596
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,880
 After Steven leaves, there's probably about a minute of Steven walking down the stairs,

597
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,240
 walking back up, wiping his fingerprints off the door knob.

598
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
 It's so ridiculous.

599
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,000
 I mean, the devil's advocate thing will do it, but we have video footage of Steven church

600
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,880
 leaving the apartment right after we hear these noises, right?

601
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,840
 We hear somebody, either Steven or Johnny, scream out, "What the F, man?

602
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,560
 Stop, stop, stop."

603
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,640
 Steven walks down the stairs, comes back up, wipes his fingerprints off the door knob, and

604
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,360
 then walks away and then probably about 30 seconds pass and you hear a voice from inside

605
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,080
 the apartment, which is Johnny.

606
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,360
 It's definitely going, "Help, help."

607
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,520
 So let's play devil's advocate.

608
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,520
 It's just because I don't want to accuse a man of murder and get sued.

609
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,920
 Let's play devil's advocate.

610
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,320
 It's possible that this was the scenario.

611
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,240
 Steven was in the apartment.

612
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,720
 Johnny walks into the apartment.

613
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,120
 A couple minutes later, we hear, "What the F?

614
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
 Stop it, stop it."

615
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
 And I guess it's possible.

616
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
 I guess anything's possible.

617
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,120
 I talk about ghosts all the time and banging princesses.

618
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,960
 That voice was actually Steven.

619
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,680
 And what was going on was Johnny walked in and began vomiting blood everywhere.

620
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,800
 And Steven's going, "Stop it, dude.

621
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
 Stop.

622
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
 Stop."

623
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,280
 And all the banging you hear and everything is just Johnny running around the apartment

624
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,200
 vomiting blood and pooping out blood.

625
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,480
 That's the devil's advocate thing, that it wasn't a murder, it wasn't assault, it was

626
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,080
 a medical thing, even if that's the case, even if that's the case.

627
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,560
 So if you just saw someone running around their apartment vomiting up blood, your reaction

628
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,520
 is to leave them while they're still alive because you hear Johnny clearly yell out,

629
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
 "Help."

630
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,840
 Your reaction, I mean, I guess you would want to get away from somebody if they were vomiting

631
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,960
 blood, but think about it.

632
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,520
 Steven, let's say that devil's advocate, it's a medical emergency.

633
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,800
 Steven then leaves the apartment very, very calmly, walks down the stairs, walks back

634
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,080
 up the stairs, appears to wipe his fingerprints off the doorknob, covers his hand up with

635
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,760
 his jacket, wipes the doorknob, goes back down the stairs.

636
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,880
 You just watch someone have a medical emergency.

637
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,680
 You're not calling 911, you're not knocking on the neighbor's door, you're not alerting

638
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,400
 anyone, your calmness can be, you just walk away.

639
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,720
 And the police go, "Yeah, we're looking for him because he was there around the time or

640
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,240
 before the time of a medical emergency that may result in a..."

641
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:59,520
 The devil's advocate theory, while possible, right, Johnny walked in with this gastrointestinal

642
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,760
 disorder.

643
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,520
 It's possible, but that shows such callousness as well, that someone who you were letting

644
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,200
 stay at your apartment could watch you vomit blood and then just very calmly leave and

645
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,440
 not contact the authority.

646
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,840
 Remember, it took five days before his body was even found, the family in Maine cult.

647
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,480
 So that's kind of what the narrative is.

648
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,080
 The police are going with this story, with this medical condition story, and it's absolutely

649
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
 nuts.

650
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,480
 It's absolutely nuts.

651
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,360
 Now, I'm adding this part in because I was editing it and I was thinking, "Okay, I got

652
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,480
 to do the devil's advocate thing, even though this is a conspiracy theory podcast."

653
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,200
 And I do think at this point there is a conspiracy theory to cover up this crime.

654
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,600
 Let's do the other side.

655
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,720
 I also want to make a correction as I was editing this podcast.

656
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,760
 I was continuing to read articles because this totally fascinates me.

657
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,440
 I say articles, really, it's just Noreen's article reprinted in different websites.

658
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,680
 There's not a lot of people talking about this.

659
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,800
 And as I was working on this, I see another podcast, a much bigger podcast than mine called

660
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,720
 Generation Y, I think it's called, covered this just a couple of weeks ago.

661
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,880
 So I didn't know that when I was doing this story, and I'm glad that other people are

662
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,080
 covering this.

663
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,120
 They're starting to.

664
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
 That's cool.

665
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,280
 I found that out while I was editing this.

666
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,560
 I was kind of looking around.

667
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,360
 I was trying to get that audio clip that I played for you.

668
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,440
 I was like, "Jason, I wish you had it."

669
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,000
 And I found that another podcast had covered this story.

670
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Good.

671
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Awesome.

672
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,960
 More people should know about this.

673
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,240
 But while I have this time, I wanted to make a correction.

674
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,120
 The neighbor, it's a minor correction.

675
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,560
 The neighbor was a woman.

676
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,080
 I kept referring to her as a him.

677
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,320
 That was just me.

678
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,040
 I didn't catch that the first time when I was writing my notes down.

679
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,120
 I put it down as a he.

680
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,240
 So that was my mistake.

681
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,080
 So it's either incompetence or it's a cover-up.

682
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
 Maybe a little bit of both.

683
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,800
 I think generally, I think they probably were incompetent.

684
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,280
 They walked in, they saw this guy.

685
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
 He's an alcoholic.

686
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,520
 He had run-ins with the law.

687
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,840
 They knew this guy.

688
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
 Who cares?

689
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
 He's just some drunk.

690
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,240
 You know what really pisses me off about this story when I read it?

691
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,840
 I thought, "That's me."

692
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
 Right?

693
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,960
 You know what I mean?

694
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,840
 I don't know what this guy did.

695
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,720
 This guy could have done some disgusting crimes.

696
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
 I don't know.

697
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,240
 But even then, I go, "That's me, man.

698
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,040
 I'm just a dude.

699
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,200
 I'm just a guy floating through life.

700
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,320
 Maybe that's you too.

701
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,960
 Maybe you're Johnny as well.

702
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,360
 And if something happened to you, the police, it's just something that happens at 3 p.m.

703
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,920
 on this cops afternoon, whatever.

704
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,520
 He probably made a couple of jokes about it back at the station when about his day.

705
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,120
 Now, if it had just been a natural death, fine, dude, whatever.

706
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,560
 Like I understand that.

707
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,720
 But it wasn't a natural death.

708
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,680
 It was not a natural death.

709
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,080
 You heard that audio, and I played that audio because it pisses me off.

710
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,040
 He was pleading for help.

711
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
 You know what I mean?

712
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
 Like, that's...

713
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,400
 He's one of us.

714
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:31,480
 He's just a guy going through life, facing problems, fighting his demons, sometimes winning,

715
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,880
 sometimes losing.

716
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,640
 And he died brutally, and the police rode it off like nothing.

717
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,240
 Pisses me off.

718
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,520
 Pisses me off to no end.

719
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
 I get it.

720
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,120
 Listen, I get in trouble whenever I say this, but police are people too.

721
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,440
 You know, sometimes that job gets boring, sometimes you check out, just like when you're

722
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,840
 working retail or working at a corporate office.

723
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,680
 Some days you come in and you're not doing 100%.

724
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,840
 You're doing like 50 at best.

725
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,880
 You've been doing the job too long.

726
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,120
 You're underappreciated.

727
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,840
 You don't get the raise.

728
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,000
 You probably have personal problems at home.

729
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,800
 And the same way that you half-ass stuff at your job cops half-ass stuff at theirs.

730
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,960
 It happens because they're people.

731
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:34,040
 But the difference is that when I half-ass at my job, murderers don't go free.

732
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:45,560
 And if I did half-ass at my job and I got caught because of who I am, I don't know.

733
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,160
 I'd say, I'm sorry.

734
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,800
 Like, yeah, we didn't have the audio at the time.

735
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,680
 I just saw the video footage of one guy walking in and 10 minutes later, one guy walking out.

736
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,000
 I mean, like, I didn't really think of it.

737
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,240
 We don't know what footage they have either.

738
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,280
 The neighbor says they took some of the footage, but I don't know actually what he recorded.

739
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,640
 But he just walked in.

740
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,400
 He got a welfare call.

741
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,080
 They said they had to go back multiple times to get into the apartment because he wasn't

742
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
 there.

743
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
 He wasn't answering the door.

744
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
 Finally, they got a hold of the manager.

745
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
 They went in.

746
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
 They found him dead.

747
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,440
 This was a whole day ordeal.

748
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,720
 And I get it, dude.

749
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,120
 They're burned out.

750
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,800
 Then own up to the mistake.

751
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,960
 That's what pisses me off even more.

752
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
 I get it.

753
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,280
 Not everyone's 100% all the time.

754
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
 I do.

755
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,960
 But when you make that mistake, when you realize you have the audio recording of something

756
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,560
 happening to them, who knows what?

757
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,200
 For all we know, they made them swallow a ton of ibuprofen.

758
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,840
 It doesn't sound like it.

759
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,160
 It sounds like a man being beaten to death.

760
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,200
 When you make a mistake, you own up to it, right?

761
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,000
 And you double down your efforts and you put out, "Find this guy."

762
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,920
 But see, if they do that, the police don't want to publicize this case because then all

763
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,600
 of the stuff that goes with it, they have to admit, "Yeah, we dropped the ball.

764
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
 Yeah, we did this.

765
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
 Yeah, we did that."

766
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
 And they have this investigation.

767
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,080
 Hopefully they're having an internal affairs investigation into all of this.

768
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
 But you know what I mean?

769
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,840
 Like now, it could just get even more messy for them, but I don't care about them.

770
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,000
 Johnny's one of us.

771
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,840
 He's just somebody living life.

772
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:41,600
 Just a dude who died brutally and the police rode it off as a natural cause.

773
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,280
 Think about all the pieces that had to fall into place for this to be uncovered.

774
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,280
 The ex-girlfriend had to show up and the apartment hadn't been cleaned up by the manager to be

775
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,920
 re-rented out.

776
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,680
 She had to have...

777
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,680
 That was the big part was the ex-girlfriend showing up because she knew the neighbor.

778
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,680
 See?

779
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,040
 And he goes, "Yeah, I got video footage of this."

780
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,280
 What if he didn't have the camera?

781
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,760
 If one of those two things were missing, his family would have just been like, "Johnny,

782
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,600
 you know, poor Johnny, he struggled through his whole life and then he had this medical

783
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
 event and he died.

784
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,080
 He died far away from us.

785
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,160
 I wish he was with us."

786
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,720
 But now that family's embroiled in a murder mystery with a suspect that the cops don't

787
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,560
 really seem that keen on catching.

788
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,280
 Absolutely bizarre.

789
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,280
 Absolutely infuriating.

790
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,880
 It's sad, right?

791
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
 Sad.

792
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
 Sad story.

793
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
 Young man dies.

794
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,040
 It's always sad.

795
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,320
 Young people die, you know?

796
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,960
 Absolute incompetence, followed up by a cover-up.

797
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:51,880
 The Lynchburg police of Lynchburg, Virginia, should be ashamed of themselves.

798
00:45:51,880 --> 00:46:01,280
 But the problem is, they're not.

799
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,600
 Because if they were ashamed of themselves, they would do whatever it took to catch this

800
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:13,920
 guy.

801
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
 I love being proved wrong.

802
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
 I really do.

803
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,480
 When it comes to stuff like this, I would love it.

804
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,560
 They catch him tomorrow.

805
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,560
 I love being proved wrong.

806
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,360
 So Lynchburg police, please.

807
00:46:36,360 --> 00:47:01,360
 Prove me wrong about you.

808
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:08,360
 I love you.

809
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:17,360
 I love you.

810
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:28,360
 I love you.

811
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,940
 (upbeat music)
