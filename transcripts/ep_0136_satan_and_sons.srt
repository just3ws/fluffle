1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 Today we talk about a bunch of stuff on the first and last Hangover New Year's Day special

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,440
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,880
 I need to drink more water.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:23,360
 [Music]

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,960
 I'm having a great day over here, having a great day too.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,960
 I am hungover.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,720
 Now when I say the first and the last, it's not the first and last New Year's Eve or

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,920
 New Year's Day episode because we'll have many more of those.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,520
 But it will be the last episode I do hungover.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,520
 Yesterday wasn't just supposed to be the bonus episode.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
 I started to record this episode.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,600
 I was going to really sit on New Year's Eve.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,920
 I had one beer.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,360
 It wasn't even a beer.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
 It was one of those straw burritos.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,880
 It's just a margarita and a can.

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,320
 I proceeded to talk about Bird Box for 20 minutes straight and I was like, "I can't

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
 do this."

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,200
 I went and I edited up the bonus episode.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,680
 I have a really low tolerance to alcohol.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
 Then I went out.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,240
 So quick note, my buddy Aaron, he's a listener of the show.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,320
 Hey Aaron, he invited me to his show.

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,320
 He's in a rock band called Sundiver, great band.

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,320
 I wish I could have paid more attention to the lyrics because he says there's a lot of

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,720
 cool concepts in the lyrics.

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,960
 But in live shows it's kind of hard plus by that time I had three more ciders.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,320
 It's not just regular, a lapel cider.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,200
 And I was pretty blitzed.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
 Then I came home and just kind of stumbled around my house for a while, went to bed,

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
 woke up today, ate my body weight in Taco Bell and now I'm recording this episode.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
 Once Sundiver starts to get some music recorded, we'll definitely see about playing some of

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
 it on the show.

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
 It's a really good band though.

37
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
 I think a lot of it, when we're talking to Aaron, a lot of it crosses over to the same

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,760
 topics we talk about here.

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,000
 So I'm not going to talk about Bird Box for 20 minutes like I did on yesterday's Scrapped

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
 episode.

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,760
 I wanted to highlight two scenes.

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
 Now, first off, let me back up.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,840
 Bird Box is the biggest hit movie that Netflix has announced.

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,760
 They said they had 45 million views of that show within a week.

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:15,760
 And it's a horror, sci-fi horror movie about a world where it's the normal world, but one

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
 day these invisible ghosts or demons show up.

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,320
 And if you look at them, you either get so sad you kill yourself, you get so afraid you

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,640
 kill yourself, or you fall in love with them and you keep running around and going, "Open

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,440
 your eyes!" and you try to take people's blindfolds off or hold their eyes open.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,280
 It's completely ridiculous, completely ridiculous.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
 Premise and the movie doesn't work on multiple levels, but I'm going to break down my 20-minute

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,920
 review into basically two scenes because this really, early on, this happened and it set

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,080
 up everything.

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,880
 The star is, who's that chick?

55
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
 Sandra Bullock.

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,280
 But Sandra Bullock and her sister are driving away from a hospital where they just saw a

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 bunch of people kill themselves.

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,320
 Because this infestation or whatever has just come to the United States.

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,240
 And the sister is driving the car and she said, "We need to get to my ranch.

60
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,680
 I have supplies there.

61
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,160
 It's off the grid.

62
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,400
 No one can find it because they don't know what's going on."

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,440
 And after watching multiple people kill themselves and on the news it was showing this was happening

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,800
 worldwide.

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
 Someone makes that offer to you.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,200
 There's a mysterious disease causing people to kill themselves and someone says, "I have

67
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,280
 a place completely remote that's stocked up on supplies."

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,880
 The normal person would be like, "Just fine, whatever."

69
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
 Sandra Bullock goes, "What?

70
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
 What will I wear?

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,120
 I owe my clothes or at my apartment.

72
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,640
 We have to go to my apartment first."

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,520
 And then, which is completely stupid, and then the very next scene, they're still in

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,800
 the car, a huge explosion blows up behind the car, like maybe two or three blocks away,

75
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,040
 but a massive explosion.

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,000
 And Sandra Bullock goes to the driver, her sister goes, "Go, go, go, go, go!"

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
 And the driver goes, "What?

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
 I can't run a red light."

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,160
 The whole, and they just sat there for a while and then they started driving, the whole movie

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,320
 is that.

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,840
 It's people's personalities changing scene for scene.

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,200
 Sometimes Sandra Bullock is very caring and we're like, "We can't let this guy go back

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
 out there.

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,700
 That's suicide.

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,280
 We have to take this guy in."

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,040
 And then she also has her kid and her friend's kid.

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,440
 They both gave birth at the same time as one of the Colt members who was running through

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,720
 the house trying to open their eyes up.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,080
 And she has both those kids for five years.

90
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
 She gives birth to one and the other little babies there and the mom jumps out of the window.

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,000
 So Sandra Bullock with two babies, five years later we go into the future and she named

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,480
 the kids boy and girl.

93
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,120
 So it's like she's sentimental towards total stranger.

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,080
 It was supposed to be like she wasn't ready for motherhood or whatever, nonsense like

95
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,960
 that, but in some scenes she was totally close to strangers and other scenes she can't even

96
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,800
 like name these kids for five years.

97
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,040
 It's called bird box because she has a box full of birds.

98
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,120
 Birds make noises when the monsters are around.

99
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,160
 And the whole climax of the movie is her rowing a boat down a river blindfolded.

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,120
 I've seen some stupid, implausible stuff in movies.

101
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,760
 But rowing a boat blindfolded down a river, it takes the cake.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,840
 I've never seen anything that dumb ever.

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,440
 Early in the movie they drive a car blindfolded and they kinda are like "well this car is

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,880
 GPS and it has like these sensor warnings, but you would be in a, if you did a boat blindfolded

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,440
 for more than two minutes, you're totally gone."

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
 It's like a six mile journey.

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
 It's completely ridiculous.

108
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,920
 So yeah, that's it, bird box.

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
 Don't watch it.

110
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
 Sorry guys.

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,480
 Better luck next time, Netflix.

112
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,880
 It was better than Cloverfield Paradox.

113
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
 Kinda.

114
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
 Okay.

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,240
 So, as my dehydrated body, my husk sits here.

116
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,680
 Still soaked with four ciders.

117
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,400
 Trying to rehydrate.

118
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,240
 Let's take a look at some New Year's traditions stuff.

119
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,000
 I thought it was interesting.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,480
 Because I was trying to, I was like "are there any New Year's ghosts?"

121
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,720
 There's always a ghost walking on a hall somewhere, but that's not interesting to me.

122
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,640
 So with all that being said, let's talk about Pizza Gate.

123
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,760
 It's only barely connected to it, but it all started off with a Pizza Gate thread on Twitter,

124
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,880
 which eventually brought in the daughter of Hillary and Bill Clinton.

125
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,120
 So Chrissy Teigen.

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,000
 Chrissy Teigen is a model and she's been around forever.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,840
 I'm not calling you old Chrissy, but you've been around for a while.

128
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,760
 She posted on Twitter, she posted pictures of a little girl, and her little girl was

129
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,400
 dressed up as a hot dog, as a pineapple, and as Alice from Alice on Wonderland.

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
 Not all of the same time.

131
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,120
 As awesome as that costume would be.

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,560
 A hot dog dressed up as Alice with a pineapple on it said.

133
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,360
 It was three different costumes.

134
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
 And then another tweet, she tweeted the emoticon of a slice of pizza.

135
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,360
 So the Twitter people jumped all over this and said "oh my god, Chrissy Teigen is part

136
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
 of Pizza Gate."

137
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
 Look at these photos.

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,320
 And other people were like "oh my god dude, how can you deny that these photos are pictures

139
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
 of Pizza Gate?"

140
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
 Here's why.

141
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:18,560
 Alice from Alice on Wonderland is supposedly used by MK Ultra agents to brainwash young

142
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
 girls.

143
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,800
 You know Alice falls in the looking glass, the mirror.

144
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,200
 Anytime you see Alice in Wonderland imagery, it's because the Illuminati wants you to see

145
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
 that.

146
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,480
 They're showing you that that's how they brainwash young girls.

147
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
 And hot dogs.

148
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,000
 You're like "well hot dogs are all American."

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,400
 How can that be associated with a French revolutionary group of masons from the 1700s?

150
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,040
 What does a hot dog have to do with them?

151
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,720
 Well a hot dog is a code word.

152
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,760
 You should know this audience.

153
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 Oh what a...

154
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,560
 I can't believe I have to even explain this concept to you.

155
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,040
 It's so obvious.

156
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,160
 A hot dog is a code word for a young boy.

157
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,240
 I should dump you for the Pizza Gate audience.

158
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,400
 How can you not give that reference?

159
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,280
 Now obviously your question would be "why is the little girl dressed up like a hot dog

160
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
 then?"

161
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
 Hold on!

162
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,640
 Don't think too much about it.

163
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,920
 Just post a bunch of comments and like this video on YouTube.

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,280
 And if it's so funny on the tweets they're like "yeah I don't know what pineapple means

165
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,640
 that the pineapple has no code in this Pizza Gate mythology.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
 It's just pineapple."

167
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 So they couldn't fit that in.

168
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,160
 Anyways, a couple of the tweets and I've actually discovered this too.

169
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,160
 We talked about Hans and he believed that men are women and women are men and there's

170
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,840
 this big thing to...

171
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,760
 That's actually way bigger than I thought it was.

172
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
 I thought it was just a Hans thing.

173
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,480
 There's tons of people who believe that most women are really men and most men are really

174
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
 women.

175
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
 So we'll have to explore that again.

176
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,560
 But in these tweets they bring that up and they're like "Yeah Chrissy Teigen's a man

177
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
 anyways" and other people are like "What?"

178
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,320
 And there's one person who said "Hey, whoa whoa whoa, I believe in Pizza Gate but you

179
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,000
 know you gotta knock off with this trans hatred."

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 So it was this weird...

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Cause the dude just threw it out and was like "Yeah, you know it's a man.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,520
 What do you expect?"

183
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,280
 Anyways, Chrissy Teigen responded to this and said "I normally don't respond to this

184
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,840
 type of stuff but you're assaulting my kids."

185
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,400
 One of the people on Twitter said "Look at the kids...

186
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,440
 Look at the look in that kids eyes."

187
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
 It's very common.

188
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,680
 That's what sexual assault or that's what abuse victims look like.

189
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,240
 That's pretty low dude.

190
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,680
 That's someone's kid.

191
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,800
 That they're like wearing a costume and you're saying "Yeah, but that kid gets abused."

192
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,280
 That's pretty jacked up.

193
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,400
 So Chrissy Teigen responds to this and she's like "Hey man, you guys are making fun of

194
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
 my kids."

195
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 Like kind of crossing the line.

196
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,520
 And Chelsea Clinton responded to that tweet saying "Hey, you know, happens to me.

197
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,040
 I don't mind when they make fun of me but when they start making fun of my daughter and

198
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,280
 threatening my daughter, I report all of those."

199
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,040
 Now the beautiful thing about Twitter is you can have somebody who is super duper duper

200
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,040
 famous, super powerful and whatever and anyone can contact them in public.

201
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,160
 There was a thread recently where Mila Jovovich was just randomly talking about movies like

202
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,760
 resident evil movies and someone tweeted back "You suck!"

203
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,640
 And she was like "I suck, you suck, you'll never be on the set of a movie."

204
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,720
 And then total, I mean it's probably a fake account.

205
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,440
 Someone created, yelled at a huge movie star and flipped her out.

206
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,120
 So Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Hillary and Bill Clinton, reaches out to a Twitter friend.

207
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
 They don't really know each other in real life but a fellow mom and says "Hey, I go through

208
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,400
 it too."

209
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,840
 And then someone with the account called Rogue Hooters staff, like a rogue member of the

210
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,200
 restaurant Hooters, just says "Eat shit Chelsea!"

211
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,800
 And it just tagged right to her.

212
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,760
 That's the greatest thing about Twitter.

213
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,080
 So that started a big thing where people were then contacting Hooters and saying someone

214
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,680
 is using an account that makes it seem like they work for you to insult an ex-president's

215
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,640
 daughter so then Hooters had to get involved and say "Hey, we don't have anything to do

216
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,960
 with this account."

217
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,520
 Once Hooters gets involved, Chrissy Teigen is like "What is happening?"

218
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,080
 Like "Hi Hooters, that's her exact tweet.

219
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,960
 Because you have these two powerful famous women and a restaurant that is known for busty

220
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,840
 women and potwings has to get involved."

221
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,560
 Chelsea Clinton responds in 2017 "At Church of Satan and I were put on a few threads together

222
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
 in 2018.

223
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
 It's Hooters.

224
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,280
 What a time to be alive Chrissy."

225
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,160
 The Church of Satan, because she tagged them in this, the Church of Satan responds "The

226
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,160
 never-ending excitement here is never-ending."

227
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,240
 And then Chelsea Clinton responds "It's been so long, happy new year."

228
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,400
 And in that she tagged Church of Satan, Chrissy Teigen, and four other people, most likely

229
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,000
 Hooters and whoever else was in the thread.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,280
 Now that happened earlier obviously in like January of 2018.

231
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 So people took that seriously.

232
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,440
 It's funny because it's on Snopes.

233
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,760
 Did Chelsea Clinton tweet "Happy New Year" to the Church of Satan?

234
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
 And it's true.

235
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,480
 Because she did.

236
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,440
 So you have to take it in the context of all everything that happened before that.

237
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,880
 It was kind of this thing like, what a wacky world we live in.

238
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,280
 First I'm connected to "At Church of Satan" and now I'm connected to "At Hooters" and

239
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,400
 I'm this person and it's just, I'm a mom and it's just such a weird thing.

240
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,640
 But that actually made things worse for her.

241
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,760
 And Pete's a gate and everything like that.

242
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,520
 Even Sarah Palin, Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin, chimed in and then a bunch of

243
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:49,080
 other just normal people chimed in saying, you know, this just goes to show what we're

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
 up against.

245
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,080
 This is Peter Wood, this is the Satanic Elite, so on and so forth and blah blah blah.

246
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,880
 Yes, she did wish "Happy New Year" to the Church of Satan.

247
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,600
 But it's so bizarre that all the context is gone from that.

248
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,520
 A lot of this stuff has to be about the context.

249
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,600
 However, of course, this just threw fuel on the fire because now Chelsea Clinton is talking

250
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,720
 to someone who's accused of being, dressing her kid up as a hot dog and now the Church

251
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
 of Satan's involved.

252
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,600
 You know, is Hooters part of the Illuminati?

253
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,200
 I don't know, it's hard to keep track of all this stuff.

254
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,360
 But yes, she did.

255
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
 It is true.

256
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,760
 She did wish them a Happy New Year.

257
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,960
 But again, yeah, it's all about the context.

258
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,400
 So New Year's traditions.

259
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,320
 We've talked about Chelsea Clinton ringing in the New Year by talking to the Church of

260
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,180
 Satan.

261
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
 Did you know?

262
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,840
 No, Franz is not showing up.

263
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,960
 Even though that is his character, that is his official phrase.

264
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,440
 I should get a shirt made that just says "Did you know?" as a picture of a guy named Franz.

265
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
 But did you know?

266
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
 Did you know?

267
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,520
 No, no, Franz, I just did Franz on Bam McGarr's afterlife.

268
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,480
 He can't come back that quickly.

269
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,840
 But did you know that there is actually a movement, it's probably like three people,

270
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:11,440
 now they actually believe it, that New Year's Day is Satanic and so are New Year's resolutions.

271
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,080
 So the New Year Day, the New Year Day being Satanic, that's a fairly, that's not a very

272
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,920
 controversial belief.

273
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,960
 The idea is, and it's true in the sense that when Christianity began to take over Europe,

274
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,720
 they went the path of least resistance.

275
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,840
 People had traditional holidays, pagan holidays, and the Church says, "Yeah, that's Jesus'

276
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
 birthday."

277
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
 Because they really don't care.

278
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,200
 They're like, "This is when everyone gets together and hangs out, we'll just rename

279
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 it."

280
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,640
 They did that with churches and holy sites and holidays across the board.

281
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 Apparently in the Bible, there's a part in Exodus where God says to Moses and Aaron,

282
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,520
 I think Aaron's his son or something like that.

283
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,860
 Maybe it's just some other dude who's just like, he was like a time traveler who just

284
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,840
 hung out with Moses and he pops up occasionally in the Bible.

285
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,800
 I wonder if there is a time traveler in the Bible, like Bible times, like just chilling

286
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 in the background.

287
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,240
 Okay, so Moses and Aaron are hanging out and God goes, "This month shall be unto you the

288
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
 beginning of months.

289
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,520
 It shall be the first month of the year to you."

290
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
 Fades away.

291
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,920
 So, what he's talking about is back in Hebrew times, there was, they used a different calendar

292
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,520
 obviously because they had no idea what Julius Caesar was.

293
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,280
 They, they're basically, when God was saying that, it was the month that is between our

294
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,120
 modern March and April, which is supposed to be the new year.

295
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,200
 And we have it on January 1st, therefore New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are satanic.

296
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,800
 Those aren't the days that God wanted us to worship or wanted us to celebrate as the

297
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
 new calendar.

298
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
 I don't think he cares, dude.

299
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,040
 And actually the website I was reading, it was from a book that was published in 1964,

300
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,760
 hasn't gained a ton of traction.

301
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,600
 It's a belief because again, I don't, that's such a minimal thing.

302
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,960
 It's not a holy holiday when you celebrate the New Year's, it's simply just a day to

303
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,280
 say, "Hey, it's new beginnings."

304
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,080
 I don't, we're not a farming culture.

305
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,640
 The reason why the logic saying that God assigned that time is their new beginning is because

306
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
 it was harvest based.

307
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,600
 You gotta pick your battles sometimes.

308
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 Like if you're trying to save the souls of humanity from eternal torment, if that's what

309
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,760
 you truly believe, I don't think getting them to put down their poppers on December 31st

310
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
 is a good tactic.

311
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 You gotta choose your battles.

312
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,120
 And I think that's what Rome was doing.

313
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,200
 Just the church in general, they're like, "Whatever, dude.

314
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,440
 Yeah, Jesus was born right now.

315
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,320
 Your old holiday is gone.

316
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 This is the new one."

317
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,880
 They're just choosing their battles.

318
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,840
 So on its own, I didn't find that one super compelling.

319
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,800
 However, there's a trick that I've learned.

320
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,480
 You can type in blank conspiracy.

321
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,840
 Someone believes a conspiracy about that.

322
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,160
 And I talked about that on episode four or five, a long time ago.

323
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,600
 But the problem is, a lot of times it just pulls up criminal conspiracies.

324
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,920
 However, you can, into Google, not just, I shouldn't be specific, not just type it into

325
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:11,360
 a text file, you have to type it into a search engine, you can type anything blank satanic.

326
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,360
 Someone will believe it's satanic, oddly enough.

327
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,520
 No matter what you choose, if you put in laundry detergent satanic, I'm sure something

328
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,000
 will pop up.

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,720
 So when I typed in New Year's satanic, I found this old article.

330
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,320
 But then, oh man, I think I hit the jackpot here.

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,400
 Did you know, did you know that not only is New Year's Day satanic, but New Year's

332
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,280
 Resolutions is one of Satan's greatest weapons against humanity.

333
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,920
 So I'm gonna read from this article here.

334
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,520
 It starts off with a bombshell.

335
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,520
 It starts off with something that I always personally believed, but my mind was blown

336
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,120
 when I read this sentence.

337
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,160
 Here's the first sentence of this part.

338
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,280
 A society is not a chimney.

339
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,760
 Oh, what?

340
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,880
 I, oh man, I always compare society to a chimney.

341
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,680
 I, I was, I thought I was the only person who ever even saw the two connected in any

342
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 sort of way.

343
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,920
 But this guy, this guy knows, man.

344
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,120
 Society is not a chimney.

345
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
 You know what?

346
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,520
 According to this guy, a chimney is built of bricks.

347
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,480
 Okay.

348
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,560
 You stack up bricks one on top of the other, and at some point you have a chimney.

349
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,240
 I think you have to have a little more planning than that.

350
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,920
 I don't think you can just stack bricks up and you have a chimney.

351
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,800
 I think you have to design it and it has to be like a shape with a hollow tube through

352
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 it.

353
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,280
 But it's analogy, whatever.

354
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,400
 A society is not a chimney because a chimney is built of bricks.

355
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,640
 You stack one on another in any sort of random order with no design, whatever, and eventually

356
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,920
 becomes a chimney.

357
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,120
 But actually, no, I'm adding the but.

358
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,280
 He doesn't add the but.

359
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
 This is his quote.

360
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:03,680
 A society, in a way, is built up of spiritual bricks, i.e. resolutions.

361
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,880
 But doesn't that make it like a chimney if now it's built of bricks?

362
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,360
 He has this weird, it's almost like he's going by the most strict definition.

363
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,240
 Of the word resolution as possible.

364
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,840
 When people say, "Away, what's your resolution for the new year?"

365
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,600
 It's a goal.

366
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,760
 It's a decision you're making.

367
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,560
 We tend that they're good resolutions, but something to be like, "Oh, I'm just going

368
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,560
 to drink as much alcohol as I can tonight."

369
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
 That's my resolution.

370
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
 It's a goal.

371
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,200
 It's you're making a determination to do something.

372
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,680
 I'm resolved to do this.

373
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
 He goes into this whole thing.

374
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,080
 Think about the police forces, for example.

375
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,160
 A policeman has a uniform, a badge, often a firearm if he's lucky, or he could be in

376
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
 Britain.

377
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,840
 But what distinguishes a true policeman from a uniformed bandit?

378
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,720
 What happens when policemen abandon their resolution to serve and to protect?

379
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,040
 You gotta have both of those in there.

380
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,520
 They just can't serve.

381
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,680
 The material objects remain the same, the uniform, badge, pistol, but the spiritual

382
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,120
 brick shatters, crumbles, and disappears.

383
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,120
 What does any of this have to do with a new year's resolution?

384
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,640
 The title of this article that I'm reading from?

385
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,880
 New Year's Resolutions, A Satanic Plot?

386
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,440
 And I cut out where he spent the first third of the article.

387
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,120
 He came up with this weird mathematical formula to show what a resolution was.

388
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
 But anyways, so yes.

389
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,880
 But that's not when people say, "Oh, what's your resolution?

390
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,840
 Oh, my resolution is uphold the law, because I'm a police officer and that's my job."

391
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,160
 That's not what we think of when we think of a New Year's resolution.

392
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,240
 He then goes on to say stuff, "Think about banks.

393
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,760
 Do you think that the money in your bank is really inside a big vault with your name on

394
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,680
 a stack of dollar bills?

395
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,920
 If the bank decides to abandon their resolution to give you your money when you ask for it,

396
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
 you're broke."

397
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,440
 But that's not what people mean.

398
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,680
 Now, he goes on and on with all of these examples of it, but I gotta get to the meat of it.

399
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,440
 This is the section entitled, "How Does Satan Attack Resolutions?"

400
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,720
 There's no "I couldn't make this up."

401
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,960
 Satan doesn't have huge biceps or money or an army except for the millions of demons

402
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,360
 at his control.

403
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,840
 And I think Satan would be pretty fit.

404
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,560
 I don't think he'd be super lanky or incredibly fat.

405
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,120
 I think he'd probably have huge biceps, maybe not 33 inch pythons or anything, but I don't

406
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,720
 think he would be someone who you'd be like, "Man, you need to hit the gym, Lord of Hell."

407
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,120
 I think he would be pretty ripped.

408
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,400
 Satan doesn't have huge biceps, and he has all the money in the world if he's tied in

409
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,720
 with these Illuminati guys, but anyways, Satan doesn't have huge biceps or money or an army,

410
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,480
 but he's the owner of a kind of big marketing consulting firm.

411
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,040
 Satan is a liar, and the father of lies.

412
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,800
 I wonder who the mother is.

413
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,840
 I wonder if that's just a turn of phrase, or if it's supposed like, "He gave birth to

414
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
 lies."

415
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
 I guess the snake lied for the fruit.

416
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
 I don't know.

417
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,440
 Since Satan wants to destroy everything that is good in our society, he must attack the

418
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,880
 very substance of the spiritual bricks that make it up.

419
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:41,720
 Therefore Satan does everything he can to give bad publicity to good resolutions.

420
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:49,400
 One of Satan's favorite tricks is to throw dirt, throw a handful of dirt, on the reputation

421
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:57,160
 of resolutions using his famous New Year's Resolutions ad campaign.

422
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,480
 So I imagine Satan sitting down in hell, and he's like, "Oh man, humanity's been doing

423
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,920
 so good for the past 10,000 years.

424
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,960
 There haven't been any sort of wars.

425
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,600
 People aren't just murdering each other in the streets.

426
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,960
 There's no terrible diseases.

427
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,320
 If only I had some way to stir the pot up on Earth."

428
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,000
 He's like, "Nah, it's not good enough.

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
 What I need to do.

430
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,160
 What I need to do.

431
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,200
 We need to straight up madmen this.

432
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,560
 We need to get an ad campaign going."

433
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,160
 They're like, "Whoa, devil.

434
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
 Devil."

435
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,320
 He's like, "My name's Satan, dude.

436
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 Don't call me devil."

437
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
 Okay, Satan.

438
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 Satan.

439
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
 What?

440
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,640
 What do you think we should do?

441
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,160
 What do you release more Ebola?

442
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,960
 He's like, "Nah, it's child's play."

443
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
 You know what?

444
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,400
 I hear, have you guys ever heard of the term "spiritual bricks"?

445
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
 And they're like, "What now?"

446
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,080
 And Satan's like, "Me neither."

447
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,560
 But we should tear apart these things we've never heard of by starting a thing called

448
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,560
 New Year's Resolutions.

449
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,440
 The other demons are like, "Ooh, yeah.

450
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,760
 We could have these start during March between March and April."

451
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,440
 And Satan's like, "No, we have to do it the Satanic New Year, January 1st.

452
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
 What do you guys think?"

453
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,480
 And the demons are like, "Oh yeah, sorry."

454
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,040
 So Satan has set up the idea of New Year's Resolutions.

455
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,520
 And here's why.

456
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,760
 Back to this article, or leaving hell to back to this article.

457
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:25,600
 The poor, gullible suckers who bite this diabolical fish hook always bitterly repent afterwards.

458
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,000
 The New Year arrives and they are filled with good intentions, so they leap.

459
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Quick!

460
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,160
 I must run a marathon right away since I'm fat.

461
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,560
 That's me, no fat person ever says they have to run a marathon right away.

462
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,320
 And at the same time, I'll do my income tax return since I'm always late.

463
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,880
 And while I'm running with my computer and my bundles of invoices under one arm, I'll

464
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,240
 hold a paintbrush in my mouth and a canvas under the other, since I've been wanting to

465
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
 learn oil painting for years.

466
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,320
 What are the probabilities of success for such an endeavor?

467
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
 About zero.

468
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,200
 I would say that's beyond zero.

469
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,720
 You're fat, you're running a marathon, you're doing your taxes and you're trying to paint

470
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
 at the same time.

471
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
 But back to the article.

472
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,360
 But this is exactly what Satan wants.

473
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,320
 He wants people to take as few resolutions as possible and to take them as incorrectly

474
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:26,120
 as possible in conditions which practically guarantee their failure and especially that

475
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,520
 they create as many bad memories as possible.

476
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,320
 He didn't laugh in the article, that was me.

477
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,280
 Also apparently Satan, father of lies.

478
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,160
 And lord of the flies, it kind of rhymes.

479
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,120
 And has this huge demonic army and according to this guy isn't fit, but I'm sure he has

480
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,320
 at least a barbell set in hell.

481
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,840
 He has all this power, magic basically.

482
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,560
 He can be invisible, he can tempt people, but his main plan is having like whispering

483
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,640
 in people's ears, "You should lose weight."

484
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
 He'll never lose weight.

485
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,720
 But the problem with that is that what if the dude loses weight?

486
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,080
 And he's like, he goes about it the right way and says, "I'm fat, I should run a marathon.

487
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
 Next marathon's in eight months, I'm gonna do it."

488
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,880
 And Satan's like, "Dag, nab it!

489
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,560
 I should never whisper it in his ear to lose weight.

490
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,920
 Now I'll have to wait 60 years to capture his soul."

491
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,440
 But you know, again, it's one of those things, like this dude was reaching, he had to come

492
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,600
 up with such a strict definition of the word, I think he was working backwards.

493
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,520
 I think he was probably sitting there smoking the Christian equivalent of marijuana and

494
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,960
 thought, "Dude, what if New Year's resolutions are Satanic?"

495
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,560
 And then worked backwards to prove his point.

496
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,960
 That if I have such a strict version of the word resolution, then it's, New Year's resolutions

497
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
 are something you say you're gonna do and you're right, not a lot of people do it, but

498
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,720
 it doesn't create bad memories.

499
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,840
 You just go, "Oh yeah, I totally forgot I was supposed to learn how to play guitar this

500
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
 year."

501
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,800
 You don't sit around and cry about it.

502
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,640
 And to be fair, if it is part of Satan's plans, most people's New Year's resolutions

503
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,720
 are pretty self-serving.

504
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,400
 So you think that would work against Satan, because New Year's resolutions are stuff like,

505
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,200
 "I want to buy a house.

506
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,720
 I want more money.

507
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,640
 I want to lose weight so I can be more attractive to attract the opposite sex."

508
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,000
 That's all very, really kind of selfish.

509
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,960
 Not a lot of people do New Year's resolutions when they say, "I want to give more money

510
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
 to charity."

511
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,240
 Normally, it's something material and say it should be like, "Yeah, yeah, do it.

512
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,800
 Lose weight and buy that house.

513
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
 That's all that's important.

514
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,920
 Don't worry about your spiritual growth."

515
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
 Do it.

516
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,400
 You think it would be the opposite, but again, clever little trick.

517
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,240
 You want to find anything bizarre, just type in "blank Satan" or "blank Satanic" and you'll

518
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,480
 get stuff like this.

519
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,920
 The idea of Satan running a marketing firm, though, I just imagine him with one of those

520
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,640
 tripod things and you have the sheet of paper on it and you flip it over.

521
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,440
 He says of all night on these huge sheets of paper, writing down his marketing plans,

522
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,360
 and then he takes those into the office with all the other demons.

523
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,880
 He sets up the tripod, puts the big sheet of paper on it, and instantly he rubs it

524
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,720
 in flames and he's like, "Oh yeah, forgot I'm in hell."

525
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
 How would you have a marketing team in hell?

526
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,400
 What are their desks made of?

527
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,400
 I mean, everything would have to be stone.

528
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
 You can't have a computer down there.

529
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,800
 It's all on fire.

530
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,960
 Everything, I mean, all of your legal documents would be on like five miles of rock.

531
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,080
 Go walk three miles over that way, that's where the fine print is.

532
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,920
 I'd like to give this diet gotten a benefit of the doubt and not think that he actually

533
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:49,160
 meant that Satan ran an actual marketing firm, but or marketing campaign, whatever the term

534
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
 was.

535
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,120
 No, it says he's the owner of a kind of big marketing consulting firm, so maybe he

536
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,240
 has a bit of an outlook because he said kind of, but it's still, I just imagine it's a

537
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,800
 place called like Satan and Sons and you go in there and you go in there and you're like,

538
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,560
 this is my product tower we're going to sell in.

539
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
 Satan's like, "Discarded baby flesh."

540
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,000
 There's a market for that somewhere.

541
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
 He sells it to Avon.

542
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:23,440
 I just love the idea that God's eternal, apparently God's like spent the past 10,000

543
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,320
 years preparing for the final war between good and evil and Lucifer's down there making

544
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,640
 ad campaigns for IBM.

545
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,800
 I love that idea.

546
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,400
 I'm just imagining at some point in the future, Satan's going to be sitting there going over

547
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,240
 a pie chart that's made out of pebbles and seashells and then all of a sudden he's going

548
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,960
 to look up at his clock and go, "Oh wait, I forgot Armageddon's coming."

549
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,280
 And then just a bunch of angels show up and just lay waste to his entire empire.

550
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,640
 And Satan and Sons, that's just where I'm going to start getting all my marketing done

551
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
 from.

552
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,200
