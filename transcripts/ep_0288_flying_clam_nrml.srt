1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
 A creepy park in California makes people move to Arizona.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,880
 And then we travel to the year 1925, when four pilots out on a joy ride encounter a UFO.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,560
 But this UFO has a bite taken out of it, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,680
 I do have to make some corrections though, I know, I know, I never make mistakes.

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
 Every word is pronounced perfectly, but sometimes even I make a mistake.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,080
 First off, I was talking about people who had recently subscribed to my Patreon,

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,360
 and I think James Milne doesn't exist.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,040
 Person does not walk the face of the earth, it's James Milne.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,080
 So thank you for that correction and thank you for donating to the Patreon.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,960
 Secondly, yesterday's episode about the Casablanca entities, which is just, I love that episode,

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
 it's so weird.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,720
 I think Chop Top for recommending the story, he's a great guy, he does a lot of good stuff,

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,400
 doesn't exist, will exist, but Chop Top is a woman, so making that correction as well.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,080
 And one last correction regarding Casablanca entities, the story, spoiler alert,

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
 that story ends, I see the kid fell off the roof, landed on his head, the aliens went away,

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,680
 and then I just go on.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,440
 The kid's fine, I didn't, when I was editing it, I was like, "Oh should I add that?"

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,000
 The kid totally lived no brain damage or anything, he did fall off a house on land right on his head,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
 but he was fine.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,000
 That article, that story was originally printed in a newspaper in Riverside.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,880
 A reporter came out to the scene, documented everything, super bizarre story, and it's just

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,400
 been lost to history.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,920
 So yes, those are my corrections, kid survived, Chop Top is a woman, James Milne.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,960
 I won't have another correction thing, probably for another three months, I do them so rarely,

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
 but every so often stuff kind of pops up and I'm like, "I should have dressed those things."

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,840
 Let's go ahead and move on with our first story, and for our first story, guys, put on your backpacks.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,200
 We are joining up with Backpackerverse once more. Backpackerverse, if you're new to the show,

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,320
 it is a website that is dedicated to investigating the paranormal, and then just making stuff up.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,360
 It's garbage.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,640
 Ooh, there's a spooky tree in California, let's write a backstory about a spooky witch

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
 like killing 15 presidents and hanging their ghost road.

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
 They just make stuff up.

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,360
 And to add insult to double insult, now they've started a new thing.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,000
 Where not only do they make stuff up, but they make it seem like they have a team of dedicated

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,440
 paranormal investigators who go to these locations that aren't haunted.

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,480
 So it's one thing for you to just go on, sorry, it's Friday, it's rant, but there's actually

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,320
 a story here, but it's one thing to say, if you go to this graveyard at 3am, I've heard

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
 a ghost shows up, pulls your pants down.

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,320
 But then to tell me, and then I sent out my dedicated reporter, he went out to the graveyard

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,160
 and got his pants pulled down, I mean like that is a line too far.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,200
 We are going to Valencia Park, California.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,680
 And in Valencia Park, California, apparently there is some sort of horrible entity in this park.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
 Floating around in the darkness.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,160
 And I'm reading this article and the reporter, quote unquote, is I swear like a bot writes these

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,120
 things. This reporter though, C3PO, is saying there's a bunch of evil stuff that happens in

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,600
 this park. And then we segue into that I, my eyes bulged out of my head when I read this.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,120
 You guys might not find it as aggravating as I do.

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
 I'm just journalism major.

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,200
 Absolutely jaw dropping when I got to the sentence.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,160
 So it's going on and it's like Valencia Park, the legend has it that if you go through there

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,280
 and it's all spooky and spooky tree, then I get to this part.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,160
 A domain of evil it is, says a passing skateboarder and a pretty decent imitation of Yoda from

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,880
 Star Wars. Thanks because I thought that was Yoda from Friends.

56
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,720
 He's smiling, but then his face changes.

57
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
 In all seriousness dude, I wouldn't go there.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,160
 And I definitely wouldn't go there at night if you know what's good for you.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,080
 And I'm like, so you're telling me that you guys assigned a reporter to go to Valencia Park

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
 and they have a little notepad, a little hat, press pass on it and a skateboarder goes by

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,880
 and you're like, what do you think about Valencia Park and he's like a domain of evil it is?

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,920
 Now you guys may think I'm leaning a little too hard.

63
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,120
 Oh, let me finish this skateboarder story because that's not, that's not dumb enough.

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
 Again, they're making it up, which is always this weird thing because they make it up and

65
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
 then they just stop halfway through.

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,200
 This is the story the skateboarder tells this reporter, this intrepid journalist

67
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,400
 who travels to Valencia Park to look at a spooky tree.

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
 Skateboarder tells the story.

69
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,080
 So my friends went into the woods one night.

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,160
 They shouldn't have and I didn't go because I'm smarter than that.

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,520
 So I'm like outside just hanging out skateboarding around perfecting my impression of Yoda.

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,560
 And my friends came running out and they said there was a bunch of bats, but not just bats.

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,040
 Bats with the faces of humans.

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,880
 Now, I don't know if it's just me, but that's not a particularly scary thing because they're

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,680
 still tiny.

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,640
 Basically by saying the bats had the faces of humans, it's the equivalent of saying bats had

77
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,080
 the faces of babies.

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,640
 Like yes, if I walked home one day and there was a bat with the face of a baby floating around

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,560
 my apartment, it'd be shocking, but it wouldn't describe what happens next because they said

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
 they went into Valencia Park.

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
 They got attacked by bats with the faces of babies.

82
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,720
 And then the skateboarders, one of the skateboarders friends.

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,160
 Okay, here's what he says.

84
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,000
 "My friends, my friends came away crying and it wasn't too long after that

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
 that one of them moved away to Phoenix.

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
 I haven't heard anything from him since."

87
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
 So he just moved.

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,240
 "Is that where you go to hide?"

89
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,720
 Again, if you're making it up, and I feel like I'm being a dead horse and maybe you guys

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,840
 are aggravated by this, but if you're making it up, not if you're being a dead horse,

91
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,800
 I'm being a dead horse.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,040
 If you're making it up, why is your twist ending that your teenage friend moved to Phoenix

93
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
 and you lost touch with him?

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,720
 That's your twist ending?

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
 Bats with human faces.

96
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
 That's a good fable.

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
 That's a good made up thing.

98
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,720
 And then he moved away to Arizona and was never heard from again by me.

99
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,840
 He was heard from by other people in Phoenix, but me myself, I've never heard from him since.

100
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,920
 Why is that a twist ending?

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,280
 But our intrepid- Oh, and let me say this too.

102
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,640
 Let me say this too.

103
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,720
 I know I bring backpacker verse up a lot, but this is what I gotta deal with.

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
 This is the type of stuff I have to deal with.

105
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,680
 I'm constantly running into ghost stories and paranormal stories.

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
 I have to cross-reference it because I find out that it's not true.

107
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,160
 And you can say Jason, just stay away from backpacker verse.

108
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,320
 Backpacker verse, as I was researching this, they have a story about two stoners who hotbox

109
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
 Bigfoot.

110
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
 And it's not even Bigfoot.

111
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,520
 It's some guy, this, there's a guy named, there's not, there's not.

112
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,680
 But backpacker verse says that there is a Bigfoot who has no neck.

113
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
 And instead of a neck, it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger's chest.

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
 He's like this big muscle bound.

115
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,640
 He's a normal Bigfoot.

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,800
 But from like the ears down to his shoulders, it's all muscle.

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 He's called the Meathead of Sycamore Park.

118
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,720
 So I saw that.

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,920
 I saw that at like 1230 last night and I went, "Damn it."

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,360
 So then I'm having to Google Meathead of Sycamore Park for 15 minutes.

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,800
 Seeing if there's any other reference, there's not, there's not totally made up.

122
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
 A new monster, a new cryptid.

123
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
 Meathead of Sycamore Park.

124
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
 Two stoners are smoking weed.

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,680
 And Meathead walks over to them and sits down.

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,960
 Oh and this one also involved a reporter talking to a stoner.

127
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,240
 He's like, "Hey dude."

128
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
 And anyways, Meathead, Meathead of Sycamore Park sits down.

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
 They have a drawing of it by the way too.

130
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,440
 That's how far they're willing to go with their nonsense.

131
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
 You're sitting there smoking weed and Meathead is just sitting there.

132
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,040
 That's the end of the story.

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,720
 He doesn't even smoke.

134
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,480
 But again, I have to cross-reference this nonsense.

135
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,480
 So like I always like to do, I don't like to just rant on back,

136
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,600
 I do like to rant on back, back, reverse, but not just that.

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,120
 I always try to find a true ghost story for the area that they're making stuff up.

138
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
 Because one, I don't want to just tell a ridiculous story.

139
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,400
 And two, I want to show how if with a little more research they could have actually told a

140
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,760
 legit ghost story.

141
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,160
 We're going to go an hour and a half north of Valencia Park,

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,360
 which is in like Southern California.

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
 We're going to go an hour and a half north.

144
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
 We're going to Mount Ruby though.

145
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,360
 It's a mountain that has a giant cross on the top that somebody put up there.

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
 It didn't magically appear, of course somebody put it up there, but it's a giant cross on

147
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,760
 top of a mountain.

148
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
 And if you go up the mountain, there's a little fake.

149
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,160
 You know, the Jesus died and they put him in a cave and they rolled a big old rock in front of it.

150
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,480
 So anyways, if you go up by this giant cross, there's a tomb.

151
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,520
 It's this little Jesus tomb and there's a picture of Jesus.

152
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
 Not a picture, it'd be a picture.

153
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,640
 There's a picture of Jesus painted on the rock, which sounds bizarre,

154
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,920
 which sounds totally bizarre.

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,600
 Like you travel this pilgrimage up the mountain and you're going to go visit Jesus' fake tomb

156
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,120
 and then there's a one foot tall Jesus picture of Jesus waving at you.

157
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,600
 Now that place is known to our rumor to have a cult activity, which you're kind of asking

158
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,720
 for it if you have a fake tomb of Jesus and animal sacrifices, all sorts of stuff that goes

159
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
 on with wilderness areas that are kind of butting up against civilization, but far enough way.

160
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,720
 All those urban legends, but we have some particular ones here.

161
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
 Again, this is only an hour and a half away that could have easily moved the skateboarding

162
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
 kid here and be like, "Dude, you won't believe what was happening."

163
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,960
 A tomb of Jesus it is.

164
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,080
 Apparently, according to reports, Jesus haunts this mountain.

165
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,200
 People have seen Jesus' ghost on Mount Rubido.

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
 So let me ask you this.

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
 Where will you have a choice now?

168
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
 Here's your choice.

169
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,400
 You can smoke weed with the...

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,480
 What was his name again?

171
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,120
 Meathead.

172
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
 You can smoke weed with the meathead bigfoot.

173
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
 You can fight bats with the faces of babies and then...

174
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,000
 But then you have to move to Phoenix, Arizona or you can meet Jesus' ghost.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,960
 And before you go, "Hey, I'm an atheist.

176
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,800
 I don't believe in Jesus' ghost."

177
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
 You're like arguing with them.

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
 He's like all getting frustrated.

179
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
 He's like, "Do I have to show you the wounds?

180
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
 Do I have to show you the wounds?"

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
 Even better.

182
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,640
 Even better.

183
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,080
 Let me throw a little more.

184
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
 So you got Jesus' ghost, smoking weed with...

185
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,280
 I can't go on my Heathcliff for some reason.

186
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,960
 Smoking weed with the giant fat cat slash the meathead.

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,440
 Bats chasing you, human faces, move to Phoenix.

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,280
 But Mount Rubido, for you people who don't believe in Jesus' out there,

189
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,360
 even though his ghost is floating behind you,

190
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,520
 it's also been known that if you walk on the trails up there,

191
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,080
 sometimes you'll turn around and there will be piles of rocks behind you.

192
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,160
 Like three rocks stacked on top of each other.

193
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
 Jesus, he's getting low.

194
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,160
 He's moving rocks.

195
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
 He's moving rocks.

196
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,040
 I don't know if that's Jesus' ghost.

197
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,960
 This next one I doubt is...

198
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,680
 There's another...

199
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,320
 I doubt it.

200
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,720
 Who knows?

201
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,440
 There's another legend on Mount Rubido that if you're walking on the trails,

202
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,520
 sometimes pebbles...

203
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,880
 I like the escalation here.

204
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
 You're walking on the trail, right?

205
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,160
 Your feet are walking.

206
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,400
 It's been known that the spirits of the mountain

207
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,960
 will throw pebbles, rocks, or boulders at you as you're walking the trail.

208
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,520
 Now you may say, Jason, that's normally what happens when you're walking in the mountains.

209
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,960
 Pebbles and boulders and rocks come after you.

210
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,320
 And that's true.

211
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,360
 That's called gravity.

212
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
 It's not really a ghost.

213
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,520
 They can be replicated anywhere on the planet.

214
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,440
 You can replicate it on your table right now.

215
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
 Go get some rocks, boulders, and pebbles.

216
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,400
 Start rolling them around your house.

217
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,240
 Doesn't mean there's a ghost there.

218
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,760
 Or doesn't.

219
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,400
 But apparently though, if you walk up here,

220
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
 rock piles appear behind you.

221
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,680
 Rocks follow you.

222
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
 Rocks don't follow you.

223
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
 They crush you.

224
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,440
 And then to add to the total awareness of this story,

225
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,920
 just to get...

226
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,240
 This...

227
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,840
 This has almost become its own segment,

228
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,440
 because this mountain seems to just be infused with high strangeness.

229
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,400
 To be fair though, all the rest of these incidents I got off of

230
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,160
 comments from a website about Mount Rubido,

231
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
 whether or not it was haunted.

232
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
 And people were like...

233
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,400
 Some of the comments were like,

234
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
 "I live by the mountain. It's not haunted."

235
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
 One person commented,

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
 "I live in the mountain. It's not haunted."

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,360
 And people were like,

238
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,280
 "What are you? Gollum?"

239
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,640
 People said,

240
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,080
 "I read a story about a guy..."

241
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,760
 I don't know if there's something in the water around this mountain.

242
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,280
 But all of these comments in this forum about Mount Rubido,

243
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,920
 it was like reading a David Lynn screenplay.

244
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
 One guy tells a story.

245
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,160
 He goes,

246
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,960
 "This guy fell and he got stuck in a rock.

247
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,200
 And he was stuck there for days."

248
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,400
 And then a woman hiking smelled something.

249
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,080
 So I'm like,

250
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,920
 "Oh, so the guy fell into the rock, died, and started to decay."

251
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,000
 And then it goes on to say,

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,280
 "A man and his dog found the man.

253
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,080
 The man and the dog got an award."

254
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,960
 What is going on?

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
 I'm like,

256
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
 "What? How does that..."

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,400
 So from what I'm getting from that sequence of events,

258
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,720
 man falls into a rock.

259
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,640
 And the terminology,

260
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,600
 if I remember correctly,

261
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,560
 is into the rock.

262
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,840
 But I'm assuming like,

263
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
 it pinned in by rock.

264
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,720
 Jesus pushed into boulder,

265
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,760
 got the guy all crushed.

266
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,280
 He's trapped between a rock and a hard place.

267
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,560
 A woman walks by,

268
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
 smells his decaying/still living

269
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,280
 but poop filled pants smell, leaves.

270
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,400
 And then a guy and his dog later comes,

271
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,640
 "Dog gets an award."

272
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,600
 Man gets an award too,

273
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
 but that's not news.

274
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,920
 The dog getting an award like Chewbacca is just brilliant.

275
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,960
 I love that.

276
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,960
 Then some guy says that his mother-

277
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,200
 his mother-in-law-

278
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,840
 his in-laws were on a vacation to Mount Ruby-Dough.

279
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,120
 And they were there late at night.

280
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,640
 And his mother-in-law is in a photo.

281
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,880
 Here's the description of the photo here.

282
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,840
 It's a photo of a man-

283
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,760
 it's a photo of his mother-in-law, right?

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,520
 Not a man, photo of his mother-in-law.

285
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,400
 But in the background,

286
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,880
 you see two transparent people.

287
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,920
 And it goes on to say,

288
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
 here, I'll read this to you.

289
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,160
 It says,

290
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
 this is his comment.

291
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
 Right next to her,

292
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,400
 there were two people sitting next to her-

293
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,320
 that's- I'm actually reading it.

294
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,800
 Next to her,

295
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
 there were two people sitting next to her,

296
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,840
 and they were transparent.

297
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
 Or see-through.

298
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,920
 Thank you for-

299
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,600
 thank you for clarifying that.

300
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,880
 Or see-through.

301
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,480
 One was an overweight male wearing a t-shirt,

302
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,640
 and you can even see a design on his shirt.

303
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,960
 Thought he was transparent.

304
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
 But apparently,

305
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,640
 you can see that he's wearing a third-eye blind shirt.

306
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,520
 The other was a female with her legs bended.

307
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,280
 Okay.

308
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,520
 And I'm assuming she's sitting down,

309
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,360
 but I've- I-

310
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,000
 all bets are off.

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,720
 The other was a female with her legs bended,

312
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,440
 and it appears she's trying to scare people.

313
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
 [laughs]

314
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,080
 It appears she's trying to scare people

315
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,920
 by removing her face.

316
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,760
 And you can see her skeletal face.

317
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,080
 Don't believe me?

318
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,960
 Well, if only you knew me,

319
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,840
 then both you and new are misspelled, by the way.

320
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,160
 Well, only if you knew me,

321
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
 I can show you the pic,

322
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,880
 and I would have loved to show it

323
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,960
 to a paranormal team to see what they think.

324
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,040
 So- so there you go.

325
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,080
 There are your choices.

326
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,640
 You can.

327
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,480
 Hot box with meathead.

328
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
 Move to Arizona,

329
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,560
 'cause a bat.

330
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
 Or...

331
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
 all that stuff.

332
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
 Jesus pushes a boulder after you.

333
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
 You get crushed by a rock.

334
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,880
 And then, uh, you die in an embarrassing shirt,

335
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,840
 but then you don't die,

336
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,560
 you get rescued,

337
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,840
 and a dog wins an award.

338
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,600
 That was a little journey

339
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,480
 through the paranormal parts of California,

340
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,640
 including the made-up ones from Backpackerverse.

341
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,840
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

342
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,560
 Our next story is true,

343
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,160
 as far as the fact is somebody has said it's true.

344
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,920
 So, let's go back in time.

345
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,200
 So, let's go back in time to the year 1959.

346
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,120
 An old man pulls out a piece of paper,

347
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,240
 and he grabs a pen,

348
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,440
 he grabs like a quill,

349
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,040
 quill with a little thing, ink,

350
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
 and he dips it.

351
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
 He licks the end of it,

352
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,880
 he's like, "Mmm, delicious ink."

353
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,520
 He's like, "I'm supposed to do that in reverse order,

354
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,320
 but whatever.

355
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 I'm addicted to blue ink."

356
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
 He's writing it down,

357
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
 he's writing the letter,

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,280
 he's like, "Shh."

359
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,720
 My name, "Shh."

360
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
 It's Don Wood Jr.

361
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,880
 "Shh."

362
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,680
 And I'm gonna write you this story,

363
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,800
 he's writing it down.

364
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,960
 And then he writes the whole letter out,

365
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,080
 he folds it up,

366
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,280
 licks the envelope,

367
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,400
 puts the stamp on it,

368
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
 drops it in the mail.

369
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,600
 He's waving goodbye to the mailman

370
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,800
 as the letter is being taken,

371
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,000
 'cause he knows this letter will change his life.

372
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,880
 He wrote this letter to Flying Saucers Magazine.

373
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
 So, you're like,

374
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,960
 "What is this old man writing this letter to this,

375
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
 to this magazine?"

376
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
 Well, that is the question I am here to answer for you.

377
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,920
 A question you didn't even ask.

378
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,120
 You know why he wrote it,

379
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,000
 I'm assuming you know.

380
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
 So, he was writing a story,

381
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
 he's telling them a story, right?

382
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,440
 But not a fictional story.

383
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
 It wasn't his fan fiction,

384
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,800
 where he's like hanging out with Johnny Rocket,

385
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,240
 or whatever they had back then.

386
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,840
 Lost in space.

387
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,720
 Anyways, anyways, Johnny Rocket's writing fan fiction.

388
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
 He's like, "Someday I'll be a manager of Johnny Rocket."

389
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,560
 I can't wait.

390
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,920
 By the way, I saw UFO.

391
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,880
 So, he writes this letter to Flying Saucers Magazine.

392
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,040
 And the letter tells this story.

393
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,080
 Quite fascinating story.

394
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,200
 The year is 1925.

395
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,280
 And recreational flying had become a thing.

396
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
 So, you had all of these surplus planes after World War I.

397
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,560
 All these biplanes and stuff.

398
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,400
 So, Don Wood Jr. and three other pilots said,

399
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,280
 "You know what?

400
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,000
 There's this place called Battle Mountain,

401
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
 which is a giant mason.

402
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,640
 It's like 5,000 square feet wide on the top.

403
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,560
 But the walls are really too steep to climb,

404
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,320
 unless you're really, really good at climbing,

405
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
 and have the right equipment."

406
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,120
 He said, "Let's go fly our planes out to Battle Mountain.

407
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,000
 Hang out.

408
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
 Have a picnic."

409
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
 I don't know.

410
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,560
 I mean, let's be honest.

411
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,280
 These guys are going to fly out in their private planes,

412
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
 their private little biplanes,

413
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
 land at Battle Mountain,

414
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
 and talk about planes for like two hours,

415
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,800
 and then fly away.

416
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,320
 Same thing when you go to a car show.

417
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,400
 All people do is talk about cars.

418
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
 You never go to a car show and you're like,

419
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,600
 "Hey, have you seen Avengers Endgame?"

420
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,800
 They're like, "Oh yeah, man.

421
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,920
 This Hemmy dude, V8, break pads,

422
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,760
 and this look at the steering wheel."

423
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,560
 Like, they just talk about stuff all the time.

424
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,400
 But that's what they were going to do.

425
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,120
 They were going to fly,

426
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,680
 and they were just going to talk about planes on a mason.

427
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
 And then they would fly home,

428
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,040
 and they're like, "Oh, those planes are pretty cool, right?

429
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,880
 V8s, break pads."

430
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,560
 So whatever.

431
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,080
 They can have those conversations anywhere,

432
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,200
 which is what I'm trying to say.

433
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,040
 But anyway, and it's probably beautiful,

434
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,080
 it's scenic, and all that stuff.

435
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,320
 But anyway, so they're flying their planes.

436
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
 They land on the mason.

437
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,560
 [imitates plane sound]

438
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,720
 That's the sound of the tires screaming.

439
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,600
 That just wasn't like a seagull or some weird bird.

440
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,800
 [imitates plane sound]

441
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,760
 And the planes are like,

442
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,680
 and then the one guy's plane wouldn't stop,

443
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,040
 and they're like, "No, Johnny, no."

444
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,120
 And it's like, "Oh, no, that didn't happen.

445
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,080
 That didn't have an O."

446
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,360
 But it would have been exciting.

447
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,640
 We'll pretend that it did.

448
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
 But anyway, so eventually they save Johnny,

449
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
 the planes teetering on the edge of the mason.

450
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,560
 Huge thing.

451
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,720
 They save them, and then they talk about planes.

452
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,560
 But while they're sitting there,

453
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
 this part's exciting.

454
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,720
 This part's real.

455
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
 I don't know why I added that fake part.

456
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,920
 This part's exciting.

457
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
 They're sitting there, and they're looking off the distance,

458
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,480
 and they're like, "What?

459
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,520
 Intarnation?"

460
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,240
 And they see something approaching the mason as well.

461
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
 Now, obviously, they think it's some sort of aircraft.

462
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,520
 Because what else is flying that high?

463
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,640
 They're standing there, and what happens is they see it,

464
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
 and it looks like a saucer.

465
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
 Now, this is in 19--

466
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
 He's writing the letter in 1959,

467
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,560
 and a lot of people go,

468
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
 "This took place in 1925."

469
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,640
 They didn't know what flying saucers were back then.

470
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,680
 True, but he's writing it in 1959.

471
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,840
 So just don't get your hopes up.

472
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,400
 I think the story's probably true in some aspect,

473
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
 but I just think it's interesting.

474
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
 A lot of the stuff is like,

475
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,800
 "How could he know what a flying saucer?"

476
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
 Because he wrote it after flying saucer--

477
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
 But he wrote it to Flying Saucer Magazine, obviously.

478
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,760
 But back then, let's assume that he doesn't know

479
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,640
 what a flying saucer is.

480
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,360
 Let's assume the story is true from beginning to end.

481
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
 And, you know, so we'll get into whether or not it's true

482
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,920
 in the end.

483
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,520
 But the UFO, he sees a saucer coming down.

484
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
 And he says it's about eight foot in diameter,

485
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
 and it's coming down and it hits the mesa,

486
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,240
 and then kind of skips up and then goes,

487
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,800
 "Pfft, pfft," kind of scrapes across the mesa.

488
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,440
 And they're like, "Having flashback to Johnny's event."

489
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
 The thing eventually skids to a stop.

490
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
 Dust.

491
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,880
 So the pilots don't get super close to it,

492
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
 but they get close enough

493
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,920
 because they want to know what that was.

494
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
 And it's sitting on the mesa with them.

495
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
 So they start walking over.

496
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,920
 And this is where Don Wood, when he's writing this letter,

497
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,720
 he's like, "Basically everything from the point on

498
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,520
 "in this letter, even he admits, is really, really hard

499
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,920
 "to believe."

500
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
 Because again, by the time he's writing it,

501
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,720
 UFO sightings are a thing, enough that there's a magazine

502
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,520
 about it.

503
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,360
 And he goes, "What I noticed first was that the UFO

504
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
 "was breathing."

505
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,800
 He says, "You could see the top and the, you could see it

506
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,120
 "basically expand and contract, like someone was laying down

507
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
 "and they were breathing."

508
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,120
 He goes, "Secondly, there would be like..."

509
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,320
 He described it as like a clam opening up at part of it.

510
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,120
 Like in that, reinforce the idea that it was breathing.

511
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
 You would see like little mouth opening.

512
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
 Go, "Hah."

513
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
 "Hah."

514
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
 But they didn't hear anything.

515
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
 I just had to do that for dramatic effect.

516
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
 But they're watching it open and close.

517
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
 And thirdly, it had a bite taken out of it.

518
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,120
 So they're looking at the UFO and it looks like there is a good

519
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,120
 chunk removed from part of it.

520
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,120
 And not like it had any sort of like crash damage from crashing.

521
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,120
 They said it was leaking this metal foam, this metallic like

522
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,120
 foam, which is kind of bubbling out of where this wound was.

523
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
 Which made them think, "Blood."

524
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
 Again, not like when a vehicle crashes, you just have wreckage.

525
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
 They said they saw this foam coming out of it.

526
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,120
 They got the sense that it wasn't damaged, but it was hurt.

527
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
 It seemed to almost be in a...

528
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,120
 Like if you saw a panicked injured animal as opposed to a vehicle

529
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
 like leaking fuel.

530
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
 They said it continually tried to like lift off and then would land again.

531
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
 And then lift off and land again.

532
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,120
 Like when I say lift off like a couple feet, it's like a bee.

533
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,120
 Like an injured bee. Again, everything they were seeing were making them think it was some sort of injured animal.

534
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
 So again, if this story took place in 1925 and is true,

535
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,120
 when they have no idea of what flying saucers are,

536
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,120
 they wouldn't go, "Well, that's weird. Flying saucers have grey aliens in them.

537
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,120
 They're just looking at this anomaly on this mesa, just these four men."

538
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,120
 And after about 20 minutes, it began to glow incredibly bright

539
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
 because it did have like a metallic sheen to it.

540
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
 And it started to lift off again.

541
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
 [exhaling]

542
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
 Fell back down.

543
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,120
 Now, they don't know what to do. They're petrified. They've never seen anything like it.

544
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,120
 And even if you thought this is an injured animal, I can help it.

545
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
 It...

546
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,120
 If you saw an injured deer, you would be foolish to be like, "Oh, come here, little deer."

547
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
 Because it's probably gonna kick you in the face.

548
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
 If it has antlers, you're getting gourd.

549
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,120
 Like, you know what I mean? Like, you could see an animal that looks safe

550
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
 and try to care for it and get injured.

551
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,120
 This is an 8-foot insurconference clam monster that you've never seen before.

552
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
 You're not gonna walk up to him and be like, "Well, how are you doing, Billy?"

553
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 Like, throwing water on it and stuff. You're gonna keep your distance.

554
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,120
 But it's at that point, the men are standing there, the clam standing there,

555
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,120
 and then a shadow appears on all of them.

556
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,120
 They all look up. Clam doesn't look up, but all the humans look up.

557
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
 Oh, and also he said he didn't have any feet, didn't have any eyes.

558
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,120
 Just look like a clam, but it looked like also two saucers put together on top of each other,

559
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
 like a normal flying saucer.

560
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
 This giant shadow appears over them. They look up.

561
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:03,120
 And there is another creature, a UFO/flying clam type thing, 30 feet insurconference.

562
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,120
 It's coming down from the sky.

563
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:16,120
 And four, like, tendril-tongue suction cup things shoot out of it, latch on to the little guy,

564
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
 and then start to lift him up.

565
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,120
 And they said that the giant craft became so bright, they couldn't even look at it.

566
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,120
 So they start looking away, and then it's gone.

567
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,120
 They look up. The light goes away, they look up, it's gone.

568
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,120
 He said within a second it was out of sight.

569
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,120
 He said he would have been traveling a thousand miles an hour to move that quickly to get out of the way.

570
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
 And now they feel free to explore the mesa.

571
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
 So they start talking about planes.

572
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
 Now they're like, oh, we gotta figure out what it was.

573
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,120
 They go over to where the injured one was, and that foam that was pouring out of the wound

574
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 started turning into what they described as aluminum wire, and then it just started to dissolve into nothingness.

575
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,120
 And they said there was a horrible stench where it was as well.

576
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,120
 Now, he says that that happened in 1920--they all got in their planes, they flew away.

577
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
 Totally scared.

578
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,120
 But he says that happened in 1925, and he never told anybody because he didn't want to be a lunatic.

579
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,120
 And when he wrote the letter into the magazine, he said, "Don't use my real name,

580
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,120
 but you can write me back if you want additional information."

581
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:33,120
 And, and assume in the original draft, in the original issue of Flying Software magazine,

582
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
 they didn't use his real name.

583
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,120
 We know his real name now because other researchers have gone back and said, at the time, around the time,

584
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,120
 did write him back and say, "Can you tell us the story?"

585
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,120
 And the story was pretty much the same when he talked to these other investigators.

586
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,120
 What's interesting about this story is it is pretty much buried in the UFOology.

587
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,120
 Like, even at the time, like, I was reading a book that was referencing this story,

588
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,120
 and they're like, nobody wants to talk about this story because it goes against what we think UFOs are.

589
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,120
 If you believe in UFOs, this is one of the earliest modern UFO sightings.

590
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,120
 It beats the sighting in 1947, which kind of started the whole UFO flap.

591
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
 It beats that by 22 years.

592
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
 So, why isn't it more well known?

593
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,120
 It's because it makes UFOs not alien constructions from another planet.

594
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
 It opens up a whole new can of worms.

595
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,120
 And Don Wood Jr. said, "If you saw one of these at night, you'd just see a bright light in the sky."

596
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,120
 I've always had the theory that basically there is a veil of high strangeness all over the place,

597
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,120
 and you see what your mind is capable of seeing.

598
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,120
 So, somebody who doesn't believe in Bigfoot but is super religious,

599
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,120
 if they go to an area that has some sort of paranormal event,

600
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,120
 I'm not gonna say they're gonna see a seven foot tall hairy Jesus walking through the woods,

601
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,120
 but they may have a rhythm which would be hilarious.

602
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
 They may have a religious experience there.

603
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
 They may have some sort of Buddhist awakening or something like that.

604
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:08,120
 If a someone who believes in Bigfoot went to that mesa, would they have seen a Bigfoot-related thing?

605
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,120
 It's a really interesting thing because they saw what they could comprehend.

606
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,120
 We were just achieving flight as humans in 1925.

607
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,120
 So for them to see a metallic spaceship crash,

608
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,120
 and then another spaceship come and take that spaceship away,

609
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,120
 and have sparks shooting out of it, plasma,

610
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,120
 all that stuff would be fairly alien in 19-20.

611
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,120
 Well, not no pun intended, but fairly alien in 1925.

612
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,120
 But seeing a giant clam bleed, and then another clam show up to save it,

613
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
 it's a little more reasonable, right?

614
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
 It has a biological purpose.

615
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,120
 But it could have been a UFO, but you just can't comprehend that back then.

616
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,120
 The universe may only give you as much as you can actually comprehend.

617
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,120
 It's weird to think about that, because I do think there is a limit.

618
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,120
 A caveman is not going to see a bunch of buttons and dials in a UFO.

619
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,120
 If you go on this line, a caveman, if you put him in a UFO, he's not going to be like,

620
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
 "What? Transwarp drive?"

621
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,120
 He's going to go in and he's going to see a bunch of gods sitting in a golden throne with eight arms,

622
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,120
 pressing not buttons, I just said there's no buttons, moving icons.

623
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,120
 That's the only way their brain could understand what's going on.

624
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,120
 Humans will see a biological entity sitting in a very, very high-tech room today.

625
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
 That's what we'll see today.

626
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,120
 It's always, it never blows your mind, if you see what I'm saying.

627
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
 It never blows your mind.

628
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 So is there a connection between the consciousness and the imagination of the human

629
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,120
 encountering the event and the event itself?

630
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:03,120
 And if there is, it really creates the idea that every paranormal unexplained event is connected by some sort of ether.

631
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,120
 Bigfoot's UFOs, ghosts, cryptids.

632
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:16,120
 It depends on the time and the place and the person viewing it, but it's all pulling from the same source.

633
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:26,120
 There may not be any intergalactic empires or dimensions full of the dead or monsters lurking in the darkness.

634
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:33,120
 What it may be is a veil that every so often someone peeks behind it,

635
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,120
 and they're seeing a understandable portion of what's behind that veil.

636
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,120
 Our brains make it into what we can comprehend.

637
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:57,120
 And that begs the question, what happens if someday the veil falls and our reality and that unreality collide?

638
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:06,120
 It would be insanity, because right now we're just getting little peaks at this other reality.

639
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:16,120
 But if we were confronted with the full force of it, it wouldn't be flying clams or grey aliens.

640
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,120
 It would be things that we couldn't comprehend.

641
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:32,120
 The safety mechanism that protects our brain would be gone, and we would see nothing but true cosmic horror.
