1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 Is it true that there is a phone app out there that can make you a powerful psychic?

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:15,200
 And then we travel to Virginia City in Nevada to take a tour of a haunted art center.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:24,160
 Is it true that by day old women paint things, but at night bloody chains appear hanging

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:34,960
 from the walls today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,680
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are staying warm,

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,560
 all my listeners in the United States. I don't know why all of a sudden I kind of

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,720
 pronounce the word "united" and I see in the future civil civil war incoming?

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,280
 We'll talk about seeing the future. There's no civil war coming from those of you who got

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,400
 worried instantly, but we'll talk about the fact that I can see the future now.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,360
 But before we get into all of that, first off because it's winter themed because everyone's

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,640
 chilly, everyone has a witch of Parkinson. In comes one of our legacy patreons. He's dressed like a

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,560
 penguin. He's sliding on his belly into Dead Rabbit Command. It is Jimmy Moore. Everyone give a round of

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
 applause to Jimmy Moore. He's a long time listener of the show. He's been around forever. Jimmy,

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,760
 we really appreciate your support. As he waddles in. Little penguin outfit. You're going to be our

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,760
 captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys happen to be

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,800
 humans, that's okay too. Just helps rid the word about the show. Really, really, really helps out

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,000
 a lot. Talk about it online. Talk about it in person. Get the word out. Jimmy, I want to talk to you

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,800
 the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,120
 to Wall Street. Jason Jalopy is driving on the road. I'm going to take this as an opportunity

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,800
 as well. It's Friday. So you guys got the weekend. I wanted to say this. I've been doing really good

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,080
 on my 90 days to a better you challenge because I'm doing it as well obviously. And to those of

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,000
 you who are still trying to figure things out or have already started doing things, this is an

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,160
 interesting way to look at this. What do you really want to do? See, the last time I did a 90

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
 days to a better you challenge, I was focused on losing weight. I was looking at that scale, that

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,760
 number on that scale. Trying to make that number go down. But that's not really what I wanted.

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,920
 It's not really what I wanted. I wanted to be healthy. I wanted to be fit. So you know what I

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,640
 did? I actually took my scale and I took the batteries out. I put it in the closet and I'm

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,080
 gauging my 90 days by how much weight I'm lifting. And the gains have been amazing.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,840
 Just in the past couple weeks, I'm reusing that old muscle that I built up in high school and

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,800
 college when I was seriously lifting weights. I thought I wanted to be thinner, but I want to

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,920
 be stronger and healthier and fit. And then the weight loss comes from that. So it's very important

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,240
 to look at what you actually want. If I dropped down to 220 pounds, yeah, I'd be fine. I would look

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,760
 good, but I want to be strong. And because that's what I really want, those gains are just piling

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,360
 on top of each other. So think about what your real end goal is. I for years wrote, I was an

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,600
 author for years and years and years and was writing and putting this stuff out. I couldn't

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,840
 keep my production schedules up. It turns out I didn't want to be a writer. I wanted to be a

38
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,920
 storyteller. As a child, I wanted to be a director. As an adult, I wanted to write. I've written

39
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,160
 scripts. I've written books. I've written short stories, all sorts of stuff. But I wanted to be

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,800
 a storyteller. And once I realized that and I started doing this podcast where I tell two stories a

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,520
 day, 10 stories a week with cool little sci-fi twists at the end of the episodes, this is what

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,160
 I wanted to do. And once I realized that I wanted to be a storyteller, it didn't matter what the

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,480
 medium was, I wanted to tell stories to people. Everything fell into place. So if you are thinking,

44
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,320
 I want to be a rock and roll guitarist, is that what you really want or do you want to be in the

45
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:25,280
 music industry? You know what I mean? Think about what your true motivation is that might help you

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,280
 click. And this goes past the 90 days to a better you challenge. This could be something that opens

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,800
 up whole new gateways for you. So think about that. Think about what you really want to do.

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,360
 Because once I stopped worrying about that needle on the scale and started worrying about the

49
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,800
 weights being attached and just lifting heavy, I can't wait to work out. I can't wait to see how

50
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:54,960
 strong I am now. Think about what your end result is and that will help you become a better you.

51
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,240
 90 day challenge and beyond. Wanted to get those words, hopefully those motivated you,

52
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,440
 those words motivated you. Jimmy Moore is coming out of the car, he's lifting weights,

53
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,080
 his little penguin arms lifting weights. Go for it, go for it. But we also got to go to Wall

54
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,600
 Street. So Jimmy Moore is back in the Jason Jalaphy and we are on the way. Maybe we'll get him a little,

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,560
 maybe we'll weigh down the steering wheel. So as he's steering it, it's like lifting weights.

56
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,520
 It's also super hard to drive. The reason why we're headed to Wall Street is because I want to

57
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,640
 talk about this app that I talked about a while ago. It's a couple episodes ago. I mentioned the

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,080
 40 in map and I mentioned this app called the remote viewing tournament. I think it was last

59
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,920
 week or the week before, I said, "Hey, I'm going to announce it over." It was actually farther back

60
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,520
 than that, I think. I go, "I'm going to announce this and I'm going to try it out and if I see

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,440
 anything from it, then I'll let you guys know, dude, this is awesome. This, this, you guys,

62
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,360
 I made jokes that this is going to get you kidnapped by Professor X. It might. And I might be the

63
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,280
 first to go. First off, I got to give a shout out to Nate's Patreon supporter. He's the one

64
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,840
 who brought it to my attention. So thank you so much, Nate. I would not have known what an amazing

65
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,880
 human, not no human, homo superior is the actual term that I'm giving myself. Let's talk about

66
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,600
 the app though real quick and then we'll get into how amazing it is. So this guy named Michael

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,840
 Ferrier invented this app and basically he was listening to coast to coast AM one day and they

68
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,040
 had like a remote viewing exercise and he did it and he guessed it right and he goes, "Ah, maybe

69
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,600
 there's something to this." But obviously he's a bit of a paranormal fan if he's listening to

70
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,080
 coast to coast in the first place, but he's been thinking about remote viewing for a while and

71
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,480
 like, is there any science behind it? Started investigating it and then he does what really

72
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,840
 everyone does or everyone wants to do. He takes a passion, which is paranormal stuff and remote

73
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:54,000
 viewing and how can I make money doing this? So is this app free? Yeah. He actually pays winners,

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,520
 quote unquote, winners out of his own pocket. So at the end of each month, the top 10 people get

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,600
 $10 and then at the end of the month, the top 10 people for the life of the app get $10. So it's

76
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,680
 not a ton of money. That's what $200 that you're paying out of your pocket. But what he does

77
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,520
 is this. He's trying to use, and he's very open about this. This isn't hidden. He's done

78
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,880
 interviews on this. It's actually in the apps, frequently asked questions. He uses the information

79
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,240
 that app users give to buy and sell stock on the stock market. He's been doing this since

80
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:37,280
 September 2019 and so far he's made $7,000. Some days he buys, some days he sells. And that actually,

81
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,720
 he said that on average, he has a 55.7% chance of being correct. If he bases what he's going to do

82
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,400
 on the stock market on the results of the app, it's more than average. That he'll actually make

83
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,920
 money. When you, and I showed, I did a Patreon live stream last Saturday and I showed them how

84
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,560
 it's done. I'll try to explain. It's a little hard to explain, but every day at 1.30 PM,

85
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,080
 right after the stock market closes, your phone alerts yourself. If you have this app, if you

86
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,000
 don't have this app, this isn't going to happen. You're like, dang it, why is my phone not doing

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,480
 this? I have the app at 1.30, it gives me a white screen and I draw an image of what I think I'm

88
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,800
 going to see. And then I submit it and then it gives me a choice of two images. And basically,

89
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,280
 that image, one of those two images will be presented to me the next day at 1.30. And I have

90
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,960
 to predict which image it is. He says he gives, it gets complicated from there, but using this weird

91
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,320
 math, science, psychic stuff, he basically, one image means buy and one image means sell.

92
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:52,640
 And if more people saw the buy image in the future, he buys. And if more people saw the sell

93
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,200
 image in the future, he sells. But you go, Jason, how does it predict? It gets a little more complicated

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,840
 than that. He says that it's randomized, so some people see one image for buy and other people

95
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,080
 see one image. That same image will mean sell. So it's this weird algorithm thing. But he apparently

96
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,840
 has it working because he's made $7,000 using this thing and he's just buying and selling these

97
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,720
 stocks. His goal is to eventually be able to form out remote viewers. He wants to prove that this

98
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,600
 thing is a viable option. He goes, eventually I would like to start giving them more money,

99
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,440
 more shares in what's going on. But so for example, for example, the other day, my phone does a little

100
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,600
 beep beep. My phone pulled up the white screen and I had in my head an image of something tiny. So I

101
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,440
 drew a picture of a giant chair and a little person standing next to it. And then I wrote tiny in that.

102
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,720
 I submitted it and then it gave me a choice of two images. One was a beach with like a beach house

103
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,400
 and a bunch of chairs. The other one was a loaf of bread and little tiny pieces of cheese and a

104
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,600
 tiny German flag. I don't know if it was German. It was a European flag. Why would it be with bread

105
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,680
 and cheese? That's in France, but it wasn't a French flag. And I go tiny. Tiny little flag.

106
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,520
 So I clicked that one with 100% certainty and the next day, bam, that was the image. That was the

107
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,160
 image. So right now, right now, and actually let me say this too, I thought this was real interesting.

108
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,960
 There is a thing called decline effect in parapsychology and basically the longer you run a

109
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,320
 parapsychology experiment, it starts to go to 50%. They go a lot of times when people start doing

110
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,800
 like trying to guess random cards, like can you see what is this a star? Is it across that type of

111
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,840
 effect? Can you read? Is it a black or red card? People a lot of times will get 60% right. Be like,

112
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:48,240
 oh man, you're psychic. But as time goes on, it actually drops down to around 50%. And they go,

113
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
 sometimes it's the person gets a lot of hits early on and then they start second guessing

114
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
 themselves. They don't come as easy. They start not trusting their instinct and then it ends up

115
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,200
 becoming 50%. And then they just get totally discouraged because that's normal. That's a

116
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,440
 homo sapien. So I've been doing this app for about three weeks now. I told you that story so I could

117
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,120
 doot doot my own horn. I've been doing this app for about three or four weeks now every single day.

118
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,600
 There's about 13, 14,000 users of this app. Apparently I was reading one of the reports.

119
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,760
 It actually might be higher. I probably could check it. But let's say 14,000. I'm in the top

120
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,360
 470 psychics who are currently using this app and in the month of February, which is pretty much

121
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
 when I started. I think I started like the last week of January. I'm number 12.

122
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,200
 Number 12. And what's cool about this is that it actually will break down your stats.

123
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:55,840
 So right now, I've done 27 rounds. So I've done it for 27 days. So around a month. I'm 61% correct.

124
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,160
 They said based on this app, they go based on your answers and how confident you are in your

125
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,760
 answers. There is only a 2.3% chance that you are doing this randomly. And if you even forget the

126
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,560
 confidence part, if you just pick two images and don't say I'm absolutely for sure, there's only

127
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,600
 11% chance that you're doing this randomly. I'm a psychic baby. I'm a remote viewer and I got the

128
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,200
 numbers to back it up. I've been doing it long enough. So interesting thing if you've ever wanted

129
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,560
 to have proof that you're psychic download this. However, again, I'm not responsible with government

130
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,760
 agents or fictional characters. Can nap you and try to turn you into some sort of secret super

131
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,480
 weapon. But if they did, maybe that's part of the 90 days to a better you. Maybe you want to be locked

132
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,880
 up in some government lab. You're like, within 90 days, I'll be nine stories deep underneath the

133
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,000
 Pentagon. Just where I've always wanted to be. Try it out. It's a really cool app. See if you can beat

134
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,800
 my score. But do not. If you win 10 bucks, you gotta give it to me. You gotta give me a referral

135
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,600
 code. Jimmy, let's go ahead and leave behind Wall Street. Call in at Carbnercopter. We are headed

136
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:11,200
 out to Virginia City, Nevada. You know what's funny? Today's stories I picked, I just kind of wanted

137
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,280
 a chill day. Honestly, I just wanted a chill day. Because yesterday's story really, I hate that story.

138
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,120
 Like when I was researching it more, I remembered most of it. Then I had a research, and there was

139
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,960
 the Branson Perry story, and then I was researching it, and I was like, this is so gross. Then when I

140
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:33,280
 was telling it, it's like, and then I had to edit it. And I was like, oh, I just want to take tomorrow's

141
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,480
 Friday's episode is going to be pretty chill. It's an interesting story. I'm glad that I shared it

142
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,400
 with you. It's truly horrific. Why am I glad that I shared that? I'm like, that disturbed me for 20

143
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,600
 years. Enjoy. Then I just play it. Yeah, dude, it's just so creepy. That story is so creepy for me.

144
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,240
 But anyway, so we're kind of taking a casual trip for this one. We are headed out to Virginia City,

145
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:04,160
 Nevada. We're walking along this dusty road. There's tumbleweed everywhere, broken down fence,

146
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,080
 skull, cow skull. Don't get scared. Don't get scared. It's not a human skull. It's a cow skull. If you're

147
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,800
 cow, though, that's probably terrifying. We're walking in front of St. Mary's Art Center, formally

148
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,840
 St. Mary Louise Hospital.

149
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:28,320
 The lightning striking. There's like a creepy weather vane of a rooster.

150
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,800
 Going back and forth. That's how I pictured this place. That's how I pictured this place.

151
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
 Because that's how I picture most of Nevada. But as we go through the story, you're going to learn

152
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,240
 like I did after I spent 30 minutes, 45 minutes, research in this place that the truth is far

153
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,240
 different. The truth is far different than your imagination. According to hauntedplaces.org,

154
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,640
 one of my favorite websites to check out every day, just pick on a random city. This is what you see

155
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,280
 at St. Mary's Art Center. It used to be a hospital, so that's kind of spooky, right? You see much

156
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,640
 apparitions. You'll hear boot steps, which is oddly specific. Did you hear that? Just

157
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,480
 sound like tennis shoes. You hear boot steps. You hear boot steps coming out of nowhere.

158
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:20,400
 You hear ladies voices. Oh my. Look at George in his new boots. And then you smell phantom

159
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,640
 smells like rubbing alcohol, flowers, and pipe tobacco. Now rubbing alcohol, I haven't heard

160
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,040
 that one before. It's interesting because flowers and pipe tobacco, I hear all the time with phantom

161
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,160
 smells. My grandpa, he was his favorite chair. He passed away every time I go over there or not

162
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
 every time. But every so often I smell pipe tobacco in the house. I've heard that story

163
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,440
 multiple times from friends of mine. I wonder why pipe tobacco and flowers too. Flowers and

164
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,040
 perfumes, flowers perfume and pipe tobacco. Weird. I don't have any theory for that, but

165
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,920
 maybe those smells, because it's never like, oh yeah, this is where my aunt Ma died. And I

166
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,160
 smelled Virginia Slims every time I walked by. It's never some noxious odor unless it's brimstone.

167
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,760
 It's pipe tobacco, which actually smells really good. The one thing I love the most about haunted

168
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,560
 places.org is the reviews. Because the little write-up is just like, oh there's boot steps.

169
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,840
 And then the reviews is where people actually have been to these places. They let us know what's

170
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,800
 really going on. Boots on the ground, you may say. So here's a review from McKenna. McKenna's story

171
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,040
 starts like this. She's going to go with a friend to St. Mary's Art Center because it has a reputation

172
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,640
 of being haunted. She wanted to see a ghost, or what she refers to as a so-called ghost. Like,

173
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,680
 she doesn't believe in them, which is fine. You don't have to believe in ghosts. So that's her

174
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,680
 introduction. My introduction to this story is I read three to four hours a day. Not literature,

175
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,000
 not great works of art. I just read articles. People always go, how do you find all your crazy

176
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 stories? I read three to four hours a day. There's a lot of skimming in this job, because I'll just

177
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,400
 skim skim, lights in the sky, lights in the sky, lights in the sky, gun. And then I'll start to

178
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,680
 read it and be like, he pulled the gun on the alien and stuck it in his mouth and said, earth rules.

179
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,080
 Oh, okay. I'm going to read this story. Lights in the sky, lights in the sky, abduction. Uh,

180
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,160
 reading that? Oh, hippies. They want to bring peace to earth. Skipping, skipping. He's giving

181
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
 instructions on how to cure the earth's ills. I'm like, get rid of that. Get rid of that.

182
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,560
 Lots of skimming, because I have to read tons and tons of stuff. So as I'm reading this young

183
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,200
 woman's account, I'm reading it and it's like, so we went to St. Mary's and it was dark and night

184
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,080
 and then we saw a visible and I was like, oh, visible specter. Okay, that's awesome. The word

185
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,160
 pops out because I'm just skimming this visible. You don't really, even in the initial account,

186
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,760
 they're like, yeah, there's apparitions, but it's the boot steps that keeps people coming back.

187
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,880
 So then I saw that there was a word in there. I started reading from the top. Her and her friend

188
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,240
 show up at 10 PM on a Friday night. So on night, much like this, if you're listening to it on

189
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,560
 Friday, if not, it's on a Friday night. You've experienced those before. They pull up to the

190
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,960
 house. I'm going to read you this right from her account. We pulled up and there was a car in the

191
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:19,600
 driveway and lights at the front door. We saw a visible person walking out of the door and we

192
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,200
 asked if there was any way we could go inside. He was actually a worker for the art center.

193
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,400
 What? Have you ever been, have you ever described one of your coworkers? Man, that guy sure is

194
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,800
 visible. You're like, what? Hey man, you got to meet my friend. He's really cool. He's good at chest.

195
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,960
 He's visible. Why would you use the word, why would you use the word visible to explain a

196
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:51,520
 normal human walking out of a building? But at this point, I was already reading the article

197
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,920
 and I had a hunch from that. I had a hunch from that. I don't know if she knew the way that I

198
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,400
 read and the way that I skim. I don't know if this was some sort of time bomb, literal time bomb,

199
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,280
 because it's sucking up my time. But I had a hunch. If McKenna was making such an odd statement

200
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,800
 this early on in her narrative, there's basically two stories I look for. The bizarre

201
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,960
 and the ridiculous. That's why there's so many poop stories in this podcast.

202
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,840
 So McKenna meets this visible person and she's all touching him. She's all, is he real? She's,

203
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,840
 yeah, I'm real. Quit poking me. He works for the art center. Now it's 10 o'clock at night.

204
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,880
 It's 10 o'clock at night here, but that, you know, maybe they had some new paint delivered.

205
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,040
 Maybe they're getting some new art supplies delivered. He goes, hey, would you like me to

206
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,560
 show you gals around? I don't know if he sounded that disgusting, but he does offer to show the

207
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,920
 girls around. The girls are like, yeah, fine. I'm assuming these girls are late teenagers,

208
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,480
 because they're out driving by themselves. So, you know, you have a guy working in an art center.

209
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,760
 Everyone, every woman he sees is over the age of 50. He sees a couple of co-eds walking. Yeah,

210
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,880
 yeah, I'll show you around. I am a worker at the art center. After all, they start walking around.

211
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,280
 And she goes, the first thing we did when we walked inside was there was creepy dolls everywhere.

212
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,400
 Not just, not just dolls in their packaging, not just American girl dolls, creepy dolls.

213
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,200
 Here's the thing. All dolls out of their native environment are creepy. A doll not found in a

214
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,640
 girl's room or in the vicinity of a girl is a creepy doll. A girl walking up the street holding

215
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,160
 a doll, that's fine. That exact same doll covered in dust sitting on the side of the freeway,

216
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,160
 literally the same doll. It could be brand new. It's terrifying. This guy's showing McKenna and

217
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,640
 her unnamed friend around, and he's like, look at all this stuff. And as she's walking with him

218
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,880
 into the building, they're past the creepy dolls. He doesn't seem to remark on that. He takes them

219
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,640
 into a room where he has a bunch of cameras set up. Now you and me, we talked about this on

220
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,600
 yesterday's episode, the Branson Perry's episode, people being naive. I want to walk into some

221
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,960
 abandoned building. It's not abandoned. See, that's the thing. Like, okay, well, we'll get into that

222
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,160
 in a second, but apparently the building's abandoned and she walks, her and her friend walk

223
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,200
 into it with this guy. And now he has a bunch of cameras set up and he says that he works there.

224
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,400
 We wouldn't go in the building in the first place. We may go, nah, we're good. Man,

225
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,840
 just see that guy, how visible he was. Oh dude, that was super spooky. I want to write that on

226
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,480
 the internet. And then we'll double back when the dude's gone and then we'll go in and start messing

227
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,880
 with spooky ghost dolls and stuff like that. I'm not going to roll around with some stranger

228
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,200
 that I don't know in this former hospital now art center. These girls are apparently naive. They

229
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,680
 walk in here. There's a bunch of cameras, which listen, man, there's only a few types of people

230
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,120
 who have cameras. Photographers, actually there's a lot of people who have cameras. There's a lot

231
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,400
 of different types of people who have cameras. Some people just like taking pictures, but also perverts.

232
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,200
 They ruin it for everything, right? That's why I don't eat Chex Mix anymore because one day I saw

233
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,880
 Pervert eating Chex Mix and now that's all I can think about. So, room full of cameras. Now,

234
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,480
 they don't think anything of this. If you went into a dirty place full of spooky dolls at 10 o'clock

235
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,040
 at night with a stranger and he said, come this way and you saw room full of cameras, you're going

236
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,640
 to assume you're in a saw movie. You're going to assume these cameras are recording and there's a

237
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,760
 snuff film going on. And through eating Chex Mix, you see a guy in the corner. Let the party begin.

238
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,840
 At this point, the girls go, whoa, what are all these cameras doing here? And he tells McKenna,

239
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:41,600
 oh, I'm a ghost hunter. These are my ghost hunting devices. So, he lied. He totally lied. He doesn't

240
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 work for the art center. He's a ghost hunter. He broke into the building, became visible, and then

241
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,280
 a car full of girls showed up. Well, two girls, so half a car full of girls, showed up. He said,

242
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,560
 come in. I work here. It's okay. And then he's a ghost hunter too. But again, McKenna's not thinking

243
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,120
 that at that point we'd bounce because he already lied once. What else is he going to lie about?

244
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,080
 He takes them up to the nursery room. Now, remember this used to be a hospital, so it makes sense

245
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,200
 that there was a nursery room. And according to McKenna, this room held kids of all ages, specifically

246
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,600
 preemies to eight-year-olds. That is the worst combination to anyone who knows anything about

247
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:30,800
 human biology. And I don't know much. I do know that preemies are incredibly fragile. And eight-year-olds

248
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,320
 like to wrestle. Eight-year-olds just watch my warm-up power rangers. They're like, stay away,

249
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,720
 buddies. And they're like kicking one-year-olds across the room. You can't combine year-olds

250
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,760
 and preemies. Now, there were other kids in there too. It wasn't just those two age groups

251
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,360
 that everyone else is another ward. So it'd be even worse. You got a bunch of like six-year-olds

252
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,440
 trying to like assert dominance over the eight-year-olds. And then you got like the preemies all

253
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
 huddled up and they got their umbilical cords all connected. And they're like sharing food and

254
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,520
 secrets. They're plotting. They're gonna form one giant eight-year-old. They're like, all of our ages

255
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,640
 add together. We're 10. They're like, no, they're punching them. Anyway, so that's not true, right?

256
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,880
 Like this is the point where you should start to realize that either this photographer/

257
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,400
 checksmixenthusia/ghosthunter is lying to her saying this room used to house all these different

258
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:35,040
 ages of kids or McKenna is lying or she's incredibly delusional. They go then to the basement,

259
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,920
 because that's where the ER was according to McKenna. They have the basement, which is actually

260
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,760
 that makes a lot of sense because emergency room is what ER stands for. And there's nothing like

261
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,120
 an emergency that you have to go down three stories, right? The doctor's like, oh no, I got a call.

262
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,760
 This guy's having a heart attack. As the elevator's going down, it's always leg day for the doctors

263
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,480
 there. Emergency rooms are always on the first floor specifically for that reason. They're actually

264
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,520
 right next to the door. So whatever, this woman, McKenna's obviously never been in hospital. I'm

265
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,600
 sorry to think she's never left her computer. So we have that. She's given us this layout,

266
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,120
 this theater of the mind. So we have the nursery, aka, "Thundered Home for Ages Eight and Under."

267
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,000
 You have the ER in the basement. Then on the top floor of this art center, formerly hospital,

268
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,040
 was an insane asylum. So this is a pretty all functioning hospital, right? You can give birth,

269
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,520
 you can give birth in the hospital, and then you can be rushed to ER, not rushed, you know,

270
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,800
 you have to go down the elevator, someone else is hitting the button, go up, you have to go back

271
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 up to the top, bunch of insane people get on it. You can do everything in this hospital. You have

272
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:49,840
 emergency room, you have the, you don't want to have the nursery in the same building as the

273
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,440
 insane asylum. You probably don't even want to know the same city block, but they must have

274
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,640
 not had a lot of space in Nevada, because Nevada is known to be very crowded metropolitan state.

275
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,920
 It looks like Coruscant. You have the insane asylum at the top floor, you have the nursery,

276
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,240
 you can hear the crazy people are like, "I can hear the babies vibrate through the floorboards."

277
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,480
 Besides the fact of having an insane asylum anywhere near a nursery or in emergency room,

278
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 they're like, "First, we go down to the emergency room, get all the scalpels and surgical saws."

279
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,440
 You don't want to have an insane asylum on the top floor of a building, because they're insane,

280
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,320
 they're just going to jump out windows. It's very interesting. That's a call back to an old

281
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,560
 episode I did, very, very popular conspiracy theory. I'll put it on the show notes about

282
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,920
 the United States fighting Nazis in Antarctica, which is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. It was

283
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,320
 a really good episode. It didn't make any sense that when you start to think about the conspiracy

284
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,560
 theory, it doesn't make sense. But one of the parts of the conspiracy theory is one of the guys who

285
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,080
 supposedly was a whistleblower jumped out of an insane asylum. He was on the eighth floor and

286
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,920
 they were saying you never put jumpers on the eighth floor. You put them on the second floor,

287
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,160
 but for some reason he was transferred up there. That's one of the sticking point. They go, "Well,

288
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,320
 this guy killed himself," or he was assassinated because he knew too much. Forget that there was

289
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,800
 30,000 other US soldiers involved in this battle and you don't have other soldiers coming out saying,

290
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,200
 "I was also there. I shot down a spaceship," and the Hitler was shaking his fist at me. He's like,

291
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,440
 "Meow, mind got told, get you, Yankee." So, you know, whatever. But anyways, that's an interesting

292
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,400
 episode. Give that one a listen. But that was what made me think of this. I go, "Yeah, you don't

293
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,160
 never put an insane asylum on the top story." I learned that from insane conspiracies involving

294
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:44,880
 Nazis in Antarctica. McKenna also said on the top floor was quotes, scratches, up and down the walls,

295
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,560
 blood drips all over the floors, chain locks on the bed, creepy children's toys,

296
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:04,480
 and a deck of cards. Why would she add that part? How does that add anything to the imagery?

297
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,120
 Scratches up and down the wall is bloody prints on the floor, bloody puddles,

298
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,840
 chains on the bed and a deck of cards. I don't care if there's a deck of-- were they haunted?

299
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,320
 Did the Joker of the deck of cards wink at you? No, it's just a deck of cards. How does it add

300
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,640
 any of the menace there? Then they say that a door slammed super hard. After all of that,

301
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:36,080
 after seeing blood on the floor and being escorted around this location by a man who lied to you,

302
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,920
 what scared them the most was the door slamming. Here, this is because these are reviews.

303
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,080
 This is on the review, so this is the ending of McKenna's review. Quote,

304
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,680
 "I have never in my life had an actual ghost experience until then." The slamming door,

305
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,440
 by the way. Not the blood, not the fresh human blood dripping. "I have never in my life had an

306
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,480
 actual ghost experience until then. It freaked us all out and we left and never went back. I am so

307
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,760
 willing to go back for a second time though because that event changed my life and totally

308
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,680
 made me believe in the afterlife." So we have someone who in the beginning didn't believe in

309
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:22,240
 ghosts. Now it turns out they were full on agnostic, possibly atheist, didn't believe in the afterlife

310
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,440
 at all. They figured when you died it was the black void for eternity. I don't know what I was

311
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,280
 like before I was alive, so I don't care what it's like after I'm alive. Let the void swallow us all

312
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,520
 until the door slammed, until the door slammed. And then she straight up scooby-doodle out of there.

313
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,160
 So we have that story. Now I've never been there. I've never been there. And when I'm telling you

314
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,520
 that story you're thinking, "Okay, maybe the kin is exaggerating. I've been to a lot of places,

315
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,640
 but I've never seen a deck of cards. I've never seen a deck of cards out of place."

316
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,840
 Spooky dolls. Maybe there's like it's like hobos running around there, stuff like that.

317
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,240
 Here is another comment right underneath hers because this is so great about this website that

318
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,960
 someone can tell a tale like that and someone go, "Ugh, there's this comment underneath this."

319
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,800
 Quote, "My friend rented the place out for the night. My children slept in the room that I guess

320
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,880
 was covered in scratches with chains, etc. I didn't see any of that. So I'm thinking,

321
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,960
 why would you rent out? Why would you ever be like, "Come on, kids. Let's go to this abandoned

322
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,320
 ex-hospital now. It's this abandoned art center where sometimes adults will just hang out with

323
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,560
 cameras in a room. Bring your dolls. BYOD, bring your own dolls. Why would you rent this place out?"

324
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,800
 It turns out, because again, I've never been here, but after I read her, after I was tricked

325
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,720
 into reading her narrative by using the word visible, that's all it takes, putting the word

326
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,040
 visible in there for not anymore. Now that I'm going to need to read a little bit more before I

327
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,240
 continue. I was imagining this spooky abandoned art hospital, maybe it was an art center in the

328
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,400
 60s when a bunch of hippies took it over and now it's just this decimal place. It is a place where,

329
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,520
 to this day, it's completely all done up. They have art festival stuff. Well, not now because

330
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,440
 the pandemic's going on, but they're starting to open it up. It's basically a place where a bunch

331
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,080
 of old women would go and paint in the backyard. It's this beautiful building that is the only

332
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,000
 time there has probably ever been a creepy doll around there is on Halloween because it is known

333
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,240
 to be haunted and every Halloween for like three days they have these big paranormal tours. Other

334
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,200
 than that, bring your, it's BYOP. It's bring your own paint and you sit out there and there's ducks

335
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,880
 walking around. Jimmy Moore's trespass of England. He's waddling by their painting pictures of them.

336
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,440
 It's that. It's an art center. You go, there's like a basket weaving section and a yarn.

337
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,360
 You just look at yarn, you're like, oh man, I really wish I could do something with that.

338
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,360
 They're like, no, no, that's the advanced class. Lots of painting and stuff like that. It has been

339
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,440
 shut down during the pandemic, but it's not abandoned. There's no bloody chains. There's no

340
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,720
 deck of cards. There's not a deck of cards to be seen. There is two interesting questions about

341
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,520
 this though. One is, this is me being conspiratorial. You are not allowed to go ghost hunting in that

342
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,000
 building. It is a known ghost haunted location. It's on hauntedplaces.org, right? But you can't

343
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,600
 do any ghost hunting there unless you talk to the wigs. Now, I guess this makes sense. I'm a

344
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,600
 classic ghost hunter. I used to break into haunted places, graveyards and houses. You know, hold

345
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,800
 the flashlight on a long, jumping over people's fences and stuff like that. Okay, you may call it

346
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,080
 criminal ghost hunting, but that's classic ghost hunting. This is before ghost hunting shows and,

347
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,920
 you know, before things like laws and permits and trespassing orders and all that. It's back in

348
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,120
 the day, man. But I guess the wigs control this side of the ghost town. They control this part of

349
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:00,560
 ghost town. The wigs are a group they're called the women investigating ghost sightings. I bet you

350
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,960
 I bet you could never guess about wigs. You're like, I don't even know it was an acronym. I just

351
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,360
 thought it was a bunch of like old the old-timey political party was walking around hitting people

352
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,680
 with canes. Now, the wigs is women investigating ghost sightings. It's a woman, obviously woman-based

353
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:22,240
 ghost group. They control the St. Mary beat. And what if you showed up and said, I would like to

354
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,880
 learn how to paint, please. You're always painting pictures of ghosts and the wigs show up. They're

355
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,880
 knocking over your easel. They're like, get out of here. You bum or you show up and you're like,

356
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,320
 one yarn. I'd like to buy one piece of yarn, please. And then like you pull out your little EVP

357
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,760
 reader and you're like, when did you die? They're like, what? The wigs come out of nowhere. They

358
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,080
 start beating you up. They're breaking your EVP recorder. They're like, record this, smash. You're

359
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,520
 like, I just did. My other EVP recorder. They have a lock on this place. You can't investigate it.

360
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,240
 You can't investigate it. So that's just weird. I don't know how they got that. I don't know

361
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,480
 how they got that contract. I don't know why they would want that contract. But apparently that's

362
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,240
 the way it is. The other weird thing, we'll wrap it up like this, this much more lighthearted episode

363
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,840
 than yesterday's episode, even though I referenced it multiple times. What in the world was McKenna

364
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:21,360
 talking about? Here's the thing. She was either completely, completely making it up. Totally lying

365
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:28,640
 about this place because none of it matches up. You could say, maybe she went on Halloween or

366
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,880
 around Halloween. She didn't mention all the trick or treaters, all the visible 10 year old's trick

367
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,880
 or treating. If it was like they were setting up for a haunted house or something like that,

368
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,040
 there wouldn't have been a man there setting up the cameras because Wigs is a woman group.

369
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,520
 So they wouldn't have been a dude they're setting up cameras. Definitely wouldn't be

370
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:56,000
 setting them up at 10pm by himself. So she's either totally making the story up. Flat out fake. Or

371
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,960
 she went to the wrong location. Here's the thing. The most likely answer is that she's totally made

372
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,920
 it up. That's just the most likely answer. However, if that was the case, she could have made it up

373
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,480
 on Reddit. She could have made it up anywhere that wouldn't be tied to this location. She could

374
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,240
 have easily posted it somewhere where someone could have instantly fact check it. She could have

375
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,760
 posted on Reddit and goes, "Me and my friend, we once went to this spooky place out in the middle

376
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,600
 of Nevada. I forgot the name of it and tell the same narrative." And she'd get all this karma and

377
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,760
 people would be like, "Oh, that's super spooky." She could have posted it as creepypasta. She could

378
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,440
 have done a bunch of stuff. She tied it to this location in the very next comment. Someone goes,

379
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,160
 "That's not true. My kid's hanging out there. My kids, my kids range from age,

380
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,000
 preemie to eight. It's perfect for them." What if she went to a different location and all of this

381
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 stuff is real? The dude with the cameras, the blood on the floor, the deck of cards, the creepy dolls,

382
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,200
 humans are visible. It's all sorts of madness. There may be some other place in Nevada

383
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:06,080
 that is this. There may be another abandoned hospital in Nevada that is this. Or even more

384
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,080
 terrifying, she did show up to the right location.

385
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:23,360
 Amber Alert. Did you like that? Did that scare you as much as it scared me?

386
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,600
 Let me give you one more thing for a wrap this episode up to, guys. It's never going to be the

387
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,920
 perfect time to start your project. While I've been recording this episode, I've had people

388
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,080
 walking up and down and slamming doors and dogs barking. There's always cars driving by,

389
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,160
 people listening to really loud television in the place next door to me. I got an Amber Alert

390
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,160
 going off on my phone. Do it. Anyways, there's never a perfect time to start your project.

391
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,440
 The perfect time is now. The perfect time was yesterday. I've been recording this show 620

392
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,640
 some odd episodes. It's never the perfect time. It's never the perfect place. You just do it.

393
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,640
 You just get it started. If you wait for the perfect time, you'll be waiting forever.

394
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,840
 If you wait for the perfect situation, you'll be waiting forever. Just one last piece of

395
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,160
 inspiration for you for the weekend. What if she showed up to the right place and this was what

396
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:15,440
 she experienced at this art center? She got there. It was gross. It was littered with debris

397
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:24,560
 from hundreds of hobos moving in and out. Up on the top floor where women sit with their easels,

398
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:32,640
 and sketch out the sunset. When she went into that same room, it was covered in chains and blood

399
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,920
 and scratches. If she went back to that place, what she says, she wants to go back to that place,

400
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,200
 would she find a completely different location? She walks in and she goes,

401
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,760
 "When did you guys do all this renovation?" It looks beautiful on the outside. Look at all this.

402
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,080
 There's no tile on the ground. There's no dolls everywhere.

403
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,520
 They're like, "This place has been renovated like this since the 70s. It's been an art center.

404
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,720
 People have been using it every single day." When she went out to prove whether or not

405
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,160
 ghosts existed and ended up hearing a door slam behind her, it blew her mind.

406
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,480
 It made her think that there is life after death. What would happen if she found that

407
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:28,400
 when she visited this place, it was a totally different place. It was from a different reality,

408
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,520
 a darker reality, where this hospital was not reused as an art center,

409
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:45,120
 but fell into disrepair and became a blight on the landscape. Somehow she transcended through

410
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:55,680
 reality and entered a haunted building. And maybe the door slam wasn't so much the wind

411
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:04,000
 or even a ghost, but reality itself closing in on her. We don't know what happened to McKenna

412
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,240
 after this story, but what if she traveled home and everything was fine? But the next day when

413
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:19,840
 she goes to work, the building that her office normally stood in seems decrepit. Seems like no

414
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:26,160
 one has been there for years. She figures she's lost, she doesn't really think anything of it,

415
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,040
 she doesn't seem to be the most bright as bulb. So she goes to her local college,

416
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,600
 because it's time for classes to start. It takes her 10-15 minutes before she realizes

417
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,040
 she's the only one on campus. She looks through the window of a classroom, it looks like it's been

418
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 abandoned for decades. As she walks back out to her car, she realizes the city is quiet.

419
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:01,520
 No sounds of humans, no sounds of cars, no sounds of anything, but her own beating heart.

420
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,680
 She thought she was just going out on a Friday night to visit a haunted house,

421
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,080
 but instead she found herself walking into a new world, a haunted world.

422
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:23,920
 Her entire world is slowly turning into a wasteland, and that's when the shadows begin to move.

423
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:33,120
 She's not alone, but she will soon wish that she was. McKenna better start believing in the afterlife,

424
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,920
 because she's living one right now.
