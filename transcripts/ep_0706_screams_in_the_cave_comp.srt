1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
 A woman wakes up to see five very unexpected strangers surrounding her bed.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,880
 When a homeless man has diarrhea, he stumbles across a worldwide conspiracy.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,040
 Yeah, that's an actual topic.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,360
 And then two young men are out camping in an Arizona desert.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,920
 They just want to have a good time and tell spooky stories around the campfire.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,920
 And they are thrust face first into a war for Earth's women today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:44,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
 I know yesterday's episode ended abruptly.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,680
 I basically just took my football and went home.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,240
 Everybody really bugged me and just to be aware, that was yesterday to you that was

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 30 minutes ago to me.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,440
 I just got done recording that story because I'm trying to get all these episodes done

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,880
 for the heatwave hits and this is my last episode I have to record for the week.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,200
 It's June 24th for me.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,040
 So this was recorded long before you're listening to it.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,240
 But I decided I was going to find some goofier stories than I had originally planned for

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,000
 this episode because yesterday was kind of just me getting upset.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,520
 I mean it was reasonable, right?

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
 It was reasonable.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,840
 But I found some goofy ones for us today and then we have the mind story.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
 I didn't get to that.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,280
 And then Alirak was our legacy Patreon supporter yesterday.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,800
 I always want to make sure you guys fly the Carpenter copter.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,960
 So Alirak, you are back in the seat for this episode because all you did was drive the

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,680
 Dead Rabbit Dune buggy and I just yelled the whole way.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
 You're like, "Oh, this is a very awkward journey."

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,800
 So Alirak, welcome back to Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,600
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,760
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,200
 You guys know what I'm going to say, but I mean every word of it.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
 That's okay too.

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,040
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,760
 Alirak, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,880
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,720
 We are headed on out to Devon, England.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,640
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is taking us on out there.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
 It's November 1991.

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,080
 It's three in the morning.

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
 The spookiest time to be alive.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,440
 It's super spooky.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,120
 If you're alive at two, if you're alive at four, you're golden, but 3 AM.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,960
 This family in Devon had been having some paranormal issues going on in the house at

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,200
 night.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,480
 Family members had heard strange noises, footsteps down empty hallways.

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,560
 That actually doesn't sound like footsteps.

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
 That sounds like mom and dad are having a little fun.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
 You're like, "Jason, nobody.

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,480
 That sounds like two elves banging each other.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,360
 What type of adult makes that?"

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,080
 It sounds like a construction worker.

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,360
 You're like, "Jason, it's not a construction worker either.

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,520
 Just tell the ghost story or the alien story, whatever this is."

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,680
 One night, one night everyone's asleep, mom feels something pressing down on her chest.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 She wakes up.

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,320
 There's nothing in the room.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
 That's not the whole story.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 That's not the whole story.

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
 That's just sleep paralysis.

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,520
 I don't even know why I included that detail.

63
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,240
 It adds nothing to the narrative.

64
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,480
 I guess it shows that stuff's going on in the house, but that happens to people all

65
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 the time, right?

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,160
 Okay, so I included that detail because it was in my notes, but looking back over it,

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,640
 I don't know why I included it.

68
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,000
 This is why we're telling this story.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,520
 This is why we're at this house.

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,040
 There's another night and the mom wakes up.

71
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,680
 She sees a ghost in old, timey clothing standing by her bed.

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,080
 She's like, "Oh!"

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,200
 And then next to that is another old, timey ghost standing there, right?

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
 And she's like, "Oh no, there's two old, timey ghosts on this side of my bed.

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,080
 I'm going to slowly turn my head because maybe the other side of the bed, there's no one

76
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
 there."

77
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,360
 And as she's turning her head, she sees a third old, timey ghost just standing there.

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
 She cranes her head just a little bit more.

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
 She sees four.

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,760
 Apparently this is an episode that's obsessed with me straight now.

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,840
 She sees four scary ghosts standing on the side of her bed.

82
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,120
 They're all wearing old, timey clothes.

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,720
 But Jason, you said that a woman wakes up and she sees five people in her house.

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,480
 So who is the fifth ghost?

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
 Is it someone special?

86
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,720
 Is it Abraham Lincoln?

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
 Is it King George?

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
 This is the interesting thing about this story.

89
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,720
 I mean, listen, that's sleep paralysis, right?

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,240
 You're waking up, you see a couple ghosts.

91
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
 I mean, I guess that's not normal sleep paralysis.

92
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,440
 That is a couple ghosts.

93
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,120
 But waking up and seeing ghosts surrounding your bed, that's terrifying.

94
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,240
 But is it Dead Rabbit Radio Terrifying?

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
 Is it so unusual that I would talk about it on the show?

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,280
 She wakes up, she sees four ghosts.

97
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
 They're translucent.

98
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
 You can see through them.

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,760
 It's 100% the definition of a ghost's full body apparition.

100
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
 They're wearing old, timey clothes.

101
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,880
 The fifth ghost is not a ghost.

102
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,080
 It is a fully solid gray alien.

103
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,680
 That story was from, think about it, docs.com.

104
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
 You're like, Jason, wait, that was the whole story?

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,400
 A woman wakes up, she's surrounded by old timey ghosts and a gray alien and then there's

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,760
 no, they don't say what happens?

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
 No.

108
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
 They don't, which is interesting, right?

109
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,280
 Which is technically would be the most interesting part of the story, right?

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,120
 And I think just seeing them together is fairly interesting.

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
 Seeing them together.

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,400
 This was reported, think about it, docs.com, one of my favorite websites.

113
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,680
 They got it from Malcolm Robinson.

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,160
 They wrote for, I think it was a newsletter called SPI, I'm assuming it's something like

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,760
 spook paranormal investigations or something like that.

116
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,400
 But think about it, docs.com has never steered me wrong.

117
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,880
 They have a lot of great info there.

118
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,280
 They're one of the few sources I trust in this game.

119
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
 So what was going on here, right?

120
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,240
 You could say, yeah, she was dreaming.

121
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,040
 But I think they have this lead up to paranormal activity.

122
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,960
 The reason why I want to talk about this is because of that combination of high strangeness.

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,600
 Here we have an alien and we've touched on this subject throughout the run of the show,

124
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,880
 but we have an alien in the same presence of ghosts.

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,440
 We've seen Bigfoot and aliens in close proximity, but I can't, I'm sure we've covered it before,

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,200
 but if we have, it's extremely rare, an alien and ghosts in the same location.

127
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,520
 And it just raises a whole bunch of questions that are really fascinating.

128
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,920
 Is there a connection between aliens and ghosts?

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,480
 Does that mean that the idea or the theory that aliens are interdimensional?

130
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,720
 Because we already believe that ghosts are kind of of this world, but not of this world.

131
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
 Like interdimensional between heaven and hell and all that stuff.

132
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,160
 Does this mean that, but you would think if that was the case, we'd see this happen more often.

133
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,720
 Or this is, there's a whole other bunch of theories we can go down on this.

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,920
 But this is what I'm thinking.

135
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,440
 This is, I'm curious.

136
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
 There are people like us.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,640
 I mean, everyone has their favorite paranormal stuff.

138
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,600
 Like I enjoy reading more about ghosts and demons than I do fairies and gnomes.

139
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,800
 I'm not going to turn my back on a gnome.

140
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,920
 He's chasing me.

141
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,000
 If he's chasing me down the street, I'm like, oh, you don't exist.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,680
 But I, you know, I'd at least interview him, but I don't, I won't go out of my way.

143
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
 If there's like a gnome marvel down the street, I'm like, ah, maybe tomorrow.

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,480
 The fairy circle is slowly disappearing.

145
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,160
 It only appears once every thousand years.

146
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,600
 Oh, wait, I'll wait.

147
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,360
 I'm playing just cause three today.

148
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 I have a theory.

149
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,320
 I think about this.

150
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,560
 Like what if, and this isn't my theory.

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
 Other people have put this forward.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,880
 I actually originally heard this from Dennis Hauke.

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,600
 He's the author of the National Directory of Haunted Places.

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,920
 There's parts of the world.

155
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,440
 Sometimes it's a fixed location.

156
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,520
 Sometimes it travels and moves around, but that the reality gets a little wonky.

157
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,200
 And depending on what you believe is what you see.

158
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,080
 So someone who doesn't believe in anything, someone who's completely atheistic,

159
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,200
 not just religious wise, but completely, they don't believe in any paranormal stuff.

160
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,360
 They may walk through a certain location and feel a little funny.

161
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
 And they'll chalk it up to the fact that they were eating R-R-Bs earlier that day.

162
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,120
 But someone who believes in ghosts may go in that location and they see a haunting.

163
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
 Someone who believes in aliens may go to that location.

164
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
 They see lights in the sky.

165
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,920
 Someone who believes in Bigfoot will hear a roar in the distance.

166
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,080
 And that theory is interesting.

167
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,600
 It doesn't really, it holds up sometimes.

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,080
 Like if you go to a haunted house, like people go, that house is haunted.

169
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,480
 We go there.

170
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
 There's cold spots and stuff like that.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,520
 You can't get Stephen Greer going there and he's like, "Oh, spooky alien."

172
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,920
 Well, he probably would, but that was a bad example.

173
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,680
 But if you get someone who believes in UFOs and takes them to a spooky house,

174
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,400
 and if they don't believe in ghosts, they may not see anything.

175
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,160
 But there is this theory that what you believe is what you see.

176
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,680
 And if you are a religious person, you may go there and you may see an angel.

177
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,200
 You may see a gen, right, depending on where you fall at.

178
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
 So that could be what this is.

179
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,960
 And it's an interesting question to us, to us.

180
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,360
 Even though I enjoy reading about ghosts and demons more than,

181
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
 really, I think more than aliens.

182
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
 It's really hard for me to find good ghost stories for this show.

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,840
 I really love ghost stories.

184
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
 I've seen ghosts, I've seen demons.

185
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,560
 I know 100% those things exist.

186
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,240
 But I would be open to seeing an alien.

187
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
 And if I went to a haunted house, I would expect to see.

188
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
 I would be like, "Ghosts, show up.

189
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
 I don't want to waste my time here.

190
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,160
 I already let that hobbit hovel disappear."

191
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,120
 But if, you know what I mean, like,

192
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,520
 but if I showed up to a haunted house and I saw a gray alien,

193
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,960
 I would not be disappointed.

194
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,120
 My pants may need a washing, but I want to be disappointed.

195
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,960
 So I'm thinking, like, I'm just, this is interesting,

196
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,640
 because is she was this woman?

197
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,240
 First off, it could have just been a dream.

198
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
 But if she did see these things,

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
 was her brain trying to process all this weird information?

200
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,080
 And it couldn't.

201
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,640
 It couldn't even process it as five ghosts or five gray aliens.

202
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
 It kind of split the difference.

203
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,640
 Or did the alien bring the ghosts with them?

204
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
 Like, there's a whole bunch of, I love this story,

205
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,360
 even though it's so short.

206
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
 Sometimes it's these little short ones

207
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,600
 that really get the noggin joggin.

208
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
 If you know what I mean, should that be my new catchphrase?

209
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,280
 I think I actually heard that from Ned Flanders 15 years ago,

210
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,880
 but that's my new catchphrase.

211
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,120
 Come on, fluffle, let's get the noggin joggin.

212
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,480
 I will never say that again.

213
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,520
 Okay, I said it twice.

214
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,440
 I didn't even laugh.

215
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
 I didn't even laugh the second time I said it.

216
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
 And you were like, thank you, Jason.

217
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,960
 Thank you for realizing how stewed that was.

218
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,680
 Eli Rack, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

219
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,760
 We're going to take the hot breezes away from Devon, England.

220
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,080
 We are headed out to Santa Monica, California.

221
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,000
 Eli Rack's like, damn it, that's where we went yesterday, dude.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
 And you started yelling at everybody.

223
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,880
 You started accusing people of being grifters.

224
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
 Well, hang on to Eli Rack's ankles.

225
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
 We're not going to talk about Sharon Lee Giganti again.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,160
 We are headed out to Santa Monica to meet Max Kramer.

227
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,000
 Max Kramer is a character we just introduced.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,400
 I think last week, I'm starting to lose track of episodes

229
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
 because I'm recording them so far ahead

230
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,160
 before this heatwave destroys the planet.

231
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
 Max Kramer was a character.

232
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,600
 Oh yeah, it was Father's Day.

233
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
 I did not plan that.

234
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,320
 I did not plan to have an episode about a man disguising himself

235
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
 as people's dads on Father's Day, but it worked out perfectly.

236
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,840
 Father's Day, I introduced this character named Max Kramer.

237
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
 He was sent to me, not physically.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,520
 I would have loved to shake this guy's hand.

239
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,320
 We don't know if he's alive anymore, but Oogs,

240
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
 a long-time listener of the show Oogs, sent me the story of Max Kramer.

241
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,400
 To sum it, you don't have to listen to Money's episode.

242
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,360
 I recommend that it's really funny, but to sum it up,

243
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,360
 Max Kramer is a homeless man who is also a video game designer

244
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,240
 and has a website called Immortal Jewish Car Machine.

245
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,360
 And the website is long gone, but thankfully it's in the wayback machine.

246
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,400
 He's a video game developer.

247
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
 He's developed 90 video games.

248
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,640
 One of them is about a guy named Skip Shudderville

249
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,720
 who pawns his knife.

250
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
 This is you, by the way.

251
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,520
 This is the character you play.

252
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,080
 If you've ever wanted to play a video game where you're a total idiot,

253
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,680
 there's a guy named Skip Shudderville.

254
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
 He pawns his knife.

255
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
 This takes place in 1812.

256
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,320
 I guess they bought, I guess they bought used knives back then.

257
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,080
 It's called 84 Sins.

258
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,440
 The ghost of Skip Shudderville.

259
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,320
 This is a game he's developed, i.e. wrote down.

260
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,080
 Skip Shudderville is you, you, sorry, 1821.

261
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,280
 Sorry, let's go from my notes.

262
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,720
 Sorry to get the date wrong, Max.

263
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
 You pawn your knife because you have to pay some gambling debts,

264
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,080
 and then you drink too much at a bar,

265
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,600
 and then they go, "Hey, where's the money?"

266
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,360
 And you don't have it, and you don't have a knife,

267
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,560
 and they stab you to death?

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,520
 I don't remember that being the opening of Halo.

269
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,600
 And you're like, "Jason, no, that's super counterculture.

270
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,480
 That would be great."

271
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
 So anyway, Skip Shudderville.

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,760
 Fine, you've developed the game.

273
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,400
 Skip Shudderville, this is all the opening cinematic.

274
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
 Skip Shudderville is buried,

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,440
 and there's a rabbi wizard walking through the graveyard randomly,

276
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,920
 and he goes, "Oh, dude, I heard about you.

277
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,000
 You're the idiot who pawned your knife.

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
 The rabbi wizard possesses Skip, and then you come to life."

279
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,560
 And the rabbi goes, "Sorry, rabbi wizard.

280
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,720
 I don't want to short- I don't want to short-sell this, dude.

281
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
 The rabbi wizard says you had 84 sins in your life."

282
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
 "Well, dude, that's so low.

283
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
 I think I've committed 84 sins this week,

284
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,960
 but you only committed 84 sins in your life, Skip Shudderville.

285
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,360
 If you right those wrongs, I will take you back in time,

286
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
 give you a younger body, and $1 million,"

287
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,200
 which would basically make you the richest man on the planet

288
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,960
 in the year 1821.

289
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,920
 As you're playing Skip Shudderville, you are a homeless hobo,

290
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,560
 which is a constant theme in Max's games.

291
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,040
 I would- that's so bizarre to me if I was a hobo.

292
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,000
 If I was a hobo, and I could dream up a dream world,

293
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,560
 I would first- step one, stop being a hobo,

294
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,920
 but so many characters in his games recycle cans,

295
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,960
 like cans are the currency in so many of his games.

296
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,280
 You're not collecting gold coins,

297
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,840
 you're collecting aluminum cans to recycle,

298
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,000
 and then you use that to buy magic swords.

299
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,360
 It's so bizarre.

300
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
 But anyway, Skip Shudderville,

301
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
 I know you guys are on pins and needles,

302
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,920
 you want to hear the story of Skip Shudderville,

303
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,520
 you are Skip, and you come back to life,

304
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,640
 and it starts off like this is the end of the opening cinematic.

305
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,200
 People walk up to Skip and they're like,

306
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
 "Hey, you want something to eat?

307
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
 You want some pennies?"

308
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,480
 And Skip says, "Skip replies here,

309
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,040
 no thank you," and tells them that he would just stomp on a cockroach

310
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
 and cook it on the end of his cigarette.

311
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,120
 And then the game starts.

312
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,680
 And it's weird because what I think is that Max Kramer

313
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,120
 probably said that in real life

314
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
 and thought it was like the wittiest thing in the world.

315
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,400
 As he has this big thing about people giving him weird looks,

316
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,360
 he thinks that's him upsetting the Matrix.

317
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
 So when he says something that upsets people

318
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,280
 and they kind of shriek back,

319
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,560
 he thinks that he's upsetting the programming.

320
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,240
 He'll throw racial slurs out constantly.

321
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,960
 He says, "And that's one way to get the Matrix to realize that I'm in here."

322
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,640
 He thinks he's trapped in here

323
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
 and he needs to be brought back to the real world.

324
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,680
 Max, that's a really easy way to get beat up super badly.

325
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
 Don't do that.

326
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,120
 But he'll hurl racial slurs at people

327
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
 and people go, "Oh, oh."

328
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,400
 He says this multiple times on the website,

329
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,480
 that's him breaking the Matrix.

330
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 So I can imagine him saying something like,

331
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,880
 "Yeah, I'll just stop on a cockroach and cook it on my cigarette

332
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
 and the people recoil in horror."

333
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
 And he built an entire game around that.

334
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,960
 And you go, "Jason, he didn't build a whole game around that.

335
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,880
 That's just part of the cinematic."

336
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,280
 Level one, stomp on cockroaches, collect them in a jar,

337
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,000
 sell them to the skeleton farmer for a plate of meat and potatoes.

338
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,280
 And so actually now the thing about it,

339
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
 he's not eating the cockroaches.

340
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,200
 He says that to shocked people and then he's like, "Gross."

341
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,360
 And he takes them and got the skeleton farmer.

342
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,400
 And it goes on from there.

343
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
 He elists a couple other levels.

344
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,200
 Level two, you fight ghosts, which is pretty cool.

345
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,440
 Level five, though, he doesn't have three or four.

346
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,760
 Level five, you paint those whole level,

347
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,040
 paint an old lady's house.

348
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,400
 That's the escalator real quick from beating up enemy ghosts.

349
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,760
 Level seven is the last level.

350
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
 He doesn't have a level six list then.

351
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,640
 Talk about lost media.

352
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,280
 Levels, I'd love to know what level three, four and six were.

353
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,360
 Level seven, fight enemies.

354
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
 Find baseball cards for orphanage boys.

355
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,600
 So these phrases make sense to Max Kramer.

356
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,800
 He probably wrote that and was like, "This is brilliant.

357
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,600
 This is...

358
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 When I go into Bioware,

359
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,400
 when I wear everyone's skin and go into Bioware,

360
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
 they will totally buy this game."

361
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,440
 A lot of his games are Diablo clones.

362
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,520
 And he'll say in the description of the game,

363
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,920
 "Hey, what was the game?"

364
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,600
 It was one he wanted to do like a Doom game.

365
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,280
 It had to do with another franchise.

366
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
 And he put on the notes, he goes,

367
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,440
 "Guys, if you are seeing this from this company

368
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,680
 and you don't want it, I'll just change the name."

369
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 So he thinks like, it would make sense.

370
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,120
 If you thought you were trapped in the Matrix,

371
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
 you would assume everyone's paying attention to you, right?

372
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,640
 You're under surveillance.

373
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,040
 So why wouldn't Bioware be looking at this stuff?

374
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,200
 But Max isn't just a man who develops video games.

375
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,560
 Max is also a man who has to break conspiracies,

376
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,520
 whatever it takes.

377
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,880
 Now, Max is the webmaster of immortal Jewish car machine.

378
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
 The Jewish comes into the fact that he's Jewish,

379
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,160
 proudly Jewish, very, very proud Jewish man.

380
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
 And there's nothing wrong with that.

381
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,880
 I mean, early in the racial...

382
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,360
 And some of the racial slurs are anti-Semitic too.

383
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,040
 So he'll call himself that and watch people react to it.

384
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,920
 And he's like, "Ha ha ha!

385
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,280
 Another Matrix destroyed, but really, Max,

386
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
 you're gonna get in a lot of trouble."

387
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,240
 Again, we don't know if he's still alive.

388
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
 I do wish him the best of health.

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,760
 But anyways, let's go ahead and talk about his diarrhea.

390
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,240
 Chala bread, if you don't know what I did,

391
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
 and I had to look this up, it's actual...

392
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
 It's like a traditional bread,

393
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,760
 a traditional holy bread in the Jewish faith.

394
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
 And he tells the story.

395
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
 He goes, "One day I walked into the store

396
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
 and there was five computer-generated people there,

397
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,520
 which would be you and me."

398
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,560
 He sees us as we're just ones and zeros.

399
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,120
 He walks in and he sees five computer-generated people.

400
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
 And he goes, "Hey, can I use your bathroom?"

401
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,080
 And they said, "No."

402
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,240
 So he's like, "Whatever, whatever computer-graphic people,

403
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
 probably threw a couple racial slurs around."

404
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
 He walked out of their building,

405
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,760
 pulled his pants down,

406
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,560
 and sprayed diarrhea in the bushes in front of their business.

407
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,120
 Now, depending on your stance,

408
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,640
 that is either sticking it to the man or super disgusting.

409
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
 But even if I think you're sticking it to the man,

410
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,400
 because they want to let him use the restroom,

411
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,360
 it's still pretty gross.

412
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,960
 But anyways, he sprays diarrhea all...

413
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,840
 And also, in a way, it's quite funny,

414
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
 whether or not it's a political statement, it's still funny.

415
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
 He poops all over the bushes

416
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
 and he leaves.

417
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
 Because they're not chasing this guy, right?

418
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
 He says that he continues to walk down the street

419
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,360
 and he has diarrhea and is under where to.

420
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
 The spray kind of spilled everywhere.

421
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,640
 So he finally does get to a bathroom

422
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,040
 and he starts wiping himself.

423
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,320
 You're like, "Just get to the conspiracy."

424
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,840
 I don't even think there is a conspiracy.

425
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,920
 I think you just want to tell us a diarrhea story.

426
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,240
 No, there is a conspiracy.

427
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,640
 I mean, it is from a homeless insane man,

428
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,840
 but he's wiped...

429
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,720
 But see, here's the thing.

430
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
 Most homeless insane men are just ranting to the air.

431
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,840
 He wrote this down.

432
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
 We can study this years later,

433
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
 because this is from like 2014, 2016.

434
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,680
 He's wiping the diarrhea from his butthole

435
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,840
 and he wipes it all, but then he starts...

436
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,640
 This is so gross.

437
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,200
 I don't even know.

438
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,320
 Is it too late to say?

439
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
 Is it too late to say?

440
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,360
 If you're eating literally anything, just give a head.

441
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
 He's wiping his butthole

442
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
 and he realizes that all the poop's gone,

443
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
 but now there's a clear liquid on his hands.

444
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,040
 And he's like, "What?"

445
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,800
 And he starts to think.

446
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,600
 I've secreted...

447
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,960
 I like this is pure bile coming out of me at this point.

448
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,280
 I've diarrheaed so much, all the poop is gone.

449
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,240
 This is a clear...

450
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,200
 To my two remaining listeners.

451
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
 Thanks for sticking around.

452
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,520
 Thanks for sticking around.

453
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,960
 This is a big 180 from yesterday's episode.

454
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,680
 I needed this.

455
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,880
 I needed it.

456
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,080
 So the story as Max Kramer is wiping away,

457
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,200
 he has this clear liquid all over his hands.

458
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,800
 He thinks it's his stomach bile.

459
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,320
 He thinks it's pure bile.

460
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
 So he smells it.

461
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:11,200
 And he says that it smells like chala bread,

462
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
 which he is familiar with,

463
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,320
 because he is a religious and ethnically a Jewish person.

464
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
 He's eaten chala bread,

465
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,040
 and he thinks that this bile smells like that bread.

466
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,000
 So here's his conspiracy.

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 On the spot he comes up with this.

468
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,160
 On the spot he comes up with this.

469
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,800
 This man should be his own conspiracy theory iceberg.

470
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,880
 He smells this in his mind.

471
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,480
 Chala bread does not smell like stomach bile or diarrhea.

472
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,880
 I've never had it, but I can safely guarantee it doesn't.

473
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
 But in his mind, the smell is similar.

474
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,920
 On the spot he comes up with this conspiracy theory.

475
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,440
 Quote, "Why is bile being sprayed on chalas?

476
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,480
 Neo-Nazis or devil worshipers might have been adding

477
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,280
 gut juice from dead bodies on chalas."

478
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,080
 That's fascinating, the way that mine works.

479
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,320
 What's interesting is we see similar conspiracies ourselves.

480
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
 We see something happen and we go,

481
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
 "That doesn't seem right."

482
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,920
 And then we'll start looking for information,

483
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,160
 but ours are more rational.

484
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,600
 But it's the same process,

485
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,680
 it's the same thought process, right?

486
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,480
 He's making an observation,

487
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
 making a connection,

488
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
 and then going, "Who hates Jewish people?"

489
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
 Saying worshipers, "Neo-Nazis."

490
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,040
 And then he adds,

491
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,760
 what's so weird,

492
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,800
 he adds the detail of getting it from dead bodies.

493
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
 Like not from themselves,

494
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,160
 it's like even more barbaric

495
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,320
 if it's bile coming from dead bodies.

496
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,880
 But he made these connections incredibly fast.

497
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
 My diarrhea smells like chala bread.

498
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,960
 Chala bread is something a Jewish people eat.

499
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,920
 The bread wouldn't normally smell like that,

500
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,440
 and Jewish people wouldn't normally do that.

501
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,600
 Therefore, our enemies are doing that,

502
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,960
 they're poisoning our bread.

503
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,560
 Fascinating insight into the mind of a conspiracy theorist.

504
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,640
 Because we all enjoy conspiracy theories,

505
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,600
 whether you're a hobbyist,

506
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,040
 or you actually believe in them,

507
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,800
 or you fall somewhere in between.

508
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,080
 But to watch something get crafted like that so quickly,

509
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,720
 monkeys don't exist is the same thing.

510
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,280
 It's an observational conspiracy theory.

511
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,480
 You can have a bunch of people watch

512
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
 Hans Warm Hats videos saying monkeys don't exist,

513
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,920
 and they go, "That's right,

514
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,520
 I've never seen a monkey up close."

515
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,000
 It is weird that monkeys throughout the ages,

516
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
 pictures of them have changed,

517
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
 and drawings of them used to look like this,

518
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,320
 and then photos used to look like this.

519
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,840
 It's an observational conspiracy theory.

520
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,360
 I don't believe it one bit,

521
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
 but I understand why people fall for it.

522
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,840
 And this actually,

523
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
 this conspiracy theory has legs.

524
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,360
 This, the Chalet Bread conspiracy theory could catch on,

525
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,760
 because the thing that works

526
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,440
 with observational conspiracy theories is,

527
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,840
 you can't observe it yourself.

528
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,360
 You look and you go, "That's weird,

529
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
 the earth does seem flat."

530
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
 You have to go way, way, way, way high in the sky,

531
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,960
 because it's so massive to start seeing the curve of the earth.

532
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,400
 I've never seen Chalet Bread.

533
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,920
 I looked at some photos online.

534
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,480
 I still couldn't pick it out of a crowded bread.

535
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
 Never tasted it, I've never smelt it.

536
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
 I have no idea, and obviously I don't believe

537
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
 Max Kramer's conspiracy theory,

538
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,360
 but to someone who is just hearing it and passing,

539
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,600
 they would think, "Well, I don't know.

540
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,600
 I know neo-Nazis and St. Warshpers hate Jewish people,

541
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,240
 and I know that there's bread, there's this bread,

542
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,760
 and this guy's Jewish, he's more of authority on it than I am."

543
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,720
 It could have caught on.

544
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,240
 It'd be a small niche conspiracy theory,

545
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,280
 but it could have caught on.

546
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,040
 I don't want to overdo the Max Kramer stuff, honestly.

547
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
 I don't want to do it too much,

548
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,200
 but I find him so interesting because he is...

549
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,680
 He's us.

550
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,200
 He's us to the nth degree.

551
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,680
 He's us in an unfortunate reality.

552
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,440
 We've all dreamed about being video game designers,

553
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
 or being musicians, or having some sort of creative job,

554
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,040
 and we've all sketched out notes

555
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,120
 and thought about how these things would play out,

556
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,000
 we've all come up with our own conspiracy theories.

557
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,800
 But he's us magnified by a hundred times.

558
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,160
 And he's an interesting fellow,

559
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
 because I don't know if that means at any point

560
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,240
 we could all become Max Kramer,

561
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
 or if it takes more than just one bad day,

562
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,720
 does it take underlying mental health issues,

563
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,240
 or is it possible that this is a path we will all...

564
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,840
 Oh, the skin dark.

565
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,560
 I don't actually think that we'll all end up like Max Kramer,

566
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,680
 but I just... I find him as a person so fascinating.

567
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,000
 And honestly, I think I might have started off

568
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,840
 on the wrong story with Max Kramer,

569
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,920
 because when I said that he wants to wear your skin

570
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,280
 and molest your kids,

571
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,160
 I think he's gonna be...

572
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,680
 He didn't do that, by the way.

573
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,160
 He does list his arrest record online,

574
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,920
 and he's never been convicted of a sex crime

575
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,880
 or anything like that, so...

576
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,560
 But that might have been...

577
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,840
 You guys don't know what I say about him going forward.

578
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,520
 You're like, "Jason, you have a funny video game,

579
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,680
 but he threatened to break into my house,

580
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,560
 wear my skin and hurt my children."

581
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
 But also, you can't sugarcoat him.

582
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,720
 He did say those things.

583
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,680
 He did say those things.

584
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,120
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story,

585
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,640
 because it's gonna be...

586
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,160
 This episode is gonna be a little bit long,

587
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,040
 but we are going to fly out to the Arizona desert.

588
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,760
 Ellie Rack call in that world-famous carpenter copter.

589
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,560
 We are leaving behind Santa Monica, California.

590
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,640
 We're headed out to Arizona.

591
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,600
 It's November 1997.

592
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,320
 It's nighttime.

593
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,280
 There's two friends out in the Arizona desert.

594
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,720
 We have names, which is really nice.

595
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,360
 I like that one.

596
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,400
 We have real names.

597
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,960
 Duane Burger, 22 years old, and his friend Mark.

598
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,000
 Skip Shutterville.

599
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,080
 Skip Shutterville showed up as well.

600
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,160
 Duane Burger and Mark are camping

601
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,320
 in an isolated area out in Arizona.

602
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,360
 They're eating.

603
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,320
 They're just relaxing.

604
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,360
 Little campfire burning,

605
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
 illuminating the area around them.

606
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,160
 And then, off in the distance, they hear...

607
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,920
 No!

608
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,600
 What is that?

609
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,640
 What is that type of sound?

610
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
 Someone's stepping on hot coals.

611
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,200
 They hear the sound of a woman screaming off in the distance.

612
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,280
 More troubling than that,

613
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,600
 because that's already bad enough.

614
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,720
 They hear the sounds of screaming women.

615
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,040
 More than one.

616
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,760
 Right?

617
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
 One screaming woman was, you know, like,

618
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,800
 "Oh, that's just kind of bad."

619
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
 When you hear lots of them, you're like,

620
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,400
 "Oh."

621
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,160
 They hear them off in the distance.

622
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,200
 And Duane and Mark are sitting there for a second,

623
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
 and they're like, "Dude, did you hear that?"

624
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
 As the screams are continuing, they're like,

625
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,120
 "Yeah, I'm hearing it right now."

626
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
 And they kind of discuss what to do.

627
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,640
 That would be a troubling situation to be in, right?

628
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,600
 You're in the middle of nowhere.

629
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
 You hear multiple women screaming.

630
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,520
 You might be foxes, right?

631
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,480
 But you keep hearing it.

632
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,680
 You're hearing the sound of screaming women.

633
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,880
 You got to do something, right?

634
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,480
 You got to at least look.

635
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,800
 They're looking around their environment.

636
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,600
 They see in the distance an abandoned mine.

637
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,400
 That seems to be where the sounds are coming from.

638
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,760
 The only weapon they have available is a tire iron.

639
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,840
 They pawn, they pawn their knife.

640
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,680
 They have a tire iron.

641
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,200
 They head off to the mine shaft to see what's up.

642
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,480
 They enter the cave.

643
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,400
 They get 12 yards in.

644
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:30,400
 They see a greenish glow off in the distance and two dark figures in hooded robes.

645
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,280
 Dwayne and Mark kind of look at each other.

646
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,920
 You know, we could take them, two of them, two of us.

647
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,000
 They begin to creep closer to the figures.

648
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,320
 They realize these figures are only five feet tall.

649
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
 I'm like, "That's weird.

650
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
 We can take these guys.

651
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,960
 We can do this."

652
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,520
 So one of them stands up and shouts, "Hey, let those women go."

653
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,400
 Suddenly the two hooded figures speak at the exact same time.

654
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,360
 A booming mechanical voice fills the cave.

655
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
 This is their exact quote.

656
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,480
 "The women are beyond your help.

657
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,680
 Leave it once or perish.

658
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,360
 Leave it once or you shall join them in the caves."

659
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,800
 At that point, before Dwayne and Mark could even react,

660
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,080
 because that's a challenge.

661
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,440
 This is a challenge to see how fast you can run out of the cave.

662
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,200
 They figured they can still take these guys.

663
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,760
 The two figures pull out wands.

664
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,360
 You're like, "Jay, is this really a story you're telling on a Friday?"

665
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,920
 It is.

666
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,640
 The two hooded figures, this is my role-playing game from the other day.

667
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,160
 The two hooded figures pull out wands.

668
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,240
 They shoot out a yellow beam and it hits both the guys.

669
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
 And they're paralyzed.

670
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,400
 They're frozen in place.

671
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,400
 And then the two figures turn and point their wands at the side of the cave.

672
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,080
 Shooting out a green beam.

673
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,240
 And it melted the rock off of the cave wall.

674
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,320
 The two figures walked into this newly formed hole.

675
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,200
 The Earth repairs itself.

676
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,840
 Dwayne and Mark are then unfrozen and run back to their campsite.

677
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,760
 Which I'm gonna add, I'm assuming then they got in their car and left.

678
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,000
 I'm assuming they didn't run to the campsite and they're like,

679
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,720
 "Woo wee, that sure was spooky. Who wants s'mores?"

680
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,680
 I'm assuming then they got in their car and left.

681
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,320
 They knew, no matter what, they couldn't save those women.

682
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,840
 They were left to their fates in the mineshaft.

683
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,960
 This might be the first- I actually didn't plan this,

684
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,280
 because I was trying to find some goofy stories for this episode.

685
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,560
 This was also from ThingAboutToDocs.com.

686
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,440
 I don't think I've ever done two from ThingAboutToDocs.com on the same episode.

687
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,680
 But they got it from Brad Steiger.

688
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,520
 He wrote Out of the Dark.

689
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,960
 Brad Steiger actually is a pretty big name in UFOology.

690
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,120
 So that's the story.

691
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,440
 That's the story you waited for.

692
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
 I enjoy it.

693
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,920
 I do find it very interesting.

694
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,280
 You're like, "Taste and have story."

695
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,840
 That story was interesting, but it wasn't diarrhea.

696
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
 It wasn't diarrhea interesting.

697
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,800
 Like, I had to sit through you talk about a homeless man,

698
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,280
 diarrhea, on a bush and then smelling his hand.

699
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,960
 And then thinking up it was a worldwide anti-semitic conspiracy theory.

700
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,920
 I listened to that to get to this story.

701
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,840
 It's about a bunch of tiny people with magic wands.

702
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
 You're right, you're right.

703
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,200
 You did wait through the diarrhea story for this.

704
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,120
 And maybe it had a really big buildup,

705
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
 because it got canceled from yesterday's episode.

706
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,640
 I personally like this story.

707
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,680
 I'm a big fan of underground hidden civilizations.

708
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,160
 I don't believe in Holloworth,

709
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,520
 but if you even go back to some of my earliest episodes,

710
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,840
 I believe that there are massive cave systems

711
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,800
 that may hold either remnants of a past civilization that lived underground,

712
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,280
 or could still be a civilization today.

713
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,040
 I would be more willing to believe that UFOs come out of those tunnels

714
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,160
 and out of our waterways than I would that they're coming from far distances in space.

715
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,160
 I'd be more willing to think they're coming out of this underground cave system.

716
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,080
 Again, Holloworth is something completely different.

717
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,800
 But that's why I love this story.

718
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,640
 It has that element.

719
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,800
 We've even covered, I don't remember what episode it was,

720
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,400
 but we've covered other stories with aliens melting rock,

721
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,880
 or alien-like beings moving in and out of these stone structures.

722
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,960
 You have that, you have that connection to the lore,

723
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,480
 and then you have that old trope, Mars needs women.

724
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,000
 Aliens, which I'm assuming these guys were alien.

725
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,920
 Their technology definitely was alien,

726
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,200
 and we don't get to see their face.

727
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,000
 They have those cloaks,

728
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,040
 and we've run into stories with aliens wearing robes as well,

729
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,800
 but that old trope of aliens taking our women,

730
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,880
 which even go, I keep saying it's an old trope,

731
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,920
 it's like an old sci-fi trope,

732
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,560
 but we see so often an alien lore,

733
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,320
 they abduct men and they experiment on them,

734
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,640
 they abduct women and they use them for pleasure,

735
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,240
 they use them for reproduction.

736
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,000
 So a man would be more disposable to them.

737
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,040
 So what are they doing with multiple women in the cave?

738
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,800
 It's funny because the story is short,

739
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,680
 it kind of ends, it sounds fantastical,

740
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,080
 but when you extrapolate it out,

741
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,280
 it's quite terrifying.

742
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,960
 Underground alien bases,

743
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,840
 women screaming for help,

744
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,680
 two men trying to rescue them,

745
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,240
 but being overpowered and then just leaving the area.

746
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,600
 And it's not like you could go back to the mine,

747
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,840
 if these things can melt rock,

748
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,160
 they'd be deep within the earth before you ever came back,

749
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,760
 and no one would believe you, right?

750
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,560
 No one would believe you if you came forward like that.

751
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
 So just an interesting story,

752
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,160
 just kind of a spooky story.

753
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,080
 You think you're gonna have a good time with your buddy,

754
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,440
 and you end up having to make a decision,

755
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,600
 do you save human lives?

756
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,640
 But the decision's not really yours to make,

757
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
 you don't have the ability to.

758
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,560
 Hearing the screams of several women

759
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,960
 in a cave that's populated by aliens

760
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,120
 would be the same thing as seeing people drowning offshore,

761
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,640
 and you're not a very good swimmer.

762
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,880
 It's not the aliens in the tunnel that make the story scary,

763
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,000
 or the isolated location of the desert in Arizona.

764
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,480
 It's the feeling of helplessness that makes the story terrifying,

765
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,560
 because we all know what that feels like.

766
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,320
 We may want to step up and help people when we can,

767
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,360
 but sometimes we can't.

768
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:44,880
 We just have to run away until we can no longer hear the screams in the cave.
