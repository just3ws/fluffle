1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 What happens when the predator meets a sexual predator?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,160
 And we're gonna take a look at an interesting UFO encounter, the aftermath, and the craziness that continues to this day today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:26,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,840
 I hope you're having a great day, too.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,680
 I'm not feeling that good. I did quit the chewing tobacco. I have switched to the locenges to

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,800
 help me step down. I feel like I'm just like sweaty and gross, man.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 I've never had this reaction to

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,000
 stepping down off nicotine. I'm thinking I might be coming down with something. I feel gross and

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,360
 here's a little mind-twister for you.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,040
 I actually already recorded this intro of the show earlier and then I did the first story,

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,680
 but I took some energy droplets and now I'm like more energetic.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,360
 So I'm gonna basically probably do everything else again. I don't know. We'll see how this ends.

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,800
 I feel like both gross and like I could wrestle a bear. Super bizarre. Now energy droplets,

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,720
 I should let you know. I found them. In Hood River, we have these little boxes.

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,120
 They're like these little food bank boxes just on random corners and you just put food in there and you take food out if you need some.

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,160
 It's kind of cool. I went there one day. I'll just stop by there once in a while, grab some applesauce.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,880
 But anyways, I went there to get some applesauce and

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,960
 they had these little

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,920
 jars of like homeopathic goo stuff like

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,560
 squeeze 40 drops in your water and drink it. And it was stuff I never heard of so you know me. I took it.

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,000
 I was like, oh, more free stuff and actually works really good. I would tell you what they are if I could pronounce it. This one's

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,920
 L.E.U. Thero

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,400
 and this one's Chizandra. I'm pretty sure it's just like Rose Seaman.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,920
 I think it's like Petal Juice or something like that. But yeah, I actually feel super more energetic than I did when I started recording this episode.

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,400
 Yeah, so I think we're gonna go ahead. I'll probably just re-record everything. I wanted to do a quick note.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,360
 A couple episodes back, a couple months actually. We did an episode on Pankreus Denial

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,400
 where I featured a young girl's gay BTS

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,400
 fanfiction that happened to mention Pankreus now. I really liked that episode.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,600
 That was a fun little journey. And just recently I said, you know what?

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,720
 I hope none of my listeners would ever harass anybody over that.

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,360
 And I went and I checked in on her and I said, hey, I'm Jason Carbone. I do this podcast.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,200
 Here's the episode. I was just making sure everyone was being nice and she got back to me and she was like, thank you so much.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,200
 I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable reading this stuff and you have a great podcast and thank you very much.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 So I wanted to do a quick shout out. Thank you guys.

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,280
 That was a kind of a litmus test, honestly. When I released that episode, I thought I want to see how people react.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,560
 If I put up this Pankreus Denial story and people bombard her with negative comments,

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,680
 I think it would change the tone of the show, honestly.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,040
 I don't think I'd be able to highlight those kind of individual weird things.

39
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,560
 I would have to stick to kind of broader topics. But the fact that I was able to say, oh, listen,

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,520
 here's this girl's story and because I provided the link and yeah, that was awesome, guys.

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,280
 I was really kind of concerned about that at the time and I, it was in the back of my mind.

42
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,600
 At that point, it showed me going on maybe 40 or 50 episodes and you guys have been really cool,

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,360
 really respectful to each other. I think, yeah, it's a great community.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,440
 So I'm really happy to have you guys as listeners and like I said, to have you guys as friends.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,440
 We are having pushback and I'm not going to go into super detail because I have to see what the next step is.

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,800
 But one of the people that I did an episode on has found that episode and they are not happy.

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:50,360
 So we will see if, how they want to proceed with that. I cannot make any comments other than that at this time.

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,320
 But as it goes forward, and you guys can easily figure it out because it's the only video that's getting down.

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,200
 It's the only video that's getting consistently downvoted.

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,600
 But I don't want to specifically say anything until this particular person decides to make a move

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,600
 and then we will go forward because it, I listened to the episode the other day and I stand by it.

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,760
 And yeah, I just need to wait because you know, we have, you know, the podcast is safe,

53
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,560
 but YouTube, it's easy to get videos removed and copyright strikes and all sorts of stuff like that.

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,160
 So, and again, I also don't want to harass him like, oh, you don't like my video.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,720
 You're getting your army to come after me. You're online at, you know, I'm not going to be, that's not the point of the show.

56
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,000
 However, if it does get out of hand, I will have to address it.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,720
 But for right now, I'm just kind of stating it like that a little bit of news segment on the show.

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,080
 Let's go ahead and get started.

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,320
 So I've actually recorded this part of the show three times. I had it focus. I had it on an earlier episode.

60
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,240
 I cut it. I recorded it before I took my Rose Seaman.

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,080
 I think that's really the only way I can describe it.

62
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,160
 It tastes like a rose was like just jacking off in a bottle.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,280
 There was a sexual predator on the set of the movie, The Predator, and that's funny enough.

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,720
 But this is the thing. This has always been the key. Every, like I said, every quarter.

65
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,280
 This is a couple of times it always seems to run a little long.

66
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,720
 So I'm going to try to keep it short.

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,600
 Let's get to the details. There is an actor named Stephen Wilder Strigel.

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,600
 He is a convicted sex offender with children and his friend is Shane Black, the director of The Predator.

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,360
 He did Iron Man 3. He did The Nice Guys. I think he did Kiss, Kiss, Bing, Bing.

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,520
 He wrote The Original Predator and their friends.

71
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,920
 So when he got out of jail, he did a six month stint for enticing a child by a minor

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,560
 and then some other just kind of legally risk of injury to a child.

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,960
 And so he did six months. He got out. Hey buddy, Shane, can you give me a leg up?

74
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
 And she's like, oh yeah, sure. No.

75
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,040
 And he starts writing these little parts for him into these movies.

76
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,160
 In The Recent Predator, Olivia Munn is in it.

77
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,120
 There's the scene where she's jogging and like a creepy guy comes up to her and is like,

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,960
 hey baby, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Olivia Munn blows him off.

79
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,440
 The day before it's supposed to premiere at a film festival, somehow Olivia Munn finds out

80
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,040
 that this Steven Wilder/Straigle guy is a convicted child, a convicted sex offender.

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,200
 She tells the studio, studio wanting no bad press and this time

82
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,040
 clipped the scene out of the movie.

83
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,480
 And then what happened was Olivia Munn feels like the cast and the director blackballed her

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,560
 because they had another like photo shoot or press conference.

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
 They didn't show up or something like that.

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,560
 That's the story in a nutshell. This is the reason why it's on this show because again,

87
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,000
 that's just gross. And even though it fits into the true crime thing,

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,640
 it's not incredibly interesting. This is why it's on the show.

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:45,320
 This type of behavior is why people believe in pizza gate and frazzledrip and all of that stuff.

90
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:53,880
 This type of thing where a powerful person hires a convicted sex offender to be in multiple movies

91
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,800
 when somebody powerful and rich. I mean, Shane Black isn't like the biggest guy in Hollywood,

92
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,600
 but he's also not a small fry. He's also not a first time director.

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:09,560
 When people who have sway protect pedophiles, it is not that far removed.

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,840
 It is far removed, but people make the connection.

95
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,280
 If this single high level director, name director, is protecting one pedophile,

96
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,080
 therefore Hillary Clinton is protecting a thousand pedophiles.

97
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,840
 Ergo, pizza gate is real. That's why people believe in this stuff.

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,800
 I have my own thing about pizza gate and I'll talk about that in a second,

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,560
 but that's why people believe in these worldwide pedophilic networks and all of that.

100
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,240
 And that like Obama's like, hey, Queen Elizabeth, try this.

101
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,120
 And they're like, oh yeah, she's so hot. That's why they believe in this stuff because we see

102
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,320
 smaller proof of it. We see pedophiles getting protected.

103
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,160
 We saw it in Britain with that. What was that guy's name? The fat dude.

104
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,840
 He recently, he was like, did the pop stuff. I'll have to look him up after the show,

105
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,360
 but it's going to take too much time. Not Gary Glitter, but there's a bunch of them.

106
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,880
 David Bowie like banged a 13 year old. That was the weirdest thing.

107
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,800
 David Bowie bangs like a 13 or 14 year old. And then like when he passes away,

108
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,920
 it's like, oh, he's this great icon. And me and my friend are like, dude,

109
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,520
 remember when he banged that 14 year old? Like never, never mentioned, never mentioned.

110
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,360
 So it's just so bizarre. And that's why people believe that those big conspiracies,

111
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,640
 because we see the little ones. Oh, oh, and you guys are thinking, oh,

112
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,680
 I just enticed a girl by a computer. No, he felt her up. She was actually a distant relative of

113
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,000
 his, according to him. She was 14. Probably should have included all this detail earlier.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,240
 I did the other two times I recorded it. She was 14 years old. He was in his 40s.

115
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,720
 They were talking online. He was saying she was sexy. They end up meeting up. He fills her boobs

116
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,640
 up. Gross dude, like seriously, come on, man. And it's always this huge thing like, oh, I was just

117
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,880
 lonely or I was feeling bad about my life. Whatever, man. Anyway, so that's beside the point. The

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,440
 point is, is that that's why these conspiracies fester. I think stuff like frazzled drip is a

119
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,320
 smoke screen. Frazzled drip has been debunked. If you don't know what frazzled drip is, it's supposedly

120
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,560
 a video of Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton eating a baby or girl, something like that.

121
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,280
 So yeah, that's the thing. You have real conspiracies like this guy hiring a

122
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,000
 chalm lester. You have, and then they're turning to these crazy conspiracies like Reptilians or

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,680
 kidnapping kids from Iowa and taking them to Antarctica. That's where we have to be careful,

124
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,080
 because the truth is always more interesting. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here,

125
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,960
 because I'm moving like a mile a minute. This one's super weird and not just the story itself,

126
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,640
 but the path that took me on afterwards. What we're going to talk about here, and I was reading it,

127
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,080
 and I was like, I was like, this is a UFO story I can get behind. This is the story. This is

128
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:46,040
 Cash Landrum. Cash Landrum is a UFO incident that involved three people. This took place back in 1980.

129
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,520
 It involved two older women, like, I mean considerably older. They were like in their 60s

130
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,160
 or 70s when it happened. Betty Cash and Vicki Landrum, and there was a little kid in the back

131
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,640
 seat or baby or something like that. They're driving down the road. They're in Texas. It's at night,

132
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:07,560
 and they see this diamond shaped light vehicle that's illuminated. I guess it's better to put it

133
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,640
 fly overhead, and they're like, what was that? They didn't cuss because they're from Texas.

134
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,080
 It's 1980, and they're Christian, which we'll find out later. The thing flies overhead, and they're

135
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,480
 like, what the heck? What the tarnation? And so they keep driving on the road. It's kind of like

136
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,400
 an abandon area. Not abandoned, but not civilized, I guess. They're driving on the road for a bit

137
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,520
 more, and it comes back over, and at this point it kind of stops in front of them. And it was weird

138
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:40,600
 because you got this glowing diamond that's like, so and then Vicki says, that's Jesus. He will not

139
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,120
 hurt us. And she's like, let's get out of the car and go see this glowing diamond floating in the

140
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,920
 sky. So she talks cash. She talks Betty to getting out of the car. And the first thing they realized

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,640
 when they got out of the car was how hot it was. And they said they could see fire coming out of

142
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,040
 the bottom of it. And it was kind of like moving up and down like the fire almost like a hot air

143
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,440
 balloon was helping propel it up a bit. And it was just kind of hovering there. And it kept getting

144
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,120
 hotter and hotter and hotter as they were outside of their vehicle. At a certain point,

145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,560
 they're like, dude, we need to get back in this car because like we're otherwise we're going to melt.

146
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,920
 They jump back in the car and Betty said she actually had to use her jacket to touch the door

147
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,040
 handle to open it to get inside. It was that hot. And when she touched the dashboard of the car, her

148
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,440
 hand like melt, not her hand didn't melt, but you know what I mean? Like pushed into the vinyl

149
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,000
 because the car was getting heated up at this point. 23 Shinne helicopters

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,200
 show up. Some of them were Shinne helicopters, I should say, but it was 23 helicopters. They counted

151
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:47,720
 them. And they're surround the diamond. And they're like, what's going on there at this point at this

152
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,200
 point. So the diamond had actually come down close enough that it was kind of blocking the road.

153
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,920
 The helicopters show up. I'm going to keep saying helicopters show up just so I can make the noises.

154
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,280
 It ain't me. It ain't me. The helicopters flying around, they're playing

155
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,680
 Cleatance Clearwater. And so the diamond slowly starts to go up and takes off. And the helicopters

156
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,480
 are like, ah, and they didn't actually scream. But anyway, so she they drive away. Now these young

157
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,440
 ladies, I why am I saying the young, I know they're 80, these old ladies go home. They go to sleep.

158
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,480
 They're like, that was weird. Next morning, they wake up, they're super sick. They're like,

159
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,640
 vomiting, they're nauseous. No, they did not eat a Taco Bell. Their skin started to boil.

160
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,800
 And they're like, oh my God, like they started getting like these burns on them. Betty ends up

161
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,280
 like after a couple days, she keeps getting sicker and sicker. She can't even move. They take her to

162
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,480
 the hospital. And both Betty and Vicki, the nurses are like, oh my God, you guys look like you're

163
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,480
 burn victims, which is not something you want to hear when you walk into a hospital. They actually

164
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,400
 are like, we don't know what happened to us. Like we don't know why we're so sick. And some people

165
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,680
 go maybe there was radiation. So people have gone out there with Geiger counters, there's no

166
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,040
 radiation. So they go, well, there's this other type of radiation that could have caused it.

167
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,040
 Some people thought it could have been some sort of aerosol, some sort of like self defense mechanism

168
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,120
 released by the vehicle, the UFO, not their car, to like mess with them. So no one's ever been able

169
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,600
 to pin down and say exactly this. What they did was they said, you know what, that UFO was whatever

170
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,160
 it was, it's from another planet. But the government must have known about it because all those

171
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,080
 Chinooks were there. And that's a government helicopter. Those are generally used by US

172
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,680
 forces. And I think Britain might use them too. But so what happens was they actually

173
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,120
 contact their US senators in the area. And the senators said file a complaint with the Air Force

174
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,520
 Base and see what happens. Like, you know, they're because oh, and they weren't the only ones who

175
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,800
 saw this also, the 23 helicopters aside, there was two other cars in different parts of the area

176
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,960
 that saw the light. So people really took it seriously in that area. And of course, you know,

177
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,080
 they're boiling the people are like, I saw UFO. And you're not going to be like, oh, it was just

178
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,120
 swamp gas as they're like barely mobile and their eyes are burnt shut. It wasn't that bad. But they

179
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,400
 were like had physical issues with their skin and things like that. So the senators are like, well,

180
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,880
 once you file a report, file a complaint with the Air Force Base in the area. And they were,

181
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,800
 they said, well, according to Wikipedia, it says that cash landroom in Colby, I keep thinking Colby

182
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,000
 is an infant. How old is this kid? Anyways, the baby was talking apparently to they were interviewed

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,520
 at length at Bergstrom Air Force Base, and they were told to hire a lawyer and seek financial

184
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,800
 compensation. This is where the story started to get a little weird. Now I could see the senators

185
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,040
 going, well, you just file a complaint with the Air Force Base. But I can't imagine the Air Force

186
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,280
 Base going, mm hmm. So you're melted and you're vomiting for the past five years. You should

187
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,760
 sue us. No, what? Like if I go into Mervins and I'm like, hey, I tripped on your shirt. They don't

188
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,680
 go, hey, well, you know what you should sue us. That's when the story started to go sideways for me.

189
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:54,760
 Inter lawyer Peter Gersten took on the case pro bono. He says, I am going to do this. They

190
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,440
 were in court for several years, suing them for $20 million. And in 1986, I remember this event

191
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,080
 happened in 80. In 1981, they talked to the senators. Now we're 1986. And the judge dismissed the case.

192
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,840
 Judges missed the case and said that the plaintiffs could not say, could not prove the helicopters

193
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,880
 came from the US government. And military officials testified that the United States Army does not

194
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,680
 have a large diamond shaped aircraft in their possession. So it went to that level of court,

195
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,880
 where they were actually having witnesses coming and all of that stuff. Definitely too early for,

196
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,040
 you know, like court TV, and I'm not saying that flippantly, but I'm saying like when courts are

197
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,080
 being recorded, I'm sure you can find the transcripts of it. So I was like, still, that's a really

198
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,680
 interesting story. I started looking into the debunking stuff on it. The debunking is actually

199
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,040
 really weak on this one. The main point, there's two main points when they're debunking this.

200
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,640
 There's no way you could fly 23 helicopters in a group, like around something. And I was like,

201
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,080
 that does seem like a lot. And I, they were fairly insistent about the number. That's a lot of

202
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,360
 helicopters to be in an area and not crash into each other. So I don't know. Another one of the

203
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,120
 other witnesses farther away said they saw 14 or 12 fly overhead. That sounds more believable than

204
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:17,160
 23. And then the other thing was the, how, how sick and disgusting did Betty Cash look before the

205
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,760
 UFO? We don't know what her medical history was before the UFO. She might have always been covered

206
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:30,200
 in boils and vomiting all the time. So because we don't know what she was like before, we can't really

207
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,560
 say that the UFO caused that. And I can understand that in some sort of like liability lawsuit,

208
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,640
 which I guess that was at $20 million. But if someone's like walking around with boils and you

209
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:47,000
 can like look at photos of her pre boil, come on. It is curious though to, in the debunkers favor,

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,080
 that they said, well, let us actually look at the medical reports when you went to the hospital

211
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,960
 and reported this. And Betty was like, no, I'm not going to show them to you in private. I don't

212
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,240
 want to release my medical reports. And now to be fair, I don't think I would release my medical

213
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,240
 reports to a debunker, you know, either. I mean, because if I've lost the lawsuit, what do I have

214
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,440
 to gain anyways? But they're saying their whole thing is we don't know how sick she really was.

215
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,880
 They can't really debunk the sighting because there was multiple witnesses. And I mean, they can try

216
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,760
 and they can look at her and go, yeah, you're gross, but when did you get gross? It's their question.

217
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,880
 So interesting. Here's the key thing though. I read that and I was like, okay, this is cool.

218
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,760
 This is a UF story I could get behind. I keep saying UF. This is a UFO story I can get behind.

219
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,680
 It's fairly interesting. It's nothing too insane. You know, I like this one.

220
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:49,480
 As I was looking at the debunking stuff, the lawyer's name came popped back up. So 2012,

221
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,440
 you guys remember 2012, Mayan, Prophecy and all that stuff. Peter Gersten lives in Arizona. And he

222
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:06,840
 said at 11/11/2012, I am going to climb up Bell Rock in Sedona, a dimensional portal.

223
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,640
 It's going to open up. I'm going to jump into it. Okay, so here's just quote. I'm not going to read

224
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,960
 the whole thing because it's kind of boring, but most of you will think I'm delusional and that

225
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,640
 my insane act will certainly result in my death. Death is inevitable, at least nowadays. And 100

226
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,960
 years from now, it won't matter whether I died in 2012 or 2013 or even 2020, but I believe that some

227
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,640
 type of cosmic portal will be opening at that time and place. And then an opportunity will

228
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,800
 present itself. I fully expect that it will either lead to the next level of this cosmic program,

229
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,640
 freedom from an imprisoning time loop, a magical Martian like bubble, I don't know what that is,

230
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:59,880
 or something equally as exotic. So he climbs up. Oh yeah, and also like a couple of months before

231
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:09,400
 2012, a dolphin bites. He's snorkeling. He was diagnosed with cancer before this and he was

232
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,720
 like, you know what, I'm just going to spend the my life. He's doing fine. He's still alive,

233
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,480
 spoiler alert, but it's in remission. But anyway, so he goes, oh, and the story's not over, not

234
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,760
 total spoiler. He's doing all this stuff, right? He goes snorkeling and he's swimming with the dolphin

235
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,040
 and the dolphin bites his arm. But when he looked down at his arm, he saw three long scratches,

236
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,600
 like where the teeth scratches arm and then one smaller scratch next to him. He looked at his

237
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,960
 arm and he put in his blog, he goes, the dolphin was trying to write 1111 on my arm. Because

238
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:50,840
 that's the time he has to jump into the portal. Why would you want this guy free or not working on

239
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,120
 your court case? You, you, I, they probably saw something. I don't think they saw nothing. They

240
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,480
 may have even seen some sort of craft that was being worked on. It could have been in just,

241
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,840
 you know, having some trouble. The helicopter showed up. It could have been alien. I don't know.

242
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,000
 But I think that story is more believable and it's more intriguing, honestly, than a bunch of

243
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,120
 lights just sipping around in the sky. This is like a close encounter of the second time they

244
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,280
 are impacted by it. Why would you hire this guy? They didn't hire him. He was free. Why would you

245
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,880
 want this free dude working on your court case? He wants to jump into a portal. Now to be fair,

246
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:32,360
 the court case was in 1981. He's talking about jumping into a portal in 2012. So maybe he wasn't

247
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,240
 as crazy back then, but I mean, I bet you back then he was like jump like practicing jumping. Oh,

248
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,280
 yeah, this guy does practice jumping in portals. He climbs up to the bell rock all the time still.

249
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,920
 Okay, so he doesn't jump in 2012. The county actually supposedly sent a helicopter up there to

250
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:57,880
 try to stop him. He was up there and he waited around and he was there for a while. He waited

251
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,840
 past the 1111 portal didn't open up. He didn't jump. Now see, it was originally called leap of

252
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,960
 faith because he was originally saying he would have to jump before the portal opened up to show

253
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,360
 that he had faith in the computer or cosmic computer program. But he didn't jump. He walked back down

254
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:19,160
 and everyone was relieved. As I was researching him, I find this article, much more recent article.

255
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:29,320
 He turned 74 recently. And if you add seven and four, you get 11. He 11 is a mystical number,

256
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,880
 apparently at 1111 on his 11 birthday. He's going to jump off the he's going to jump off the bell

257
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,520
 rock. He has a sub session with jumping off the bell rock. And he says he needs to bring

258
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,120
 I just don't this stuff's funny because I don't get how people get latched onto these certain

259
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:58,040
 ideas. He has to bring 2222 people to the top of bell rock by 2222 of the winter solstice,

260
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:05,000
 December 21st of 2018. He's still doing this this year. He's going to have to bring

261
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,840
 not I don't think they'll have to be up there at the same time. That would be incredibly dangerous.

262
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:17,000
 But before 2222. So what is that like before 10 o'clock 10 20? Why do I care?

263
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Why am I trying to figure out the time? The point is he has to bring a bunch of people up.

264
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,800
 And he has like three months left to do it. And then he will be able to go to the next level of

265
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,760
 his quote unquote holographic reality program. The one UFO story that I've looked at over the

266
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:40,200
 course of the show that I was like that sounds really, really likely this guy's tied into it.

267
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,560
 The vortex jumper. I got it. I'm intrigued by this dude. But we all know he's not going to jump

268
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,000
 this time either. I hope he doesn't jump, obviously. Oh, and some guy was like, Hey man,

269
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,280
 don't jump. And he was like, Don't you want to see something mystical happen? He's like,

270
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,720
 Yeah, I want to see something mystical happen. I don't want you to jump either.

271
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,280
 He's weird. It's delusion. I wouldn't be surprised if he's trying to get money. You know what? I'm

272
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,920
 going to get myself in trouble again if I start calling people frauds. But Peter Gersten, please

273
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:19,800
 don't ever offer to represent me in any sort of UFO related trial. Because you just just too weird

274
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,280
 even for diamond shaped UFOs floating around Texas, even people boils. And that is a high bar.

275
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,960
 Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is going to be your email address. You're going to also hit us

276
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,560
 up at facebook.com/deadrabberadio. At Twitter, wait, now that doesn't make sense. Twitter.

277
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:43,640
 Wait, what? How to at Jason O. Carpenter is going to be our Twitter. Fuck. At Jason O. Carpenter is
