 When a woman hitches a ride with a creepy trucker, you will guess what happens next.
 And then we go hunting with three Indians in Canada. The year is 1938.
 They're looking to just shoot some elk, bag a deer or two, but instead they find a bear
 fighting Bigfoot today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I think
 you guys can hear I'm feeling much, much better. Still a little short-winded, still can't
 breathe through my nose, but I'm A-OK on everything else. It's funny because I've been
 in self-isolation for about four days, four days in a row, but at a certain point it's
 like I gotta go outside, right? Going crazy in here. So I went and I don't have the coronavirus,
 okay? If I do have it, everyone in town has it. But anyways, I'm walking down the street
 and we're after the day where everyone flooded the Walmart, flooded the Rite Aid, the Walgreens,
 the Rosars, bought all the stuff. The day after everyone panicked. Walking down the street,
 everything's kind of back to normal. People at the coffee shop, people are buying overpriced
 toys. It's just the way Hood River is. But every so often I'd go and I'd have a little
 cough. I felt like the guy in a zombie movie who's gotten bit, but doesn't want anyone
 else to know that he's bit. I'd be like walking around and I'd be like, I have to cough and
 I'm like, I'm like duck into an alley and go coughing on my elbow. Did anyone see that?
 Expecting cops to come and trank me. And the next thing I know, I wake up in some isolation
 ward in China, but I am still taking the steps to self-isolate. I'm still doing all that.
 I have one more grocery run to do tomorrow and then I'm sitting well. I have a lot of
 stuff now, but I'd like to diversify my food and drink supplies. But I hope you guys are
 doing great. And honestly, other than like funny stories like I just told you, feeling
 like I was the traitor in a zombie movie, we're really not going to talk about the coronavirus.
 We're going to treat the coronavirus like I treat politics on this show. You get enough
 of that just turning it on the television set. Doesn't mean it's not important, but
 you get enough of it. So every show often I might tell a funny anecdote or two, but
 we're not going to talk about any conspiracy theories. I'm sorry. Actually, I'm not. I
 already read too much of it and it gets kind of overwhelms me and then I will just have
 to, you know, go and start playing balloon invasion. Just some flash came from like
 2011. It's like my comfy game or I'm playing Minecraft and stuff like that. So we're not
 going to talk about coronavirus unless a huge news pops up about it. I think there's major
 outlets that can cover that. We're going to cover fun stuff like our next story. Now,
 our next story is fun for us because we weren't involved in it, but there's multiple people
 suffered because of this story. Still very fascinating. And I want to give a shout out
 to a classic Patreon. I want to give shout outs to people who continue to support the
 show. Dave, Dave is one of the earliest Patreon supporters. Thank you so much for supporting
 this show. Really, really helps a lot. We're going to give you the end of your cancer where
 the Patreon. You can always help the show just by getting the word out. I always want
 to give a shout out to the people out there too who can't financially support the show.
 You can still help get the word out about the show. That helps a lot as well. But thank
 you so much Dave and all my other Patreons as well. Dave, take the keys to the Jason
 Jalopy. We are hitting the highways checking the highways, going down the road. I can't
 sing the rest of that. You guys don't even know what song that was, you lunatic. If I
 sing the rest of it, the video will get taken off YouTube. But let's just say some people
 are born to be wild. That's unrelated to the tune I was just singing. It's May 22, 2019.
 So very, very recent. Those are cars driving by. Or in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. And it's
 Interstate 24 in this woman's car, this unnamed woman. She should be named. We'll know why.
 I'll tell you why she should be named at the end of it. Her car is out of gas. Oh no. What?
 Did I forget how to operate a car? Actually no, I shouldn't make fun of her. I've had
 cars run out of gas multiple times. So we're not going to mock her. Because I'm empathetic.
 If I never ran out of gas, I would totally make fun of her. Cars are driving by her.
 People are nowhere. And then a truck, like a big rig pulls up. It slows down. I really
 got my sound effects on point today. I should get sick more often. Birds are chirping. Okay,
 that was pushing it. That was pushing it. Anyways, truck pulls over. The trucker's name
 is Roy Nelsch. Roy Nelsch. And he's like, "Hey ma'am, you need a lift?" Now, we're not
 going to make this an interactive episode. But if you were in this situation, your car
 is out of gas here in the middle of nowhere, a semi pulls up, and a guy offers you a ride.
 Would you get in? If a truck... I've had people offer to give me rides because I walk around
 Sacramento all the time. Did I tell you guys about this? I did tell you that guy was like,
 all super creepy and trying to get me in his car because he wanted to bang me. I know I
 mentioned that a couple episodes ago. You're like, "No, you never told us that story."
 Yeah, but I'm not going to tell it now. But anyways, sometimes I'm walking through the
 hood of a river and people will pull up and be like, "Hey, you want a ride?" And I'll
 be like, "No, stranger danger. I don't tell them that, but I don't get in rides with people
 I don't know." So anyways, you wouldn't get in this truck, right? I wouldn't get in this
 semi at all. I wouldn't get in a semi truck of someone I knew because I still think they
 were a serial killer. But anyways, this woman goes... I don't know what time of day this
 happened, but this woman goes, "Sure, I'll get in your truck." So anyways, you know what
 happens next, right? But you don't. I love this story. Truck is driving the ladies in
 the passenger seat and the truck driver's driving. And she needed to get off at this
 next exit. The truck driver's like, "Yeah, totally." Pass that exit. And she's like,
 "Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm supposed to get off that exit." He's like, "Oh, sorry, sorry."
 Passes the next exit. Now she's getting nervous. Sweatin', hearts racing. Pass the next exit.
 She starts freaking out because now she realized she made a mistake. Roy, the truck driver,
 pulls out a gun and says, "I'm gonna kidnap you and I'm gonna rape you." Now I don't
 know if he said it like that. He probably was a little more menacing and he probably
 like, "I don't know. I don't know if he built it up or sugar-coated it or something, but
 I don't know if he was that blunt." But the point is, is that now she's aware that she
 got into the wrong truck. She's gonna be kidnapped, which she's currently being kidnapped and
 raped and possibly murdered, right? He didn't threaten to murder her yet. Get in the sleeper
 part of the cab. She's a little like box room if you're not familiar with semi-trucks. Behind
 the driver's wheel, I'm apparently not familiar with semi-trucks, but you know where the driver
 wheel, you know the steering wheel, that's what it's called, the place where the driver
 sits and steers it. Behind him is like a bed. So imagine if it was Optimus Prime, it would
 be like in where Optimus Prime's head is. That's where the sleeper area is. So she gets
 back there and he, or he's trying to get her back there and she starts fighting. She starts
 putting up a fight. So he's driving the semi and he's fighting this girl and she gets the
 gun and she points it at him and pulls the trigger. Click. Now, it's unknown whether
 or not the gun was unloaded or the gun misfired. I think the gun was unloaded, honestly. I
 think if you looked at serial killers, like if you really like delved into serial killer
 stuff, I bet a lot of times they use unloaded guns because that's even more like you could
 have got away, but I tricked you with my gun. Serial killers are so just like mentally ill,
 mentally deficient, and they're so powerless in normal life that any amount of power they
 can get is what they crave. Generally, I've said this before, serial killers, serial killers
 are men, really, men whose dicks don't work. When you bake it down to that, it's men who
 can't get off unless they're killing people who remind them of their mom or the girl who
 broke up with them in high school and they never got over it. Like all serial killers,
 even the serial killers who are trying to bang their dad or the boy who broke up them in
 high school, like John Wayne Gacy, it's all, their dicks don't work. I should have said
 this is going to be an explicit episode. So they need every sense of power. So having
 a loaded gun and pointing it at someone is a sense of power, but tricking someone, being
 like, oh, you could have got away if you knew the gun wasn't loaded. Now you're chained
 up and you can't get away. I think, because John Wayne Gacy did that. He'd go, hey, you
 want to see a magic trick? It wasn't so much the fact that he overpowered the kids, it was
 the fact that he tricked them into their own demise. John Wayne Gacy would put handcuffs
 on and then put his hands behind his, or have his hands behind his back to the handcuffs
 on and then go, ta-da. Look it, I did it. It's a magic trick. You want to see how to
 do it. The kid would be like, yeah, sure. He'd get handcuffed behind the back and John
 Wayne Gacy would say, the trick is to have the key and then he would kill the kid. And
 so that's the part of that power trip. Now, John Wayne Gacy, his dick didn't work unless
 he was in that situation. He was a powerless little man. And that's this guy too. This
 guy had no respect for serial killer. We've done episodes on this in the past. Long time
 listeners are like, oh, I'm fast forwarding. I've heard this rant. But it's important because
 I think they're punks and I think they're little babies. They didn't get enough love
 in their life. So now they think that he can kill a couple prostitutes and then everything,
 now they're powerful. Whatever, bro. Disgust me. But anyways, let's get back to this piece
 of filth. He's driving on the road. She grabs the gun. She pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.
 He pulls another gun out and pistol whips her handcuffs her throws a blanket on her. Now
 I'm assuming at points he was at least slowing down the truck. I don't know if he was going
 60 this whole time, but and he actually is still driving because I know now remember
 this part. I remembered as an I looked over my notes. So he is still driving because what
 happens is she's handcuffed. She's underneath a blanket. She slips one of her hands out
 of a handcuff takes the blanket throws it over his head gets him in a chokehold and
 begins grabs the wheel and begins swerving the semi side to side across the freeway.
 At this point, the guy pulls over and kicks her out of the truck. He's just like this
 is not this whatever my intent was totally not worth being kicks her out of a truck.
 Her car is driving down the road and sees kind of what's going on pulls over and she
 goes oh my God you won't believe what just happened. He's like yeah it's all you get
 kicked out of a car and you have handcuffs on. Yeah yeah call the police. The police pull
 over this truck. The trial is going on now. This is why this is in the news. Roy ends
 up getting arrested pretty quickly and the trial is going on now. So we're getting all
 this information out about him. So first you're thinking maybe he's just some guy who can't
 get it up and then he decides to pull a gun out and try to like rape this woman or try
 to have power over this woman. What the police have found so they found in his property trucks
 and home and all that stuff a ledger full of the names of women and children which is
 weird I don't know how they'd have how they know the names are of children unless it was
 like Bobby or like current names like all the names are like Edward and Bella you'd
 probably be like oh there's a kid names but other than that they must be able to connect
 it to some living people. He had in his possession not only to have this weird ledger but he had
 10,000 images of child abuse. He had bloody underwear in his truck. He had chat conversations
 with other people offering children for abuse. Blood on his steering wheel. Blood on his
 driver's seat. Blanket with blood stains. Rope handcuffs. Stun gun. Which is funny because
 it's good that's not funny not owning a stun gun is funny but it's a good thing he didn't
 use that on her because it could have went somewhere else. So they don't know if Roy
 Nellish is some sort of sicko serial killer if he's just a sicko if he's a poser if he's
 a pretender who knows but he's currently on trial and hopefully he goes to prison for
 a long long time and I'll say this the reason why we should know that woman's name because
 that's pretty badass right that's badass like that woman and I could understand her not
 wanting to get her name out there but especially it's kind of creepy that he has like this
 chat combos with others offering these kids for abuse. Who are those other people? Why
 aren't they in jail? Hopefully they're headed to jail. Maybe she just doesn't want the attention
 to something like that but that's a hero. We applaud you nameless woman on Interstate
 24 because you took every step you needed to to survive and when you're dealing with
 a sicko creep like that you stopped him. His reign of terror ended because you were totally
 badass so that applause is not is not sarcastic really I mean you are an honorary member of
 the fluffle which is the name which is the scientific name for a group of rabbits. You
 are a honorary member of our patreon nameless woman that's weird. You are a dead rabbit
 radio person I don't know you guys get it I'm trying to instill an honor on her but
 I don't really need to because nature made her an awesome butt kicking person that's
 all the honor she needs. Anyways maybe she's traveling America now killing other serial
 killers so I thought that story is really interesting that guy's disgusting and I was
 able to go off on another serial killer rant because it's just been about 200 episodes
 since I've done that because I don't want to beat a dead horse but god I hate those
 guys. Let's go ahead and though and move on to our next topic so Dave let's go ahead
 and fire up the carbonar copter we're gonna park the Jason Jalopy we're gonna take the
 carbonar copter because we got a long way to go from Kentucky we're headed up to I
 think so I don't know I don't know where's that on the map we're headed up to British
 Columbia and we're going to a place called Chillowack now we're gonna talk about a very
 bizarre news article and when I first saw it I go hmm there's a large possibility this
 news article doesn't exist we've run into that a lot on this podcast where we find a
 news article and find out that it's forged or it's some viral marketing for some movie
 or something like that. This one I actually found the article it was published in a newspaper
 called the Chillowack Progress you can go to the link it's in the newspapers archives
 this article is 100% real whether or not the events are the article is real so that's
 a good sign because we've covered we've uncovered a lot of hoaxes on this show but anyway so
 we're headed up to Chillowack and that's in British Columbia we're going back to the
 year it's 1938 it's February 23rd 1938 and we're going to land and first we're gonna
 pick up a newspaper because this is an odd this this every news article should have a
 lead like this leads always the first paragraph of the article in a newspaper newspapers are
 written like an inverted pyramid the way they do it is the most important information is
 at the top in the further you read in the article the less important information gets
 it's very easy to edit and you just stop reading halfway through and then there's a thing called
 burying the lead where you have the most important stuff at the bottom but this one that's from
 journalism that's from a journalism degree but every article in the world should be written
 with this every article should just start with this paragraph actually but if you can't
 start with this paragraph you should start with this style here we go a terrific battle
 a fight for life of prodigious strength matched against savage ferocity between a hairy giant
 of the Sasquatch so right in the article they're just like oh yeah by the way Bigfoot exists
 this is a real newspaper this isn't a tabloid this is an actual newspaper still around apparently
 a terrific battle a fight for life of prodigious strength matched against savage ferocity between
 a hairy giant of the Sasquatch and a huge bear which after 10 minutes of wild struggle
 fury and rage dot dot dot I'm not gonna give away the ending they do there's a thing called
 burying the lead there's a thing just giving away the ending in the opening paragraph they
 should have just ended it there but that's how every article should be it's just one
 of that that just get your heart pumping so in this article it explains the story of
 these three Indians they're Harrison River Indians so let's join them in the forest this
 happens only a week before February 23rd so we don't have far to go back in time and there's
 three dudes walking through the forest they're hunting just hanging out they're looking to
 shoot living things in the brain and then consume the meat for energy and maybe make
 some new shoes I don't know but they're walking through this forest and they haven't shot
 anything yet they're really disappointed that nothing is dead they're like oh dang it and
 you know they're probably hungry too but anyways they can't find anything and then in the forest
 now in this article the main guy being quoted of the Indian I wanted to say Native Americans
 but they're in Canada the Indians is a guy named Jimmy Craneback he's being quoted in
 this article and he's saying they heard this roar they're dealing the forest they hear this
 roar birds scatter out of their nests fly off into the sky they hear trees they hear
 trees getting pushed like something's pushing against them they can hear the trees crack
 they can see the leaves sway through the tree tops okay maybe they didn't see that part
 but the fact is that they're not eight feet tall they can't see over the tree top but
 they hear the crack of tree branches snapping and loud thuds like two things are just going
 to war in the middle of this forest throwing each other up against trees a true battle
 of the beasts so these three dudes are like okay here's the thing that's super spooky
 right we don't want to go anywhere near that but it's February and bears are super hungry
 around this time they're really lean they're really angry and we got women in the woods
 doing the gathering thing we're doing the hunting thing women are like picking up mushrooms
 and collecting berries and all that stuff so we have to at least see what that is because
 if it's two bears fighting we'll go kill them both we'll bring home some bear meat or we'll
 just scare them off so everyone else here doesn't have to worry about getting mauled
 to death so the three men begin walking through the woods towards the sound of the commotion
 rock keep her in it again closing so now at this point when they get to the ravine they
 go okay now we got to make a decision because there's definitely two bears fighting here
 if they they look like they're gonna fall over the wrestling it's so it's such a violent
 match looks like they're both gonna fall under the river then they're just they're both
 gonna die and no good comes out of it let's shoot them now and then we can at least eat
 them they're both gonna die anyways but we get something so they raise their rifles they're
 ready to aim and right before they can take a shot one of the creatures one of the supposed
 bears says something echoes through the forest then Indians look at each other and they're
 like oh it's the Sasquatch and they know that they said if he had said nothing they both
 would have been dead it was shot him both and then they'd been like oh no Sasquatch we
 shot this mythological creature in the brain I guess we're still gonna eat it I wonder
 if anyone's eaten Sasquatch I wonder if anyone's eaten Bigfoot meat that would actually be
 an interesting thing like you always have like the ultra rich like oh they inject the
 blood of the young or they're eating babies we should start a conspiracy theory that the
 ultra rich dying on Bigfoot meat that's why you can never find them because George Soros
 has eaten all of them he's like mmm I love the yeti but North American Sasquatch has
 a particular meaty they're all meaty it's meat but anyways new conspiracy theory the
 ultra rich eat Bigfoot they though realize that oh this is Bigfoot like we've heard
 about Bigfoot in our area let's not shoot them and let's start cheering they're like
 yeah go on Bigfoot go so with the cheering behind him Bigfoot turned like oh me feel
 better now me and oh get home turf advantage he gets the bear in a headlock a chokehold
 really and chokes him out they say that the bears tongue sticking out of its mouth as
 the Bigfoot got the chokehold even tighter tighter tighter and then finally the bear
 went limp and then died but that's not enough for Bigfoot boys he's not that type he's
 not just gonna choke you out and leave your body there he then picks the bear up and
 throws it into the river and the Indian dudes clapped as Bigfoot walks away so then they
 came back to town and they told everyone this story now whether or not that story is true
 who knows it does raise a couple interesting questions one Bigfoot would be beating the
 crap out of bears constantly bears are very violent territorial Bigfoot he doesn't really
 have many places to go he lives in the woods they're both giant I think if you and I we
 could do math on this or I could probably watch a YouTube video on this but a gorilla versus
 a bear I think the gorilla stronger I think the bear has like the big old claws all the
 muscle to punch through but I'm pretty sure the gorilla could to break them up and I don't
 think it would be a controversial statement to say that Bigfoot stronger than a gorilla
 so I think it at least would be a savage battle but you go Jason so we have the story of three
 men back in 1938 there's no evidence for this whatsoever it was printed in the newspaper
 it's a very entertaining article you can read it in the show notes that's I mean any three
 dudes can go walking through the woods the story is over a hundred years old there's a
 shh because that's not the only encounter of a Bigfoot and a bear and not only is that
 not the only encounter with a Bigfoot and a bear that is the encounter you would tell
 a little baby to put them to sleep oh Bigfoot is nice and chokes the bear out and throws
 them in the water let's go to Russia it's autumn 1989 we're in the Ark Ark Angel's
 Ark Angel's region in Russia there's a guy he's a professor of medicine his name is
 doctor in Alutsk collecting herbs in the middle of the forest so we have a story that's much
 more recent in time with a doctor supposedly assuming this guy exists well just exists
 for the for the entertainment value of the story we have a doctor who's most likely still
 alive and he's a professor of medicine again assuming that's the author didn't just make
 this up this is taken from a magazine a paranormal magazine called periscope it's written by
 Paul Stonehill but anyways doctor Alutsky is hanging out in the forest he's collecting
 herbs and stuff like that he's probably nerd this is his hobby he's like ooh a particularly
 delicious herb I heard this the herb that I'm supposed to eat but I don't want to throw
 up well I eat disgusting herbs oh yes we'll take a lot of these herbs are gross and he's
 sitting there he's by the river there's a it's funny because there's some parallels in
 this story this one the guys collecting herbs in the first story the Indians were afraid
 of other people just kind of randomly collecting herbs both of these stories take place by a
 river both of these stories involve a big foot and a bear that's where they end because
 in this story he's sitting there he's collecting herbs and berries and all that stuff and he
 sees a bear cub kind of walk out of the forest and begin yelping at him and he's like are
 you kidding me and then he hears also in the forest the mama bear coming and he's like
 okay herb mission herb mission is over I'm out of here all he has is a knife on him he
 gets up and he starts running because he knows that he it's already too late like he knows
 the fact that he can see the baby bear means that he's already in trouble and he begins
 running and then he hears a horrible sound from behind him his brain can't even register
 what could possibly be making the sound and under what circumstances would cause anything
 to make this sound and he turns around and he sees the mama bear now out in the open
 by the cub and standing behind the mama bear is a gorilla like creature that's two and
 a half meters tall eight feet tall he said it was a female had large fangs and it was
 holding the mama bear by its back legs it then in one motion with no visible effort hoisted
 the mama bear up holding it by its hind legs and then ripped it apart like a wishbone
 within a matter of seconds he said it was like nothing picking up this big Russian bear
 and just splitting it open fur and muscle and blood spilling out into the river it's
 funny because humans really anthropomorphize nature I was watching videos of bears in
 preparation for this story little bear cubs walking around I was like oh they look like
 dogs oh look at the way like I can see the way the mom looks at those cubs kind of looks
 like she's a little tired because you had a long day work she doesn't work she eats
 stuff but we put our emotions on stuff and I think we do the same thing with Bigfoot
 we see Bigfoot as always like this lost cryptid of this tribe or he's some species that hasn't
 been encountered but maybe they have rituals and they bury their dead and that's why we
 can't find them or maybe they get angry and they throw rocks if they exist they are beasts
 of the wild if they exist they fight every day against savage creatures it's less hairy
 in the Henderson's and more like dirty hairy like you would have to Bigfoot's would have
 to be violent by nature because nature is violent you may be able to live out in the
 woods as a human and grow a little patch of patchouli and eat that all day long and live
 off four leaf clovers and live a peaceful life but if you didn't even have a hut if
 you were living in a cave you'd be strangling ducks all day long and beating up raccoons
 and eating them that's what we used to do we become civilized and now we live in buildings
 and we just eat duck we let someone else beat it up at a farm but the Bigfoot's never
 become civilized like that definitely not in these two circumstances and because Bigfoot
 are already so hard to find they could be doing this 24/7 they could constantly just
 be walking through nature stepping on the backs of bobcats picking up skunks and like
 putting their hands up their butts and using them as boxing gloves is like punching elk
 in the face a Bigfoot is a wild creature and all the Bigfoot hunters and Squatch hunters
 and all that stuff desperately seeking Squatch all of them they hope they're gonna run into
 the Bigfoot that's like me Bigfoot me friend but the truth is Bigfoot's a big old monster
 and yeah it could be nice just like you may run into a bear and it looks at you and just
 like walks away and you go I had a good encounter with a bear not all bears are like that bear
 I met was totally fine and didn't maul me but you're really taking your chance between
 Bigfoot greeting you giving you a high five and Bigfoot grabbing your legs and as the
 Bigfoot is tearing you into you're the one making the horrifying noise that scatters
 the birds from trees and makes the rest of nature go silent be careful how their Bigfoot
 hunters you can't find them if he's right behind you
