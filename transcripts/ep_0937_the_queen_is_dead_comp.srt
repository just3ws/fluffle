00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Breaking news! Once again in the world of conspiracy theory, this has been a very, very crazy year from the destruction of the Georgia Guidestones to the Queen of England.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Most famously, no one has been a shape-shifting reptilian, has died! What does her death say about the reptilian conspiracy theory?

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And then we take a look at a tasty, yet disgusting conspiracy theory.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Is it possible that every time you eat a hot dog or have a pulled pork sandwich, you're actually taking a bite out of one of your relatives?

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 [music]

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now was one of our newest Patreon supporters.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Everyone give it up for AskSwo! Woohoo! Yeah, come on in buddy!

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 AskSwo is walking on into Dead Rabbit Command. Does a little pose when he gets right next to me for some weird reason.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 AskSwo, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Just helps spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot. I see more of you guys are doing that online recently, so that's awesome.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I really like to see it. It helps the show grow.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Now AskSwo, we're going to go ahead and we're going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're flying all the way out to Jolly Old England.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 [imitates engine]

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Doing that, flying there, I'm kind of sitting back reading the newspaper and I go, "Oh, man, did you see the news?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Queen Elizabeth dying?" I'm like, "That's a reaction. That's a reaction. One of the world's oldest monarchs."

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And I was like, "Yeah, listen, I'm American, right?" So, I mean, listen, it's horrible when anybody dies.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I'm not celebrating anybody's death. But she was like, "I don't know. She's not my queen, right?"

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 So, I mean, when I read the headlines, here's the thing. When I read the headlines, this is the first thing I thought.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 This is how you know you are dying in the world conspiracy theorist.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I thought, I wonder how the reptilian conspiracy theorists are going to handle this.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That was the very first thought. And then I thought, "Oh, it's sad that a 96-year-old grandmother died."

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 But then I went back to, they have to be... It's so funny because I knew one of two things.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And before we get into that, people are like, "Wait, wait, wait, what? Queen Elizabeth is a reptilian?"

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I think that's... I think this is such a widely known conspiracy theory. I'm not going to go too in-depth.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I'd be shocked if you hadn't heard this by now, but...

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 There's a British author, British conspiracy theorist named David Ike.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And he was the one who really popularized the shape-shifting reptilian conspiracy theory in the first place.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And he's British. He used to be a race car driver.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And everyone's like, "Woo, yeah, he went so fast in that car, dude. Yeah, awesome. Win the race."

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And he's like, "Read my book. Read my book."

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And they were like, "Oh, is the book about race car driving?" He's like, "Maybe."

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And he read it. That didn't actually happen. He wasn't throwing it out there in a ceremony.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 He was a race car driver, though, and then when he retired, he started uncovering the reptilian conspiracy.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Interesting career. Like, whatever you think about David Ike's theories, I think that's interesting, right?

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 He's a Renaissance man. He's done two things. Race cars and talk about reptilians.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He believes that the reptilian conspiracy theory, the shape-shifting reptilians, he is the main driving force behind that.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Like, I remember back in, like, the early 2000s, it would even be like pre...

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I don't want to date. I don't want to say it was pre-9/11, but I remember in the early 2000s,

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 you'd be walking through Barnes & Noble and they had the spirituality section, which was also doubled for the conspiracy section.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It was very small back then. And David Ike had his own little row.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So when Queen Elizabeth died, I thought, okay, she was supposed to be, if not the head of the reptilian world order on Earth.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 She was one of the biggest players, right? She was laying all the eggs.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 If you were famous, if you were famous reptilian, you came out of her cock-ex. Is that the term?

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 She, Queen Elizabeth sat down and dropped a big old reptilian egg right in the middle of Buckingham Palace and out crawled Kanye West.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 This is this conspiracy theory. Actually, that's again, that's specifically not one of those.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You won't find that in a David Ike book, but she was either the biggest reptilian overlord or one of the top.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And she's dead now. And I remember thinking, that sucks, grandma died. That's not cool.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Secondly, I thought, reptilians, I mean, seriously, like I was like, how are they going to deal with this?

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And I remember thinking a couple different things popped in my head. I thought, one, they're going to ignore it.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And they're talking about the reptilian conspiracy theorists and they're just going to pretend it didn't happen.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Or two, they're going to basically say stuff like, well, she's just going into another body now.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 She like shape-shifted into Charlie D'Amelio or something like that. Like, this is just part of the life cycle.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Don't you know the life cycle of reptiles, you ignoramus?

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 This is part of that. She's just shape-shifting to someone else. This body's dead, but the alien is just shape-shifting.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So basically, it's one, they just pretended it didn't happen. And they just kind of hand-wave it off.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 The other one is they make up some sort of story for it. But I thought, is anyone reptilian, human, grey, insectoid?

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Everything dies, right? And I thought, probably the most interesting way they could handle this,

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 because I have been going on to a lot of forums that I don't normally go.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And I was going like the David Ike's forum and stuff like that, trying to figure out what they're saying.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I think that the easiest thing would be to say, yeah, Queen Elizabeth, world-famous shape-shifting reptilian, died at the age of 96.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Reptilians also, I mean, maybe she was 400 in space years, but she just died.

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And now a new blood-soaked saga will begin. Who will take over the reptilian agenda?

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I found one post. I started looking through all these forums. I found one post that was basically like,

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 "Now the war begins. Now the war between the reptilians to see who sees his control."

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And that one post was just that. My predictions were correct.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Other people, a lot of posts in these forums are saying, "She's been dead for years. She didn't know that."

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 The real Queen Elizabeth died a couple years ago. She was about to make a Princess Diana joke, but already fraying.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 That wasn't the real one anyways. This was like, "Why would you clone a reptilian first off? Just get a new reptilian overlord."

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Secondly, then that would make the past couple years of David Ike talking about her, she's a reptilian.

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Then that's not true, because she was a clone. I don't know. Just accept, like, when I say accept reality, I will allow you.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 You can talk about reptilians all you want. I'm not going to say you can't do that.

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But accept that also reptilians can die, right? You can't have a world where Queen Elizabeth is a shape-shifting reptilian who rules the world,

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 but she's been dead for years. What we've seen was a clone or a hologram or something like that, because then the first census doesn't make any sense.

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Just say, "Yeah, she died. She's a reptilian." Fine. I don't believe that, but if you want to believe that, fine.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 But if you want to continue, it makes more sense. You know what I mean? It makes more sense to be like, "Yeah, reptilians die too."

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And so this is going to be the name of my book, "Reptilians Die Too."

82
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And then the other thing, what was the toothier? Oh, one that they just kind of hand-waved it off, "Oh, she'd been dead for years."

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And then what was the second one? I don't even remember what it was.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 My second example was, I think it kind of blended together. Some people just were like, "No."

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 They just kind of -- oh, that was it! So one of them -- I don't remember what order I put them. Sorry for this very well-structured episode.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Like I said, this was breaking news. This kind of jumped right in my lap, and I was doing research literally up until the minute of recording this.

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 You had one camp saying she'd been dead for years. It doesn't matter. It's just been a clone.

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And then the other group completely ignored it. Completely -- they're not even talking about it.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And what's shocking is that's the biggest group.

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So I was going on the David Ike forums, and I was going on this other forum I used to go to all the time, unironically, when I was more of a hardcore conspiracy theorist.

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Like I never believed the reptilian shapeshifting agenda, but I believed a lot of conspiracy theories.

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Without even -- if -- if -- oh, man, I was -- it was -- it was entertaining. It was fun, but it was bad.

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Like I would get in long arguments about 9/11 was an inside job in real life, by the way. Not online.

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Like we would have these discussions about these conspiracy theories.

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Like I was 100% died in the world. Conspiracy theorists believed all this stuff.

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And I spent a lot of time on godlike productions. So I went back there. They're not talking about it.

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Like this -- in the world of conspiracy theory, this is huge.

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Just like the Georgia guide stones blowing up earlier this year, and I predicted -- and I was right -- I said, "We're never gonna find out who did that."

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 As far as the public knows, there's not even an investigation. Isn't that so bizarre?

100
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Someone detonated a bomb. Forget what it was.

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Like take out the -- whether it's the Georgia guide stones or your local fro-yo shop.

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Someone detonated a bomb, a fairly powerful bomb, to destroy all of this concrete that was designed to survive a nuclear war.

103
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Right? That was the intent after these huge, massive ecological or man-made disasters.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Georgia guide stones will still be there to lead us.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Not only did the guide stones get blown up, and there's -- as far as we know -- no investigation, there's not even people really asking,

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 "Hey, what's going on with this investigation?" Including the conspiracy theorists. Like this has been completely dropped.

107
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 At the very last moment when it blew up, basically the mainstream media who said, "Oh, well, we don't care about it anyways."

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It was built by a white supremacist, and we know who it was. And I was like, "What -- where is this coming from?"

109
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And then that became the official story, and then people stopped asking questions.

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I guess there was a documentary called "Shadow Over Elberton."

111
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Could be pronouncing it wrong. Shocker that I pronounced the word wrong. There was a documentary that came out a couple years ago,

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 and they said, "We know who built the Georgia guide stones because we were talking to a guy who said he knew who did it."

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And he opened up a box of letters that apparently these letters were from the guy who did it.

114
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And one of those letters -- there's a pile of letters -- the camera crew got a name and an address off one of those letters,

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 and it was the name of some local clownsman or local white supremacist or something like that.

116
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So they go, "That's the guy." Now that documentary came out, and nothing really came of it, right?

117
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 It came out like in 2017, 2018, like that. And then when the Georgia guide stones blew up, everyone goes,

118
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 "Oh, they're racist anyway, so it doesn't matter. We're not going to look into it."

119
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Now, it's so fascinating because from the day they were built until the day they were destroyed, the narrative was this was New World Order propaganda.

120
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 This was the original Denver Airport murals. This was the New World Order showing people how they wanted the world to be.

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And that was the through line. That documentary came out, and nobody talked about it.

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 It blew up, and the media just goes, "It's a bunch of white supremacists, so who cares?"

123
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And if you ask questions, you're a white supremacist, if you want to know.

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Like, that was a white supremacist thing blew up. Do you care if white supremacist stuff gets blown up?

125
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 People are like, "Uh, okay." And it disappeared. It disappeared.

126
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Now, again, just just normal person walking through the world, do you think they would at least be wondering why a bomb went off in Georgia

127
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 that destroyed this concrete monument? But the conspiracy theorists for them to drop it even, you still see whispers of it now and then.

128
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But anyway, it's completely gone from the zeitgeist.

129
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Not just the Georgia guide stones blowing up, but what the Georgia guide stones represented.

130
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 That entire thing is just gone. You don't even hear them talking about it.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I have seen a few, going back to Queen Elizabeth thing, I have seen a through line in the conspiracy community

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 where they're saying that since the Georgia guide stones have blown up, Shinzo Abe was assassinated.

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And now Queen Elizabeth has passed away. And there was one other world leader who died recently.

134
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And they were connecting that to basically the Georgia guide stones was, I'm not, for the intelligence agencies that listen to this broadcast,

135
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I'm not saying this, that the Georgia guide stones was some sort of marker in time where the elite were starting to get wiped out one by one.

136
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That's an interesting conspiracy theory, right? Who was the other world leader? I don't remember, but.

137
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So you still have some people talk about it for the most part.

138
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 All they're talking about in the conspiracy theory community is COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID vaccines and microchips in your bloodstream and all that stuff.

139
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It's absolutely fascinating. But anyways, going back to Queen Elizabeth thing, what are these people going to do now that their lizard queen has been killed?

140
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And I'm talking from the conspiracy theories, how they look at her as a lizard queen.

141
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 She died and they just, they, I mean, seriously, they just stopped talking about it.

142
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 One person was like, because when they first announced that she was sick, one person was like, oh dude, if she dies on September 9th, that'll be 9, 9, 2022.

143
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And he, nines are basically upside down sixes, right? Everyone's just kind of like, yeah, I guess.

144
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And if you took 2022 and you got rid of the zero and you had two plus two plus two, that's six.

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 So 996 turned those other nines upside down at 666.

146
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But she didn't die on September 9th, she died on September 8th. So he made his prediction.

147
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 He's like, oh man, I was hoping it would be satanic. It was just a grandma dying.

148
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 But it's just so interesting how the conspiracy theory community, like all communities, right?

149
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 If you find information that doesn't back your argument, you get rid of it or you ignore it.

150
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And the conspiracy theory community, because they're so fanciful, I do love them.

151
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I am a member of them on one end. Definitely, they just can make stuff up.

152
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They just make stuff up at a certain point and be like, oh, she's been dead for years, what?

153
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 You were still buying all those David Ike books saying she was a reptilian? Ah, nah.

154
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 She was just the clone. She was just the clone. She was just the clone.

155
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And I do have to say though, and this is going to segue into our next story, let's go ahead and ask Woe.

156
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

157
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Get that car fired up while I'm finishing this little thing.

158
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 I will say that as I was researching it, I said they were mostly talking about COVID.

159
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 There was a ton of stuff about COVID and vaccines and people dying off from the vaccine and all that stuff.

160
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And 9/11. Doing a lot of this research leading up to 9/11.

161
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 We're seeing all this stuff. I was doing research a couple minutes before I go on air.

162
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 They were talking a lot about 9/11. So it's 9/11 COVID.

163
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And then the whole, the reptilian overlord queen is dead even on David Ike's own forms.

164
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 It's barely a whisper. So weird. So bizarre.

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Because this was the big boss that again, as she got older, people would be like, can a human live that long?

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 No. Only reptilians can live to be 96. It actually helped their argument that she was so old.

167
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 But now when she's dead, they're like, it didn't matter anyway, she was a clone.

168
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Or they just don't talk about it. So that's fascinating to me.

169
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 But you know, Asquo, go ahead and get in that Jason Jalopy. We're driving all the way out to your hometown.

170
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Asquo's like, oh no, are you doxing me? What did I sign up for?

171
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 No, we're not going to Asquo's hometown. We're not even hometown. That was incorrect.

172
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 We're going to where you live right now. And this is a thought experiment I came up with last night.

173
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Last night, I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend Sabine, September 10th. It's like 8. It was like 8pm.

174
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And this is what it's like to hang out with me, right? I'm sure it's exhausting for people around me.

175
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 We're out having Mexican food, delicious. And as we're leaving Modern Taco, which is an amazing Mexican restaurant here in town,

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 in the evening Modern Taco, I remember walking through the doors and I go, what if?

177
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 All of a sudden you realized it was September 10th, 2001. It was 8pm on the west coast, because that's where I'm at.

178
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 What could you possibly do to stop 9/11? And it became this thought experiment I started going through.

179
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And I kind of would like to invite you guys to do it as well. And this is how I set it up, right?

180
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 My cell phone wouldn't work. My cell phone wouldn't work. There's no 5G towers around. The reptilians have not put those in every city.

181
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 It's part of their brain heating apparatus. There's no 5G towers. My cell phone wouldn't work. I didn't live up here in 2001.

182
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 So if you've moved since 2001, you would be where you are right now. You're where you're at now in 2022,

183
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 but all of a sudden you're sent back to September 10th, 2001. And how would you warn about this?

184
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And this is what I came up with. I didn't live up here, so I wouldn't know anyone up here in 2001.

185
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I wouldn't be able to get into my place. My key might still work, but there'd be some weirdo living there.

186
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I would have to go into a business and use a phone. I'd have to say, can I use your phone? This is an emergency.

187
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And the internet was totally different, right? You'd probably just get a phone book at a certain point, and I would call the FBI.

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 But here's the thing. The FBI would... they get hundreds of these calls a day, right? The FBI gets kooky calls all the time.

189
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And so this is what I figured out. I would have to call up the FBI at 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

190
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 The attacks happened like... I said 12 hours I thought last night, but they happened like at 7 or 8, somewhere around there in Eastern Standard Time.

191
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 So I don't even have a 12-hour gap. It's much shorter. And you would have to be able to convince the FBI with knowledge you have now of the 9/11 attacks.

192
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But it would have to be stuff that happened before. Because if you start saying, "3,000 people, they're gonna die,

193
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 and there's gonna be people jumping out of buildings, and they're gonna collapse," and you guys are gonna be like, "Wait, what are you talking about?

194
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You can make up any scenario. This is my situation." I'd call up the FBI and I said, "Listen, I'm sure you get all these calls 100 times,

195
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 but there's gonna be a terror attack on the East Coast and New York sometime tomorrow morning in September 11th.

196
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's gonna be like 7/8 in the morning." And I would start... I'd be like, "There's gonna..." Because you would have to convince them that you knew about this.

197
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 They would assume you were part of it, but I'd say it's gonna be spearheaded by a guy named Osama bin Laden.

198
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 He's operating out of Afghanistan with a group called the Taliban. His group's called Al-Qaeda. And you would start listing stuff off,

199
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 and they would be like, "How would he know that?" Like, "Yeah, Osama bin Laden was interviewed by Time Magazine in 1997,

200
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and he could probably pick up some of this stuff." And I'd be like, "He's working with a guy named Muhammad Atta."

201
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 He's currently under surveillance. He's been going to flight instruction schools.

202
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And so at that point, specific stuff like that, they would start to go, "Oh wait, we are investigating that guy.

203
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 We have been looking at people going to flight schools." And I would say there's going to be a training exercise.

204
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 There's no way I would know this is civilian on the West Coast. Tomorrow morning, the Air Force is gonna do a training exercise,

205
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 and what they're gonna do is they're going to do a simulation of planes being hijacked so they can work on scrambling their jets.

206
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 How would I know that? I know that. But that's really all the info.

207
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That took me like 20, 30 minutes, because I was really thinking about last night some things like, "Ah, it's kind of interesting, Jason."

208
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I was like, "No, but wait!" And I said I would call the FBI, I would stay all that stuff, and then I would call like the New York Times,

209
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 and the Washington Post. I would call different newspapers, because here's the thing which is what would happen.

210
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I would get arrested in very, very short order, because I'm using the phone at Modern Taco.

211
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I don't even know if it was Modern Taco back then. I'm using the phone at Crazy Pepper, is what it used to be called.

212
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And the FBI would send someone in to get me, because I'm threatening, quote, unquote, to them.

213
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I know all this stuff about some terror attack, they would think I was in on it.

214
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And the reason why I would call the media is because...

215
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 They're going to throw me in Guantanamo Bay, it's not even open at this point.

216
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 They're going to assume I'm part of it, and they may not even do anything to stop it.

217
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 But I would say, listen, a plane's going to hit sometime in the morning, and then there's going to be a period of time, maybe 30, 45...

218
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Because I don't know a ton of information. I don't know a ton of information.

219
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Sabine was like, "You know a lot! You actually know surprisingly a lot about Pre-9/11."

220
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 But I don't know what times the plane hits, and I couldn't say like, and then United 93 is going to crash in Pennsylvania.

221
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 None of that stuff would prevent it. I'm trying to prevent it.

222
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 But yeah, isn't that interesting? I thought like being so far away, having to use a stranger's phone, you might still be in the town you grew up in, which is fine.

223
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 You just go like, "Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, terrorist, you're attacking tomorrow."

224
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 But how... You might have better ideas, there were more information, but how would you be able to stop it?

225
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And I think you could give them enough information that even if they didn't believe you, once that first plane hit, you could scramble jets for the other planes.

226
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And again, I would say, "Listen, all you got to do, it's United 93, it's coming out somewhere on the East Coast, and then I think it's American Airlines and United Airlines."

227
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So there's only two airlines involved. Just put extra security, just check them. They're bringing in box cutters. That's it. That's all you got to do.

228
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 You can save 3,000 lives, you can stop a 20-year-long war, and you could never...

229
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 You actually couldn't say that you could never tell them you were from the future. You could, but they wouldn't believe you.

230
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 They would definitely think you were crazy. You could just keep saying, "I can't tell you how I know this, but I know this."

231
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 It was interesting. I was thinking of the thought experiment through. I remember another thing I said, I go, "George W. Bush will be reading a book called My Pet Goat in Florida.

232
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Ask the Secret Service Detail. Call them. Ask him if he's pre-read that book so he doesn't have any surprises as he's reading it."

233
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 The book he's reading, how would I know that? But you would get arrested. They would take you somewhere. They probably would...

234
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 They probably would waterboard you. You'd be the first waterboarder. But yeah, would it be worth it? Would it be worth it trying to...

235
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Yeah, basically to save 3,000 lives. But then I said, "What if you're on the phone with the FBI and you tell them all that information?"

236
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And they go, "Well, we don't believe you. We do not believe you that Osama Lanin's going to attack America tomorrow."

237
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And you're like, "But I've given you all that information." And then George Bush is on the phone and he goes, "Because it's an inside job, baby. You can't stop it now."

238
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And you're like, "Noooooo." I've always thought... This is a conspiracy theory of mine. Yeah, do that thought experiment.

239
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 I think it would be interesting to get your heart rate up. I've always thought the reason why history is the way it is, is because of time travelers.

240
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 There may have been someone far worse in charge of a lot of these countries, right? Someone worse than Hitler, someone worse than Stalin.

241
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 We could have had presidents that have completely destroyed the world, right? The wrong person gets elected at the wrong time.

242
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 You could have a moment where... And this was kind of the plot of that Stephen King novel, but...

243
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 I'm not sure if you can tell by the sound of my voice how much I enjoyed it, what was it, 1963 or whatever, that someone else was killed.

244
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 That was actually an episode of Quantum Leap as well. Jackie Kennedy was killed instead of John F. Kennedy.

245
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And so Squiggy sent Quantum Leap back into the body of Lee Harvey Oswald and he shot JFK or something like that.

246
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I vaguely remember that episode. Spoiler alert for a 30-year-old television show.

247
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I think history... What if someone went back in time... New York was nuked.

248
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Someone went back in time and stopped the nuking of New York, but because of that, just three towers were taken down in the middle of New York City.

249
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Who knows? That's my conspiracy theory, right? And if I am right, I'm going to get erased from the time stream because I know too much.

250
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 But yeah, 9/11, it's always kind of a somber day, so I figured we'd play a game. I figured we'd play a game.

251
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Thought experiment, could you stop it? Who knows? Maybe you're a general in the military. You're like, "Yeah, Jason, I really love your podcast and I could totally stop it."

252
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I was a captain back then. I'd make a couple phone calls, but interesting.

253
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And I want to segue that real quick into a Dead Rabbit Recommends. I wanted to do a long time ago and I just kind of forgot about...

254
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 But I never forgot about the movie. I just forgot about telling you guys about it. Super quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

255
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 There is a conspiracy movie called Toxic Skies starring Anne Haish.

256
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And it came out quite a few years ago. It came out in the mid-2000s. It's about chemtrails, which I'm not a huge fan of that conspiracy theory.

257
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Not that I don't think it's really happening or not really happening. I just think it's kind of boring, right? It's just lines in the sky.

258
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Toxic Skies is about Anne Haish and some dude. This is real off-the-cuff recommendation as well.

259
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 They're trying to uncover this conspiracy theory that chemicals are being sprayed in the sky. This was a made-for-TV movie, or is direct to video, or something like that.

260
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 So it doesn't have the highest budget, but I'll tell you this. The first five minutes is pure nightmare fuel for any conspiracy theorist.

261
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 The first five minutes is absolutely terrifying. I felt really uncomfortable watching it. And again, it is like a made-for-TV movie.

262
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 But I'm not going to spoil it, but you watch that opening scene and you're like, "Whew." That's what... That is the ultimate fear of every conspiracy theorist.

263
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It's a really good movie. I really did like Toxic Skies. They're trying to solve a mystery that we already know the answer to, right?

264
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 That the skies are full of poison, and they're trying to go about it and expose this group. I guess it's not so much as a mystery, because they kind of figured it out too.

265
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 But they're trying to expose the group in it. The beginning... The movie is good. The movie itself is good. I'd give it like a 6 or a 7.

266
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But the beginning and the ending, you're like, "Yeah, that's 100%..." Those are the two most accurate things you see in the world of conspiracy theory.

267
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 The beginning and the ending. Excellent movie. We lost Anne Haish recently. I know there's been a lot of conspiracy theories about her death.

268
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 She was currently working on a movie about child trafficking, child sex trafficking, and then she got in that car accident and she burned...

269
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 She got all horribly burned up, and then she was moving around. People said, "Oh no, the firefighters were part of the Illuminati, because I...

270
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 This episode's all over the place." But she got in this car accident. She crashed into a house. The house caught on fire.

271
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 The firefighters came in. They saw the car. They didn't see her. They were putting out the fire. They see her in the car.

272
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 She was like on the floorboards. They realized now... So she was like in this car for like a half hour.

273
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And then they took her out, and then there's helicopter footage of her being put on what people have said is a body bag, throwing her in a body bag.

274
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And then she burst out of the body bag, and then the firefighter pushes her back into the body bag and zips it up.

275
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And people have said, "Oh, it's the Illuminati silencing her." What I've read... On the conspiracy theorist forums, you have people who are just reporting on what they see.

276
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 If you're looking at that and you go, "Wow, this is what it looks like. I'm not gonna say you're a dummy because that does make sense."

277
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 You have other people come on and go, "No, no, no. What that was is... That was a blanket. That's like a foil that they use for burn victims."

278
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 They go, "She has so badly burned. She is so exposed to just, I mean, like bits of dirt, toxins, anything. Like she has no skin."

279
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So what they were doing was they were putting her in the... It wasn't like a bag. It was like this foil thing over her.

280
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And they go, "Yeah, she's still alive." And it freaked her out. So she sat up and they're like, "No, get back under here."

281
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Because that's the only way that you have a chance is being in this thing. She was just completely burned.

282
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I didn't think it was interesting like it for when I saw the news. I was like, "Oh, that sucks." I guess there was alcohol involved.

283
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 That was another thing. But I don't know if they've proven that there. I guess she was talking on a podcast earlier that day about drinking a lot, drinking a lot that day or something.

284
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And then, um... Yeah, I'm just addressing the conspiracy theories. Trying to go off the top of my head again here.

285
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 But yeah, I do remember this. She got in the car accident and I go, "Oh, that sucks." And then the family was like, "Oh, the hospital's like, "Oh, she seems to be fine. She seems to be fine."

286
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And then like a day or two later they're like, "We're selling her organs." We're not selling. We're donating her organs.

287
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 She's dead. I remember thought that was weird. But it doesn't mean it's a conspiracy theory. I mean, who knows what this film...

288
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 If it's just a generic, "Don't take my daughter" lifetime movie about child sex trafficking, then I don't think she would have gotten killed over that.

289
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 If it was naming big names, if the villain was an obvious metaphor for Brian Singer, then, you know, definitely she could have been erased.

290
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 I'm not saying either way, honestly, because I don't know much about that movie. It hasn't come out. People do get toxic skies.

291
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Like, again, that is an element of the movie toxic skies that she was in. And that movie's starting.

292
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 That's what, when I saw it in articles, I go, "I gotta recommend that to my audience," because it really is a good movie.

293
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 So that's a Dead Rabbit Recommends/another bit of current conspiracy news as well about Anne Haish.

294
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Guys, we're gonna go ahead and save the human pig hybrid store for tomorrow. All of that conspiracy talk went on a little bit longer than I planned it to.

295
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 But I hope it also showed how passionate I am about the world of conspiracy theories.

296
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 A lot of times, people hate on me personally, because I don't believe -- they go, "You don't believe in anything. You believe in the stuff you've experienced."

297
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Which, I think, is pretty normal. But you don't believe in all these other conspiracy theories.

298
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I definitely used to be a 9/11 truther. We've talked a lot about that.

299
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And then, I'm not anymore. I saw a video of a World Trade Center. What was it? Tower 7. The third twin tower.

300
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 So we're to say it like that, but three towers went down on 9/11. One, two, and then building number seven.

301
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And I saw some video footage from the other angle, and you can see there was massive damage done to it.

302
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And I felt lied to by the conspiracy theory community. I know that the government lies to me. I know that big businesses lie to me.

303
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I know the media lies to me. But when my fellow conspiracy theorists lie to me, I took that as a betrayal, because I thought we were all in this together.

304
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 But I hope -- I mean, really, if anything -- and not like I ever have to defend myself -- people can feel how they feel about me.

305
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 People don't have to like me or anything like that.

306
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Whether or not I believe in every conspiracy theory I come across, I feel very passionate about talking about them.

307
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Like, I could just go on and on and on and on and on and on, but, you know, then that's just not entertaining.

308
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 I guess it's just a guy rambling. I'm actually hoping that the past half hour or so has been entertaining to you.

309
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 It feels very rambling to me. It's not our normal type of show if you're a new listener.

310
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 But yeah, I do love the world of conspiracy theory. I find it so fascinating.

311
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 The ones I believe in, and even the ones I don't believe in, even the ones I find boring like Kim Trails,

312
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 I find it very, very interesting to talk about. And we got more stuff to come up on Dead Rabbit Radio.

313
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 We'll talk about human hybrids tomorrow. Human pig hybrids tomorrow.

314
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 We'll have Asku back to be flying the carbonicopter.

315
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 We might even be covering some even weirder conspiracy theories.

316
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And then I will do some paranormal stuff as well just to mix everything up.

317
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
