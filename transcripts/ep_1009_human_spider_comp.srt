1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
 What would you do if you found yourself trapped inside a farmhouse with three aliens on the

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,640
 inside and the National Guard surrounding you on the outside?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:20,760
 Then we traveled to Australia to meet two young boys, brothers, who have finally done

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,600
 the impossible.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,760
 They cleaned their room.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,320
 It's clean.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,200
 Everything looks spotless.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,680
 Little darkness fell and it crawled into their room.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:49,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
 You're like, "Jason, really?

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 That's what we're talking about now.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,080
 Boys cleaning their room and it gets messy."

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
 Hold on.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,480
 I'm trusting me.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,120
 And someone who always has trusted me, I believe.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
 Maybe not.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,120
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command are two of our legacy Patreon supporters, longtime supporter

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,320
 to show.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,200
 And they're always swinging by for the Patreon Live episode on Sunday.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
 Give it up for Nick and Helena Bustin.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
 Woohoo!

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,440
 Yeah, walk on in Dead Rabbit Command, little doggies.

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
 Come on in.

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,760
 Walk on in Nick and Helena.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,400
 Actually, I think of how it's pronounced.

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,440
 Nick and Helena, you guys are going to be our captain.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,200
 I live this episode.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,360
 You guys can't support the show financially if you guys don't want me to mispronounce

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,560
 your name publicly.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
 That's fine too.

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,640
 That helps out so, so much.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,120
 Helena, let's go ahead and get you started off.

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,520
 We're going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Race Car.

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
 I think this is new.

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,680
 Dead Rabbit Race Car.

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,480
 Let's hop on board while she's getting everything tuned up.

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
 That's her job.

43
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,040
 She has the language and the wheels are on.

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,880
 She's like, "Nick, you're the real one driving.

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,760
 She just has to check the oil."

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,680
 Let's go ahead and hop inside the Dead Rabbit Race Car.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,480
 We're going to zoom off all the way out to Massachusetts.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:15,960
 Imagine it's like a little F1 racer.

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,200
 That'd be dope.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
 Have we ever had this before?

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,840
 Specifically, we're headed out to a town called Duxbury in Massachusetts and there's a place

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,760
 called Bay Road.

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,160
 You guys are familiar with the encounter.

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
 You're like, "Golly, he's in my neck of the woods.

55
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,600
 I know where that's at."

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,440
 Well, you have a time machine because it doesn't matter where the location is.

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
 Well, actually, I guess it is.

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,840
 You could probably go and maybe find this farmhouse.

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,840
 But if you had a time machine, you could go back to February 1996 and take a look at

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
 this story for yourself.

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,400
 But you don't, so here I am telling it for you.

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
 It's 1137 PM.

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,960
 We're walking down Bay Road with this dude.

64
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,160
 His name is Alan Greenwood.

65
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,320
 He's a farmer, but I know when you hear the word farmer, you think of corn and wheat.

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,480
 This guy farmed cranberries.

67
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,280
 Alan Greenwood, a cranberry bog farmer, is walking down Bay Road.

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,800
 It's 1137 PM when all of a sudden...

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:22,800
 [MUMBLING]

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,640
 You see, it's a UFO land.

71
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,240
 This isn't like a typical flying saucer.

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,400
 This is quite an odd-shaped alien spacecraft.

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 He said this landed maybe about a thousand feet away, and he said it was shaped like

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
 a baseball bat.

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:48,040
 This one looked like a baseball bat with three chartuce lights on the wide end of this UFO.

76
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,280
 Three chartuce lights.

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,120
 And a little door opens up.

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,960
 [MUMBLING]

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:05,160
 And out of this craft walk three white-colored men.

80
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,800
 And it's interesting terminology, right?

81
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,400
 If you just said three white dudes, you'd be like, "Oh, it's other people from Massachusetts."

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,000
 No, they were white-colored, so it implies that they're not human.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
 They're just humanoid.

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,000
 They had big eyes.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,640
 They walk out of the ship, three white-colored men with big eyes, and they began walking

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,320
 towards Alan.

87
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,400
 I imagine Alan's meeting them somewhere in the middle.

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,960
 A thousand feet's quite a distance.

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
 You're just standing there the whole time, like a thousand feet away.

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,920
 These little guys are walking towards you.

91
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,640
 You're like, "Come on, guys.

92
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
 It's 1130 at night.

93
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
 I got better things to do."

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 A thousand feet?

95
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,800
 I mean, you wouldn't want to meet them in the middle.

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
 If you didn't immediately run away, that is.

97
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
 You'd be like, "I'm sorry, but you wouldn't be like that."

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
 They get close to you.

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
 You start backing up.

100
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,640
 They're like, "Oh, come on, man."

101
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,840
 I'm sure they met in the middle.

102
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
 It doesn't matter.

103
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,440
 It doesn't really matter where they met in the middle.

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,200
 But anyways, what I love about this story, we've covered tons of alien encounters on

105
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,080
 this show.

106
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,200
 All of the weirdest ones I can find, and this one's no exception.

107
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,840
 These three little alien dudes walk off this ship.

108
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,160
 They walk up to Alan.

109
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,040
 And Alan pulls out a handgun and takes them hostage.

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,600
 He's like, "What are you guys doing here?

111
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
 What are you guys doing here?"

112
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,920
 And they're like, "Fleet flop loop."

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,520
 We don't know what was said between Alan and the aliens.

114
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,440
 All we know is that Alan, with a handgun in his hand, forced the three guys, forced these

115
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,320
 three aliens into a nearby farmhouse and held them hostage.

116
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,120
 I imagine it would be incredibly difficult to hold really anyone hostage.

117
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
 Three people, one handgun on three people.

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 I mean, you can do it.

119
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
 It happens.

120
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,160
 And then somehow, we'll get into where this report came from in an instant.

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,840
 There's some information missing.

122
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
 This whole story's fascinating.

123
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,800
 He kidnaps these three aliens and forces them at gunpoint to the farmhouse.

124
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
 Somehow, the National Guard gets wind of this.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,920
 I don't know, could it be the massive UFO sitting on the ground?

126
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,440
 And the military goes in there like, "No one's here.

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
 That's weird.

128
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
 We found a UFO.

129
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,680
 Shartus running lights still on."

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
 And there's no one here.

131
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
 And they're like, "Sure, sure.

132
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,680
 We found three sets of footprints walking 1,000 feet away.

133
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,640
 And then four sets of footprints headed towards that farmhouse over there.

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
 Good work, Private.

135
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
 Round up.

136
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
 Let's go.

137
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,040
 And then all the soldiers ran to the farmhouse.

138
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,480
 Or it's possible that one of the aliens got to the phone and said, "Help me.

139
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,560
 We're being helped, prisoner."

140
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,120
 Somehow the National Guard surrounds the farmhouse.

141
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,680
 At that point, negotiations begin between Allen and the military.

142
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:05,120
 This article ends with the phrase, "No other information."

143
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,440
 And it also has two more words there.

144
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,880
 Two more words are added onto this.

145
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,080
 I got this from thinkabout@docs.com, one of my favorite UFO websites.

146
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,280
 I didn't even know existed until I started doing the show.

147
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
 It's fantastic.

148
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,400
 This is from thinkabout@docs.com.

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,280
 And you'll see a lot of UFO stories end with the words, "No more information."

150
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 It happens.

151
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,440
 A lot of times it happens when a person who's experiencing some sort of UFO or abduction

152
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,320
 related incident doesn't remember.

153
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,840
 It'll come to just like a...

154
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
 They don't remember.

155
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
 They're going through hypnotic regression and they remember the aliens doing X, Y, and

156
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,320
 Z and then no more information.

157
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,880
 The person didn't remember what happened or a subject disappeared.

158
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,840
 So it's not super common, but it's also not super rare to see no more information listed

159
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,880
 in UFO reports.

160
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,200
 The way this is phrased completely and think about it, docs.com says, "No other information."

161
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,800
 And then in parentheses, they wrote, "Media hoax?"

162
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 Question mark?

163
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,200
 Now it's really interesting.

164
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,640
 We've done a lot of stuff from thinkabout@docs.com and I've read maybe 10 times the amount of

165
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,200
 stories that we've actually covered on this show.

166
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 I read...

167
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,320
 I mean, there's just so much stuff that we don't cover from thinkabout@docs.com.

168
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,360
 They've used the word hoax in this context only one other time that I've seen.

169
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,960
 And that was in a story and they called it out.

170
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,280
 They said this story was a hoax.

171
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,440
 Like they gave all the information, they go, "Confirmed hoax."

172
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
 We did an episode on it because it was fascinating.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,160
 It was about some guy who believed that he saw the military shooting this UFO down over

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,000
 on the East Coast and then that guy ended up going to prison for trying to assassinate

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,440
 a bunch of local congressmen because he thought they were covering up this alien menace.

176
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,920
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

177
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,880
 So it was a confirmed hoax.

178
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,200
 This guy went nuts and was trying to do all this crazy stuff.

179
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,120
 I've read thousands of accounts.

180
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,720
 I mean, I don't think that's an exaggeration.

181
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,520
 Thousands of accounts from thinkabout@docs.com.

182
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,760
 I've only found the word hoax used in this context twice now.

183
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
 This and that.

184
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
 So I go, "Media hoax?"

185
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,880
 I go, "That's super fascinating."

186
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,560
 There's someone who's reporting on all of this crazy UFO stuff.

187
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,320
 For them to call out something as a hoax, it is a big deal.

188
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
 It really is.

189
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,600
 You can't throw that word around lightly.

190
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,880
 So I go, "Okay, this story may also have this super fascinating backstory."

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:48,320
 The thing is, I couldn't find any other information about this story except for on thinkabout@docs.com.

192
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,440
 They said their source was something called the "Duxbury Press."

193
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,760
 That, as far as I can tell, never existed.

194
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,800
 And again, they're really good with their source scene as well.

195
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,600
 Even if they just give a name, I can take a look at that name and then enter it into

196
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,680
 Google and search around a bit and find out that was a UFO researcher.

197
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,760
 Or it still is a UFO researcher doing stuff, selling books on Amazon still.

198
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,440
 They'll put a name that usually you can track down.

199
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,280
 I couldn't find anything called the "Duxbury Press."

200
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,960
 There's a newspaper in the area called the "Duxbury Clipper."

201
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,520
 That's been in operation since the '50s, so it's not like the "Duxbury Press" was previously

202
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
 there.

203
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,160
 Maybe it was a competing newspaper.

204
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
 I don't know.

205
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,520
 I cannot find any source of that newspaper existed.

206
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,200
 It's a fascinating story.

207
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 Was it a media hoax?

208
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,400
 I wasn't able to find...not only was I not able to find proof that it was a media hoax,

209
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,760
 I wasn't able to confirm this story in any way, shape, or form.

210
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,880
 You know, the thing is, is 1996 was not a long time ago.

211
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,960
 I was, what, 20 in 1996?

212
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,320
 But this is one of those stories that, if it happened, this is how it would have played

213
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,920
 out.

214
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:05,600
 Not just with the "Holding the Aliens" hostage, but you...you...here's the thing.

215
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,520
 This is the way I imagine it.

216
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,680
 One in town knew good ol' Alan Greenwood was kind of a nutcase.

217
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,040
 So the second he had an opportunity to kidnap some aliens, if anyone in town was gonna do

218
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,840
 it, it'd be Alan.

219
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,280
 The military would get involved.

220
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,200
 The locals would know that as well.

221
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,400
 The locals would obviously wonder why there were all of a sudden troops surrounding the

222
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,680
 old farmhouse.

223
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,080
 And then no one would ever know how it turned out.

224
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,720
 That would be that.

225
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,800
 100% that's how that story would end.

226
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 Whatever happened to Alan Greenwood?

227
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,840
 I don't know, the National Guard came out and he was in the house with them three guys

228
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,720
 that looked like they weren't from around here.

229
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
 What happened then?

230
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
 I don't know.

231
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
 Did you ever see Alan Greenwood again?

232
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,520
 Well, you know, some people say...

233
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,200
 They would liquidate that dude.

234
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,960
 They want that dude, if this story is real, that dude, if he walked out of that farmhouse,

235
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,680
 he was not long for this world.

236
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,920
 There is no way, no way that that dude would live to tell that tale for multiple reasons.

237
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,320
 One, he's basically taken a hostile action against a foreign country in a sense.

238
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,080
 It'd be the same thing as if he took a bunch of Syrian diplomats, they're hanging out in

239
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,520
 New York and he took them hostage.

240
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,280
 You're not long for the world.

241
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,560
 Either the Syrians are gonna get you or we are.

242
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,240
 The US military, US secret...

243
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
 You know what I mean?

244
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,680
 You have to be like, "Hey, don't take him out, gentlemen.

245
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
 We'll do it for you."

246
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,760
 If he didn't end up locked up in some sort of laboratory, all sorts of stuff, the story

247
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,680
 would end with you never really knowing how it ended.

248
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,720
 You couldn't hide the fact that the National Guard surrounded this farmhouse, but you could

249
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,040
 be like, "No, Alan has to come with us and answer some questions and he'll probably spend

250
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,440
 some time in the drunk..."

251
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,760
 You know, a whole bunch of stuff, but this dude would not be long for the world.

252
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,680
 You can't kidnap aliens and get away with it.

253
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,880
 So the fact that it ends with, quote, "No more information" is exactly how it would

254
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
 be in real life.

255
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,680
 Even locals who saw this, if this did actually happen, you know, you would see National...

256
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,040
 He eventually would give up, he'd surround the National Guard, they'd pull him out, little

257
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,960
 aliens would be hustled back to their ship.

258
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,640
 Oh, no, they weren't really aliens.

259
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,360
 They were guys in suits, they're filming some new Star Wars movie and you know, old Alan,

260
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,240
 they'd have a hundred cover stories.

261
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,400
 And if they just stormed the farmhouse, you would be like, "Oh, no, no, everyone's fine,

262
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,640
 but we had to take Alan to hospital, he didn't get shot in the brain multiple times.

263
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,880
 That was special effects from that movie."

264
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
 That's exactly how these stories would end up.

265
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 It's fascinating though.

266
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,200
 And this is one of the stories that if it is a media hoax, I would love to hear that

267
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,520
 angle of it as well.

268
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
 Who did it and why?

269
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,040
 If this story, if someone contacts me after this is done, like they have before, like

270
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,600
 the Civil War ghost story or the Lone Pine Devils and someone's like, "Oh, no, that's

271
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,160
 a confirmed media hoax."

272
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,680
 And I would love to hear that story as well, because like, why did they do it?

273
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,480
 What was the point of the joke?

274
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,360
 Fascinating stuff, fascinating stuff.

275
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,200
 I think if aliens show up, we've talked about it on this several times on the show about

276
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,120
 fighting back about beating up gray aliens, how weak they are, little tiny white skinned

277
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,720
 men walking around ships.

278
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,560
 And they're all fancy with their chartoos lights.

279
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,400
 You could beat them up, you could take them.

280
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,400
 But when I say stuff like that, I hope I'm very clear not saying take them hostage.

281
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,680
 I'm not saying like, "Now, it's my time to do the laser probe on your brain."

282
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,280
 No, just beat them up.

283
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
 Just rough them up a bit.

284
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
 That's what I'm saying.

285
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
 Just rough them up a bit.

286
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,800
 Show them what's what.

287
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,360
 I, Jason Carpenter, who worked at reparative, do not endorse taking aliens hostage.

288
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,560
 It will end badly for you.

289
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,360
 Taking them up might not be a great idea either, but you can just save a self-defense and you

290
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
 are panicked.

291
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,400
 Nick, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carvener copter.

292
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,260
 Helena Hop on board as well.

293
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:19,640
 We are leaving behind this farm fly us all the way out to the land down under.

294
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:25,760
 Australia, the penal colony continent, the big giant piece of land.

295
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,320
 It's beautiful when you look at it on the globe.

296
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,400
 Or as I called it yesterday, the glob.

297
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,120
 I still don't know what I was thinking.

298
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,240
 We're flying out to the beautiful land of Australia.

299
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,560
 We're about to meet a little boy.

300
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,240
 His name is Marcus.

301
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,360
 Marcus is a six-year-old boy and his older brother is named Kane.

302
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,720
 We don't have an age for him, but Marcus and Kane in this house, they have just done the

303
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 impossible.

304
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,960
 They've cleaned their room.

305
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 They're good boys.

306
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,880
 They went and they took all their toys and put them away and put their clothes in the

307
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
 wardrobe.

308
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,080
 They've picked up the banana peels and the chunks of meat and throwing them in the proper

309
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
 garbage can.

310
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,680
 The room's clean.

311
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,920
 The room, ding, little sparkle on it and the parents come in and they go, "See Marcus

312
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,400
 and Kane.

313
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
 See what a clean room looks like.

314
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,200
 You can actually see the carpet.

315
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
 We can actually see you."

316
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,360
 Previously, we would just see two lumps moving underneath all the dirt and the refuse.

317
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,640
 But now, aren't you guys proud of a job well done?

318
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, we did it.

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,480
 We cleaned our room."

320
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,280
 It's great.

321
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
 Great job, kids.

322
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,320
 Well, a couple nights later, they're asleep.

323
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 Marcus and Kane are asleep.

324
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 They have bunk beds.

325
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,160
 So Marcus is on the bottom bunk and Kane's on the top bunk.

326
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,080
 And something wakes Marcus up early, early in the morning.

327
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,680
 He hears his dad walking through the house.

328
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
 That's normal.

329
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,400
 The dad's normally walking around the house, six in the morning to get ready to go to work.

330
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
 Marcus opens his eyes.

331
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
 Stomp.

332
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
 Stomp.

333
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 Stomp.

334
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
 Stomp.

335
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 Stomp.

336
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
 Stomp.

337
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,160
 But he quickly realizes that this is not his dad walking around.

338
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,880
 In fact, he doesn't hear his dad walking in the house at all.

339
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,520
 So Marcus starts to think, "Wow, it must be earlier than I thought."

340
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,320
 Dad's normally stomping around at six in the morning.

341
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,080
 It must be like four or five if dad's not up.

342
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,560
 What's that stomping going on?

343
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,160
 And he realizes he's hearing it outside.

344
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,520
 Whatever is making this sound, he compared it to the sound of heavy steel-toed boots

345
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
 stomping around.

346
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,880
 He goes, "I heard him out by the back door of the house."

347
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,040
 And now I hear them in the house.

348
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
 Stomp.

349
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
 Stomp.

350
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
 Stomp.

351
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
 Stomp.

352
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 Stomp.

353
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
 Stomp.

354
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,600
 They're coming down the hallway.

355
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 Stomp.

356
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
 Stomp.

357
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 Stomp.

358
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 Stomp.

359
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,760
 They're approaching the open bedroom door.

360
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
 Stomp.

361
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
 Stomp.

362
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
 Stomp.

363
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
 Stomp.

364
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
 Stomp.

365
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
 Stomp.

366
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:20,080
 Marcus is staring at this open bedroom door and suddenly he sees it.

367
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,280
 He said, "It appeared first at the top of the door, almost like it had been walking

368
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,920
 along the ceiling and was now entering the bedroom.

369
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,000
 It was coming from the top of the door.

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,560
 What he saw was a massive spider with a grinning human head."

371
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:54,440
 He's looking at this huge creature slowly crawling into the bedroom, eight legs scuttling

372
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,560
 across the ceiling.

373
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,800
 It's large.

374
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,440
 The head was the size of a human's head.

375
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,200
 The body was proportional to that.

376
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:13,320
 It was just this large black spider with this human head, this wide grin of razor sharp teeth.

377
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,360
 And it's staring straight into Marcus's eyes.

378
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
 Marcus can't look away.

379
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,320
 The spider's still moving around the room, but it's staring straight at Marcus as its

380
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,640
 legs continue to scuttle and crawl around the ceiling and down the wall until it reaches

381
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
 the wardrobe.

382
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,440
 The creature then opens up the wardrobe and begins pulling out the boy's clothing and

383
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
 throwing it around the room.

384
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,560
 In an instant, Marcus is watching all of the work that him and his brother had done be undone

385
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,360
 by this monstrosity, by this creature who invaded the house this night.

386
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,080
 Marcus is terrified.

387
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,400
 I think any human would be terrified, but you imagine a six year old boy at night, be

388
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,680
 a hundred times worse, you see this giant spider-like creature with a human sized head

389
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,200
 smiling at you with razor sharp teeth.

390
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,320
 Marcus is laying there in bed and he goes, "Kane.

391
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,320
 Are you awake?"

392
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,160
 "Yeah," Kane responds.

393
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,600
 In a moment of quiet, fills the room as this creature is continuing to throw clothes around,

394
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:41,040
 and then Kane goes, "I see it too."

395
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,120
 Marcus threw the coverage over his head and hurled underneath his blankets.

396
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,240
 As he continued to hear this creature scuttle around, making a huge mess, empty in the wardrobe

397
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,040
 back on the floor.

398
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,880
 And then at some point, it simply left.

399
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,040
 But both the boys woke up to this messy room.

400
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,080
 It wasn't a dream, something happened.

401
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,800
 In the next morning, Marcus and Kane were talking about what happened last night, and Marcus

402
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,920
 was like, "You saw that last night, right?

403
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,880
 They're standing among a sea of clothes at this point and they're looking for something

404
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
 to wear."

405
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,040
 Marcus goes, "You saw that last night?"

406
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,400
 Kane's like, "Yeah, I did.

407
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 I saw that."

408
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 Marcus goes, "Well, what are we going to do?

409
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
 What are we going to tell mom and dad?"

410
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,160
 And Kane goes, "Listen, don't tell anybody.

411
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,480
 They're not going to believe it.

412
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,120
 Just keep it between us because nobody's going to believe this."

413
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,560
 And apparently Marcus did try telling people, because he basically says, "Yeah, they didn't

414
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
 believe me.

415
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,760
 They didn't believe me at all when I told them about this."

416
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
 Spider that crawled in the house in the middle of the night and made their room a mess.

417
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,760
 Obviously, the parents would be like, "Guys, you just spent such a long time cleaning it

418
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
 up.

419
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,960
 Why did you make it all messy?"

420
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,280
 If you say, "Well, a giant spider came in my house last night, they're not going to

421
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
 believe you."

422
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,040
 No parent would.

423
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,600
 Marcus posted this story online.

424
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,760
 I see the username "seenparanormalthings" and normally when I see a username like that,

425
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,960
 I go, "What's the validity of this story?

426
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,200
 Is this someone just looking for attention?"

427
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,960
 They're like, "In the next week they fight a dragon and then one time they take a bunch

428
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,400
 of aliens hostage in a farmhouse.

429
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
 You know what I mean?

430
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,160
 Like sometimes we see these accounts that just make stuff up."

431
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,520
 This looks like a throwaway account.

432
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,640
 They mostly, there's a fairly new account.

433
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
 They mention this and then they kind of talked about one or two hobby things they were doing

434
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
 on other boards.

435
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,080
 But I saw this and I go, "Okay, that's probably just a throwaway account.

436
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,480
 They wanted to talk about this."

437
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,360
 What's interesting is, I would say, I can't put a percentage on it, but it was enough

438
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,240
 that even Marcus was coming back, because that's not his real name.

439
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,480
 Marcus was coming back and saying, "Guys, this is actually like a terrifying event for me."

440
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,920
 Because most of the comments, like the ones I saw, the ones you'd see maybe 70 to 80%

441
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,120
 were, "Ha ha, Australia.

442
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
 That's what I thought.

443
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
 Oh, it's Australia, eh?

444
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
 What did you expect?

445
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,600
 Oh man, those bugs in Australia."

446
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,160
 When I saw Australia in the headline, I knew what was coming.

447
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,000
 It was just all these stupid jokes.

448
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,920
 And he was responding to him at a certain point.

449
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,120
 He goes, "Guys, this is like, I'm trying to tell you something that actually happened."

450
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,560
 Like everyone's just, and this was on like a paranormal board as well.

451
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,600
 This was on humanoid encounters.

452
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,320
 That was where it was found.

453
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,520
 And then I was like, "What's super interesting about this?"

454
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:48,200
 Despite all those stupid remarks, what's super interesting about this is he's not alone.

455
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,520
 There was probably like 500 comments.

456
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,680
 A good amount of them was, maybe not that many, let's say 200, 300 comments.

457
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,240
 A good amount of them were Australia jokes.

458
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,160
 But just through a cursory look.

459
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,440
 Because I was trying to find, he drew a picture.

460
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,160
 He didn't include his account at first.

461
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,320
 He drew a picture and then I had to go through the comments to find what he was actually

462
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,680
 saying about it.

463
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:17,720
 I found multiple accounts of a similar creature all over the world.

464
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,880
 So many so that I couldn't even cover them all.

465
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,920
 I picked two of them.

466
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,320
 Let's take a look here.

467
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,800
 Down in South Africa, we're going to meet a young man, an 18-year-old boy.

468
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,480
 We'll go ahead and call him Johnny.

469
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,120
 Johnny, living in South Africa on the Eastern Cape, he said his family when he was 18 years

470
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,680
 old moved out to an old farm that had been built in the late 1800s.

471
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,720
 One night, five in the morning.

472
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 Interesting.

473
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,280
 You know, this is happening around the same time as the first story.

474
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
 It's five in the morning.

475
00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:03,440
 He said, "I walked into the bathroom and I see this massive spider in the bathroom."

476
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:11,200
 He estimated it was the size of about a medium-sized dog.

477
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
 It was standing there in the bathroom.

478
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,560
 I don't know if it was on the ground or on the wall or on the ceiling.

479
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,960
 I know you don't no longer have to use the bathroom.

480
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,560
 You just went.

481
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:27,960
 You see this spider the size of a medium-billed dog and its head was a human skull.

482
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:36,240
 Now, a little human skull design on the fur, it had a human skull the size of a human skull

483
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
 as a head.

484
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,840
 He said, "I walked into the bathroom.

485
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,200
 I looked at it and I stared at it for almost 20 seconds.

486
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,840
 There was just this time period where I couldn't move.

487
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,640
 Just looking back at me, these dark sockets just staring into my soul and then it simply

488
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,840
 scurried away into the darkness."

489
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,720
 He said, he posted on this story online under the username JoroGumo.

490
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,740
 He goes, "When we first moved in, I remember hearing the scuttle butt around town.

491
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:17,000
 The rumor in the area is the previous owner was known for wrapping the house in fencing

492
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,520
 wire and smearing the fencing wire with animal fat.

493
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
 This is weird.

494
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
 Why are you doing this?"

495
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,720
 The previous owner said, "Late at night, demons."

496
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
 What he called them.

497
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,240
 "Demons would crawl out of the river and enter my house."

498
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,200
 He figured out the way to keep himself safe from these creatures crawling out of the darkness

499
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,920
 was to wrap his house in fencing wire and cover it in animal fat.

500
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,120
 Which of course the new owners wouldn't do that, right?

501
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,800
 They'd go on some weird kook.

502
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,280
 They're running down a bunch of demons and running up behind them.

503
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 They're like, "Ahh!

504
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,780
 Put it back, put it back."

505
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
 Creepy story.

506
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,520
 You have a giant spider with the size of a human head.

507
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,960
 Let's travel to a suburban neighborhood.

508
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,000
 This is a story we don't have an exact location for.

509
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,480
 A user by the name HelicopterSpirited65 tells us this story that happened back in the early

510
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,680
 1970s.

511
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,160
 He was seven years old.

512
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,920
 Early 1970s he was seven years old.

513
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,360
 Actually if he was born in, let's say 1972, right?

514
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,660
 If he really was born in '65 and he was seven years old.

515
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,760
 He was playing with the neighborhood kids.

516
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,940
 Some of his relatives had come out and they were hanging out and they were all playing

517
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,160
 with neighborhood kids and they decided to all play a big game of hide and go seek.

518
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:43,000
 He said, "I was there with another boy and a girl that were visiting us from out of town.

519
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,240
 They're all playing hide and go seek so we'll go ahead and call this guy Billy and then

520
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
 he has two friends."

521
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,880
 Billy's running around and they hide as a group.

522
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,240
 They're playing this big game of hide and go seek and him and the boy and the girl hide

523
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,320
 as a group and they're in this area behind a house, his house.

524
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,960
 They're hiding and all of a sudden the little girl starts to scream.

525
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
 She's screaming her head off.

526
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,560
 Billy looks at her and sees that she's looking at something behind him and she's just terrified.

527
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,160
 She's letting off this ear piercing shout.

528
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:26,520
 Billy turns around and he looks and on the wall, about the size of a dinner plate, he

529
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:36,080
 sees a huge spider with a human face.

530
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,640
 All of these creatures have similar appearances.

531
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
 The second one had a skull.

532
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,960
 The first one we covered had a human head.

533
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,880
 This one is described as a human face.

534
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,760
 So I don't know if it's a patch of fleshy skin placed against the spider's abdomen.

535
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,240
 Where it's like the face is slowly coming out of the spider's body or when he's saying human

536
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,320
 face he means the same thing where it's like a separate appendage, a human head staring

537
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,560
 off at them.

538
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,120
 But again, those are kind of semantics.

539
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,280
 You turn around and you look, you see a spider the size of a dinner plate with a human face.

540
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,640
 And this one also, huge smile.

541
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
 Huge smile.

542
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,480
 He compares it to the Cheshire cat.

543
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,200
 Just staring at these children.

544
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,200
 All three kids ran away screaming and in a phrase that we'll see also in a lot of paranormal

545
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,480
 stories, especially ones of high, high strangeness.

546
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,440
 We don't see a lot of these in ghost stories, but sometimes when we're looking at forces

547
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,680
 far beyond what we would normally consider paranormal, he ends it by saying, quote, "That's

548
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,000
 all I remember that day."

549
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,840
 Now it doesn't mean that's because of his age.

550
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,400
 This time goes on, you know, you're like, oh, I've experienced it all my life.

551
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
 That spider thing.

552
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,160
 I don't remember how that story ended.

553
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,920
 But sometimes when we see this in alien stories, we'll have stories that, like I said in the

554
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,320
 beginning, no more information.

555
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,640
 It's possible that what these people are seeing are so uniquely powerful that they can either

556
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:27,520
 create trauma that's so awful your brain blocks it out or they can, like an alien, shut down

557
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,040
 your ability to retain memories.

558
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,280
 It could be his age.

559
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,880
 It could be the fact that whatever this was, I mean, for all we know, it chased them down,

560
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,240
 chased these three kids down and did horrible things to their body and their mind.

561
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,800
 He doesn't remember.

562
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,200
 He doesn't remember telling the parents.

563
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,440
 He doesn't remember the reaction of the other neighborhood kids.

564
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,360
 Whether or not they went back on a search party and found that empty doesn't remember

565
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,760
 anything.

566
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,200
 Like I said, there are other stories listed here, and it makes you think how common is

567
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
 this creature.

568
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,640
 We've covered giant spiders twice on this show.

569
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,800
 One is like one of my favorite paranormal stories ever about the giant spider of Paris.

570
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:23,080
 The police were on the hunt for a serial killer, and instead they found this giant spider's

571
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,320
 cavern near the catacombs of Paris.

572
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
 I love that story.

573
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,120
 That's one of the stories that I've read like, I don't know, 20 years ago.

574
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,280
 And I was always intrigued by it.

575
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,480
 We also covered the Jabba Fofi, I think it was called, super early episode of Dead Rabbit

576
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
 Radio.

577
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,720
 It was from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

578
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,040
 There was the idea that there's a porn video out there of a woman having sex with a giant

579
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,560
 spider.

580
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,320
 We weren't able to confirm that existed.

581
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,840
 We did think that there's possibly a most likely there is a video of a woman having

582
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,080
 sex with a giant crab.

583
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,440
 There is a particular type of crab that is basically the size of a human, or half the

584
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
 size of a human.

585
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,080
 So we go, there might be a porn video out there of that, probably.

586
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,200
 We know how sick and rich people can be.

587
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,280
 If someone really wants a video of a woman banging a snow crab or whatever it was, they're

588
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
 going to get it.

589
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,800
 They'll pay for it.

590
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,960
 Do these creatures exist?

591
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,520
 Those are standard spiders too.

592
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,280
 I mean, this one obviously, there's a monstrous head popping off of it.

593
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:41,000
 Now here's the thing, you can honestly, as a skeptic say, a spider the size of a dinner

594
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,480
 plate is not out of the realm of possibility.

595
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,720
 You can get a spider, and also the terror of a little kid seeing a spider, and they

596
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,440
 may imagine it as bigger than it actually is.

597
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,880
 The spider may have been the size of a saucer plate, a little teacup plate, but instead

598
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,680
 in the mind it's that big.

599
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,440
 But remember the second story was an 18 year old.

600
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,760
 He's obviously not saying that 18 year olds don't exaggerate, but he doesn't have the

601
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,360
 same.

602
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,280
 When he's looking at it, he's looking at it as an adult.

603
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,040
 And also it had a human skull for a head.

604
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,200
 That's the thing that these things have is they have a human head.

605
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
 What are these things?

606
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,400
 I always find it fascinating when someone tells a story online, and he probably thought he

607
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,040
 was the only person who ever experienced it, and then other people are like, "Oh my god,

608
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,840
 like I thought I was the only person who ever experienced it."

609
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,000
 It's a terrifying thought.

610
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 It really is.

611
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,520
 It's been so much time looking for aliens in space, building these massive telescopes

612
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,440
 to hopefully pick up any trace of intelligence outside the planet.

613
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
 And I'm not against that.

614
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,880
 I think that's a noble and really cool thing to do.

615
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,800
 We spend a lot of time scouring the woods looking for a trace of Bigfoot, collecting

616
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,080
 little pieces of hair and plaster casts of footprints.

617
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
 Which is awesome.

618
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,380
 I'm not bagging on that either.

619
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,000
 But it's possible that we're missing a piece of this puzzle that we don't even have to

620
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,200
 go looking for.

621
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,920
 It comes to us.

622
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,760
 It crawls into our bedrooms.

623
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,680
 It hides in the darkness of our bathrooms.

624
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,960
 It scuttles along the outside of our house in broad daylight.

625
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,080
 These kids were playing this game in the afternoon.

626
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,920
 The giant spider with the human head.

627
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,540
 I'm not saying that these cryptids are whatever.

628
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,420
 I mean, is it a demon?

629
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,580
 Is it interdimensional?

630
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,940
 Who knows what this thing is?

631
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,900
 I'm not saying that they're everywhere, but they're probably more common than we would

632
00:34:50,900 --> 00:35:00,300
 like to think.

633
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,980
 And we're not even looking for them.

634
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
 We're not even looking for them.

635
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,340
 All of these experiences, they thought they were the only ones.

636
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,420
 So how many other times have people seen these?

637
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,920
 And like Kane said, no one's going to believe you.

638
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,460
 A giant spider with the human head don't even tell anybody about it.

639
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,780
 Wisdom from an older brother.

640
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,100
 So how many people have experienced these things, seen these things, and just kept their mouth

641
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,500
 shut because it sounds so ridiculous.

642
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,340
 And it's so terrifying.

643
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,220
 Is it a spider with the intelligence of a human?

644
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,260
 Is it a human slowly turning into a spider?

645
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:55,100
 Is it a demon mocking us, taking this grotesque form, reaching into our deepest fears to develop

646
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,820
 this eight-legged, harried, gross body?

647
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,940
 A disgusting caricature of a human head with grinning teeth?

648
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:09,660
 It's almost too horrific to come face-to-face with.

649
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,020
 And I wonder how many are out there.

650
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,060
 I wonder how many people have seen these.

651
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:22,620
 And I wonder how many times when you hear a noise late at night, in your house, or just

652
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,540
 outside your window.

653
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:33,780
 I wonder how many times it's one of these creatures scuttling around in the darkness.

654
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,540
 You may brush it off as, "Oh, it's just a house settling."

655
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,980
 "Oh, it's just the wind."

656
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,660
 "Oh, it's just nothing."

657
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,140
 "You don't want to see it."

658
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,900
 So you ignore the sound.

659
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:57,700
 You're safety in believing that these things don't exist.

660
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:13,380
 But if they do, whether or not you turn to look at it, it is looking at you.

661
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,100
