1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 A man visits his neighbor one day, and that's just the beginning of a mystery.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,840
 Has China developed a drug that is so addictive you can't live without it?

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,800
 And then we travel to Roswell, New Mexico, a very famous location if you're a fan of

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,640
 UFOs and aliens.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,040
 But an interesting theory has popped up.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,840
 Is it possible the craft wasn't from another planet that it didn't contain grey aliens,

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,240
 but instead contained the bodies of handicapped Russian children today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:47,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,960
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so much stuff, we're just gonna jump right into it.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
 Whee!

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
 Let's go, let's get started.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,560
 Come on, get up, get up, let's go.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,440
 Okay, there you go.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
 Wanted to see you moving.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,280
 First off, let's hop into Jason Jalopy.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,360
 We're headed to David, Kentucky, December 23rd, 2019.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:21,480
 Two days before Christmas, one day before Christmas Eve, December 23rd, 2019.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,960
 It's a cold wintery day in David, Kentucky.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,840
 And a dude wakes up one morning and goes, "I'm gonna go see what my neighbor's up to.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,000
 So I'm gonna go walk over there."

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,640
 His wife's like, "You don't have to announce everything you're gonna do.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,040
 I'm getting up out of this chair right now and I'm gonna open the door and leave."

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,320
 And the wife's like, "Oh my god, why am I still with this guy?"

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,600
 So our neighbor, we'll just call him David, he doesn't have a name.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
 David of David, Kentucky, walks out of the house.

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,800
 I am now stepping off the porch, he yells to his wife as she's filing for divorce.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,080
 He begins walking across the yard to visit his neighbor.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,480
 Now his neighbor, Jonathan Watkins, Jonathan Watkins, 38 years old.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,800
 Not to be confused with Jonathan Winters, which none of you did because not only do

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,120
 those names not sound alike, most of you don't know who Jonathan Winters is.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,240
 But if you do know who Jonathan Winters is, imagine the rest of the story.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,160
 And Jonathan Watkins as a 400-pound baby.

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,520
 Because that's basically who Jonathan Winters was.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,600
 Imagine a fatter version of that guy.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,080
 Okay, that doesn't work either.

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
 Who is that guy?

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
 Louis Anderson.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
 Imagine a fatter, older Louis Anderson.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 If you want to...

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,960
 Like I don't even know who Louis Anderson is.

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,520
 I'm not as old as you are, Jason.

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,960
 Well, anyways, go look those up.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,160
 Pause the podcast.

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
 Go look up a photo of Jonathan Winters dressed as a baby.

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,280
 Come back and then we'll get started.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 Okay, you did that.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
 I trust you guys did that.

50
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,800
 So, David, hey Jonathan, I want to see what's up.

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,720
 And the door opens up.

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,600
 And Jonathan Watkins standing there, 400-pound human baby, covered in blood.

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
 David thinks this is odd.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,400
 Normally people aren't covered in blood until much later in the day.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,240
 It's a mystery is afoot.

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,160
 And the neighbor asks Jonathan, hey, what have you been up to?

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
 And this is the quote.

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,440
 This is what Jonathan actually said to his neighbor.

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,000
 "I've been skinning dogs."

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Hmm.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,480
 David thinks to himself, interesting.

62
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,320
 But that can't be true.

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,560
 Despite the fact that he's covered in blood, which is oddly suspicious, I don't think

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
 he's been telling the truth.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,320
 Because this is actually from the article that I got.

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,520
 This is from the Courier Journal, an article written in the Courier Journal.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,340
 This phrase appears, this might be one of the best sentences that I've seen in a long

68
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,340
 time.

69
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,600
 This is a quote from the article.

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:58,400
 The neighbor told police that he did not believe Watkins because of past mental illnesses.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,000
 So basically, David is looking at a blood-covered 400-pound human baby who admits he's been

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
 skinning dogs.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,600
 And David goes, hmm, you know, if another rational person had told me that, I would

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,240
 believe that story and I would call the cops immediately.

75
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,460
 But because you have a history of mental illness, I think you're lying to me, sir.

76
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,020
 Good day, liar.

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,100
 You fabricator of facts.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
 David leaves.

79
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,660
 Now as David's leaving the porch, he's like, hmm, so he is covered in blood, but because

80
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,940
 of his history of mental illness, I think he's lying.

81
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,500
 I don't think he's been skinning dogs.

82
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 And as David's leaving the porch, he looks over and he sees on the deck animal skins.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,560
 Aha, a clue, he thinks to himself.

84
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
 Interesting.

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
 Another piece of this puzzle.

86
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,240
 Maybe those skins were there when he purchased the house and he just has, he's cut himself

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,200
 very deeply, right?

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,800
 David again just goes home at this point.

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
 Doesn't call the police.

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
 Doesn't call the police.

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,120
 Man admits to skinning an animal covered in blood.

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,000
 Animal skins on his porch goes home and then he's sitting there and he has his feet.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,860
 I'm propping my feet up on the chair.

94
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,260
 He announces loudly into his living room.

95
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,180
 His wife's suitcases are ready to go right out the door.

96
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,980
 And then he goes, oh, you know what would make this day even better?

97
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,980
 Forget the mystery.

98
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,660
 Forget the bloody man next door.

99
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,380
 The animal skins, you know what would make this day even better?

100
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,420
 Hanging out with my two dogs.

101
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,820
 Rusty Coco.

102
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,060
 He yells off Rusty Coco.

103
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,060
 That's two separate dogs.

104
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,060
 And honestly, I don't know.

105
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,500
 Not the dog's not name Rusty Coco and I don't know what the actual names of the dogs are.

106
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,700
 And I think it's kind of moot at this point because we, you should see what's going on.

107
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,900
 I'm sorry to start the episode off with this story, but Rusty starts walking around Coco.

108
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,820
 Rusty Coco and his dogs are gone and he goes, hmm, let me get out my pipe.

109
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,180
 Let me get out my Sherlock Holmes hat.

110
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,100
 So let me put together the clues today.

111
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,700
 The blue, the blue's clues.

112
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
 Let me go back.

113
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,100
 Me and Steve are going to go back with these blue's clues.

114
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,740
 First off, my neighbor is covered in blood.

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,580
 Secondly, he said he's been skinning animals, but we have to disregard that because he's

116
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,580
 insane.

117
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
 Hmm.

118
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:23,980
 I found two animal carcasses on his porch and now my dogs are missing.

119
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,580
 So he sits there for a while and then he goes, I, you know, I should call the cops.

120
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,180
 I really should call the cops.

121
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,980
 Cops go over to homeboy's house.

122
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,340
 Open up, open up sir.

123
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,700
 Jonathan Watkins opens the door, still covered in blood.

124
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
 This time holding a knife.

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,700
 Police are like, whoa, whoa, what's going on dude?

126
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,300
 And he says, quote, I'm making myself a doggy coat.

127
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,940
 They know he has a history of mental illness as well, but they, they arrest him.

128
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,340
 And David, the neighbor is looking out the window and he's like, hmm, I wonder why the

129
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,540
 police are there.

130
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,780
 I wonder what could be going on.

131
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,900
 Rusty Coco.

132
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,180
 So that is the story of Jonathan Watkins, 400 pound human bloody baby who killed dogs

133
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
 allegedly.

134
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,180
 Again, maybe the dogs had heart attacks at the same time.

135
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,300
 Anyways, he was making a doggy coat.

136
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,140
 So that's that story.

137
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,820
 There you go.

138
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,980
 That's a good way to, I realized the other day I go, I build this as a true crime podcast,

139
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,220
 paranormal conspiracy and true crime.

140
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,460
 And I realized this the other day when I was doing the story about the guy injecting stuff

141
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,900
 and it was testicles in the middle of McDonald's.

142
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,540
 I thought this isn't what people think of when they think of true crime.

143
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,900
 When people think of a true crime podcast, they think of serial killers and, and murderers

144
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,220
 and stuff like that.

145
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,860
 Not vagrants exposing themselves in public and injecting drugs into their testicles.

146
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,300
 Not people making doggy coats.

147
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,740
 Not any of the other weird things I've covered.

148
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,900
 But honestly, I kind of like this true crime stuff better because the murder stuff just

149
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,860
 kind of gets old unless it's super weird.

150
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,700
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story though.

151
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,500
 Now our next story is actually a request.

152
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,620
 So we're leaving behind David, we're leaving behind David Kentucky.

153
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,060
 We're going to buy him puppies though.

154
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
 Here you go.

155
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,260
 We're actually going to buy him puppies with the money we get from our Patreon because

156
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,780
 this next story is actually a request from a Patreon user.

157
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,620
 So Lori sent me this story and Lori, we're going to use our money from Patreon to give

158
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
 him two little puppies.

159
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
 Here you go.

160
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,420
 And he's like, oh yes, two little coats.

161
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,580
 And I'm like, what?

162
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
 And he was in on it.

163
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,660
 And I think he was the mastermind the whole time.

164
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,700
 He's like, yes, evil doer.

165
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,580
 I know you're making those coats.

166
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,140
 He's like, but master, you're the one who sells him online.

167
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,900
 And he's like that guy's obviously mentally ill.

168
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,980
 Cops are arresting him.

169
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,780
 Don't worry officers, all dispose of this evidence.

170
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,620
 His eyes shifting from side to side.

171
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,300
 He goes down to his basement.

172
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
 He's sewing it together.

173
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
 Want something done?

174
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
 You got to do it yourself.

175
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,260
 The entire basement full of dog skins and then in the corner, his wife's skin as well.

176
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,020
 Leave me, will you?

177
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
 Leave me.

178
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,940
 Okay, apparently he became the crypt keeper.

179
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,660
 Apparently this anonymous man whose neighbor in real life killed and skinned dogs is now

180
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,740
 the most evil villain in the story.

181
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,940
 The camera pans out of his basement window, goes up into the clouds, credits roll for this

182
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,980
 fictional story I just made up.

183
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,140
 And anyways, we're headed off to China.

184
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,580
 Now this has nothing to do with coronavirus.

185
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,060
 I'm not talking about coronavirus.

186
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,100
 But this was a request from a Patreon user, Lori.

187
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,140
 I just want to make sure that I say that because that kind of might have gotten lost in my

188
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,380
 fictional world there.

189
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,580
 So really, really thank you for the Patreon support.

190
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,020
 If you want to support the Patreon, it's in the show notes.

191
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,740
 If you can't support the Patreon, just help get the word out about the show.

192
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,060
 That really helps a lot.

193
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,980
 Supposedly there's a new drug, right?

194
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
 So we're in China.

195
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,980
 There's a factory.

196
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
 No one's working there right now.

197
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,660
 They're all sick.

198
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,380
 This conspiracy has kind of been waylaid by what's going on over there right now.

199
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,340
 So we go into a factory and it's completely empty.

200
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,660
 The bodies are stacked 10 dead on the factory floor.

201
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,780
 But that's not because of coronavirus.

202
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,500
 That's just because it was a sweatshop.

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,940
 But also now they're stacked 12 dead because there's also people dying in the floor.

204
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:25,940
 In this factory, these little vials going down an assembly line.

205
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,300
 This chemical is known as DYXJU.

206
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,740
 Now the reason why we know about this chemical is from John McAfee, inventor of antivirus

207
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
 software.

208
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,660
 I don't know if he invented it or if he's just the guy behind the marketing dude.

209
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,700
 He might be the Pillsbury dough boy of the virus software.

210
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
 I have no idea.

211
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,540
 The only thing I know about John McAfee is that he believes in quantum suicide to the

212
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,700
 point that he put a loaded revolver into his brain in front of a reporter pulled the trigger

213
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,140
 and he goes in another reality.

214
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,620
 My brain's blew out but in this reality I'm still alive.

215
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,620
 Whatever.

216
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,140
 And he is alleged to have killed a man.

217
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,260
 Killed his neighbor actually.

218
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,500
 Maybe his neighbor was making too many doggy coats.

219
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,220
 But that's not what we're going to talk about here.

220
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,220
 You can look all that.

221
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,220
 You're like I want to hear about that.

222
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
 No you don't.

223
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
 It's kind of lame.

224
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,540
 But that's all just he's just a weird guy.

225
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,020
 So when he tweets this thing about DYXJU it's kind of par for the course for John.

226
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
 Good old Johnny.

227
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,540
 Here's this tweet that he had.

228
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,660
 The Chinese government has created a revolutionary drug called DYXJU.

229
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,980
 It is absolutely zero effects on physiology or consciousness.

230
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,140
 That's kind of a lame drug.

231
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,740
 You're like do let's go and do this drug that does nothing.

232
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
 Absolutely nothing to us.

233
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
 Yeah man.

234
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,260
 I can't wait to just sit there and think normal thoughts.

235
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,300
 It is absolutely zero effects on physiology or consciousness.

236
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,940
 Do any drugs have effect on a physiology?

237
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,380
 Like do you take a drug and you turn blue?

238
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,740
 Like aren't they all consciousness?

239
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,460
 I guess like cocaine makes your heart race.

240
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
 That's not a good one though.

241
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,440
 It is absolutely zero effects on physiology or consciousness.

242
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,380
 People behave normally.

243
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,660
 It has zero side effects except one.

244
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:14,420
 This ingested the urge to re-ingest approximately 24 hours later becomes extreme.

245
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,940
 For those who asked what's the point?

246
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,060
 Imagine a government that could control a population using drugs.

247
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,180
 Been done before.

248
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,060
 Those are, that's his asides, his little parentheses.

249
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
 Let me go back to this.

250
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,100
 Imagine a government that could control a population using drugs.

251
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,420
 Been done before without having to deal with the side effects or changes in society brought

252
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,060
 on by the drugs.

253
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,700
 That drug could be the most valuable substance on earth.

254
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
 So obviously there's a couple different questions here.

255
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,980
 One, how did he find out about this?

256
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,100
 Now he's supposedly like maybe like more enlightened than the rest of us.

257
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,500
 He's definitely richer than a lot of us.

258
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,100
 Maybe he has access to this stuff.

259
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,020
 Whistleblower sent it to him.

260
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,180
 He's getting this info fed to him from somewhere.

261
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,460
 He uncovered it himself.

262
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,460
 He was on submission.

263
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,500
 He was looking for more neighbors to murder.

264
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,260
 He's like I think I have some neighbors in China.

265
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,620
 Kicks down a door.

266
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,340
 And it turns out that there's really making this stuff.

267
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,820
 So that was his tweet though, right?

268
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,220
 Regardless of where he got the information from, he's definitely revealing this to us

269
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,540
 to let us know about DYXJ.

270
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,780
 Now I'm looking around and other people are going whoa dude this is like trippy because

271
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,620
 those Chinese man they're gonna like take us all over and they will use this drug to

272
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,620
 do it.

273
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,780
 You know slip it in our water supply or just give it to us willingly and tell us it's

274
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,820
 something cool and then we're addicted to it.

275
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,380
 Government will control us.

276
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,940
 And I was doing my research, I was looking all over for this stuff.

277
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,300
 I came across a website called, it was an outdoor website called 24 hour campfire.

278
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:49,300
 It's always weird to me how mainstream conspiracy theories have become.

279
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,180
 Because when I was reading them they weren't cool at all back when I was like 12.

280
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,060
 And I got into all this stuff a long time ago like in the 1980s.

281
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,780
 There's real underground stuff.

282
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:02,140
 And now a website dedicated to like camping gear and backpacks and stuff like that.

283
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,140
 It's talking about this.

284
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,820
 I guess they probably have a survival contingent on that website but still it's odd.

285
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,940
 I've come across ghost stories on motorcycle forums.

286
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,220
 We talked about that a long time ago.

287
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,700
 It's drifting, drifting forums.

288
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,180
 Just everyone kind of loves talking about this stuff.

289
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,980
 This website 24 hour campfire has a user named Jeff A. And he broke the code.

290
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,980
 He broke through the Chinese conspiracy.

291
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,780
 And if you're listening to this at work turn it down or put your headphones on because

292
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,700
 I'm going to have to use some profanity, which I rarely do on this show.

293
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,140
 Because I listen to podcasts at work and I hate it when...

294
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,340
 That's why I don't really use a lot of profanity on this show.

295
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,620
 I listen to podcasts at work myself and I like to listen to podcasts that don't necessarily

296
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,620
 always need headphones.

297
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,820
 So, here we go.

298
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,780
 DYXJU.

299
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,580
 This is what Jeff A. pointed out.

300
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,100
 DYXJU.

301
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,780
 If you shift to the right for each of those letters.

302
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,380
 D is F.

303
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,860
 Y is U.

304
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,300
 X is C.

305
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,580
 J is K.

306
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,940
 Fuck you.

307
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,940
 And then you can be I, but I think that it...

308
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,940
 Then it's just fuck I.

309
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,460
 But basically it's fuck you.

310
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,260
 And then it's basically revealed to be a troll.

311
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,620
 So the people on the campfire forum, like the threads going pretty well and then that

312
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,180
 release and people are like, "Oh, yeah.

313
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,180
 Look at me.

314
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,980
 Look how dumb I am that I thought that this was actually real."

315
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,580
 People started then posting that on Twitter.

316
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,180
 They're like, "Dude, it's a troll obviously.

317
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,460
 John gave you this information.

318
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
 It's an acronym.

319
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
 It's a little code.

320
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
 It's just fuck you.

321
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
 It's not a big deal."

322
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,500
 Now, generally, I've been proven wrong, proven wrong on this show.

323
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,740
 People have said what you reported, not disputed.

324
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,140
 People have said what you reported was actually an internet hoax.

325
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,380
 And here's the article proven in.

326
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,100
 And I've issued corrections and go, "Oh, yeah.

327
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
 It wasn't an internet hoax."

328
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,980
 And that's part of the problem.

329
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,580
 John McCat, and that's what you should do.

330
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
 You get caught out.

331
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
 You just get caught out.

332
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
 There are 388 episodes.

333
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,940
 If 10 of them are provably false, not because I was lying, but because the information I

334
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
 was giving was wrong.

335
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
 Who cares?

336
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,460
 Or, you know, 20 or 30 or whatever.

337
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,420
 Anyways, John McCat gets called out on this, and then this is his tweet.

338
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,220
 Of course.

339
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,380
 The full name of the drug shifted right one key is fuck you.

340
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,420
 Okay, you're admitting to it.

341
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
 He goes on.

342
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,620
 An accident?

343
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
 I think not.

344
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,380
 We don't think it's an accident, John.

345
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,900
 We think it's actually a troll.

346
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,060
 It's a troll on purpose.

347
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,340
 But anyways, he continues.

348
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
 An accident?

349
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,940
 I think not.

350
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,500
 The Chinese are coming soon.

351
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,700
 Eat no- This is not a joke.

352
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,420
 I'm not making this next two sentences he actually wrote in public.

353
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,740
 Eat no Chinese food?

354
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,260
 Okay, you know, it's fine.

355
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,700
 No fortune cookies.

356
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,700
 What?

357
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
 What's wrong?

358
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,740
 Fortune cookies aren't- I don't even think they're traditionally Chinese.

359
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,820
 No sing-tow beer.

360
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,340
 I don't even know- How am I supposed to not drink something I didn't even know existed?

361
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
 Fine, done and done.

362
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,700
 I don't even know what that is.

363
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:04,580
 And then, and no, cunnilingus with Chinese women.

364
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,780
 Is that how this is spread?

365
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,060
 Like why those particular things?

366
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,060
 Like, I can understand they're putting- they may be putting it in their food.

367
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,740
 I don't know how they're putting a liquid into a fortune cookie.

368
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,260
 It might be the driest thing ever constructed.

369
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
 Sing-tow beer, sure.

370
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,340
 Don't know what it is.

371
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
 Never even knew it existed.

372
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,340
 I promise you I'll never drink it.

373
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,420
 Maybe they're putting it in the drinks.

374
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
 And no cunnilingus with Chinese women.

375
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,060
 The only way it could get into the woman's system is if she took it herself.

376
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,140
 So are they already on this drug?

377
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,100
 And also now that I think about it, okay, but is John saying it's cool to just blow

378
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,340
 a bunch of Chinese dudes?

379
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,980
 Like, oh no, no, you can totally do that.

380
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,580
 Meet Jet Li, take him in the bathroom.

381
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,980
 Blow him to your heart's content.

382
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,140
 But no, not with those women!

383
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,860
 So anyways, he's obviously a lunatic, allegedly.

384
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,140
 And a lot of people pointed this out.

385
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,100
 There's a lot of substances like DYXJU on the market.

386
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,140
 It's called food and water.

387
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,300
 Like it has no real effect on you or your consciousness, but you need it every 24 hours.

388
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:16,700
 The need to re-consume food and water every 24 hours is great.

389
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,820
 And governments can control you by limiting those.

390
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,340
 So I really appreciated the recommendation lawyer.

391
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,780
 I thought it was an interesting journey.

392
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,460
 Because yeah, at first you're like, "Hmm, this seems like some weirdo conspiracy thing."

393
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,220
 And then in the end you're like, "Oh, it's just one weirdo conspiracy guy spouting something

394
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
 off."

395
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,700
 Then probably it may be 10% of the people who read everything still believe that the

396
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,740
 Chinese government have created this drug that will turn you into a drug addict zombie?

397
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,100
 You're just basically a normal person.

398
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,580
 You just want it every day.

399
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,900
 Which food, water, and sex.

400
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,260
 It's basically that.

401
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,220
 But in a water form, apparently one of the transmission vectors of it is going down on

402
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
 Chinese women.

403
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,660
 The whole thing's absolutely bizarre.

404
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,620
 So I appreciate the recommendation.

405
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,260
 Because I love reading bizarre stuff.

406
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,900
 So let's go ahead and move on to our last story here.

407
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,220
 And our last story is kind of short.

408
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,620
 It's actually interesting because for the implications of it, there's really not a lot

409
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,820
 of information to back it up.

410
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,740
 It was extremely controversial when it was released.

411
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,900
 So there's this author/journalist named Annie Jacobson.

412
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,460
 She specializes in writing books about secret groups, not like secret groups like Illuminati,

413
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,660
 like actual government funded secret groups.

414
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,740
 She's had books about the Operation Paperclip where the US government brought Nazis over,

415
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,460
 changed their identities because we wanted them for the rocket program.

416
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,300
 That's pretty common knowledge.

417
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,860
 She has books about CIA paramilitary armies.

418
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,300
 She has a book about the government looking into psychokinesis.

419
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,460
 These aren't super unknown conspiracy theories.

420
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,900
 But she tends to focus on the government side, DARPA, secret stuff that's going on.

421
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,300
 Now she wrote a book called Area 51, An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base.

422
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,660
 Getting the history of this place that supposedly doesn't exist.

423
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,460
 For the longest time, the government refused to even acknowledge it existed.

424
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,580
 But now they'll acknowledge it exists.

425
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,100
 They don't acknowledge what goes on there.

426
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,620
 So she's doing this book.

427
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,220
 And in the book she's detailing the history of the base, right?

428
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,940
 But then the last seven pages of the book is about Roswell.

429
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,060
 It was a bombshell when it came out and it almost immediately got swept under the rug.

430
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,340
 So let's go ahead and take a look at these last seven pages.

431
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,900
 We are actually taking the Carbindercopter.

432
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,940
 We are going to land in Roswell, New Mexico.

433
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,820
 And we are going to watch the crashing of the alien craft in this desert.

434
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:58,220
 Skipping across the ground.

435
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,500
 Smoke pouring out of this disk.

436
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,060
 Come on guys, let's go see some grays.

437
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,580
 We're running through the desert with our flashlights, our pitchforks.

438
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,540
 We have those two just in case they're still alive.

439
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
 We're going to stab them.

440
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,180
 We're going to stab these aliens.

441
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,780
 We get there.

442
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,260
 We get to the crash disk door.

443
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,460
 Trying to open and I use my immense strength.

444
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,100
 Pull it open.

445
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,460
 You guys are all amazed.

446
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,980
 A couple of you are turned on.

447
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,700
 I'm like, no time to be attracted to me.

448
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,740
 You save that for later.

449
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,260
 Let's go and we go into the disk.

450
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,100
 And there we see the three famous gray alien corpses.

451
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,900
 Just laying there.

452
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,780
 And I'm like, no.

453
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,900
 I wanted to kill you myself.

454
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,260
 Military shows up.

455
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,820
 Helicopters.

456
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,900
 And they go, they pull the bodies out, take them to the lab.

457
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,020
 One of them gets autopsy for Fox's alien autopsy in the future.

458
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,780
 So on and so forth.

459
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,980
 You know the basic story of Roswell.

460
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,860
 Turns out none of that stuff is true, by the way.

461
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,260
 I found out while I was--

462
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,340
 that's how I always thought the story of Roswell happened.

463
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,220
 And it turns out that apparently some dude was just walking by his ranch on June 14th

464
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,020
 and saw a bunch of debris and didn't think anything of it.

465
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,820
 There was nothing spectacular about all the garbage he saw in this field.

466
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,340
 His name was William Brazel.

467
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,500
 June 14th, 1947 he sees this.

468
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,940
 He goes, he leaves.

469
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,740
 It's not until July 4th that he goes back to the area for whatever reason, for work,

470
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,260
 and goes, you know what?

471
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,940
 I'm going to put some of this stuff as a samba.

472
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,660
 He drags some of the debris to be underneath a bush.

473
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,460
 And to kind of like hide it, because he's still like, yeah, it's nothing.

474
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,060
 He starts hearing stories about flying saucers in the media.

475
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,380
 And then either June 6th or June 7th, he calls up the authorities, calls up law enforcement,

476
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:56,020
 says, "I've been reading about them flying saucers and I-- there are some weird debrises

477
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,460
 out in Roswell."

478
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,900
 So then they go out there.

479
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,380
 And then July 9th is when the first article is written about it on the Roswell Daily Record

480
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,180
 local newspaper.

481
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,980
 And in that article there, like it was a balloon.

482
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,980
 It was a balloon.

483
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,220
 Like, if you read the Roswell Daily Record article that was written, the closest report

484
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,060
 to it was not spectacular in any sort of way.

485
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,180
 They really explain in the-- I could read you the quote.

486
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
 Not going to, but I'll read you this part.

487
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,460
 When the debris was gathered up, the tinfoil paper, tape, and sticks made a bundle about

488
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,220
 three feet long and seven to eight inches thick while the rubber made a bundle about

489
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,860
 18 or 20 inches long and about eight inches thick.

490
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,900
 And all he estimated the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds.

491
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,660
 There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an engine and

492
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,340
 no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one paperfin had been glued on to

493
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,820
 some sort of tinfoil.

494
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,380
 So that is being written on July 9th, 1947.

495
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,140
 So I have no idea where all these stories of flying discs and alien bought.

496
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,380
 I mean, it seems to be pretty obvious that what was found out there was a bunch of tinfoil

497
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,780
 paper and tape.

498
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,500
 But whatever, whatever.

499
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,440
 Let's assume the traditional thing, because even Annie Jacobson's story assumes it's more

500
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,100
 than that initial report in the Roswell Daily Record.

501
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,940
 That a disc did crash in Roswell.

502
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,900
 But while the story is already out, so now we're back into how people believe Roswell

503
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
 happened.

504
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,980
 The story is out, people have already believed that a flying saucer has crashed.

505
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,620
 And actually the story didn't really become famous until the 70s.

506
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,100
 Again, there was huge time difference between what had actually happened and when people

507
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,260
 actually started paying attention to Roswell as an event.

508
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,060
 It was a long period of time.

509
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,460
 You might have had one or two people really into it, maybe four or five.

510
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,460
 The numbers don't matter.

511
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,300
 What I'm saying is, as a national thing, as like a plinch pin in the UFO story, that didn't

512
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,220
 start until decades later.

513
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,620
 So anyways.

514
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:07,260
 Let's pretend that the myth is the fact that the saucer crashes, the military retrieves

515
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,940
 these bodies, and they're autopsying them and they realize, whoa, these are definitely

516
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
 they don't look human.

517
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,380
 They're big old heads and tiny little bodies and all sorts of stuff.

518
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:27,020
 But doing an autopsy, they are definitely, they are definitely, definitely human.

519
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,820
 Because this is the theory that's put out in Annie Jacobson's book, in the last seven

520
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,260
 pages of a book that other than these last seven pages was just a history book of a base.

521
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,580
 Then it goes off into this weird thing.

522
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,940
 Stalin did not have a nuclear bomb in 1947.

523
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,540
 And Stalin realized that he needed to do something.

524
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,660
 He needed to do something now and he needed to do something super, super weird.

525
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,780
 He wanted to scare Americans.

526
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,300
 So he takes a bunch of deformed Russian kids, right?

527
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,780
 Possibly this is, it's so weird that this is all kind of just crowning this conspiracy

528
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
 theory.

529
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:11,340
 Stalin, Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, takes some deformed Russian kids.

530
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:17,100
 Originally designed by Joseph Mengele himself, the angel of death, the Nazi doctor who was

531
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,660
 doing all that horrible stuff in the concentration camps.

532
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,820
 He was taking Russian kids and deforming them, making them look gross and all grody and stuff

533
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,140
 like that.

534
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,580
 And then put them in a flying saucer and you're like, wait a second, wait a second, wait a

535
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,580
 second.

536
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,380
 So Stalin doesn't have nukes but he has flying saucers.

537
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
 Well, kind of.

538
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:42,820
 Apparently the saucer was remote controlled and you're like, okay, this is even done.

539
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,100
 Hold on, hold on, hold on.

540
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,140
 There was a Russian asset in New Mexico flying a saucer around with remote control full of

541
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,940
 three disabled kids, right?

542
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:58,460
 And then they crash it into the ground and then the military shows up and they're like,

543
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,500
 oh no, it's aliens, it's an alien invasion.

544
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,460
 Now apparently this wasn't the only UFO.

545
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,740
 There are other UFOs floating around America.

546
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,580
 This one crashed.

547
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
 They weren't supposed to crash.

548
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,460
 They were supposed to just fly around and eventually maybe land and all the kids get

549
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,340
 out and like go to McDonald's and then people are like, oh my God, aliens are invading McDonald's.

550
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,780
 But this one crashed.

551
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,260
 Who knows what happened to the other one?

552
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,060
 Who knows if any of this is real, right?

553
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,060
 But apparently the CIA was talking to the National Security Council.

554
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:37,660
 The CIA got a lead on something and there was a real fear that the Soviet Union was going

555
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,020
 to use Americans obsession and fear of flying saucers.

556
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,100
 Because see, flying saucers were big back then.

557
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,700
 The Roswell event wasn't connected to them yet on a national scale, but flying saucers

558
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:58,140
 were in vogue and they, free your mind, they, the CIA was afraid that the Soviet Union was

559
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,420
 going to use saucers to either make Americans scared or we're going to use flying saucers

560
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,100
 to overwhelm early warning systems.

561
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,940
 People would be calling up phone lines, servicemen would be seeing all these flying saucers flying

562
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,180
 around and when everyone was trying to figure out what to do then, you'd have bombers and

563
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,980
 they didn't have nukes, but you'd have like bombers and jets and all that stuff flying

564
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
 around.

565
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,580
 So, she says this in her book and it's immediately lambasted.

566
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,100
 They're like, so much of the story doesn't make sense.

567
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,140
 I mean, it's all single source.

568
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,060
 This part of the story is all single source from someone who worked at Area 51.

569
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,660
 But at the end of the, it is ridiculous because I don't know how good remote controls were

570
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,660
 back then.

571
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,660
 I think it would have been easier to fly a plane and use these things as gliders to

572
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,860
 trade like you launch them like you have a glider plane, it just flies for a couple

573
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,020
 miles and then crashes somewhere and you would have a bunch of deformed kids bodies hanging

574
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
 out of stuff.

575
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,500
 It would panic people.

576
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,740
 The very least you'd be like, Russia really has that deformed kid technology on lock.

577
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,300
 They can do that in a heartbeat.

578
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,340
 America, we're 50 years behind deforming children.

579
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,060
 Get on it, scientists.

580
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
 You could have done that.

581
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,040
 I think that'd be easier, but maybe the Soviet Union, they didn't have nukes so they spent

582
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,420
 all their money at Radio Shack buying all of these RC units.

583
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
 Who knows?

584
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
 Who knows?

585
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:20,700
 The point is, is that really this scenario is, okay, I know this scenario is more realistic

586
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:28,560
 than a vehicle being built for interstellar travel, passing around meteor showers and

587
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:37,140
 supernovas and galactus trying to eat it, traveling the cosmos more than a solar system

588
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,820
 away, Alpha Centauri at the least, and then comes Earthen and they're like, "Wooah!"

589
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
 and they crash.

590
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,300
 Like, that's stupid.

591
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,820
 Like that whole scenario is dumb.

592
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,700
 I think the most likely scenario, and I've talked about this before, is that aliens are

593
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,500
 already here, that they're coming from within the planet or from underwater, that they've

594
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,460
 been here as long as we have been, or longer.

595
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,380
 That's the most likely scenario.

596
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,100
 Or them coming from Mars or Venus is far more likely than them coming from Alpha Centauri

597
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,060
 or Sirius or anything like that.

598
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
 Or they're interdimensional.

599
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:16,460
 But again, an interdimensional craft that can pierce the veil but then can't pierce New

600
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,300
 Mexican sand.

601
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,340
 That story doesn't wash either.

602
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,820
 Anyways, so when you take away, unless the aliens are from here and that ship came out

603
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,140
 of the water and then they just had a malfunction and crashed, it would be more likely, and

604
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,020
 really if you look at it from a skeptics point of view, the stalling theory is far more likely

605
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,540
 because it doesn't evolve any sort of technology that exists in science fiction, or any sort

606
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,820
 of species that exists in science fiction.

607
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:50,100
 It's just a cruel, brutal dictator, his country that already had a bunch of economic problems,

608
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,660
 trying to build something that could fly and scare people, but they couldn't even do that.

609
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,100
 It crashed into the ground and a bunch of bodies fell out of it.

610
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:06,100
 That's far more rational than grey aliens from another reality or planet or solar system

611
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,420
 just on its face.

612
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,980
 And I'll say this, honestly, I think that's scarier.

613
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,020
 I think that's a lot scarier.

614
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,260
 Tell me what's more frightening to you.

615
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:23,020
 A species from another solar system that may occasionally show up here, float around, duck

616
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,300
 to a couple of people, and go home.

617
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,260
 Or the enemy being the people next to you.

618
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:36,220
 David in Kentucky, his enemy was the dog-skinning neighbor.

619
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,220
 If the dog-skinning neighbor lived in New Zealand, you would read about it and be like,

620
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,820
 "That sucks," but it doesn't affect you.

621
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,900
 And maybe that dog-skinning neighbor eventually travels to David, Kentucky, and goes and

622
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,180
 buys some popcorn and sees some hot dog walking down the street and takes that dog back to

623
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,700
 New Zealand.

624
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,180
 Terrifying.

625
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,620
 But not as scary as living in the neighborhood.

626
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,140
 The idea of governments doing this is scarier than aliens.

627
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
 And this is why.

628
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,140
 One.

629
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:10,060
 Because obviously, the Soviet Union is still, obviously we still have UFO encounters and

630
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,340
 abduction encounters, but the Soviet Union's not around anymore.

631
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,220
 So you would have other governments doing this, most likely CIA, US government doing

632
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,060
 these things.

633
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,860
 You would have them not only with this equipment.

634
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,380
 I'm not saying they have the ability to fly around super fast in teleports.

635
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,420
 I'm saying how UFOs are described.

636
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,380
 And so they have this technology that mimics sci-fi, but it's completely understandable.

637
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,380
 It's not free energy.

638
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,020
 It's not anti-grab.

639
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:44,220
 It's some sort of device that actually is legit, but appears like a magician's trick,

640
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,900
 appears to be paranormal.

641
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,460
 You have the US government abducting people.

642
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:55,380
 You have the US government taking cows and cutting them up and dropping them up to make

643
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,860
 us afraid.

644
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,220
 You have CIA operations all over the planet.

645
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,500
 They didn't get scared of Stalin.

646
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,660
 They didn't let Stalin's plan override our early warning systems.

647
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,180
 They learned from this plan.

648
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,220
 They perfected this plan.

649
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,220
 And so those great aliens that are reported sneaking around in people's bedrooms, those

650
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,700
 great aliens that people see when they're abducted aboard these ships, and see three

651
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,060
 or four aliens walking around.

652
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,180
 A lot of times described as being robotic.

653
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:35,980
 They're deformed children, perfected to a point where they don't just look like three

654
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:44,220
 raggedy old bodies, but children that are taken and reconstructed to look like creatures

655
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,660
 from another world.

656
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:52,940
 They've been working on this technology for over 50 years, and it's been perfected now.

657
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,140
 That to me is more terrifying than aliens coming from another planet.

658
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,620
 With that, when you read these stories about grays, they're actually human children, lobotomized

659
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,620
 and transformed into these things.

660
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,340
 Far more terrifying.

661
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,500
 Because apparently there's a lot of them.

662
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:22,260
 And around the world, every year, a lot of kids go missing and are never found.

663
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,140
