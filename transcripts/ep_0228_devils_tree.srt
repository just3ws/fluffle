00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,420
 Today we take a trip to New Jersey to find the portal to hell and then we take

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,540
 a look at an urban legend that we've all heard but turns out to have more

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:21,300
 gruesome origins than we could have ever imagined today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio I'm your

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,620
 host Jason Carpenter I'm having a great day I hope you guys are having a great

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,780
 day too I almost feel like I have to record this episode as quickly as

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,980
 possible. My laptop is making some clicking sounds the hard drive is doing

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,220
 the little bit of the click. You know I've all you know my the

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,700
 Ravatron 3000 is out of commission right now I have to order my power

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,700
 supply for that I probably should do that tonight. You know if the laptop goes

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,060
 and I don't have the power supply for the desktop yet my backup plan is as

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,640
 odd as this may sound is just to record many episodes on my phone many as in

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,180
 small not many as in numerical just to keep the show going so hopefully we

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,140
 don't come to that hopefully don't come to that I don't have enough money to buy

15
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,620
 a laptop I do have enough money to buy a power supply for the Ravatron but my

16
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,860
 concern is is that when the power supply went out on the desktop that it's not

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,700
 just the power supply that went out that it may have taken the motherboard with

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,580
 it and so then that would be an additional cost and all that stuff so

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,780
 that's what's going on so if you notice a huge drop in audio quality in the

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,140
 coming days it's because I'm recording it on my phone but let's go ahead and get

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,620
 started with this episode but let's go ahead and get started with this episode

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,620
 here now this episode is supposed to be I feel like I'm totally losing the plot

23
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,420
 on the show these past two days because one I actually really liked yesterday's

24
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:04,980
 episode but this is day two of me trying to deal with this nicotine withdrawal I've

25
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,140
 basically just been sleeping all day long and eating my weight in chewy chips

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:19,780
 ahoy cookies I'm more cookie than man at this point but I know I'll be fine in a

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,020
 day like I know it'll all be over in a day so I'm just gonna have to write this

28
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,220
 out I sat here for an hour in the silence of my apartment thinking should I

29
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,500
 just go buy some more chewing tobacco that'll at least I'm not on the Los

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,620
 Angeles anymore right and I'm thinking Jason that's stupid but I had to let my

31
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,940
 brain go through that entire hour-long process to not do it super bizarre and

32
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,340
 I was bargaining with myself I was like I'll go back on keto right now go back

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,620
 on keto right now if you go and buy some chew and then like and then go back up

34
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,420
 see the problem is I have an oral addiction so that's what I that's really

35
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,980
 what I need to get rid of because when I was chewing the tobacco when I went to

36
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,260
 the Los Angeles and now I'm like I'll just eat food for the next couple days as

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,980
 much food as I want and then I just have to get over I can't keep having these

38
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,260
 oral fixations because then it's the two things that I can't do I can't overeat I

39
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,980
 can't be on nicotine so anyways all of that being said let's go ahead and get

40
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,740
 started with the episode let's go ahead and get started with the episode if this

41
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,140
 one might be short I might cut out the urban legend story I don't know because

42
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,220
 again I was feeling fine I'm until the point I started recording and now I'm

43
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,340
 like feeling like super anxious like I want to claw someone's eyes out so let's

44
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,180
 go and get started with the first story and possibly the only story right now

45
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,780
 thanks guys for sticking with me this won't be a long-term thing if I go back

46
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,860
 on the chew or I start doing the Los Angeles again I just start doing it

47
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,220
 again and we regroup later but for right now I have a patch nicotine patch taped

48
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,940
 to my foot that's where we're at right now so let's go to New Jersey let us all

49
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,540
 jump in the Jason Jalopy we're gonna take a long car ride from Oregon to New

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,020
 Jersey now so in New Jersey in the city of Somerset County sorry this is not a

51
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:19,060
 city in the township of Bernard's Township in Somerset County New Jersey

52
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,260
 there is a mountain road or the mountain road or mountain road might be the

53
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:30,340
 name of it and on this road is a tree but not just any tree not just any tree the

54
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,740
 devil's tree don't don't don't I should say now that pretty much all the

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,300
 information I have involving this tree is from backpacker verse backpacker verse

56
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,900
 is a website that we've covered before that just basically seems to make stuff

57
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,620
 up out of whole cloth just totally fictionalizes the whole thing and you're

58
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,380
 like Jason you're probably only gonna cover one story this episode you're

59
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,620
 covering a story that is from a website that you know is fraudulent just roll

60
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,100
 with it guys just roll with it I'm starting to develop like hot sweats

61
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,780
 right now just think of it this way guys think of this episode as a cautionary

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,420
 tale towards getting addicted to anything just a think of it and think of it

63
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,380
 don't don't get addicted don't get addicted to anything don't get addicted

64
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,180
 to happiness or joy or love anything because somebody you'll have to wean off

65
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,980
 of it anyway so backpacker verse backpacker verse is this website we've

66
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,540
 covered a couple times now although the fact that they make most of the stuff up

67
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,020
 I don't know if this is made up or not this one might be true but whether or

68
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,340
 not it's true it actually has the best tree intro I've ever read and I can't

69
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,820
 say I've read a ton of them but I was like this is the best intro I've ever

70
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,820
 read and it made me think it made me think so let me read it to you this is

71
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,620
 from the website this from the article trees have been symbolic motifs some

72
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,100
 nice words there trees have been symbolic motifs since the dawn of time

73
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,500
 ranging from creation stories including the Tree of Knowledge in the Bible and

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,260
 Yadrassil the world tree in North North some mythology to the Buddhist Bodhi

75
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,940
 tree and ancient tales about being people being transformed into trees like

76
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,100
 this is quite the overview quite the overview we're not even finished yet the

77
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,140
 majority of these tales have been mostly positive and charming which makes the

78
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:48,700
 following report one of the darker if not the darkest story involving a tree and

79
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,780
 it's funny cuz I read that and I thought that's not true there's plenty of

80
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,340
 stories where trees are bad or dark dark tree stories and actually sat in the

81
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,820
 coffee shop and I thought I can't think of any like what is the worst tree story

82
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,420
 that you've ever heard now obviously lynchings are gonna be high up on there

83
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,940
 but this story has that so you're thinking what and I was thinking well I

84
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,300
 mean the chop down a tree and turn it into a cross they cross my Jesus on that

85
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,340
 but I think that's kind of stretched because then because then you can say

86
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,540
 like a tree got chopped down and became a guillotine like I think they're talking

87
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,340
 about actual trees but it did make me think yes since the beginning of time

88
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,180
 the trees are a symbolic motif used in all of these things we don't really have

89
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,140
 any bad tree stories this might be one though this might be one Bernard's

90
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,420
 Township so little Township out in the middle of New Jersey has this tree no

91
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,220
 one is the Devil's tree so the local legend is that Bernard's Township used

92
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,940
 to be the headquarters for the KKK in the entire state of New Jersey they all

93
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,300
 came here to do their KKK stuff the Ku Klux Klan if you don't know what that

94
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,500
 means and you know originally they were supposed to be the ghost of dead

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,600
 Confederate soldiers that's why they were kind of dressed in those white

96
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,740
 gowns they're supposed to be spooky ghosts that would chase people off their

97
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,260
 land and then they just basically became an unarmed militia so anyways that was

98
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,900
 the legend whether or not that's true we don't know for sure but according to

99
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,100
 backpacker verse it is if it's not I think Bernard's Township has a really

100
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,740
 good lawsuit actually you know I think that the Devil's tree is actually a

101
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,980
 real tree because they are photos of it there are photos of it but again it's

102
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,940
 this website kind of adds a little bit of flavor to this stuff so if any of

103
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,560
 this article is incorrect and you happen to work for the City Council of

104
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,380
 Bernard's Township I will be a witness during the trial because this definitely

105
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,700
 makes it look like a place I will not go headquarters to the KKK and because it

106
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,300
 was the KKK they're hanging people from the tree so that was where like this was

107
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
 the tree they picked it was out in the middle of nowhere that's where they would

108
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,820
 hang up all the black people so what is interesting about that a lot well let's

109
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,540
 think about this logically it is the headquarters of the KKK for the entire

110
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,180
 state of New Jersey how many black people do you think we're living there

111
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:25,180
 in Bernard's Township to begin with think it logically think about that so they

112
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,100
 would have to then import people from other cities to hang there like I don't

113
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,100
 get it I don't get I don't get that like if you are the headquarters of the KKK

114
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,080
 you're not gonna pick a diverse city to to set up in you're gonna find the

115
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,700
 widest place possible and then you're gonna run out of minorities to hang

116
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,220
 quite quickly so then you're gonna have to import I this is getting grim the

117
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,420
 logistics of the lynching history is getting grim but again I'm dicey on

118
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,560
 whether or not that it happened at all but now we get another famous website

119
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,500
 that we've covered in the past that just puts out like the most bizarre stuff and

120
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,300
 not in a good way not bizarre stuff like the Ocean and the Night or Ageless

121
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,660
 Travel they'll put out stories that just don't make any any sense when you think

122
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,100
 about electrically weird New Jersey also has teamed up with backpacker verse to

123
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,500
 cover this story weird New Jersey is a monthly or I think it's monthly like an

124
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,180
 online magazine they might have a print version we got we got tingled up with

125
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,740
 them huh that is a pun intended when we were looking at spider gate cemetery and

126
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,380
 they just wrote the weirdest stuff the weirdest weirdest stuff anyways weird

127
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,420
 New Jersey comms states that people had driven by and seen ghosts hanging from

128
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,140
 the tree so the idea was that there was ghosts of the people that had been hung

129
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,140
 there by the clan but they also stay in there's no attribution to this because

130
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,220
 otherwise I'd be able to list the link backpacker verse has a nasty habit of

131
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,740
 saying where New Jersey says and they'll have a hyperlink and you'll click on it

132
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,380
 and it'll be like 15 definitions of the word says so it's like they trick you to

133
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,580
 thinking that if you click the hyperlink it takes you to back up what

134
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,860
 they're saying they did that they do that all the time it's super frustrating

135
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,740
 but anyways they say where New Jersey says that people were seeing ghosts of

136
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,700
 black people hanging from these trees but at least one time it turned out that

137
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,260
 what happened was the local football team at Bernard's Township hung effigies of

138
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,420
 the rival team from that tree now I do like logical answers if someone's

139
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,900
 driving by and they see a silhouette and they think it's the ghost of a black

140
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,660
 dude hanging from a tree and then they find out that it's a team a football

141
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,020
 team that was hanging effigies I do like it when we're able to logically have

142
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,260
 these things spelled out my question is okay if we accept everything that's been

143
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,260
 said is truth right now how much do you have to hate your rival football team

144
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,580
 to hang them from a tree where historically black men and women were

145
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:17,100
 hung from like that's a love that is a level of hatred that is nearly barbaric

146
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,980
 like I can't imagine hey I can imagine it may be hating somebody or an

147
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,820
 organization like that but not a rival football team the only difference

148
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,100
 between you and them is they live in a different neighborhood and so they're

149
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,220
 attending that school but think about it you hate this team so much that you're

150
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,900
 like you know what we should do we should steal their mascot and they're

151
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,580
 like no no no no we should like throw eggs at their car no no no and some guys

152
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,780
 like know that tree that they hung all those black people from let's hang them

153
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:55,940
 from let's make dummies of that team and hang them from a tree where multiple

154
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,460
 people lost their lives only due to their skin color and everyone else just

155
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:07,220
 feels that's a great idea why didn't I think of that let's do that so bizarre so

156
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,220
 you've got this tree that may or may not been accused by the clan that may or may

157
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,940
 not have been used by a football team but we'll accept both of those is true

158
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,260
 because whatever the point of this episode as much as it's gone off the

159
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,260
 rails is that it's known to be now a portal to hell it's not just any tree

160
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,420
 it's not just a lynching tree it's not just a tree that is inappropriately used

161
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,180
 by high school football teams so anyways the that all being said there's

162
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,220
 apparently a legend of dude kills his family hangs himself from the tree makes

163
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,940
 the tree haunted or the tree was already haunted and it commanded him to do that

164
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,100
 but technically when where he killed the people like he should if you're gonna

165
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,340
 make these legends up the tree should have killed the people the tree not like

166
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,900
 it's walking around like an int throwing boulders at him but it's like he shoots

167
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,420
 the family and then he hangs himself you'd think where the innocent people

168
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,060
 were killed would be more haunted than the tree where the evil man hung himself

169
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,180
 unless like his spirit went into the tree but if we're making it up just make it

170
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,540
 up to the tree possesses people they can tell that they're possessed because they

171
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,260
 they stand there all the time they have to console they're constantly

172
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,100
 dehydrated they're like I have to drink water have to drink so much water and

173
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,580
 they're like why aren't you eating anything is like yeah anyway I joke

174
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,580
 went nowhere also people say that if you touch the tree trust me this is going

175
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:42,060
 somewhere this isn't totally this isn't as rambly as he thinks it is people say

176
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,820
 that according to the website if you touch the tree it's still there if you

177
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,420
 touch the tree you get an oily stain that is nearly impossible to wash out I

178
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,180
 call 100% BS on that there'd be tons of photographic proof you'd have chemist

179
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,060
 out there you'd have all sort of scientists out there being like what is

180
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,980
 this amazing pain thing like a paint that never wears out they'd be suckin the

181
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,500
 tree dry of stuff it's totally at parts one I can guarantee that parts 100%

182
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,620
 made up there is nothing on the planet that you touch that is super oily okay

183
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,060
 that's not true there's lots of stuff on the planet that may be impossible to

184
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,460
 wash out but this tree isn't one of them absolutely 100% fake made up backpacker

185
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,580
 verse I'm so tired of this one woman this is hilarious according to this

186
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,860
 website one woman unsourced put her ear to the tree for whatever reason it's a

187
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,780
 haunted tree that is so oily it can possibly stain your your skin black

188
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,020
 yeah go ahead and put your ear up to it this woman puts her ear up to it she

189
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,220
 heard the sounds of screaming from inside the tree so again of course that

190
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,820
 either she can hear termites she made it up or it's true and you would have

191
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,420
 ghost crews out there they'd be hooking microphones up to it and all this

192
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,140
 stuff like that and you're thinking Jason you're being a little harsh and or

193
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,020
 kind of beating the dead horse that is the devil's tree but hold on getting

194
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,380
 somewhere give me a few more minutes of your time before you click up now also

195
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,340
 they say that nowadays if you get too close to the tree a black Ford like a

196
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,780
 black Ford pickup truck like an old-timey pickup truck shows up like just

197
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,100
 drives up the road and watches you for a while but then once you notice the

198
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,380
 trucks there it drives away now that is such a stupid detail I don't think it's

199
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,340
 made up they call him the Sentinel from hell like people and not they people

200
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,780
 have said oh maybe that's like the devil's guard keep an eye over the tree

201
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,460
 make sure no one's messing with it but I'm thinking what kind of Sentinel just

202
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,660
 drives away when you notice it but you know what's funny that is such a stupid

203
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,780
 detail and it doesn't have like when the way that this website normally works is

204
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,340
 and then the doors of the car opened up and blood spilled out everywhere and

205
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,460
 then you were the blood you'd be like what blood fills everywhere and then like

206
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,380
 a bunch of bats fly out of the glove compartment or whatever they always make

207
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,940
 stuff up so I'm thinking this detail almost seems so lame it's probably true

208
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,900
 this car shows up watches you for a bit drives away now again that's not super

209
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,300
 suspicious but it's also not totally normal it's kind of like in between so

210
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,020
 you go Jason why did you talk about the devil's tree for nearly 20 20 minutes

211
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,380
 I'm sure I'm gonna edit out a lot of that but he talked about this devil's

212
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,140
 tree for 20 minutes you tease us with an urban legend story that I'll talk about

213
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:42,460
 tomorrow this tree is real I know that for a fact and now it is encased in wire

214
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,580
 and fencing you can't go near it can't go near it at all covered in graffiti

215
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,660
 people have tried cutting it down people have tried touching it people have tried

216
00:17:52,660 --> 00:18:00,940
 listening to it and it is protected from all of that now so that's when I thought

217
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:07,420
 okay there might be something to this a tree is a tree is a tree yes I get it

218
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,820
 some people don't like trees getting chopped down and some trees are like

219
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,940
 this tree was around when Jesus was born I actually wonder if any trees are that

220
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,420
 old but trees have been around for like this 500 year old tree this big-ass tree

221
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,180
 just sitting in the middle of nowhere don't chop it down but if a tree was

222
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:29,060
 known again and let's assume that the historical parts are true this tree was

223
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,740
 used to hang people which is not a huge stretch of the imagination logistically

224
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,940
 yes getting black people into the KKK headquarters into the city probably be

225
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,140
 kind of difficult but I'm sure that people were hung and trees everywhere I'm

226
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,100
 sure some trees were better suited for like you couldn't hang someone from a

227
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,140
 fir tree right because they're like a Christmas tree like they have to have

228
00:18:52,140 --> 00:19:03,420
 branches but anyways just imagine Charlie Brown's Christmas and someone

229
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,260
 going we can't hang anyone from that but that's you have to go find a hanging

230
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,420
 tree so anyways the point being is that if you have a tree that historically

231
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:20,260
 known to been used by the KKK why is it being protected the whole and that's the

232
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,380
 thing that's the thing like I was reading off all this stuff and you're

233
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,020
 thinking great Jason's just gonna end it with saying isn't that stupid but no I

234
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,220
 think there's a reason why this tree is being protected I don't think it's

235
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,980
 necessarily a portal to hell but what okay put on your little paranormal caps

236
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,660
 but I'm a little paranormal caps with me here you work for a city council your

237
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,100
 city council of Bernard Township and you've driven past this tree all your

238
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,420
 life you get elected at the Township Council things are going good now when

239
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,220
 you were a kid people used to hang out by the tree and tell ghost stories about

240
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,180
 the tree and stuff like that as you got older and kids got ready they started

241
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,220
 spray painting the tree and stuff like that you have this group this

242
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,820
 conservation group come to you and say we need to protect this tree this tree is

243
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,780
 like part of our local heritage you have to protect this tree and you're thinking

244
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,980
 it's just a tree for one and two the heritage that we know of is not something

245
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,100
 we really want to be associated with we know the stories that black people were

246
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:32,180
 hung from it during the dark days of this city and the state and in conservationists

247
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,900
 are like no no no no like you have to understand like this tree is a living

248
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,740
 thing we have to protect it yes it may even used against its willful horrible

249
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,660
 things but this tree is a living thing so you got so you can't chop it down you

250
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:53,140
 can't move it it's not an again not an aunt that's the I love the ends but anyways

251
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,420
 it's it's there so you have a couple different choices you can put a security

252
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,940
 guard up you can hope and educate people enough to preserve the tree

253
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,620
 themselves or you can surround it in fencing and in case it almost in metal

254
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,900
 around the trunk around height human height size so they can't do anything to

255
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,100
 the tree that would damage it permanently or even just to face it but

256
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,060
 the whole time as a city council person you would think why is this even worth

257
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,660
 the money like why is this even worth our time discussing about it's just a dumb

258
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,540
 tree it's just a stupid tree and trees get chopped down all the time trees get

259
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,940
 initials carved into them trees older than this have been chopped down so why

260
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,820
 do we care about this and then that's when you get another visitor from the

261
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,820
 conservation group and they say listen the trees a tree tree you're right there's

262
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,540
 millions billions of trees on the earth cutting down this tree to facing this

263
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,820
 tree won't change anything but the stories about the tree are more than just

264
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,220
 stories and you kind of laugh you know you've heard these stories all your life

265
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:09,220
 but person you're talking to is just stone-faced and they say a story is

266
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,260
 about the tree are true we don't know how we don't know why but it appears to be

267
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:22,580
 some sort of not necessarily portal but some sort of containment device it does

268
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:28,140
 leak some sort of oily substance we can't identify it we've heard reports of

269
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,780
 people saying that they're screaming if you put your ear up to it and we can't

270
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:40,060
 necessarily verify that but we've had more than one report and I heard it as

271
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,020
 well we could chop down the tree we could have let every ghost hunter in the

272
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,980
 state every ghost hunter in the nation here these rumors come out here begin

273
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,940
 poking around at the tree and identifying all of this stuff and making it this big

274
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,820
 ghostly landmark verifying this verifying the noises verifying the oil

275
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,740
 verifying the apparitions that have been seen from the tree we can have all of

276
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,820
 this stuff happen and then we're going to have national attention on this tree

277
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,180
 that we don't know what will happen when we cut it down or when it burns down or

278
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,340
 when someone cuts it in half we don't know or we can pay $200 put some fencing

279
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,260
 up around it and forget any of this ever happened it'll be relegated to some sort

280
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,860
 of local legend that people will believe in some website may talk about it some

281
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,900
 podcast may talk about a couple YouTube videos and that'll be it there'll be no

282
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,100
 way to verify it because you won't be able to get close to the tree I'm not

283
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,740
 worried about the conservation of the tree is some sort of article of nature

284
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,100
 I'm worried about the conservation of this town and what will happen if we

285
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,620
 chop that tree down or if it gets damaged in some sort of way so I'm going

286
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,420
 to ask you again to protect that tree because we don't know what'll happen if

287
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:51,700
 you don't the tree is protected from anyone to touch it or cut it down or

288
00:23:51,700 --> 00:24:00,100
 deface it a local legend true portal to something else something dark and deep a

289
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,900
 symbol of how evil humanity can become or something worse than all of those

290
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,940
 put together we may never know but all that fencing and all that protection

291
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:19,620
 around the tree may be to protect us from it

292
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,620
