1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 A new conspiracy tells us what makes impossible meat...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,640
 possible.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,240
 And then we take a look at the bizarre...

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
 Oh, sh-sh-sh-sh, what's happening for this episode?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,640
 Then we take a look at the bizarre fetish,

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,480
 known as "Pinectomy."

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,880
 Is it possible that you'll get the best sexual pleasure ever...

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,600
 by removing your junk today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
 *Maniacal laughter*

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,680
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
 I hope you guys are not eating hot-

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
 I hope you guys just aren't eating anything this episode.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
 Please don't eat this episode at all.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
 And poor, poor...

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,240
 Let's give a shout out to our legacy Vateron.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,640
 They're like, "No, I do not want to sponsor this episode.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,560
 I can already tell it's gonna be rough."

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,640
 Everyone give a round of applause to the brave, the bold, hot, diggity Dane.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,320
 Everyone give a round of applause.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,560
 Hot Diggity Dane is being dragged into the Pinectomy episode against their will.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,840
 But Hot Diggity Dane, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,920
 If you can't support the Patreon, then you're like,

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,520
 "I don't want to support the Patreon."

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,800
 It's like Russian roulette.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,280
 I don't know what episode I'm gonna end up in.

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
 But if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
 Just help us hear the word about this show really, really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,000
 Hot Diggity Dane, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,560
 Jason Jalopy, we're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,880
 Let's take a little journey on out too.

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,440
 Redwood City, California.

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,640
 And as we're driving down there, we get a little hungry.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
 Before we get to the Pinectomy episode, before we get to the episode,

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,880
 that's just gonna make you think of Hot Dogs and a Microwave.

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,920
 We're hungry now.

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
 So we stopped by this restaurant and it serves nothing but vegan food.

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,800
 So we're like, "Oh man, can we go to a real restaurant?

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,320
 No, it's for the story guys.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,440
 You have to go to this restaurant."

43
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,240
 So we all kind of like...

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,200
 We look at the Arby's across the street and we're like,

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
 "Oh, this is the only time I'd ever choose Arby's."

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,280
 But we go into this vegetarian restaurant, vegan restaurant, and they have...

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,800
 It actually is like really nice.

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,080
 There's like not dirty anywhere because no one ever goes there.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,920
 No one ever eats there.

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
 The employees are totally shocked when we walk in.

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,240
 "Oh guys, this is what we've been training for."

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,160
 We walk in and they have all this food selection.

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,840
 They have like beets and like carrots and like lettuce.

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,120
 And then we see meat.

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
 And we're like, "Whoa, dude, that's totally awesome."

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,320
 And we think like maybe we're just some sort of fever dream.

57
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,760
 We're so hungry for hallucinating.

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
 No, there are things out there.

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
 I'm sure you guys have seen them.

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
 There's impossible meat and there's beyond meat.

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,880
 Now, I've never tried any of these, but K.O. Sarami has.

62
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,280
 K.O. Sarami is this person on the internet who is making this claim,

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
 legally, beyond foods and impossible foods.

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
 I am not making this claim.

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,040
 I am reporting this claim.

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
 I do not believe this is true.

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
 I'm actually going to debunk this.

68
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,120
 So before your lawyers, before your lawyers

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,920
 start filling out paperwork, listen to the whole segment.

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,840
 K.O. Sarami makes this claim.

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,000
 The impossible burgers and the beyond meat, they're apparently delicious.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
 Allegedly, these fake burgers are delicious.

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
 Om nom nom, we're digging into these.

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
 Oh, are we eating them?

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,720
 Oh, can I get two more?

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,360
 They're like, "Yes."

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
 And they'll give us like a couple more patties.

78
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,800
 Om nom nom, and we're like fighting over them

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
 because they're so delicious.

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,520
 But here's the thing, while these burgers are super delicious,

81
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
 there's no meat in them.

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
 It's all a trick.

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,480
 It's all a trick.

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
 It's actually a vegetarian burger.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,320
 And what K.O. Sarami's conspiracy theory is, is this.

86
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,000
 They used to be a vegan, and they ate a lot of vegan meats

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,160
 while they were doing it, you know, quote unquote, "vegan meats."

88
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,560
 Like soy and carrots and, I don't know, sponges all mixed together

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,120
 in a big vat, so it assumes the form of a burger, and then you eat it.

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
 She was eating those.

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
 Now, she's not vegetarian anymore, but she goes,

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
 "You know what, I have a hankering fork.

93
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,560
 I have a hankering fork something that looks like meat,

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,240
 but doesn't taste like it."

95
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,200
 So K.O. Sarami goes to the store one day and buys some impossible meat.

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,720
 And takes a bite out of it and goes, "Whoa, this is almost like meat.

97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,400
 Like this is way more advanced than the vegan patties I had back when I was

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,120
 actually a vegan.

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
 Now that I've been a vegan and then started eating meat again,

100
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,200
 and now I'm to this going back to this vegetarian patty.

101
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,560
 Whoa, this is almost like real meat.

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
 I can't believe that they're able to pull this off."

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,200
 So she looks at the ingredients and she goes,

104
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,600
 "The ingredients are pretty much the same thing.

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,680
 Soy and lentils and pea proteins and stuff like that."

106
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,520
 And she ends this post by saying, "How could they make it so meat-like?"

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
 You know what I'm saying?

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,480
 It's not a conspiracy theory that somebody doesn't know

109
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
 how this delicious food is so delicious.

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
 Well, had she ended it like that, I wouldn't have even thought twice about it.

111
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
 I would have, it would have been one of a hundred posts I read during the day

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
 and move on.

113
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,160
 But then she ends it with this very, very legally dubious statement

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,040
 that I wanted to discuss.

115
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,320
 And it's very, very interesting and it's a great way to,

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,080
 it's a great way to grow, it's a great way to gross you out.

117
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
 And it's a great way to look at how conspiracy theories are born.

118
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
 Here's how she ends her post.

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,080
 "Yet the texture was so close to meat.

120
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
 I always wondered how they managed that.

121
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,600
 That and also the fact that the impossible office is windowless."

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,520
 This is gonna go from zero to 60 real quick.

123
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:42,560
 "That and also the fact that the impossible office is windowless and right across the street

124
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,120
 from a planned parenthood clinic."

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,320
 But that might not be related, unquote.

126
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:02,720
 So the implication is, is the implication is, is that I am not stating this impossible meat

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
 or beyond meat, she didn't specify beyond meat, but she didn't mention them a couple times in the

128
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,600
 post, is that they're using aborted meat patties, that's why they taste so delicious.

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
 Now, that's not true.

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
 That's not true.

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,720
 Here's an interesting thing, because we're conspiracy theorists, when we hear that we go,

132
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,080
 and then we have to start digging into it.

133
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 Like, Jason, I did not entertain that thought for one second, but I did.

134
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
 And not so much that I thought like, maybe they do put that in there.

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,520
 I started to think, could it be possible?

136
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,320
 And it's very, very fascinating how quickly this falls apart under any sort of pressure.

137
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,480
 I looked up, this is how I spent my Thursday evening, I went to Google Earth and found

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,080
 Impossible Foods headquarters.

139
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,520
 It's in Redwood City, California.

140
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,040
 The closest, I had to look all this stuff up so I could debunk it.

141
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,200
 The closest planned parenthood building to this facility, this is the headquarters,

142
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
 is nine minutes away.

143
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,920
 So that's not true.

144
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,120
 It is not across the street.

145
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,120
 I mean, sure, you could door dash it, but it's not across the street.

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
 And the Impossible Foods headquarters is covered in windows.

147
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,600
 It's one of those office buildings you see in a little office park.

148
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,760
 There's windows absolutely everywhere.

149
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,960
 So right there, that doesn't make, like, that's a lie.

150
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,080
 It's possible that in her neighborhood, there is an Impossible Foods building next to a

151
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
 planned parenthood building.

152
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,840
 But then we look at it this way.

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,800
 I, again, just always spend my Thursday night.

154
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,320
 And this is what it means when you put out a daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,800
 podcast.

156
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
 You got to look up stuff like this because I started thinking,

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,520
 how efficient would it be to eat a baby?

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
 That's the big question.

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
 So I did some research.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,680
 According to the CDC in 2018, there were around 600,000 abortions in that year.

161
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,040
 Here's what I'm chasing.

162
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,000
 Police.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
 Police, stop.

164
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
 Police, stop.

165
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,640
 I have no idea where you're going with this.

166
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,800
 But I don't think it's anywhere good.

167
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
 Police, stop.

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
 Started this off with how efficient is it to eat a baby?

169
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
 And then you just straight to abortions.

170
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,040
 The statistics just, police, hot diggity, Dane, he's running.

171
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
 He's gotten the car.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
 He's halfway back to dead rabbit headquarters.

173
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,800
 He's left us.

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,440
 Around 600,000 abortions in the year 2018.

175
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,360
 77% of them were performed in less than nine weeks.

176
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,600
 And nearly all of them less than 13 weeks.

177
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,960
 So about 92% of all abortions within 13 weeks.

178
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,480
 So the first trimester.

179
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,320
 At that point, the biggest, the little fetus gets is an ounce or three to four inches long

180
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,920
 in the U.S. alone.

181
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,800
 And so we have 600,000 abortions in the United States.

182
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,840
 And that would give you about 600,000 ounces at best of human meat.

183
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,240
 In the U.S. alone, we slaughter 9 billion chickens a year.

184
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
 This is why most people become vegetarian, vegan in the first place.

185
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
 9 billion chickens a year.

186
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
 And each of those weighs around four pounds.

187
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
 So you see where I'm going with this?

188
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,360
 It's not efficient to eat babies.

189
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,960
 It really isn't.

190
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,240
 I did not need you to point that out.

191
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
 But you think about it on a scale.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 So let's say that I do have, and this is important because the statement itself,

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,760
 there might be fetal tissue and impossible foods and beyond foods.

194
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,320
 That is such an intriguing conspiracy theory that it could become super popular really,

195
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,040
 really quickly.

196
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
 And so that's why I think it's important to kind of step back.

197
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
 Oh, even though all the laughs we've had this episode,

198
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
 it's important to stand back because it doesn't jive.

199
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,520
 It would actually, when it makes sense, there's not enough of them.

200
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,040
 They're not big enough to make these patties.

201
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,440
 And even if you go, well, Jason, please stop.

202
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
 Please, please stop.

203
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,680
 Even if you said maybe you turned them into some sort of spread or jelly and just added them to the

204
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
 impossible, there's still not enough.

205
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,600
 I'm sure that impossible foods ships out more than 600,000 patties a month,

206
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
 let alone over the course of a year.

207
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,640
 So it's an interesting conspiracy theory because people have a natural aversion to it.

208
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,400
 And one thing I've learned over the course of this show is that people love conspiracy theories.

209
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,480
 They find repulsive.

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,960
 And I, there's two things that can happen.

211
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,720
 It can just disappear into the dust.

212
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
 I honestly think you're going to start seeing more people believe this.

213
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,520
 And impossible foods and beyond foods, this may become a problem for them.

214
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,840
 They may actually have to fight back against this because we've had conspiracy theories that

215
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,800
 turned out to be true.

216
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,160
 We covered on this show where they were using, Pepsi was using fetal tissue, not

217
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,280
 aborted babies, but they were using like fetal cells, stem cells or whatever to taste their drinks.

218
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,440
 And that cost them a bunch of business.

219
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
 And that actually turned out to be true.

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,240
 But in between that true story, and they didn't have to stop doing that in between that true story

221
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,840
 and this fake story, there's a ton of other fake stories involving aborted babies, fetal

222
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
 tissue and things like that.

223
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
 And they can really wreck a company's career.

224
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,960
 So I don't believe that it's true.

225
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,680
 I actually wanted to take the time out to show why it really would be impossible.

226
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,560
 But we've seen conspiracy theories pop up that are so bizarre, they still seem to stick around

227
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,040
 for a while.

228
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
 So we'll see what comes of that one.

229
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
 Hot Diggity Dane.

230
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,800
 So many go get Hot Diggity Dane, track him down, put a tranquilizer bolt in his neck

231
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,560
 and then bring him on back because he needs to fly this carbon helicopter.

232
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
 We are leaving behind Redwood City, California.

233
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,040
 We are headed out to Ancient Greece or Rome, one of the two places.

234
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
 They're pretty close to each other, right?

235
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,240
 Hot Diggity Dane is flying this carbon helicopter back in time.

236
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,880
 And we're coming over Italy in the old-timey days.

237
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,000
 The reason why I'm kind of iffy on where we're headed is because this story,

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,880
 we have very, very limited information on the story.

239
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,800
 Historians know that this group is real.

240
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,840
 There are documents on it, but not a lot of it's online.

241
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,920
 Like, I wasn't able to find out where they hang out.

242
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
 I didn't know any of that.

243
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
 So, but it's somewhere in the ancient world.

244
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,400
 It's old-timey though.

245
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,440
 It's like 200 AD.

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
 People are walking around in sandals and robes and they got their swords and stuff like that.

247
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,320
 And they're like poking each other.

248
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,520
 And here's the carbon helicopter flying over Parthians and there's like pillars.

249
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,000
 And there is a early Christian cult.

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,280
 They wouldn't call themselves that.

251
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,240
 They were a verified religion, according to them.

252
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
 The Valeshians.

253
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,880
 And that was the sound.

254
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,240
 And that sound you heard was the sound of every historian shutting off this podcast

255
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
 because they know exactly where this one's going.

256
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,960
 The Valeshians are walking down the road and they got their sandals on and they

257
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,800
 see a bunch of travelers coming towards them.

258
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
 And they're like, "Oh, travelers.

259
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,280
 One of the best things you can see in the ancient world."

260
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,000
 I mean, a lot of times you get attacked by wild lions or just dive diseases we don't know of.

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,200
 But to see another human, another friendly human, that is what we Valeshians live for.

262
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
 And they're like, "Hozal, hozal."

263
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
 There's not a ton of information online about these guys, like I was saying.

264
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
 But we do know two key details.

265
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,720
 The Valeshians love to castrate themselves.

266
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,400
 That's the first key detail.

267
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,240
 It's really one of the main things they're known for.

268
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,640
 They love to castrate themselves.

269
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:21,760
 And for them, it was a way to show that they cannot be corrupted by earthly pleasures.

270
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,040
 That no matter what the world throws at them, some sexy ladies walking by, "Woo, woo!"

271
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
 They're like, "Nope, none of that.

272
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,760
 I got no balls, so I'm not turned on by that."

273
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,520
 They seem to get really excited when they see a group of travelers walking down the road.

274
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,640
 But a sexy lady in like a tight robe, that's not going to turn them on.

275
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,880
 It protected you from temptation.

276
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,600
 And in this world, male virginity was like the highest state you could have.

277
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,920
 Nowadays, there's always that term like, "If a man hasn't had sex by the time he's 30, he's a wizard."

278
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,200
 Back then, that was basically literal.

279
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,840
 If you could, the longer you could go without having sex, you were becoming more and more powerful.

280
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,800
 You're basically becoming more like Jesus Christ.

281
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
 But the Valeshians, like I said, were known for two things.

282
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,760
 One of them was self-castrating.

283
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,680
 And as they see these travelers walking by, they're like, "Eh, buddies, how would you like to hang out for a bit?

284
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
 How would you like to come back and hang out at our barn?

285
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,040
 Did they have barns back then?

286
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,640
 How would you like to come back and hang out at something that will eventually be called a barn?"

287
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,040
 And the travelers like, "It's been a long journey.

288
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,640
 Yes, we would love to sit down."

289
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,520
 And the Valeshians look at each other and they're like, "Enjoy sitting down for now."

290
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,080
 Travelers are like, "What? We overheard that and it sounded quite ominous."

291
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,960
 And they lead them into this barn and there's a guy sitting there with a pair of clippers.

292
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,240
 And he's like, "Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip."

293
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,160
 And the travelers are like, "Oh, I'm assuming he's going to use those to castrate that bull over there."

294
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,400
 And then he looks at it as just a normal cow.

295
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,560
 Maybe it's to castrate that horse over there, but it's not a horse.

296
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,440
 It's just like, it's two people in a horse outfit.

297
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,720
 And the travelers are like, "Uh-oh."

298
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,000
 The Valeshians are known for two things, castrating themselves and forcibly castrating

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,080
 random people they run into.

300
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,800
 So if you ran into a Valeshian, you really don't know it's a Valeshian.

301
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,440
 You can't check unless they're naked.

302
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
 They would invite people back.

303
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
 Be like, "Hey, we're having a huge party and you go there

304
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,040
 and sure you'd eat a bunch of delicious food and drink mead and stuff like that."

305
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,800
 But they'd castrate you.

306
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,640
 So that's not a good trade-off, right?

307
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
 That's never a good trade-off.

308
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,240
 They would forcibly castrate people because it wasn't just good enough for them

309
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
 to overcome temptation.

310
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
 You had to overcome temptation as well.

311
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,760
 Interesting side note, right?

312
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,200
 Historical oddity.

313
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,960
 You're like, "That's a little more than that."

314
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,400
 Like these people were brutally mutilating people, especially back then.

315
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,560
 Like I'm sure they're like, "You've been castrated.

316
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,120
 Now make your wounds heal."

317
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,160
 Is there a bleed to death?

318
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,000
 Like that's a pretty brutal operation.

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,320
 But interesting side note, it could have just been a little thing I said to start off an episode.

320
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
 "Hey guys, here's a cult I found.

321
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,520
 They like to chop off balls.

322
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,600
 Let's move on to our next story."

323
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,680
 But then I kept looking around like an idiot.

324
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,080
 Then I kept researching and I found a subreddit called "Pinectomy."

325
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,240
 The world of fetishes is a weird place.

326
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,440
 It really is a weird place.

327
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,080
 And I remember when I was on vacation recently, I came across this news article in The Independent

328
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,560
 and it was about the burping fetish community.

329
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,400
 And I go, "Oh, how delightful.

330
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,360
 How quaint.

331
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,040
 There's a group of people who get off to people burping."

332
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,200
 Oh, that's so delightful.

333
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,320
 What an amazing little segment we'll do for Dead Rabbit Radio.

334
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,440
 Maybe we'll even have some audio of people burping.

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,400
 It'll be fun.

336
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,160
 If you've been listeners, we'll hate it because people are burping in their headphones.

337
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,240
 Oh, it'll be so great.

338
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,640
 And they pointed me to a burping fetish forum, subreddit.

339
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,200
 And I was like, "Oh, it's Reddit.

340
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,320
 Another delightful, disgusting place that you harbor.

341
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
 Reddit is just such a cesspool of humanity."

342
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,440
 But yet you still exist for some reason.

343
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,240
 You haven't been shut down by every government agency on the planet.

344
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,720
 Burping fetishes, though, they're so great.

345
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,120
 Let's go.

346
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,160
 Let's not get off topic.

347
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,200
 But how much I hate Reddit?

348
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,480
 Let's look at these amazing forum titles.

349
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,840
 Top five.

350
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,000
 Did you even know there was more than two?

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,960
 Top five female burpers of all time.

352
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,240
 Let's go.

353
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,720
 That is, if you're interested.

354
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,200
 If you want to know that list, you can wait for Chills to do a countdown

355
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
 or you can go to the subreddit.

356
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,120
 There is a post buying custom content.

357
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
 Only girl burps, though.

358
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,520
 So if you are a girl and you're looking at making some extra money

359
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,160
 and you have a good burp, you can go to this forum, probably so.

360
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,000
 There is the great post that asks the question, favorite types of burps.

361
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,360
 What are your favorite types of burps?

362
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,160
 My favorites.

363
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,440
 This is not me saying this.

364
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
 This is the subreddit guy.

365
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
 My favorite are loud burps that catch the person off guard.

366
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,000
 And when the person can feel the air bubbles leaving their stomach as they burp.

367
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,400
 Adorable.

368
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,040
 Delightful.

369
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,760
 It's a fetish that doesn't really hurt anybody.

370
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,200
 There's apparently a whole TikTok community where they just burp all the time.

371
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
 And I thought, oh, that's great.

372
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,800
 But then for every burping fetish community, for every fetish that's just so...

373
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,040
 It's weird, right?

374
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,640
 Like, when's the last time someone burped and you got a boner?

375
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,280
 Like, the last time for me was never.

376
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,680
 I've never been attracted to burping.

377
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,560
 Now, of course, on my TikTok, I'm scrolling through it and there's this hot chick

378
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,680
 pops up on my TikTok.

379
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,600
 This is not a joke.

380
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,640
 This happened just last night.

381
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,400
 I'll be scrolling through my TikTok, watching videos,

382
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
 and then I'll get to when there's a hot chick and she goes, burp.

383
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,560
 And I'm like, damn it, that's what I am.

384
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,200
 That's what I am.

385
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,480
 We're looking at this stuff.

386
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,560
 I'm still getting TikTok burps.

387
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,320
 There's a big community for this.

388
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,040
 That's great.

389
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,080
 But then I also come across subreddits like Pnectomy.

390
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
 Pnectomy is what it sounds like.

391
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,280
 It is a subreddit dedicated to the removal of penises.

392
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,000
 Do not go to the subreddit.

393
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
 Do not go to the subreddit.

394
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,800
 I will say it one more time.

395
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,720
 Do not go to the subreddit because on Reddit, they have blurry photo.

396
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,760
 Like you have not safe for work photos and they'll be all blurred out.

397
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
 You can clearly see what's going on in the picture.

398
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,680
 The first image that I saw when I went to this subreddit,

399
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,480
 or at least the first one that will be seared in my mind forever,

400
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,240
 and the one I stupidly clicked on,

401
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,560
 there was a headline that said something like,

402
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,520
 "Tonight my girlfriend's giving me my last ring."

403
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,960
 And I'm looking at this picture and it looks so something like,

404
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
 it looks like a penis.

405
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,760
 It looks like a blurry penis, but something's wrong.

406
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
 Something's wrong with it.

407
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,720
 And so I clicked on it and it was a fully erect human penis with rubber bands on it.

408
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,840
 Now not like, you know, when you put a clothes hanger on your dick

409
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,680
 and you walk around the house because it's funny,

410
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,640
 which I do.

411
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,680
 That is my favorite joke.

412
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,520
 I haven't been able to hold up a sweater yet.

413
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
 The rubber bands just aren't loosely there.

414
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,080
 Like his girlfriend was throwing them playing a game.

415
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,040
 No, they are wrapped.

416
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,240
 They are wrapped around so tight.

417
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,920
 You know, have you ever seen like Jessica Rabbit or like a sexy woman?

418
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,480
 She has like, Jessica Rabbit's not real.

419
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,720
 You can't really meet this body type, but like the wide bust,

420
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
 and then it comes down to that really narrow waist

421
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,920
 and goes out to the hips.

422
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,360
 Imagine that shape, but it's your penis.

423
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,120
 Or not even your penis, just a penis, any penis.

424
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,640
 If you just saw this, it is,

425
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,560
 the rubber bands are so tight.

426
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,200
 It looks like he has Jessica Rabbit as a dick.

427
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,760
 And again, do you really want to check out this photo?

428
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,160
 Do not look at this photo, please, for the love of God.

429
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,560
 And it's even creepier because they're like,

430
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,920
 "Yeah, dude, I love this.

431
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
 This is what I want."

432
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,080
 I have no idea.

433
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,280
 I have no idea how they're not in mind numbing pain.

434
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,000
 And they go on to explain in the comments,

435
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,480
 their goal is for it to just kind of fall off.

436
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,760
 Like they're cutting off the circulation of this,

437
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,200
 and it's just going to turn blue and fall off.

438
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,560
 One person commented, "Let me know when it's ice cold."

439
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,760
 Which I don't know if it was,

440
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
 I don't know if you have to wear with all.

441
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,120
 You wake up, you wake up in the middle of that,

442
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
 you're like, "Ah, I'm in so much pain.

443
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,760
 Oh, it's ice cold."

444
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,360
 Better respond to that Reddit request.

445
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,040
 I don't think you're going to get the notification

446
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,320
 when it's ice cold.

447
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,200
 But they go on to say, "Oh, I'm not even done yet.

448
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
 Like once it falls off,

449
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,120
 I'm going to get the rest of it cut off

450
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
 so I have just like a little smooth bump down there."

451
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
 And that's just the beginning.

452
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,160
 There are so many photos of men standing there

453
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,080
 with what really looks like a hot dog that you gave to a dog.

454
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
 And then it threw up part of the hot dog.

455
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,680
 And it's kind of sticking out.

456
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,080
 And then there's a tube coming out of it, and they're smiling.

457
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,920
 Now, listen, I know there are a lot of men

458
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,640
 who have had their junk blown off during the war.

459
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,760
 I'm totally aware of that.

460
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,320
 I'm not saying that, "Oh, you can't smile if you don't have a dick."

461
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,360
 I'm not saying that.

462
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,960
 But I don't know, I doubt any of them,

463
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
 when the bomb went off or when they got shot,

464
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,160
 were like, "Yes, this is what I wanted."

465
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,520
 Now, of course, you learn to live with it

466
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
 because what else are you going to do?

467
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
 Like, I get it.

468
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,200
 You just go on with your life.

469
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
 But these people are purposely cutting off their dicks.

470
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
 And they love it.

471
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,680
 They absolutely love it.

472
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,240
 Now, we've covered people like that before

473
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,800
 on this show.

474
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 I don't remember what episode.

475
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,520
 I don't know if I want to look through the show notes for it.

476
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,960
 But I've never seen it so graphically displayed.

477
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,160
 Because this is a group of people

478
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,960
 who they're encouraging each other to do it.

479
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
 There's tons of photos of people mutilating their own penises.

480
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,560
 There's a lot of text of what they want to do with it.

481
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,200
 One guy wanted to turn it into an awesome blossom,

482
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
 which is this delicious meal.

483
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,680
 I don't know if I'll eat one for a while,

484
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,520
 but at Chili's Restaurant, they take an onion

485
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,200
 and they just kind of split it down the middle

486
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,520
 and it blossoms out and they deep fry it.

487
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,680
 He wanted to do the same thing,

488
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,840
 but he wanted to slice it down the urethra.

489
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,160
 He didn't say he wanted to deep fry it

490
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
 and serve it with his esteem mayo, but...

491
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,640
 Anyways, I don't know why I kept looking.

492
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,240
 I mean, I've already discovered enough, right?

493
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
 I was like, "Oh, here's a disgusting fetish."

494
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,080
 And I'm going somewhere with this.

495
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,240
 I'm just not going to keep listening off gross stuff.

496
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,760
 But before I get to the end, let me list off some more gross stuff.

497
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,320
 There's another one I refused to click on this blurred photo.

498
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,080
 I learned... I'd already clicked on a few

499
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
 and I had learned...

500
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,000
 I did click on more than one.

501
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
 I was like, "Oh, no."

502
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
 And then by the fourth or fifth one,

503
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,560
 I was like, "Okay, if you trick me seven or eight more times, I'm done."

504
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,880
 By the time I got to this one, I was like,

505
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
 "I'm not clicking on this one,

506
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,160
 but I'll read you the headline.

507
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,920
 The headline is brutal.

508
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,840
 The headline wouldn't make jigsaw go,

509
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
 "Oh, I don't know. That's a little too much."

510
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,040
 And he wants to do it to himself.

511
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,160
 Here is the post of this subreddit.

512
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,840
 "Seems on topic, you know, because we're talking about

513
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
 pieces being removed. This seems on topic.

514
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,440
 Are there any practical ideas for dick breaking,

515
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,920
 which do not involve blood or trip to the emergency room?

516
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,000
 I'm going to just say off the bat, no.

517
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,920
 I don't think so."

518
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,320
 But he continues to ask this question.

519
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,920
 "I know shrinking and banding have their enthusiasts."

520
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,600
 That's what the one guy was doing with the rubber band.

521
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,720
 How do you shrink it?

522
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,680
 You get Rick Moranis.

523
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,280
 Rick Moranis gets a call three in the morning.

524
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,960
 He's like, "Oh, not again. These weirdos."

525
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,480
 He's like putting them in front of a shrink, right?

526
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
 I wonder how you would shrink it.

527
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,200
 "I know shrinking and banding have their enthusiasts.

528
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
 Some hypnosis too. That is one good hypnosis."

529
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,360
 Maybe that stuff in Nigeria is really happening.

530
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
 How about bend--

531
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,840
 This is what they want to know, though.

532
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,880
 How about bending or crushing?

533
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,600
 That's not it.

534
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,440
 That's not it.

535
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,080
 As you crush your legs, trying to figure out a way

536
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,200
 to have your penis removed without going to the hospital.

537
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,560
 So these are the options.

538
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,280
 Bending it,

539
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,080
 bending it, crushing it.

540
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,800
 Also ask these questions.

541
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
 What about heat or electricity?

542
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,960
 So the poster doesn't want to go to the ER,

543
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,840
 but is willing to electrocute their dick off.

544
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,280
 I'm not an electrician, but I'm pretty sure

545
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,360
 the amount of electricity that it would take

546
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,920
 for your penis to fall off of your body

547
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,480
 is probably enough to stop your heart.

548
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,440
 But that's the weird thing about this fetish.

549
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,760
 They want to have their dick fall off so badly

550
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,320
 they will electrocute it off.

551
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,160
 Heat it off?

552
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,120
 How would you even do that?

553
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,680
 You go and you get like your sister's hair iron,

554
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,840
 and you're like in the bathroom, "Shut up."

555
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
 She's like, "I need to do my hair."

556
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,880
 You're like, "Hold on.

557
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
 Are you cooking hot dogs in there again, Gary?

558
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,280
 No. Hold on a minute.

559
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,640
 How would you heat it off?"

560
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,840
 Later though, this person, in case you were wondering,

561
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
 in case you were wondering which way this person decided to go,

562
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,200
 they did some research.

563
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,440
 The person who posted this did some research,

564
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,040
 and they said they've decided on giving themselves

565
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
 a penile fracture because they heard,

566
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,600
 I don't know where they heard this from,

567
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,640
 but they heard it doesn't hurt that much.

568
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
 It doesn't hurt that much to break your penis.

569
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,880
 And they came across this quote that I will share with you

570
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,760
 because I'm a jerk.

571
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,480
 Men in certain Middle Eastern cultures practice

572
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,120
 taquandan or penile cracking.

573
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,680
 This involves grasping the shaft of the erect penis

574
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,480
 and bending the top until you hear an audible clicking sound.

575
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,120
 Now, that may very well be practiced in Middle Eastern cultures.

576
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,560
 I did not research it up.

577
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,400
 I was done at this point.

578
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,280
 I will guess though, they may do that in some Middle Eastern cultures.

579
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
 I doubt they do it to themselves.

580
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,040
 I bet you they do it and they're like,

581
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,640
 "Okay, where's the money?"

582
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,840
 And they're like, "I'm not going to tell you."

583
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,320
 And then they go, "Okay, cracking their knuckles.

584
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
 Let's give this guy an erection."

585
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,400
 So that would be really difficult actually to do someone unwillingly.

586
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,000
 You're showing them a bunch of sexy movies.

587
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,680
 But don't ladies, I know I have a lot of dead rabbit radio listeners

588
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
 who are ladies.

589
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,040
 I don't want you gassed to fill left out.

590
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,960
 Ladies, have you ever thought about having your clitoris?

591
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
 This is so brutal.

592
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,200
 Have you ever thought about having your clitoris removed?

593
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,920
 This is something that is mostly done forcibly in parts of the world.

594
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,440
 There's a fetish for it.

595
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:39,920
 Did you know?

596
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
 I had no...

597
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,840
 That shocked me.

598
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,640
 That there is a fetish for women to have their clits removed.

599
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,840
 And I hate to tell you, but this was one of the photos I clicked on.

600
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,520
 It's a smiling woman having her clit cut off.

601
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,000
 It was a photo essay, by the way.

602
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
 It wasn't just a moment in time.

603
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,760
 They showed them getting ready and all that stuff before and after.

604
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
 So a bizarre fetish.

605
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,960
 The world's full of them.

606
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,800
 This one is pretty damaging though.

607
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,360
 Because they're doing it without medical help.

608
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,440
 But that's what this is about.

609
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,560
 It's about doing it yourself.

610
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
 And you go, "What would be the point of removing...

611
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,640
 for sexual pleasure you're removing a sexual organ?"

612
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,280
 And really, if you look at this subreddit, they had different answers.

613
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,600
 Some of them just like the way it looked.

614
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,040
 Some of them liked the idea that it was useless now.

615
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,600
 The guy who was putting rubber bands on it said,

616
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,080
 "My girlfriend's gonna leave me once it's permanently broken.

617
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,160
 And then I'll just walk around with a broke dick."

618
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,080
 And we can look at it and go,

619
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,960
 "Whoa, this is a really small group of people who believe in this."

620
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,120
 But as I was looking into it, I started thinking back to the violations.

621
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,720
 Today's cult is tomorrow's religion.

622
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,760
 Now, a lot of times the cults do just die off.

623
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
 They're unsustainable.

624
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,000
 But all of the huge religions we see today started off as

625
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,400
 what we can only describe as cults.

626
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,640
 Early Christians were outlawed.

627
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,760
 They were killed in the streets.

628
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,280
 They were killed for entertainment.

629
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,960
 They were an underground network,

630
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,880
 literal underground network of religious advocates, zealots,

631
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,000
 really, that hung on for so long.

632
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,200
 That they became a major world power.

633
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
 And you can really look at any religion like that.

634
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
 It started off with a core group of people.

635
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
 And when you look back at a religion, you go,

636
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,800
 "Oh, look, it was Jesus and these 12 dudes."

637
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,840
 "Oh, but that one crazy guy in Texas and his 12 followers, that's a cult."

638
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,360
 Today's cult is tomorrow's religion.

639
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,200
 We never know where stuff is gonna pull out.

640
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,880
 There used to be a Christian sect that would walk around

641
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,280
 and castrate people against their will.

642
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,360
 And they believed they were doing the will of God.

643
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,920
 There is a version of history where they became a major player.

644
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,560
 And you can look at the same thing as fetishes.

645
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,880
 Foot fetish used to just be the weirdest thing in the world.

646
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,440
 People who love to just smell hair.

647
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,920
 What?

648
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,160
 Scat fetish, gross.

649
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,760
 People actually like playing with poop.

650
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,680
 But these start to become more and more...

651
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,120
 Foot fetish is really not even considered a fetish at this point.

652
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,400
 Women laugh about it.

653
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,480
 But there's so many people who are into feet, you really...

654
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,920
 It's not even a fetish anymore.

655
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,760
 It's boobs are considered a fetish because boobs are not a sexual organ.

656
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,560
 A fetish is an attraction to something that is not sexual.

657
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,720
 So like a butt fetish is kind of a borderline thing,

658
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,920
 but like boobs, there's nothing sexual, inherently sexual about boobs.

659
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,880
 That's a fetish.

660
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,280
 But it's so prevalent it's not considered a fetish.

661
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,040
 And I think the same thing will happen with feet.

662
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,200
 But what happens when Pnectomy grows as a fetish?

663
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,160
 No pun intended.

664
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,400
 And it becomes more accepted.

665
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,840
 And right now they're saying we're just cutting off our dicks.

666
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
 Because we like it.

667
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,920
 But let's put on...

668
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,000
 You guys know where I'm going with this.

669
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
 You guys know where I'm going with this.

670
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
 Well, let's put on a conspiracy conspiracy to wrap this up.

671
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,760
 What's to say just the way the world changes,

672
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,280
 the way things work, that this fetish doesn't become super mainstream?

673
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,280
 You see Brad Pitt, they're like Brad Pitt coming off the set of his new movie.

674
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,920
 Dickless Brad.

675
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,480
 And it's his biography and he's walking around and they show him.

676
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,680
 And he's wearing like super tight underwear and he has no dick.

677
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,800
 It's been chopped off.

678
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,920
 And then like you see like some Olympian, he's like running, running,

679
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,960
 and he's like beating everyone.

680
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,480
 And they're like, there he goes.

681
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,360
 That's Grady O'Graid, the best runner from Ireland.

682
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,400
 Everyone's like, does Ireland even have an Olympics team?

683
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,360
 This time they do.

684
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,240
 And the reason why he's so fast, he doesn't have a dick.

685
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,120
 That extra six inches of wind resistance cut down is running super fast.

686
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,640
 And then you see like just, you're at school and people are like,

687
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,360
 you have a penis, you have a penis.

688
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,400
 And you're like, oh, and you go home and you're like, you're an adult.

689
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,720
 You're an adult when you go home or you're home from college.

690
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,880
 And you're like, oh, why are they making fun of me?

691
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,720
 Why are they making fun of me that I have a penis?

692
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,440
 Oh man, that's it.

693
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
 I'm getting some rubber bands tonight.

694
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,840
 Who's to say that today's fetish isn't tomorrow's requirement?

695
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,640
 Who's to say that these people, this is totally gone off.

696
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,320
 This is not how I planned on ending the episode.

697
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,080
 But I already got, I'm already four feet deep in this hole and I'm going to keep shoveling.

698
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,320
 Who's to say that someday, because we've seen little cults turn to major religions and the

699
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,200
 Valetians could have been a ball cutting cult that became a ball cutting religion.

700
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,560
 So who's to say this fetish one day you're not driving out of the street and you're like,

701
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,360
 uh-oh.

702
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,480
 And your buddy's like, dude, what is it?

703
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,760
 And you're like, it's one of the checkpoints.

704
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
 And you see like these guys standing there.

705
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,320
 And they're standing there and they're super smooth pants.

706
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
 And you're like, just go turn down the other road.

707
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,720
 You're driving to the other road and there's another checkpoint.

708
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,200
 You're like, we really need to buy those groceries.

709
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240
 I'm really, really hungry.

710
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,600
 I really need some Tauraman.

711
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,040
 So we'll just go to this checkpoint.

712
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,200
 It seems less ominous, but it's not.

713
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,640
 And there are these guys standing there and they're like, we need to check your penis.

714
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,240
 And you're like, oh man, again.

715
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,200
 And then like you show it to them and they're like, it better be smaller next time.

716
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
 You're like, I'm trying.

717
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,120
 I'm letting it to myself.

718
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,520
 I've let it to myself.

719
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,920
 So much I can touch a light bulb and it turns on.

720
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,280
 And they're like, have you tried crushing it?

721
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,280
 And you're like, we never know where the world is going to go.

722
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,840
 We never know the path history will take.

723
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,680
 Will we end up in a sci-fi utopia post scarcity world?

724
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,920
 Will it be a burger punk capitalist society where the dollar rules?

725
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,760
 Could it be a post apocalyptic world where water is the currency?

726
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,360
 Or could the future be just like today?

727
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,760
 Except the road is littered with penises.

728
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,200
 Everywhere you go, everywhere you look.

729
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,560
 A man's junk is laying in the sewer.

730
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,880
 Sure, the crows have a lot of food to eat.

731
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:06,960
 And you have less wind resistance when you run.

732
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,680
 But is that really a future you want to live in?

733
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,760
 I've seen the future of humanity.

734
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,440
 And it is a rubber band wrapped around its penis forever.

735
