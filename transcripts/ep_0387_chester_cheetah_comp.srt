1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 A McDonald's in Britain has people saying, "I'm not loving it."

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,600
 And then we travel to Mexico, where right when we get there, we have to use a public restroom.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,640
 So we walk inside, pass a couple stalls, and then sit down.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,360
 And then we notice in the stall next to us a figure.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,560
 Not man, not beast, but both.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,040
 Because in real life, in this bathroom stall next to you sits the Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,360
 [Music]

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,240
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,760
 I think we have a great episode for you guys today.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
 So let's go ahead and get started now.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,760
 So let's hop on board the Dead Rabbit Dergible.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,720
 We're going slow.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,320
 We're taking it slow this time.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,600
 We're flying across the Atlantic and this big old blimp.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,040
 We are headed to Liverpool, which is in England.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
 We're in Liverpool.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,480
 We're on Lord Street.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,560
 The year is 2017.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,640
 It's July 8th, 2017.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,120
 And this story was recommended by Inio.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,240
 Inio's sent me a bunch of recommendations lately, and this is one of them.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
 Now, thank you Inio.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,800
 He's on the other side of the street.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,440
 We're waving at him.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,320
 Come on, come on, join us.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,120
 He's like, "Me?

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,680
 Looking at me?"

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,400
 "Yeah, yeah, come on.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,520
 You recommended this story."

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,880
 And he doesn't want to cross the street because he knows what this story is.

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,320
 So he's like, "No, he's pretending now to read the newspaper."

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 Because he's standing, just standing in the crosswalk.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,160
 And we're like, "He'll join us.

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,280
 He'll join us."

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,800
 So now we walk into the McDonald's on Lord Street.

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,760
 Gonna be delicious.

41
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,680
 I'm actually back on Keto now.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
 So I'm like, "I will take some patties, please.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,360
 No buns."

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 And then you can order whatever you want.

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
 You're paying, so it doesn't really matter.

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
 Don't get your hopes up.

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
 I'm not buying you guys dinner.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,160
 And we sit down and we're eating our food.

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,560
 And there's just, you know, it's a McDonald's, right?

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,440
 It's just like kids.

51
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,200
 "Yay, happy meal.

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,600
 Look it.

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
 I got a Paw Patrol.

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,040
 Doot, doot, doot, doot."

55
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,680
 Walking around.

56
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,120
 And then you got like parents, you know, just talking about, "Hey, look at me.

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,160
 Mommy, mommy.

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
 I got Paw Patrol too."

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
 And the mom's like, "Oh my God."

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
 And then, I don't know what adults talk about.

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,240
 I don't know what kids talk about.

62
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,160
 But the point is what we're talking about is that.

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
 Now, I point across the room, point across the McDonald's,

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,000
 and this, like, guy walks in, this hobo is all over.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So you know the story's going to be good, right?

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Not only does it involve a hobo,

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
 but the person telling you the story, me,

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
 has an utter disdain for hobo antics.

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,680
 So a hobo, a disheveled man, stumbles into the McDonald's.

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,400
 He's like, "I'm speaking in that hobo dialect."

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
 "I'm still eating my sandwich, because I'm used to seeing hobo nonsense."

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,040
 And you're like, "Jayson, Jason, this is particularly disgusting.

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,160
 I can't dip my chicken nuggets into my barbecue sauce."

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600
 And I'm just like eating my patty.

75
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 I'm like, "Oh, we haven't even gotten to the gross part yet."

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,680
 The hobo now is crawling on all fours,

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,240
 scuttling across the ground.

78
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,720
 Now, according to authorities, and everyone who was in the McDonald's at the time,

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 this is the chain of events that happened,

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
 hobo walks into a McDonald's middle of the day.

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
 It's a summer day.

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
 People are just lounging about playing with their Paw Patrol toys.

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
 Hobo walks in, takes his pants off.

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,400
 So obviously right there, that's gross.

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,440
 Nobody wants to see a pantsless, homeless person.

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,560
 There's very few humans that people want to see naked, just in general, right?

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,280
 Maybe there's some hot chicks, a couple hot dudes that you've not me.

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,960
 I only want to see the hot chicks with no pants on.

89
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,880
 But you know, I got a female listener audience,

90
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,720
 and some of you guys like dudes too.

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,160
 Taking the pants off.

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,520
 But most of the people, like, there's very few famous people I want to see pantsless, right?

93
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,560
 You don't want to see...

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,080
 I don't even have to, I can name the people I want to see without their pants on.

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,240
 I'm not going to.

96
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
 Well, you know the list.

97
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,800
 I talk about them all the time, like, I'd see Britney Spears walk around, no pants on.

98
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,000
 Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson just walking to McDonald's, no pants on.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
 No one would bat an eye.

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
 No one would bat an eye, right?

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,680
 But if 99% of humanity walked into McDonald's with no pants on, people would be disturbed.

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
 And if they're homeless people, it's 100 times worse, is what I'm saying.

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
 At least the average person.

104
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,680
 You can assume they've showered.

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,760
 There's not clumps of matted hair.

106
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,520
 It doesn't look like a Klingon down there.

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
 So this guy walks in to a McDonald's, takes his pants off.

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,840
 That's gross.

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
 But that's not enough for Dead Rabbit Radio.

110
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,320
 Which you're shocked, because normally that would be enough.

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
 Normally that'd be into the story, because I don't like hobos to begin with, right?

112
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,040
 Now, it's not, though.

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
 So this guy walks into McDonald's, pulls his pants down.

114
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,320
 As people are trying to figure out how to handle this situation,

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
 how to even comprehend what's going on in front of him, the homeless man,

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,640
 pulls out a hypodermic needle.

117
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,600
 Ding!

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,760
 The little needle point glistens underneath the fluorescent lights of the McDonald's.

119
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,560
 At this point, the place is completely silent.

120
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,480
 Kids are frozen in the ball pit.

121
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,880
 There's a kid going down the slide, he's stuck.

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
 He's just frozen there.

123
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
 Because now you have the worst combinations.

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,400
 You have a pantsless, homeless guy, and he has a hypodermic needle filled with some sort of substance.

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
 Is he going to come after you?

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
 Is he going to inject it into his leg?

127
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,800
 Is he going to start doing heroin?

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,360
 We don't know.

129
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,600
 Why?

130
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
 There's a whole series of questions.

131
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,400
 Why doesn't he have pants?

132
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
 Why does he have this needle?

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,640
 Some people may wonder why he's homeless in the first place.

134
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,080
 I'm not worried about that right now.

135
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
 I'm not worried about the societal implications of how this man became homeless in the first place.

136
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
 I'm worried about him not having pants and having a needle.

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,920
 He then takes the needle, you can get.

138
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,280
 We're not going to make this an interactive,

139
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,920
 but I'll give you three seconds to guess what he does with this needle.

140
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,120
 He puts the needle, he shoves it into his nut sack,

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,800
 and begins to inject whatever fluid is in there into his genitals, letting off a loud,

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,840
 that's an actual, that wasn't me, that was an actual 911 recording of this anime.

143
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,960
 No, that wasn't me, but according to the article said he began making quote, strange noises.

144
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
 Now that's an understatement.

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,400
 You are going to make a strange noise if a needle ever pierces your genitals,

146
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
 and if they're starting to fill up with fluid.

147
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
 At this point, everyone starts panicking.

148
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,440
 This is the point when people really start reacting to it.

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
 You get up, you run, you hide.

150
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,600
 I'm now going, oh, I'm off keto, ate a couple chicken, I got some back on keto.

151
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,360
 Back on keto now, guys, for this time, for reals.

152
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
 And then I get up and hide as well, and this guy's just standing there,

153
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,360
 hypodermic needle hanging out of his testicles.

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
 You guys are like, Jason, what is this show?

155
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
 Why did this show get so graphic all of a sudden?

156
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,120
 Because this story is gross, and you have to have the gross visuals.

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,160
 Cops show up, oi, oi, oi, and they come inside, wrong choice of words,

158
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,240
 but they get inside the building, and then they arrest them,

159
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,480
 and then here's some quotes from this whole incident.

160
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,760
 This is a woman, she ran, she locked herself in the bathroom.

161
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,480
 I love this quote.

162
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,640
 Quote, "I don't know if it was a sexual noise, or if it was relief from injecting himself,

163
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,200
 but it was just disgusting. It was awful.

164
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,240
 Every part of that sentence is an understatement.

165
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,080
 It was disgusting, and it was awful, times 10,

166
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,600
 but I love this thing where she goes, "I don't know if it was a sexual noise,

167
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,000
 or just relief from him injecting himself."

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,440
 And then the funny part about that quote is that you know

169
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
 that that is going to trouble this woman.

170
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,600
 This woman is going to be wondering what the origin of that noise was for the rest of her life.

171
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,080
 She'll be 80 years old, bobbing her great granddaughter on her knee.

172
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,880
 "Oh, come here, Isabella. Here, take this pacifier. Take..."

173
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,640
 Little baby, she's looking out in the sunset, and she goes,

174
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,880
 "I wonder why, where that noise came from.

175
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,640
 She will always wonder if he was getting off on the idea of a needle

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,640
 piercing his balls, or he had some sort of something going on in there,

177
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,480
 and he's like, "Oh, I need to take my medicine."

178
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,200
 The doctor said I should probably take two pills a day,

179
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,880
 but I am a crazy homeless person, so I'm just going to crush him up,

180
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,120
 mix him with some saline, and put him on my balls.

181
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,000
 So who knows? We don't. We'll never know.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,880
 And then this other woman says this quote, which to me, I think is the best...

183
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,040
 Let me read you the quote.

184
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,760
 "I just ran into the woman's loo." That's what they call bathrooms over in Britain.

185
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,160
 Both of these stories involve bathrooms, I just realized.

186
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,680
 This is the bathroom special, public restroom special.

187
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,520
 "I just ran into the woman's loo."

188
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,120
 Which, because there's a bunch of them, you know, like stalls.

189
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,360
 "I was hysterical. The first girl was just like, 'It is just disgusting. Just awful.

190
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,480
 This woman's freaking out.'"

191
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 "I just ran into the woman's loo. I was hysterical. I couldn't stop crying.

192
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,400
 I had to stay in the restaurant for about 25 minutes before I went to work.

193
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
 But I just couldn't stop crying all day."

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,760
 "This wouldn't be a situation where I would then stay at the restaurant."

195
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,320
 "I wouldn't be like, 'Ah, that's going on. Run to the bathroom.'

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,480
 Here are the cops taking him out and then being like, 'I don't want to go to work.

197
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,160
 I'm just too distraught. I'm just going to sit here five feet from where this incident happened."

198
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,160
 "There's still some fluid on the floor. McDonald's, you know, they're McDonald's.

199
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
 They got their busy. They're not going to clean it up yet.

200
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
 There's just some leakage on the floor."

201
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
 "Sorry guys. This episode is super gross.

202
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,920
 Looks like someone mixed ketchup with a hot glue gun and just sprayed it all over the linoleum."

203
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
 And she's like, "I can't go to work. I'm so distraught.

204
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
 I'm just going to sit here four feet from where this happened and continue to eat chicken nuggets."

205
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,040
 And yeah, after the first five minutes, sure, I guess you can cry a little bit,

206
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
 but crying all day long, she's just driving home.

207
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
 She's at home eating ice cream.

208
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
 The ice cream's melting.

209
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
 She's like, "No, it reminds me too much of the incident."

210
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,520
 Throws the ice cream down.

211
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:06,240
 She can no longer be around any liquidy white substance or needles, actually.

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,400
 And she's like, "Needle point. It was my only hobby."

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,800
 She's destroying all of her stuff.

214
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,520
 She just now stands in the darkness, a round room, because corners remind her of the incident.

215
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,200
 "You can't get traumatized because a homeless man walks around no pants and injects stuff into

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,120
 his balls. If a homeless man injects stuff into your balls, I think you can cry all day long.

217
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,080
 But if he does it to himself, I think you're okay.

218
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,360
 I think you can go to work and you don't have to cry all day long."

219
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,760
 But anyways, this guy's out.

220
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,000
 He doesn't serve any jail time whatsoever.

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,400
 He gets arrested for breaching the peace, which unless peace is a euphemism for your testicles,

222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,800
 he did more than just breach the peace.

223
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
 And he's out now.

224
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,280
 This man is still roaming the streets of Liverpool.

225
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,240
 His pants slung over his shoulder with two hypodermic needles, one in each hand.

226
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,600
 He's stalking the shadows because he has one for himself.

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,480
 And one for you.

228
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
 Come here.

229
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,360
 Come here, mate.

230
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
 I want to make a point.

231
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,240
 See?

232
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
 He's going to stab you in the genitals.

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
 And if you're a woman, don't say, "Oh, I'm not worried about it.

234
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
 I don't have testicles."

235
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
 Because it's a big needle.

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,200
 He can get you right in one of your ovaries.

237
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
 Let's go ahead, though.

238
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,520
 I'm done making threats against your reproductive organs.

239
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,160
 Let's go ahead and leave Liverpool.

240
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,960
 You're like, "Thank God.

241
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,280
 Let's hop back on board the Dead Rabbit Durgable."

242
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
 So we leave behind this man.

243
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,920
 He returns to his fellow hobo sapiens in the underworld of Britain.

244
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
 Someday they will rise up and kill us all.

245
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,520
 But for now, we're hopping back on the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

246
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,240
 So we land in Mexico City.

247
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
 It's a beautiful sunny day.

248
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
 We just left Britain.

249
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
 It was July 8th.

250
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,160
 So that means we have to wear sweaters and wool knit caps.

251
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
 But in Mexico, it's always sunny, baby.

252
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
 Tourist destination of the world.

253
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
 We jump out stretching, stretching our bones.

254
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,520
 This is beautiful.

255
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,160
 Look at all the sun.

256
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,520
 Look at all these beautiful women.

257
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,600
 Ah, baby, I'd like to see you pantless.

258
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
 You're in my 1% and girls are like, "What?

259
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,960
 Pervert?"

260
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,000
 I'm like, "Yeah, yeah.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
 I'll see you in that 1% bracket."

262
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
 We're walking around.

263
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,880
 Now, this story was recommended to me by Scary Man Esquire.

264
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,560
 He's recommended a lot of stuff over the year or two this show's been around.

265
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
 He sent me the story.

266
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,840
 And it's one of those stories that can take us a couple different ways.

267
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,320
 So thank you, Scary Man, for the recommendation.

268
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,960
 First off, while we're here, I got to go to the bathroom, dude.

269
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,120
 I did not want to use the bathroom in the McDonald's because this chick was next door.

270
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
 She was screaming her head off.

271
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,960
 I was like, "Come on, dude.

272
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
 I've seen it before.

273
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,200
 Get over it."

274
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
 But now I got to go to the bathroom.

275
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,080
 And you guys are all coming to the bathroom with me.

276
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,680
 I need someone to hold my purse.

277
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
 Did you know that's why girls go--

278
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,720
 I think I talked about this on an earlier episode.

279
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,840
 That's why girls go to the bathroom at the same time.

280
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,280
 The big myth that's here.

281
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,640
 Here's a conspiracy theory for you.

282
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,400
 I'm pretty sure I talked about this.

283
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,480
 Women don't sit on the toilet seat because they think it's gross.

284
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
 Okay, now before I get a bunch of emails calling me a sexist, I already know.

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
 So don't waste your time.

286
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
 Don't waste your time on those emails.

287
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,560
 Apparently, what I've heard from my female friends is that girls don't sit on toilet

288
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
 seats because they're gross.

289
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
 So they hover.

290
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
 And because they hover, stuff tends to spray out.

291
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,960
 So it makes it even grosser.

292
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,800
 Now, I'm not saying they have skunk.

293
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
 They have skunk lands and it's like, "Pssht."

294
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,560
 But not everyone sprays it out, but if just one person sprays it out, toilet seat gets messy.

295
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
 So then people definitely hover.

296
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,600
 But you can't hover if you have a purse because you have to be able to brace yourself up.

297
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 And so that's why generally when girls are at clubs and stuff like that,

298
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,960
 they go to the bathrooms together.

299
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,520
 It's either to do this or to do cocaine.

300
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,880
 So I'm being generous by giving them the hover excuse.

301
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,920
 I go to the bathroom.

302
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,560
 We're girls.

303
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
 We go to the bathroom together.

304
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,200
 I have a purse.

305
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,920
 I give you my purse and we talk outside the stall,

306
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,720
 but you're holding my purse while I'm hovering over the toilet.

307
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,240
 I'm pretty sure I've been told that multiple times.

308
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,160
 But again, my thing is one, fight back against the purse lobby.

309
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
 You don't need purses.

310
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
 Guys have purses.

311
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
 They're called pockets.

312
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,280
 We have six of them and everything we wear.

313
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,440
 Don't smash a glass ceiling.

314
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
 Destroy the leather pouch.

315
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,120
 Once you can defeat the stranglehold of the purse, the sky's the limit.

316
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
 Pockets.

317
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,520
 Pockets.

318
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,720
 If you had pockets, you wouldn't have to have your loser friend come into the bathroom with you.

319
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,640
 And we all know she's a loser.

320
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,760
 You should stop hanging out with her.

321
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,400
 You need to just get pockets.

322
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,640
 Okay?

323
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
 So there we go.

324
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,120
 But what is it?

325
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,440
 What am I?

326
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,080
 Oh yeah.

327
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,760
 So we're not talking about any of that.

328
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
 We're talking about Chester.

329
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
 We're talking about Chester Cheetah.

330
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
 So we're going into the bathroom, but you still have to hold.

331
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
 You have to hold my pants.

332
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,760
 I'm going to take my pants off.

333
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,840
 I want to experience what the homeless man went through.

334
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
 I walk into the bathroom, pantsless.

335
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,040
 I sit down.

336
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,440
 Now we're all hanging out in this bathroom together.

337
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,080
 Actually, this isn't a scary way to start this story.

338
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,400
 You go to the bathroom by yourself.

339
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,080
 You're in the bathroom by yourself.

340
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,280
 Let's build up the mood here.

341
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,160
 So we're walking around Mexico and you're like, "What?

342
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,200
 This is weird.

343
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,640
 That's disorienting."

344
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
 And then you have to go to the bathroom.

345
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
 We feel a sudden urge to go to the bathroom.

346
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,160
 And you're like, "Oh no.

347
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,520
 Who's going to hold my purse?"

348
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,320
 But nobody will.

349
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
 You have to go into this public restroom all by yourself.

350
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,760
 That's the fluorescent light.

351
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
 It's kind of busted.

352
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,640
 You're walking into the bathroom and there's a bunch of stalls.

353
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,360
 And they're like, "Now, the visual I'm about to show

354
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,800
 is not an indication of Mexico's public health system.

355
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
 I'm sure their fluorescent lights work down there.

356
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
 It's supposed to be like a horror movie.

357
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
 So again, I don't want to get a bunch of emails

358
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,560
 saying, "Well, Mexico has great bathrooms."

359
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,360
 I'm sure they do.

360
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,440
 Anyways, you walk into this busted, dirty old bathroom

361
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
 that just happens to be in Mexico.

362
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,760
 The lights.

363
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,280
 There's flies everywhere.

364
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,440
 Oh, it's so thick you can't even see.

365
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
 You're stepping in a foot of a deep of poop.

366
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,800
 You're like, "Oh, this is excessive."

367
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,400
 And you finally find a stall you get into.

368
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,080
 You sit down.

369
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,880
 You start pooping.

370
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,920
 Now, in the stall next to you, there's nothing there.

371
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,800
 And you're like, "Phew.

372
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,680
 That's close.

373
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,960
 I thought something creepy."

374
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,840
 And then you see an orange and white tail kind of unfurl.

375
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,280
 [Farting]

376
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,480
 You're like, "Hmm.

377
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,360
 That's interesting.

378
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,680
 Must be a giant worm.

379
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,080
 That would be less bizarre than what's about to happen."

380
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,840
 And then you see two big, giant feet show up.

381
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
 And they're the same color as the tail.

382
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,760
 And you're like, "Oh, it's some sort of monster next to me,

383
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,800
 but I'm mid-poop."

384
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,960
 Poop is still coming out.

385
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
 I can't just get up and run.

386
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,520
 I can't pinch it off.

387
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,320
 I really got to go.

388
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,040
 Now, so you finish going and then you're like, "Oh, got to wipe."

389
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,640
 And you're like, "This creature is in the stall next to you."

390
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,520
 And then you get done going to the bathroom.

391
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,480
 But now you have a new problem, because you have to leave the bathroom.

392
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,240
 You just can't stay there forever.

393
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,200
 But to leave the bathroom, you're going to have to walk past his stall.

394
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,080
 Because his stall is before yours.

395
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,200
 And who is his stall?

396
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,280
 Chester Cheetah.

397
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,680
 Now, Chester Cheetah, world-famous Cheetos mascot.

398
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,480
 He's a Cheetah, technically, Jaguar.

399
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
 Big, giant feline-looking thing.

400
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,360
 It ain't easy.

401
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,480
 A Benchise.

402
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
 And he started off as a...

403
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,960
 He's a cartoon.

404
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:29,040
 Now I think he's like CGI, but he started off as a spokesman back in 1986,

405
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,160
 is when he started off.

406
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
 And he was kind of like, "Give me them Cheetos, kids.

407
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,040
 Yeah, I want those things."

408
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,560
 And they're like, "Oh, Stranger Danger."

409
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,080
 And they would run away from him.

410
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,400
 And he would keep getting tricked.

411
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,680
 He would never get the Cheetos.

412
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,880
 He was like the Trix Rabbit, but a big cat and a different product.

413
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,640
 And he would go, "It's not easy.

414
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,080
 I'll be a Benchise."

415
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,800
 And then the kids would be eating Cheetos in front of him, taunting him.

416
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,320
 They're like, "You want these? You want these?

417
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,600
 I'll lick your fingers, kids.

418
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,920
 Just give me some of that cheesiness."

419
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,600
 But then around the time of 1997, he became dangerously cheesy.

420
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
 And that was, I was older by then, and I didn't really pay attention to him.

421
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,840
 I remember liking it, thinking the commercials were funny, but in 1997,

422
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
 he became cool.

423
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
 And then he got the Cheetos all the time.

424
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
 Because you don't really want your spokesperson being like,

425
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,080
 "Oh, I really want your product.

426
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,680
 I'm too lame to eat that product, but you guys can."

427
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,640
 You want your spokesperson to be cooler than you.

428
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,680
 Right?

429
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,480
 Like, nobody liked the Noid, but at least he was like a hardworking.

430
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,920
 He was persistent.

431
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,120
 He had a goal.

432
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
 So you would be watching and you're like, "I don't want him to get my pizza,

433
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,040
 but I appreciate the hard work he's putting into his endeavors."

434
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,520
 And I guess now he's part of something called the Orange Underground.

435
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
 Orange Underground is his new thing, new as of 2008,

436
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
 the last time the Wikipedia article was updated.

437
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,480
 Now he uses Cheetos as revenge.

438
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
 So apparently, like, he'll stick them up someone's nose because they're snoring,

439
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 or like, throw Cheeto dust at people.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
 He's like, "Oh, you want the Cheetos?

441
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,200
 He's injecting Cheetos into your testicles?

442
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,440
 Ah, dangerously cheesy.

443
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,160
 But anyways, the point is, is that Chester Cheetah,

444
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,640
 that's a brief overview of this cartoon cat.

445
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,600
 Now, in 2018, we saw a string of Twitter users say,

446
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,880
 "Do you guys remember when Chester Cheetah was in your bathroom in high school?

447
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,800
 Do you remember?

448
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,040
 I remember once I went to an amusement park called Kidlandia or Kidzanzia.

449
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,040
 I went to the bathroom and for like three seconds,

450
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,520
 there was a brief amount of time I looked, Chester Cheetah was in the bathroom.

451
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
 Other Twitter user goes, "What?

452
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,400
 That's ridiculous.

453
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
 I saw Chester Cheetah, but it wasn't in the bathroom."

454
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
 Because that part of the story is true.

455
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
 I was walking down the street one day and behind a bunch of bushes,

456
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,680
 saw Chester Cheetah.

457
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
 Here's some of these tweets.

458
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,600
 "I was about eight years old and I was at my grandfather's ranch

459
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,920
 walking with my cousin in the early morning.

460
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,680
 I heard something in the bushes and when I turned around,

461
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,560
 I saw Chester Cheetah for about three seconds.

462
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,360
 100% real, my cousin also saw it.

463
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,920
 He went to tell everyone, but nobody believed us.

464
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
 Here's another one.

465
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,440
 "When I was young and I was at my grandmother's house,

466
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,120
 I went into the bathroom and suddenly Chester Cheetahs passed for a few seconds.

467
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,920
 I was scared.

468
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,200
 One more.

469
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
 I remember that in elementary school, I was at the games

470
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,920
 and everyone had already gone into the classroom.

471
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,960
 And I turned to the slide and there was Chester Cheetah.

472
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,640
 I got scared and ran to my classroom.

473
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
 That's on top of the bathroom ones.

474
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,320
 We have all those sightings.

475
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
 We also have sightings such as these ones.

476
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,440
 "I didn't see Chester," this Twitter user says,

477
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,600
 "but I saw Frankenstein in my shower.

478
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,120
 My sister saw a porgy pig in the window.

479
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,440
 And my other sister saw Justin Bieber in his room.

480
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,200
 And then it says in parentheses,

481
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
 he was afraid until he was six years old.

482
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,040
 So his six-year-old brother saw Justin Bieber in his bedroom

483
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,600
 and then was afraid of Justin Bieber from then on

484
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,040
 until he reached the age of six.

485
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,680
 So I mean, kids see dumb stuff, right?

486
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,560
 Frankenstein in the shower would be comical.

487
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,600
 A porgy the pig outside the window would be absolutely terrifying.

488
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,240
 At least Frankenstein, you could kind of wrap your head around.

489
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,280
 It's at least human.

490
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,200
 An animated pig would be creepy.

491
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,440
 One guy says that he called the cops

492
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,240
 because Tony the Tiger was hanging out outside of his house.

493
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,200
 I mean, and so all of these scary men, Esquire,

494
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,880
 sent me this stuff and he's basically like,

495
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,840
 "Hey, here's the story."

496
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,440
 But warning, it's all in Spanish.

497
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
 And that's why this story really has it.

498
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,360
 As bizarre as the story is, it hasn't gotten a lot of coverage

499
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
 because I then had to run all these tweets through Google Translate

500
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,840
 and took a quite a long time.

501
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,480
 Really appreciate the lead on the story, though.

502
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,000
 There's two elements to this story.

503
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,960
 Well, three, actually.

504
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,880
 One is that he seems to hang out in a bathroom,

505
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,920
 but he'll appear to children pretty much anywhere.

506
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,560
 Two, a lot of the sightings revolve around a place called Kidzanzia,

507
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,480
 which is apparently some theme park type thing

508
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
 where you go in and pretend to be stuff

509
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
 so you can dress up as a baker and be like,

510
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,160
 "Yeah, I'm baking," or you dress up as a gymnast

511
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
 and be like, "Yeah, I'm a gymnast.

512
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,240
 You're breaking your bones."

513
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,880
 You're like, "Oh, I thought the uniform gave me the strength."

514
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,560
 There were sightings of Chester Cheetah on the slides in there.

515
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
 There were also sightings of Clown,

516
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,280
 of a clown, a particular clown in the slide

517
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
 at this particular Kidzanzia.

518
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,440
 People go, "Oh, that clown looks kind of creepy,

519
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,840
 but it's a place where people do make-believe stuff."

520
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,560
 But eventually, when people kind of got together

521
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,600
 and were talking about it on Twitter,

522
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
 they're like, "Do you remember as a kid

523
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,400
 seeing that creepy clown there?"

524
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,120
 Apparently Kidzanzia said, "We've never had clowns there,"

525
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,360
 or in Mexico they're known as piassos.

526
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
 "We've never had any piassos there."

527
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,920
 So you take that, your mileage may vary on that one.

528
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,960
 It could be false memory.

529
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,640
 It could be like, "Who employed at a theme park today

530
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,960
 could say, 'We've never, ever, ever employed a clown.'"

531
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,560
 Like, maybe you did.

532
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,440
 You don't know.

533
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,520
 But anyways, they could have definitely said,

534
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,160
 "We've never had a 2D animated character

535
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,080
 enter the real world and work there."

536
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,360
 That's something you could say.

537
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,320
 But so we have sightings of the Cheetah guy,

538
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,520
 Chester Cheetah in bathrooms.

539
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,680
 We have sightings of him at Kidzanzia.

540
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,760
 And we have all of these tweets that popped up.

541
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
 Now, I dug a lot into this story,

542
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,280
 because I think it's interesting,

543
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
 and there's two different ways we can go through it.

544
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,440
 But first one, let's attack it the realistic way.

545
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,000
 There's two ways to do that, actually.

546
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,280
 One is that these kids are all having just

547
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,680
 the-- I told the story recently about me having a brave star doll.

548
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,200
 It was this cowboy, space cowboy show back in the day.

549
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
 And one day I was looking at the doll

550
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,560
 in the face of Freddy Kruger, appeared on the doll.

551
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,080
 I remember it vividly.

552
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
 The dolls face changed to Freddy Kruger,

553
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
 and I threw the doll and ran away, and I was super scared.

554
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
 So kids will see things.

555
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,320
 And now, did Freddy Kruger really appear on my doll?

556
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,960
 Probably not.

557
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,400
 I had an intense paranoia of Freddy Kruger.

558
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,840
 Thought about it all the time.

559
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,640
 Trick of the mind.

560
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,240
 It's possible that it was demonic,

561
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,680
 but it was most likely a trick of the mind.

562
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,520
 These kids could have been hallucinating,

563
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,960
 chester cheetah, for whatever reason.

564
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
 Freddy Kruger is way scarier.

565
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,920
 Maybe they were too scared to get too dangerously cheesy.

566
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,160
 But then there's this, which is actually

567
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,000
 the most likely explanation.

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,280
 All of these tweets, and really the bulk of them,

569
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,800
 they definitely started in October of 2018.

570
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,640
 And what's October best known for?

571
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,400
 Spooky, spooky Halloween time.

572
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,120
 Now, there was also in October 2018,

573
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,160
 the opening of a haunted house,

574
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,640
 and the gimmick was it was sponsored by, you guessed it, Cheetos.

575
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,560
 So at the time, all of these tweets

576
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,400
 were popping up all over the place.

577
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,560
 And looking back, 'cause then people started going,

578
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,160
 "Well, that's kind of weird, because in this other part

579
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,000
 of the country, they had a Cheetos-themed haunted house,

580
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,680
 which is weird in and of itself."

581
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
 Right?

582
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
 But the idea is this, it was basically a stealth marketing campaign.

583
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,360
 You could easily just create fake accounts,

584
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,200
 throw up a couple posts ahead of time,

585
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,720
 then promote your Cheeto haunted house by saying,

586
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
 "Chester Cheeto's this creepy thing that hides in your bathroom."

587
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,560
 And then knowing full well that no one's going to go back

588
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,240
 and check the veracity of the accounts,

589
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,600
 or the accounts will get shut down,

590
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
 which will add to the conspiracy.

591
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,560
 It's going to be passed around via screenshots, see.

592
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,760
 A screenshot of a teenage girl's photo,

593
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,080
 looks like a real account story about Cheeto in her bathroom.

594
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,120
 Her account gets deleted, or she stops posting or whatever.

595
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,400
 The screenshot gets passed around, not the particular Twitter account.

596
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,760
 Now, you can actually find Twitter accounts of people who talk about this.

597
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,440
 You can find those accounts today.

598
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,880
 But did I go back and see how long the accounts have been posting?

599
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,440
 No.

600
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,800
 Because I think that even if they weren't part of the initial stealth marketing gimmick,

601
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,040
 it would be easy for someone to say,

602
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,400
 "Hey, that's weird. I saw Cheeto when I was a kid.

603
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
 He was really creeping my bathroom."

604
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,400
 And for other people to lie and say they saw it too just for attention,

605
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,120
 or for other people to say something similar,

606
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,360
 or false memory, or something like that.

607
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,760
 And you correlate all the positive ones.

608
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,960
 You don't correlate the 500,000 ones,

609
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,320
 where they're like, "What? That's dumb."

610
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,080
 Those don't get screen-shotted.

611
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,560
 You screenshot the 15 or 20 that say,

612
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,160
 "Yes, I saw that as well."

613
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
 All that stuff gets loaded in.

614
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,800
 And now, years later, two years later,

615
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,080
 we're talking about, is Chester Cheeto a real-life entity walking around Mexico?

616
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
 But there's another way to look at this.

617
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
 The dead rabbit radio way.

618
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
 So let's put on our conspiracy caps.

619
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,280
 You have a product you want to sell.

620
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,080
 By personifying it, you can make it easier to sell.

621
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,800
 So if you just had a brand of cigarettes called Desert Cigarettes,

622
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,160
 huh, you might be able to make it, but you call it Camel.

623
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,600
 You put a picture of a camel on it.

624
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,080
 Then you create a character named Joe Camel,

625
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,160
 who's smooth and suave, even though he's a drama-dairy.

626
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,080
 He gets more chicks than you do.

627
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
 Don't you want to be as cool as Joe Camel?

628
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,480
 Mar-Blor-O-Man?

629
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,920
 He's the guy who smokes cigarettes.

630
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,400
 You can take these brands and turn them into a person.

631
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,360
 You're creating an icon or an idea.

632
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,560
 You have the brand that you're selling, and then you turn it into an idea.

633
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,440
 We see this all the time.

634
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,760
 Pillsbury Doughboy, Michelin Man, Aunt Jemima.

635
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,400
 We have, I mean, I could go on and on.

636
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,080
 And they don't always have to be a person, but you have the brawny guy.

637
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,720
 So you have really strong dish towels, but you associate them with a big giant lumberjack.

638
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,280
 Brawny.

639
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,280
 This is how advertising works, really.

640
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,160
 Snap, crackle, pop.

641
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,800
 Tony the Tiger.

642
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,880
 I'm going to stop listing them, but we go on and on.

643
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,600
 Ronald McDonald.

644
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,160
 Okay, that's it.

645
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,200
 I'm going to stop listing them.

646
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,760
 Ronald McDonald's injecting himself with secret sauce.

647
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,160
 Here we have Chester Cheetah.

648
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:48,080
 Now, made up by an American marketing firm to market a product that's international.

649
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,440
 A cheetah, a fast animal.

650
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,240
 They're kind of cool.

651
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,120
 Kids like cats.

652
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,680
 But when we look at the design of Chester Cheetah, it looks like something else.

653
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,760
 Looks like something else.

654
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
 A coincidence, most likely.

655
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,160
 When we look at, hold on for a second, okay?

656
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
 Don't freak out when I say this for a sentence.

657
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:18,000
 When we look at Mesoamerican art, when we look at the artwork of the religious icons of the

658
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,120
 indigenous people of Mexico and Central America, their sketches of the heads of the jaguars and

659
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,400
 the bodies tend to resemble what Chester Cheetah looks like.

660
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,080
 Kind of the blocky head and the skinnier frame.

661
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,840
 The jaguar was worshiped for many, many centuries in Mesoamerica.

662
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
 It's all over their artwork.

663
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,640
 It's part of their life.

664
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,640
 So when you have an advertising agency in New York that's sketching out this cat

665
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,640
 who just wants some Cheetos, it's not easy being cheesy, he often says.

666
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,640
 And that sketch could have just come out of some artist's mind.

667
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,160
 He could have been inspired by these vases that were in museums around the world that

668
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
 showed a jaguar god of Mexico.

669
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,000
 But for whatever way, he sketches it out.

670
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,720
 And then this thing gets pushed out as an icon.

671
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,840
 Every day you're seeing commercials for this.

672
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:25,360
 Every day this visual image of a cheetah trying to get some Cheetos is appearing on your television set.

673
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
 We've talked a lot about thought forms.

674
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,600
 We talked a lot about tulpas on the show.

675
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,840
 We just did an episode, two episodes ago about Corona Chan and Ebola Chan.

676
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,800
 Is it possible this is the same thing?

677
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,000
 Is it possible that these Chester Cheetah sightings are in Mexico because you're taking

678
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,520
 this cheetah, you're reminding this cultural consciousness of this god they once worshiped?

679
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,080
 They're seeing it every day.

680
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,000
 Their iconography is being shown to them every day and it's activating

681
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,240
 something subconscious, something genetic.

682
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,480
 You don't really have sightings of Chester Cheetah running around Serbia.

683
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,040
 You don't have Chester Cheetah running around Alaska.

684
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,280
 They don't worship the jaguar god.

685
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,360
 Their ancestors were never part of that belief system.

686
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,160
 Imagine a world 500 years from now, a Christianity is wiped out today.

687
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,080
 500 years from now, people are just kind of going about their lives.

688
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,480
 And in America, someone comes up with an advertising gimmick of a man in white robes and a little beard.

689
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,560
 He walks around and he turns loaves into fish.

690
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
 That's the brand.

691
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
 It's fish sandwiches, the weather's selling.

692
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,240
 Guys like, man, I really want a fish sandwich.

693
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,120
 I got you guys.

694
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,840
 Ding!

695
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
 Takes the bread, fish appears into it.

696
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,080
 Would that in parts of the world where people used to be Christian,

697
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,840
 they had no real identity of what they, it was if they vaguely were aware of what Christianity meant?

698
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,920
 It had pretty much been wiped out by other societies on top of it.

699
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,360
 Would that awaken something in those people?

700
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,080
 Would that awaken an image that they would then one day wake up and they would see

701
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,280
 a caring man standing at the foot of their bed?

702
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,920
 What?

703
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,560
 That was weird.

704
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,440
 I saw the fish guy.

705
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
 The fish guy was at the foot of my bed.

706
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,680
 It's not a hallucination.

707
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,360
 It's remembering.

708
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,640
 It's remembering a myth that your ancestors used to believe in.

709
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,720
 That you were vaguely aware of and it was being reactivated by this imagery.

710
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,960
 If this theory is true, if this theory is true,

711
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:34,400
 you think people would need to be far more careful about the advertising or the branding they do.

712
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,160
 Because if you can awaken a sighting of a cheetah-like character sitting in a dark bathroom

713
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,360
 or standing in the bushes outside your school,

714
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,720
 just by creating an animated cartoon cat who really likes cheetos,

715
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,600
 what would happen if Chester Cheetah was instead designed as a horror movie villain?

716
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,120
 Or the final boss of a violent video game?

717
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,640
 And as those images, not the harmless cat simply trying to get a snack,

718
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,760
 but as those violent images were being poured into people's heads over the world,

719
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,880
 most people wouldn't think twice about it.

720
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,480
 But if you were the descendant of someone who worshipped the Jaguar,

721
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,360
 you would be confronted with a more evil, vicious version of that thought form.

722
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,040
 And that would be a thought form you wouldn't want to see standing in the bushes

723
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,680
 while everyone else was in class.

724
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,080
 That violent Jaguar monster wouldn't want to be

725
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,120
 someone you knew was sitting in the stall next to you.
