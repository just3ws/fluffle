1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 possibly one of the most disgusting crimes we've ever covered on Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,500
 And then we take a trip to Jack London's house.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
 Famous author, dead now, but people have been seeing his ghost for years.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,200
 However, the ghost that inhabit his property may have implications

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,000
 that go far beyond the death of an author today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,500
 *music*

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 I'm still feeling kind of tired. Don't know if it's the medicine.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
 Don't know if it's the lack of caffeine. Don't know if I'm still in recovery.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 But today's episode is going to be kind of short.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
 Going to be a little shorty. A little tiny guy.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,500
 But I wanted to put one out for you guys.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 So here we go. Now I'm going to start this off by saying that

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 if you are eating chili right now, don't put it away.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 Actually give it to me. Oh man, I love chili.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 But give it to me and then I'll eat it later.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Because even I would not dare to eat chili during this story.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
 And just to be fair, probably don't eat anything.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 Nothing. Go-gurt, fruit roll-up. You still might have a problem listening to this story.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,500
 Let's hop into Jason Jalopy. We are going to drive down to Los Angeles.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 The City of Dreams. What's that song?

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 Da-da-da. Hollywood and the New York Hills.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 Da-da-da-da-da. What's that song? Dang it. It's by Hugh Lewis in the news.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 Da-da-da-da. Da-da-da-da. Da-da-da-da.

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 You guys know that song?

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 So we're headed to LA. I just edited out five minutes of me trying to remember Hugh Lewis in the news song.

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 So you're welcome by the way. I got to keep this episode short.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 The song was The Heart of Rock and Roll if you were wondering.

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 But anyways, we're headed to Los Angeles. The City of Dreams.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 We're on Hollywood Boulevard. We're pulling up in the Jason Jalopy.

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 We're looking for people to race. We have matching black leather jackets now

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 that all on the back say dead rabbit radio. Which would actually be dope.

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 You know what actually I would love to get is some Letterman jackets.

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 I've always wanted to wear a... I never wanted to wear a Letterman jacket as a teenager.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 But I want to wear one as an adult. I want to get one fitted for me as an adult.

38
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 And just have some ridiculous stuff on the back. I don't know. A made-up sports league.

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 Letterman jackets are hilarious when adults wear them. I think it's just like the height of "I don't care anymore."

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 I just... I really don't care what people think about me when a 40-year-old man.

41
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 And you may say no, Jason. When a 40-year-old man, or 43 in my case, wears a Letterman's jacket,

42
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
 he's trying to relive his glory days. However, I will say this.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
 If it is obvious that the Letterman's jacket is not his high school Letterman jacket,

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,500
 that it is one that he somehow scammed some high school supply company to make for him.

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 That is the sign of a man who just doesn't care.

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,500
 Who social engineers, Jostens, and is able to convince them to custom make him a Letterman jacket.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 That is not a guy trying to relive his glory days. That is a guy who's living his glory days right now.

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 But anyways, so forget the Letterman's jackets. We're wearing matching Letterman's jackets,

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
 and we get out of the car and we're all walking all studly.

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 Now, we get... we're walking down Hollywood Boulevard and we see a tie place, and I'm like,

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 "Okay, guys, hold up. We're going to stay a far distance away from this.

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 We only... we just want to be passive observers. We don't want to be anywhere near this."

53
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 And at that time, we see a young woman named Heidi Van Tassel leave the tie restaurant.

54
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 "Bye, girls!"

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 Apparently, she sounds like a 50-year-old housewife from a sitcom.

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 "Bye, girls! See you later!"

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 As her friends are all leaving the tie restaurant, she gets into her car.

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,500
 She had a great meal. Everything was awesome. It was a girl's night out.

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 But lurking in the shadows, and now we're switching to hobo vision.

60
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 There's a hobo hiding in the dark alley.

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 The eyes, it's all target acquired. Target acquired. It's like infrared.

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 He looks at her. He gets like her height and her weight. It's all target acquired.

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 And he starts running up the walls.

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,500
 And so he jumps out of this darkened alleyway, and he's approaching this woman at rapid, rapid speeds.

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 She's opening her car door, and the hobo... The camel he-he-he undoes his camouflage.

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 Materialized is behind her.

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 Now, I'm going to read you this headline, because this might actually be the best constructed headline of all time.

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 I'm a journalism- I'm a journalism dude, so my degree's in.

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 This might be- I- I- This might be the best constructed headline ever made.

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 Because the horror simply gets worse with each passing word. Here we go.

71
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 Homeless man. Which is not what you want- this is not how you want your headline to be.

72
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 Because you know something bad's coming. Either something sad, homeless man dies.

73
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 I guess some guy was shooting arrows at homeless people recently.

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,500
 But- so that's bad. But any article that starts with homeless man very rarely has a good ending to the headline.

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 Homeless man through huge bucket. So, right there. Now we know this does not have a happy ending.

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 Homeless man through huge bucket. You're like, "Okay, so a guy had a giant metal bucket, and he chucks into this woman, hits her in the back of the head."

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
 Mmm, that would be much better than what's coming.

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 Homeless man through huge bucket of hot diarrhea.

79
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 The whoever concerned for this headline is a master of the English arts.

80
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:08,500
 Because here's the thing. It's- how often do you hear the words "hot diarrhea" to explain anything not in hyperbole?

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 Oh man, this tastes like hot trash or hot diarrhea. This- oh man, I'm so hot, I feel like I'm hot diarrhea.

82
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 You never ever hear it used- oh dude, I just went to the bathroom. Oh what happened? Oh, hot diarrhea, bro.

83
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 And even that you were like, "Oh, did a bunch come out?" Like you wouldn't actually think that's a temperature gauge of the diarrhea.

84
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 But we're not even done with this headline, with this horrific headline.

85
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 Homeless man through- homeless man through huge bucket.

86
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 Oh and again, he had to say huge. It couldn't have just been "homeless man throws hot diarrhea."

87
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 And he had to include the fact that not only was it a bucket, not only was it a bucket, it was an abnormally large bucket.

88
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 It was huge. It wasn't just a little bucket.

89
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 Homeless man through huge bucket of hot diarrhea all over woman's face.

90
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 Again, dude, the specifics of this. What a great headline.

91
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 Because you could have just said, "Homeless man throws diarrhea on woman."

92
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 But this author really wanted to build the visual. It's a huge bucket.

93
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 It's hot diarrhea, by the way. It's hot. And not only does he throw it on the woman, he goes out of his way to get it into the woman's face.

94
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 And here's, as much as I love that headline, there is one fact that could have made, could have added to make it super gross.

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 Remember, all of these events took place outside of a Thai restaurant.

96
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 So it's quite likely that this guy's diarrhea was fueled by dumpster diving Thai food, which would have made it extremely pungent.

97
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 But I'm still giving this headline an A+ - greatest headline I've ever read.

98
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 So let's go back to the actual crime. She's getting ready to get in her car and, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

99
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 So she doesn't say she got any in her mouth, but I'm assuming at that point she probably did, but the smell alone.

100
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 And then, here's the next part of this quote, "Parametics who came to treat me said there was so much of it that it looked like the man had been saving it up for a month."

101
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 So it's not like this guy just went, ate some Thai food, had diarrhea in a bucket, saw a attractive woman walk by, throw it in her face.

102
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:16,500
 No. It was full. This was a full bucket of Thai food-enhanced diarrhea that he'd been holding for a month.

103
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 Pooping it, go about his day pooping it, go about his day pooping it, and then he threw it on her.

104
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:32,500
 So this is, I mean, how many bowel movements do you have a day now at Thai food to that, plus being a homeless psychopath,

105
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 which means you probably have more bowel movements, and then pouring that on somebody, and it being hot diarrhea.

106
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 So anyways, he's arrested. His name is Jer Blessings. There's no blessing there.

107
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 Jer Blessings. And, yeah, I know it's a stupid joke, just deal with it. Jer Blessings.

108
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 Now, he's been diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. No duh.

109
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 Did they really need to bring a doctor out for that one? They're like, "We've arrested this man. He saved his feces up for a month. It's hot diarrhea."

110
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 "Can we spend $80,000 of taxpayer money to find out what's wrong with this guy?"

111
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,500
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure. I'll sit down with him for a while and do puzzles and ask him some questions,

112
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 and then I will tell you what you already know. This guy has some mental problems."

113
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 Anyways, he's diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizophrenic disorders and psychotic disorders.

114
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 Now, let me get to the part of the story that I think this woman, Heidi, wants to have her cake and eat it too,

115
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 because on one hand she has this quote where she says, "He doesn't need jail time. He needs mental health care."

116
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 "I have empathy for him because he needs help." But that may be true. He obviously needs help, but the thing is that,

117
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,500
 so the judge goes, "Yeah, you're right. He doesn't need help. Let's not put him in jail." They put him in a residential facility for two months,

118
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 and then he left. So he's back on the street.

119
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 Buckets, beware. If you ever see a guy buying a bunch of buckets from Home Depot, run. It may be this man.

120
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 I guess you shouldn't be afraid if you're in Iowa or something like that, but you can't have it both ways.

121
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 You can't--well, then when I say she goes on, there needs to be more victim counseling.

122
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 She got a bunch of infections, by the way. This wasn't just hot poop and it's like, "Gack!" from--you can't do that on television.

123
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 She got infections in her eyeballs, and they tested positive. She tested positive for all these infections, diseases,

124
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 and then every three months she has to get retested for a while, and I'll tell you why she needs to get retested,

125
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
 and this is the scary part, and they didn't really mention this. A lot of times there's blood and poop,

126
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,500
 especially if you're a homeless person, a psychotic homeless person, it's probably more common,

127
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 and you can easily get AIDS through your eyeball, and it doesn't show up right away.

128
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 I'm sure they gave her--if you--if you get sexually assaulted, you can go to the hospital and they have like an AIDS shot that they give you.

129
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 It doesn't give you AIDS. It takes away the chances of--so, let's say that I got raped by a dude,

130
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 and I could run to the ER and go, "I just got raped by this guy. It was unprotected. I want the AIDS shot now."

131
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
 You can say, "Jason, if you walk into a hospital saying that, they're going to think you were crazy,"

132
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 but it actually is a thing. They have like this instant injection.

133
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 They can give you--that can cut down the chances of you actually catching HIV/AIDS, whatever you want to call it.

134
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 So, that does exist. So, I'm sure they gave that to her, but they're going to have to keep monitoring her, because it's not 100%,

135
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,500
 and you don't know if you have it for a while. They say the first sign you have AIDS is you get the worst flu you've ever had.

136
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,500
 It's a couple weeks after the fact, because your immune system's starting to act up.

137
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 So, this type of guy where he's--that's a biological attack.

138
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,500
 If he had thrown acid on her, he would have been in jail, regardless of his mental illness,

139
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,500
 but he may have done just as much damage if she gets a horrible infection and dies from it.

140
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 Moral of the story is, don't live in LA. Don't trust people who have buckets.

141
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 I would say, don't go to Thai food restaurants with black, like, long dark corners around the restaurant, all those things.

142
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 But, I will offer this mystery up to you guys.

143
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 If Scooby has the Scooby Gang, what do we have? Do we have the Rabbit Gang? That sounds lame.

144
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,500
 Well, anyways, think about it. That's your first challenge. Come up with the name of a gang that we all belong to with our Letterman jackets.

145
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 My challenge to you is, apparently, there is footage of this attack that the police is not releasing.

146
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 Now, I don't want you guys to bring into police servers and steal body cam footage.

147
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,500
 However, one of the local businesses recorded this on their cameras, so that's not--again, I'm not asking you to--

148
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 Oh, don't break into the police station, but break into this boutique.

149
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 No, if you guys happen to find this footage--because I know it's out there somewhere--

150
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 DiarrheaAttack.mov, if you guys happen to find this footage, go ahead.

151
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 Post it on YouTube and send it online. Actually, you should send it to Heidi first, because she wants a copy of that footage.

152
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 But I would be interested to learn more about this story, about Jare.

153
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 I really want to know how big the bucket was. Really, how big the bucket was.

154
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 Because I'm picturing it like a big--not like a 10 gallon bucket, like a paint bucket.

155
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 I'm picturing it like a metal pail that you could carry around, but I could be lowballing it.

156
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 It could actually have been like a straight up giant, one of those old timey things they used to deliver milk in.

157
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 That it was like his personal porta potty, and then one day he's like, "Ah, whatever, it's poureds on somebody."

158
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 And, just to remind you guys, he's still out there, right now.

159
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,500
 So you could be sitting here listening to this podcast. You don't know it, but there's hobo vision behind you.

160
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 [breathing heavily]

161
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 And then you hear a spew, that's the diarrhea floating around in the bucket.

162
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 And you're like, "It's weird, I hear the sound of corn and liquid being sloshed around in a tin pan."

163
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
 And then right when you turn around, "Ah!" throws it all over you.

164
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next--that segment took 20 minutes to record. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

165
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 I enjoyed it, though. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

166
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 So we just saw all that happen, and you're like, "Dude, shouldn't we help clean her off?"

167
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 And I was like, "No, no, no, we can't attract the attention of Jair blessings."

168
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
 Like, just get back in the Jason Tlapey, we're gonna drive out of here.

169
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 So I'm starting the car up, and then we look in the rear view mirror, and we see the homeless person.

170
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 [breathing heavily]

171
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,500
 Look at us, he's already hit his one target. He starts running. He's running towards the car, and I'm like, "Come on, car, start, start."

172
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 [imitates car noises]

173
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 I'm rolling down your window. I'm like, "Dude, get him, get him! I'm too important to get pooped on!"

174
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 I'm still trying to start the car.

175
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
 [imitates car noises]

176
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 Jair is now running on all fours now. He's getting closer to the car. We finally started.

177
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
 [imitates car noises]

178
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,500
 He's still chasing the car. He's chasing the car like the T1000.

179
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun!

180
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 He's liquid diarrhea. He's turning--he can make his arms turn into like diarrhea blades.

181
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 He's all slashed in the back of the car.

182
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 [imitates car noises]

183
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 Anyways, I make a quick jackknife so he gets some diarrhea on you, and I'm like, "Hehehehehe."

184
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 We drive off, and then he's like shaking his fist at us.

185
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 However, we--there's a little bit of liquid diarrhea in the car, so it's like reforming into a little jare.

186
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 So we throw him out, and then we take him to the hospital to get tested for biological infections.

187
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 But luckily, you're clear. It didn't get in your eyes. It only got up your nostril and into your mouth.

188
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 So be thankful.

189
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 We're now in Sonoma County, California.

190
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 We're going to a little place called Jack London Village.

191
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 Jack London--I know that he wrote books about dogs, like Call of the Wild and White Fang and Canary Row,

192
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 which didn't have dogs in it, but should have.

193
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
 Maybe the dogs--maybe they were canning dog food. I don't know.

194
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 I know nothing about Jack London.

195
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who are Jack London fans that are like, "Ugh."

196
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 There's so many other great stories you can tell about him, but he's dead.

197
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
 We're going to talk about him being a ghost.

198
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 So apparently, he wanted to build this big old house, fire broke out, raised the house,

199
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 and then I think it did eventually get built or raised again by the other spelling.

200
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,500
 But anyways, he dies, and his wife said that she would see Jack London's ghost walking around the property,

201
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 and they gave her a sense of peace.

202
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 And she saw his ghost with the ghost of the little puppy who passed away.

203
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,500
 This place--Jack London Village, and then there's like a Jack London State Park,

204
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 and there's this house called like the Wolf House.

205
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 And I'm kind of this--because he was a big deal.

206
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 I'm really underselling him if you're not familiar with who Jack London is.

207
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 Jack London was basically, for lack of a better comparison, the JK Rowling of that era.

208
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 Like, everything was Jack London.

209
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 Like, the biggest author of the time, I would say.

210
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 To the point where still very famous today.

211
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 So, I mean, I don't know who is contemporary. I know very little about Jack London, except that he was super famous.

212
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 He wrote books that had cans in them, and wolves, and dogs, and the story about the reject--that's really all I know about him.

213
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 But I also know he was like super, super famous.

214
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 So, he has all this land that's kind of like a state park dedicated to him.

215
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 Little tourist stuff, you can go there. You can actually meet the air buddies.

216
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 They'll play basketball for you. All this stuff.

217
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,500
 But, there's also a lot of ghosts in this area. There's an old sawmill there.

218
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
 And what happened was, after he passed away, other people kind of came into--not necessarily possession of the property,

219
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
 but moved into the property, and like, had built stuff there or something like that.

220
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 Not entirely for sure how it--because right now it's a state park, but when I was looking up the ghost stuff,

221
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 it appeared that there were other people kind of not necessarily owning or operating stuff in that area, but simply existing there.

222
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
 So, there was a passage of hands in this.

223
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 And so, when we start to see about the ghost stories here, it's interesting because a lot of times people see a ghost,

224
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 and they go, "What does Jack London look like?"

225
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 And then they'd go and they'd look a picture of Jack London up there, like, "That's weird. That's not the ghost I saw.

226
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 The ghost I saw was of somebody else."

227
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 Because you know that there's a ghost of Jack London.

228
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 He's the most famous person in the area.

229
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,500
 And you're all, "Aww, I only saw a paranormal entity of some loser. I didn't even see a cool ghost."

230
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 "I saw Lamo. It's all blah, it's all super detailed phantasm."

231
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 They're like, "Oh, man, you're not famous."

232
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 So anyways, you had this going on for a while where people were seeing ghosts that weren't Jack London.

233
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
 You're like, "Well, Jason, that's not a story."

234
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 Most ghosts aren't Jack London. And that's true.

235
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
 Most ghosts aren't Jack London.

236
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 But things get even weirder here.

237
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,500
 One day this woman's driving down the road in the area, and she sees a man walking across the road in the middle of the night.

238
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 She's like, "Aww!"

239
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 And she starts to hit the brakes, and around that time, and other cars come in the opposite direction,

240
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 and it hits the man, and the man passes through the car, disappears.

241
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,500
 So she goes home, she calls up her friend, and she goes, "What does Jack London look like?"

242
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 That's exactly what she asked him.

243
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 And he described what Jack London looked like.

244
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
 She was in the area. She was in Pittsburgh. She was in the area.

245
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 I don't know if I made that clear when this part started.

246
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 What does Jack London look like? And the guy described Jack London, and she goes, "That's weird. That's not who I saw. I saw a ghost of someone."

247
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 Now, other people have said it could have been this other owner, because there had been sightings of an owner after Jack London.

248
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 Ghosts had been sighted in that area as well.

249
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 And he's like, "It may have been him," and described him, and she's like, "Yeah, I don't know."

250
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 But she decides to go back to this mill late at night in the area to see--she's curious about it, right?

251
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 This is basically Daphne from Scooby-Doo before she met the rest of the gang.

252
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,500
 She hops in her car, she drives back, and when she pulls up into the parking lot of this old, abandoned mill,

253
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 she sees a massive crowd of ghosts just milling about.

254
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 Not one, not three, not four, a ton of them.

255
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 Walking around the parking lot and in and out of the sawmill just moving through the darkness.

256
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,500
 She describes them as dressed in all--all of them were all dressed in dark clothes.

257
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 They had weird-looking eyes, deep sunken, with dark circles under them.

258
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,500
 Now, that sounds very torturous. That doesn't sound like a happy-go-lucky ghost.

259
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 I mean, the black clothes, they could just have been a bunch of emo kids,

260
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,500
 but the sunken eyes and stuff like that, that's kind of a shorthand for like, soul in or depressed and stuff like that.

261
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 So basically, these guys are less ghost and more like phantoms, kind of just moving through the darkness.

262
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,500
 Now, here's the thing. There's been a lot of theories that these--there's so many ghosts that have been--

263
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 she cited all those ghosts and there's been other sightings of ghosts that nobody can put their finger on.

264
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
 Well, obviously, there are ghosts. You can't touch them.

265
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 There's been sightings of Jack London ghosts. There's been sighting of this previous owner's ghost.

266
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 But then there's like 30 other ghosts people have run into and they don't know who they are.

267
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
 They're just random dudes just hanging out.

268
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 So was Jack London really a murderer of drifters?

269
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,500
 Was there a bunch of like minors who were killed in the area, not kids, cave people,

270
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,500
 in the area through some sort of collapse and nobody ever remembered it?

271
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,500
 Or was there like an old-timey plane crash that killed a bunch of dudes before planes were invented?

272
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 Nobody knows. But there is a theory going around.

273
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 And I've seen this theory pop up a couple different places.

274
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 They're ghosts of characters from Jack London's books.

275
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 It's basically Jack London's characters haunting the area.

276
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 Now, there's no wolves. There's no ghost wolves as far as I know.

277
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 No spooky spooky ghost wolves.

278
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 But the assumption is that all of these ghosts may be characters from not necessarily the Call of the Wild,

279
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 which is a book about dogs, but Canary Row, maybe.

280
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 Maybe all these guys forgot how to get to work and they're waiting for a bus.

281
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,500
 But then I was reading that and I thought that's an interesting story and that's a cool little segment.

282
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 But then something sparked in my head and this is something I talked about just a couple episodes ago.

283
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
 And I've talked about it quite a few times actually.

284
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 But a couple episodes ago I said, or maybe last episode, why are ghosts always dressed up in ball gowns?

285
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 How come there are never any slob ghosts walking around in underwear or naked?

286
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 Because that's how most people die or walking around in a, you know, Frankie says, "Relax, sure." Whatever.

287
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 They're always dressed up. What if all ghosts are fictional characters?

288
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 And what I mean by that is that when you think of Marie Antoinette or some old-timey knight dying

289
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 or some hot flapper chick from the 1920s who jumped out of a building or whatever,

290
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 and then you hear the story, and I'm not talking about necessarily tulpas in this or that the ghosts are made up in her imaginary,

291
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 but let's go back to the Marie Antoinette thing because I think that one's Ann Blyn, whatever, one of those old-timey people.

292
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 When you think of them, if I ask you to picture Marie Antoinette, you're not going to picture her in bloomers with mustard all over her bare chest.

293
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
 Maybe if you've got some weird kink.

294
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,500
 But you're mostly going to, I say picture, you're going to picture her in ball gowns, Elizabethian stuff.

295
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 So she, that was only like 10 to 20% of her life.

296
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 Most of the time she grew up, she was a little girl, she's running around in stupid little girl clothes,

297
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 and then she spends a good amount of time taking dumps, taking baths.

298
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 She's not wearing her dresses all the time, but when we think of that person, the idealized, i.e. fictional representation of her is dressed up like that.

299
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 Same thing, if you were a medieval knight, how often were you actually in your armor?

300
00:24:52,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 But you would hear the clanking of the knight's armor, if you go to Edinburgh Castle at 3 AM, you'll hear the armor clink.

301
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,500
 Well, he was never in the armor, I could almost guarantee that he wasn't walking around the castle in it.

302
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:14,500
 He only had the armor on when he was out killing Muslims in the Holy Land, or bashing peasants' heads open with a mace.

303
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 It wasn't casual Friday, oh, I better put my armor on.

304
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:27,500
 I think this is an interesting thing, I think that... I'm not using this to discount the idea of ghosts, or saying that all ghosts are tulpas,

305
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 but you could have a ghost in an area that you... how you pictured that person in life is how that ghost appears.

306
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:48,500
 And what I'm basically saying here is that the ghost in the haunted castle, and Anne Boleyn's haunted castle, may not actually be Anne Boleyn.

307
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 It could be something that you're transposing a fictional, affictionalized identity on top of.

308
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 So you're basically taking a blank slate spirit and putting something on top of it.

309
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:09,500
 Now, of course, you have people who say, "Well, the ghost has the personality of my grandpa." Not Anne Boleyn, Anne Boleyn is not your grandpa,

310
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 but your house is haunted by your grandpa. Every show, often you smell cigarette smoke.

311
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 And you hear the "chh" you hear the drink crack of a beer.

312
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 I would still argue that that is the idealized version of your grandfather, because you're not smelling his farts.

313
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 You're not remembering that time that he got so drunk that he fell down and, like, broke the wood table.

314
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 You're not sitting there watching Netflix, watching Slug Terror on Netflix because you have a bad taste in television show,

315
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 and all of a sudden, "chh" your table, you hear the sound of a table being destroyed, you jump up and your table is perfectly fine.

316
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,500
 You remember the good stuff, and that's good that you remember the good stuff about your grandpa.

317
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 But generally, the hauntings, basically all hauntings, kind of fall into one or two categories.

318
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 And most of them are this, a recording of an event, and generally it's idealized stuff about events, or something totally malicious,

319
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 and that's kind of like the small end of the scale.

320
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 And let me finish it with this, because I'm just kind of throwing out this theory, but have we ever, excluding mediums who are ripping people off,

321
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 have we ever had a ghost of somebody like Anne Boleyn, which history knows quite well, but you have a ghost of Anne Boleyn.

322
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 She's walking through her castle.

323
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:38,500
 And I'm using Anne Boleyn as just an example. I don't know if her ghost is reported on record, I'm just using her as an example as a ghost and a historical figure.

324
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 Has there ever been an example, has there ever been a story of a ghost haunting any location of a known historical figure,

325
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 and then the ghost revealing information about said figure that was unknown before that?

326
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 Has that ever happened?

327
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 Because if it does, if the ghost is able to reveal something that we didn't previously not know about Anne Boleyn, then that ghost is most likely Anne Boleyn.

328
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 But if it's simply a parody of how we see Anne Boleyn acting, then it's most likely not Anne Boleyn.

329
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 The ghost of Anne Boleyn, or the ghost of these historical figures, whether they're famous or not, kind of walking through and making these old-timey noises,

330
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 are how we picture those characters. And how we picture those characters, in a way, is very fictional.

331
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 The person itself might exist, but the representation we have of them, it's the same thing like this.

332
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 A lot of times when people do impressions of Donald Trump or Barack Obama or George Bush, they're doing an impression of somebody else doing the impression.

333
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 And you get used to hearing that, so then when you do hear the original person, you're like, "Oh, yeah, I think he does kind of sound like himself."

334
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 But we do that all the time. We do impressions of impressions, because we think the impression's funny, and then we copy that impression.

335
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:10,500
 And I'm saying that that's what this ghost thing is, is that it's a fictionalized version placed on--it's a fictionalized idea placed on top of something else.

336
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 So all of these ghosts walking around Jack London's backyard may be characters from his book that were so realized and brought to life through his writing,

337
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 which I never read, that they've entered our world.

338
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:38,500
 They could be just spirits out there that when people look at, they're thinking, "Oh, that looks like characters from Canary Row," and then they become characters from Canary Row.

339
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:46,500
 It may just be a phenomenon that we're placing something on top of because of the location of what's going on.

340
00:29:46,500 --> 00:30:02,500
 But I will end it with this. I'm going to leave a cliffhanger for tomorrow's episode, because I did say, has there ever been a case where a historical figure has revealed information about themselves after they died that we did not know beforehand?

341
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:15,500
 I do have a story. These characters weren't famous historical figures, but some people believe that their ghosts are revealing information about themselves now that they've passed.

342
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:31,500
 Tomorrow we are going to look at the phenomenon of queer ghost hunters, a group of ghost hunters who make it their mission to only find LGBT ghosts and get them to come out from beyond the grave.

343
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 But we'll talk about that tomorrow on DeadRabber Radio.
