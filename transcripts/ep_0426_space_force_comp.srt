1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 A ghost gets hauled into court.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,840
 A true crime story with a bizarre and honestly kind of hilarious ending.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,040
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory that we haven't been visited by aliens before,

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,980
 that aliens don't control the governments of the world, no.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,360
 We were existing as our own little planet peacefully in the galaxy until an interstellar

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,680
 probe visited us.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,480
 And now all the nations of the world are scrambling to create a space force today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:44,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,200
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to our legacy Patreon for today, Jeremy Davis.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,880
 Jeremy, thank you so much for continuing to support the show.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,040
 You're going to be driving our vehicles today.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
 Really really appreciated.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,080
 You can't support the Patreon, that's cool too.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,960
 Just help get the word out about the show.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,040
 That also really really helps a lot.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,160
 Let's move on to our first story.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,500
 Now, Jeremy, fire up that carboner copter.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,400
 We are headed out to jolly old England.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
 We're flying over their really tiny buildings in England.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 I did look it up.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,240
 I made a comment the other day that I imagine England has really small buildings.

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,280
 The biggest building in England is like 30 stories or something like that.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,240
 So yes, tiny country, tiny buildings.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
 Giant maple though.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,120
 The maples go all the way up to the sky.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 We're flying.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,880
 We're cutting off the ribbons of the maple with the rotors of the carboner copter.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,280
 We truly are vandals of the world.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
 We're headed to Portsmouth, Portsmouth, England.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,320
 Portsmouth, England.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
 It's April 2014.

35
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,000
 And we're going to land the helicopter in a graveyard.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
 My loved ones, they're underneath your wheel.

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,040
 And I'm not talking about the dead ones.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
 That's actually my daughter.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
 Sorry.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
 We just hopped out of the helicopter.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,080
 We've totally landed in the middle of a funeral.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,160
 We're at the cemetery.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,080
 Now at the cemetery, there are a bunch of families mourning on this.

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,560
 Obviously, you don't really go to cemetery to have a celebration unless you really really

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
 hated somebody.

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,840
 And you know, you're already thinking about the loss.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,960
 You're thinking about stuff about life after death.

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,320
 You're already, you know, you're going through all this emotional responses.

49
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,320
 And then you hear among the tombstones, "Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:57,320
 And then you hear among the tombstones, "Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:19,200
 So long story short is this guy, what happens is there's a guy playing soccer across the

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,080
 field next to the...

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,720
 We're talking about if they were playing soccer in the graveyard.

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,600
 Hey, heads up.

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,840
 They were playing soccer.

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,320
 This guy named Anthony Stallard, he was 24 years old.

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,640
 He goes, "Hey, mates, watch me make fun of these mourning people."

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,560
 And then he was jumping up behind tombstones and going, "Woo!"

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,960
 And moving his arms like a ghost or he was hiding.

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,080
 His families were walking by.

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
 "Woo!"

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,480
 And he got arrested for it.

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
 It was basically disturbing the peace charge.

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,360
 What's funny is the prosecutor had to reenact what he did in the trial.

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,560
 So the prosecutor was like, he was waving his arms like this and going, "Woo!"

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,440
 That's an actual part of the trial.

67
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 It's an actual quote.

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,240
 Now, what happened was his defense lawyer, he ends up pleading guilty.

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
 He's already had like a 12 month charge.

70
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,480
 It was like community service.

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,000
 He wasn't serving any time in jail, but he was doing some...

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,400
 It doesn't sound like that nice of a bloke to be around in the first place.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,160
 He had a 12 month charge for just generalized harassment.

74
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,200
 Three months was added on top of this and you had to pay like 20 pounds for each person

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,960
 he's scared of that day.

76
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,880
 Which if that's the case, oh dude, I was so traumatized.

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,760
 I actually was at the, uh, that cemetery in Portsmouth.

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,680
 They were like, "Sir, you can't even pronounce the name of our town!"

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,480
 You definitely weren't here.

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,080
 But anyways, I was scared where's my 20 pounds.

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,720
 So the thing is, is that his defense basically was, it's okay to be a ghost, but to be a

82
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,040
 ghost, when he admitted guilt, he goes, "Listen, it's okay to pretend to be a ghost.

83
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,840
 You just can't pretend to be a ghost in a graveyard."

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
 Because of the cycle.

85
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,440
 That's funny, because that is now should be the equivalent to, you can't yell fire in

86
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,080
 a crowded theater, because you'll get everyone to panic.

87
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,540
 I think there should be a side sane to that, if that's a term.

88
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,320
 We should make that a term as well, side sanes.

89
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,440
 You can't pretend to be a ghost in a graveyard.

90
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,560
 That actually, it really rolls off, I just said that out loud for the first time, that

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
 really rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

92
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,120
 You can't pretend to be a ghost in a graveyard.

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,520
 If you pretend to be a ghost at home, or in a movie theater, people are just gonna be

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,080
 like, "Shut up!"

95
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,040
 But if you pretend to be a ghost in a graveyard, you're adding an emotional component to it.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,280
 Dude, from now on, let's all say that, instead of someone going, "Well dude, you can't yell

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,000
 fire in a crowded theater, you just go, 'Hey man, there's a thing called free speech, but

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
 you can't be a ghost in a graveyard.'"

99
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
 Let's see if that catches on, dude, that'd be dope.

100
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,560
 That's worth way more than 20 pounds, you can keep your fake money.

101
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,040
 I'd much rather have invented that sane.

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,120
 But Jeremy, let's go ahead and fire up that carbonar copter.

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,720
 We are now, that was just a short little story.

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,680
 We are now headed back to America.

105
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,600
 We're taking off with, first off, let's exchange all of our pounds, all of this fake money

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,400
 for some real American dollars.

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,640
 Yeah, I can feel the greenbacks on my hand right here.

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
 Feels so good.

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,360
 I've never smelt, I don't think I've ever even held a pound.

110
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,960
 I think I've had Canadian, what are those things called?

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,320
 Like Canadian goose dollars, or goose feathers, or something like that.

112
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
 Actually, you know what?

113
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,720
 I probably shouldn't make fun of Canada anymore.

114
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,320
 It turns out this show is getting extremely popular up there.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,320
 And Poland, it's really exploding in Poland and Thailand as well.

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,520
 Hey guys, really, really appreciate how much this show is blowing up around the world.

117
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
 It's totally awesome.

118
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,600
 But what do they call Canadian money?

119
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,100
 It's not called a dollar.

120
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,640
 It is called, like, it's named after a bird, isn't it?

121
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,080
 It's like not a canuck.

122
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
 That's a human up there, right?

123
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
 Or is that a slave?

124
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,160
 Is that like a racist term for Canadians?

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
 I don't know.

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
 But anyways, like, their money is called some.

127
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,720
 I thought it was called, like, let me look it up.

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 Looney!

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,440
 It's called the looney!

130
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 I just looked it up.

131
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,760
 Yes, he was a bird thing, dude!

132
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,520
 Good ol' Jason's brain.

133
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
 Did it again.

134
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
 Thank you, brain.

135
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
 Let's go ahead.

136
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
 Why are we in Canada?

137
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
 We're headed to America.

138
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,120
 Where did that even come from?

139
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
 Jeremy?

140
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
 Jeremy's just flying around in circles.

141
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,760
 We're running out of fuel, bro.

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,280
 We're headed back to America.

143
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,480
 We're specifically headed to the state of Illinois.

144
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
 So bring us on down.

145
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,560
 We're landing in a little town of Milstatt, Illinois.

146
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,760
 This story takes place in April 2006.

147
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 This is an interesting one.

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
 I just saw this today.

149
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,400
 But I was just floating around.

150
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,840
 I forgot how I came across it.

151
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,200
 YouTube recommendation or something like that.

152
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,360
 Let's take a look at this story.

153
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,440
 There's a young girl named Ashley Reeves, 17 years old.

154
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,920
 She had a job interview and then she was going to go play basketball with a friend.

155
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,680
 It doesn't come home that night.

156
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
 Parents call the cops.

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
 Cops start looking into it.

158
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,520
 Start questioning her friends.

159
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,120
 Start questioning her boyfriend.

160
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,080
 Bring her boyfriend in.

161
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
 No leads.

162
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,680
 The boyfriend was out of town.

163
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,040
 He was watching his uncle's band or something like that.

164
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,600
 But one thing that the boyfriend said during the interrogation was she was going to go

165
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,840
 play basketball across town.

166
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,520
 And the cops go, "Why would she go across town and play basketball?"

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
 There's other hoops around here.

168
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,240
 And it turns out that she was playing basketball with a student teacher.

169
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,240
 So a full grown man, but was currently in the process of learning to teach something

170
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
 like that.

171
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,000
 His name was Samson Shelton.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
 He's 27 years old.

173
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,080
 She had also made comments to her friends that although she had a boyfriend, she was

174
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,560
 kind of seen an older man.

175
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,240
 Cops go, "Let's bring Samson in."

176
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,800
 Let's see what this guy has to say.

177
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 So they bring him in.

178
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,960
 And they sit down and they talk to him.

179
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,160
 He said, "Yeah, I do play basketball with her from time."

180
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,280
 At this point it's been about 28, 29 hours since she'd gone missing.

181
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,640
 "Yeah, yeah, I play basketball with her from time to time.

182
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,160
 Do you do anything sexual with her?"

183
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
 "Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

184
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:55,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

240
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

241
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

242
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

243
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:22,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

244
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

245
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

246
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

247
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:50,160
 yes, Samson, you get to go home, get your contact lens solution and toothbrush before you go to prison for 20 years,

248
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:59,160
 and I have to say, a man who pops a woman's neck, anyone who assaults anybody, really, right?

249
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,160
 You're going to have penalties put towards you, but when you're assaulting children like this, and yes, 17, you're still a kid,

250
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 you're assaulting people, and then you're trying to stage a murder, and then you leave her out there, and she lives, thankfully, she lives.

251
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:22,160
 The idea of you never peeing for 20 years, of having a nervous bladder, no, you don't get your own,

252
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,160
 not only do you not get your own urinal, bro, you have to share it with someone at all times.

253
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,160
 That is, that's justice right there, guys. Like, I just love that this guy, like, his worst fate is having to,

254
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:44,160
 and also saying, oh, I can't watch horror movies, imagine what he simply saw in his already 13, 14 years in prison.

255
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:53,160
 Stuff that he probably never would have seen on the outside. And again, attempted murder, this guy's in a higher level security thing.

256
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,160
 This guy's not a jewel thief, this guy's not a drug user, he's with other murderers.

257
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,160
 So the stuff that he's seen in there, if he thought Texas Chainsaw Massacre was putting stuff in his head, that's justice.

258
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:14,160
 So, Ashley, I'm glad that you're doing well. Samson, I hope your bladder is really, really full, and he's almost out, though,

259
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:22,160
 and that's crazy that someone that countless could be out and about. I mean, they're out already, people who haven't been caught for stuff, but...

260
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 Crazy story. Let's go ahead, though. We're running the tap. We go into Samson's cell and we turn on the tap water.

261
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,160
 He's like, "No! It's already been 13 years!" He has this ginormous bladder.

262
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,160
 The bottom half of his body is turned into all bladder now, and he's just like, now he's just like pearl from blade.

263
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:49,160
 He's just like this big bloated thing. We're leaving you behind, returning on the water, and we put on a sound machine of nothing but waterfalls and rainstorms.

264
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,160
 We're leaving you in prison. We're headed out to the Pentagon.

265
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,160
 [Humming]

266
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 We're walking down the hallway. I'm doing that noise. I'm doing my... I should hire someone just following me around with a drum.

267
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,160
 [Humming]

268
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,160
 That would make me... Everything I do sounds so much more official. Wouldn't it be kind of hard to record a podcast?

269
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,160
 We're walking through the halls of the Pentagon, and for this story, we're joined by Ori.

270
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 Now, Ori, he was flying around on the Carvener Coptor on Monday. He's a new Patreon supporter.

271
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,160
 He also... Before he became a Patreon supporter, though, he sent me this conspiracy theory.

272
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:41,160
 It's kind of an interesting one. It's interesting one in two ways. One, just the details of it, but two, it kind of shows how conspiracy theories are crafted in the first place.

273
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,160
 So let's go ahead and talk about the cons... And conspiracy theory might not be the right word for it.

274
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,160
 Maybe it's just theory. Let's take a look at it.

275
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,160
 And Ori, thank you for sending this to me. I find it very fascinating.

276
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 We're sitting in the Pentagon. We're in a briefing room. President's sitting there. We got the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

277
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:07,160
 Everyone's wearing their medals and stuff like that. We're just kind of sitting there with smoking cigars, because we're cooler than them.

278
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:13,160
 We got our feet up on the table. They're like, "Sir, that's a $5,000 tactical table." I'm like, "Yeah, whatever."

279
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:23,160
 Smoking my cigar. So we're sitting in this room, and the president's sitting there, and everyone's sitting there, and some guy's like, "Okay, here's the problem, folks. Here's the problem."

280
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:30,160
 We have recently discovered proof of an alien probe in our solar system.

281
00:19:30,160 --> 00:20:00,160
 G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G

282
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:13,160
 Okay, you... Oh, wow, wow, is that big giant space rock that was all in the news back in 2017. I actually never covered it on the show.

283
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:20,160
 It was one of those stories that was just so popular. That's the thing. Sometimes people go, "Why don't you cover that?"

284
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,160
 And 99% of the time, it's because it's just... It's such a common story.

285
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,160
 This kind of phases it into something more interesting, so I like that. But when this thing was flying by, I kind of figured...

286
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,160
 I knew what it was at the time, anyways, and I didn't cover it. It was something that was just so common.

287
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:47,160
 The same reason I didn't cover the drone sightings in Idaho earlier in the year. I figured that was just mistaken, and it turns out to be nothing, and that's another reason why I didn't cover it.

288
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,160
 So a lot of times I don't cover stuff because they're just super well-known. I like the obscure stuff. But anyways, I'm covering it now.

289
00:20:52,160 --> 00:21:02,160
 But I never learned how to correctly pronounce it. "Om wao wao" means it's a Hawaiian phrase. It means something in Hawaiian.

290
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,160
 That's literally what it means. No, it means like the messenger actually think what it means. I'm not going to bother looking at it.

291
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:18,160
 Because that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. "Om wao wao" is this big space rock that back in 2017 came into our solar system.

292
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 Now it's the first recorded interstellar object. And it's funny to think about that because the solar system is so big, and everything that we see...

293
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,160
 I mean, obviously, like we see stars, that's not part of our solar system. But like Haley's Comet is considered like locked into our solar system.

294
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:44,160
 This is something that came 100% within our lifetime, came from another star system.

295
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:51,160
 First thing we've ever seen in the real, at least the past 200 years, we've really been able to identify it.

296
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,160
 But some people say it even goes farther back than that. First interstellar object we've been able to record.

297
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:04,160
 The angle it's coming in and the way that the speed that it's coming in made all the scientists go, this is not from the solar system.

298
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:12,160
 And so you had a lot of people, and you even had one legit scientist, or more than one legit scientist, but you had a few legit scientists, maybe three.

299
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:19,160
 Saying that it was an alien probe, that it was a solar sail ship, and the sails are gone and things like that.

300
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,160
 And you'd see a lot of images of omwawwaw. And that's exactly what they were.

301
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:32,160
 I know a lot of people were saying, "Oh, you know, it's cigar shaped, just like the old, we don't know what it looked like."

302
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:41,160
 We've actually never seen it. The only thing we know is there's a little speck of light that was coming in from our solar system, which we had never seen before.

303
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,160
 And then right when it gets near Earth, it shoots off in the other direction. That is weird.

304
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,160
 And they go, "What's the gravity of the sun is making it fly off in the other direction?"

305
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:57,160
 So it's basically coming down. There's some really cool graphics that show it's coming down at an angle in our solar system.

306
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,160
 It gets to around Earth's orbit, sun's orbit. That's enough to shoot it off.

307
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,160
 It's still in our solar system. Within four years, it'll just be reaching Neptune.

308
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:12,160
 So even though this thing is moving fast, it's moving. It's one of the fastest moving objects.

309
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,160
 If not the fastest moving object we've ever seen in our solar system, it's still going to take four years just to reach Neptune.

310
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,160
 So they think it's been out there for billions of years. Billions of years.

311
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,160
 But we've never seen it. The reason why we get the cigar shape, and you'll see that very common shape.

312
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,160
 It looks like a Zintradi ship. It looks like a Zintradi ship from Robotech.

313
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,160
 But there's a lot of images of it, but they're really just artist rendering.

314
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,160
 And a lot of people got confused by this. It looks like a giant kind of lumpy piece of poop flying through space.

315
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,160
 We don't know the color. We don't know really what it's made out of. We don't even know if it's a cigar shape.

316
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,160
 They do say it looks like it's ten times longer than it is wide.

317
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,160
 But the only reason we've come to that conclusion is the way the light rotates.

318
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,160
 We have never actually seen this thing.

319
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,160
 And now that it's moving away from us, it's invisible. It's no longer showing up as a little shining light.

320
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,160
 It's completely invisible. So as this thing was coming in, most people were going, "Oh, that's interesting.

321
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,160
 It's time to do Christmas shopping." You had a group of people going, "Whoa, this is fascinating. It's an interstellar object."

322
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,160
 The first interstellar object that we've ever recorded. And then you had a group of people saying it was an alien probe.

323
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:37,160
 So you have all those groups of people. The interesting thing about Ori's conspiracy theory is that it's one of the key things that how conspiracy theories grow.

324
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:44,160
 Coincidences. Now, some people believe that everything is a coincidence. Whenever something comes up that it's a coincidence.

325
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,160
 Some people have no sense of coincidence at all.

326
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:54,160
 And then you have people like Garrick from Deep Space Nine, one of my favorite quotes from one paranoid person to another.

327
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:01,160
 "I believe in coincidences. Coincidences happen all the time. I don't trust coincidences."

328
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,160
 And that's really where the next things we're going to talk about could simply be coincidences.

329
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,160
 Could simply be coincidences. But the question is, do you trust these coincidences?

330
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:23,160
 Ori's conspiracy theory also is based on the fact, and I find this fascinating. I think there's either the conspiracy theory that aliens are working closely with governments of the world

331
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,160
 and their shadow governments and all these little things we see going on. Reptiles are running, the British government and all that stuff.

332
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:38,160
 You either have that, or you have the fact that all the governments of the world have no idea what aliens are, but they believe that they're here.

333
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:47,160
 And that's why they're constantly chasing with their fighter jets. I think that's actually a more likely one than the one that governments are actually working with aliens.

334
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:55,160
 Because if that was the case, there would have been a one-world government. The day one of the groups aligned themselves with the greys, it would just be the end, right?

335
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,160
 You wouldn't have Liberia going, "No, we're going to do things our own way," as like UFOs are flying everywhere.

336
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:10,160
 Or if Liberia got ahold of the UFOs, then everyone would just be Liberian. You wouldn't have that.

337
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,160
 This theory is interesting because it basically says neither of those are true. Neither of those are true.

338
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:23,160
 All the U.S. -- because it would start something. Let's say that the governments of the world, like when Trump goes, "I don't believe in aliens."

339
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:39,160
 There may be elements within the militaries around the world that goes, "We don't know what these objects are," but then at the top level they're just like, "Well, I don't believe in aliens, so it's probably foreign drones or glitches or something like that."

340
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:46,160
 You wouldn't have aliens working with governments. You wouldn't have the UFO sightings we're seeing actually being real.

341
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:55,160
 What this conspiracy theory puts forth is all of that stuff was trick of the lights or maybe some other sort of paranormal phenomenon we can't describe.

342
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:01,160
 Plasma charges, we've talked about that. Atmospheric anomalies, all these things.

343
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:14,160
 But this probe that came from another solar system into our own, that's when the governments of the world said,

344
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:21,160
 "Uh-oh, we -- this is not good. This is no longer a science fiction story."

345
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,160
 That happened in October 19, 2017. That's when it was discovered.

346
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,160
 And then it takes time to fly in our solar system, and now it's headed on its way out, but it's still in our solar system.

347
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:44,160
 Since 1982, we have had a space force, but it was under the jurisdiction of the Air Force. It was known as the Air Force Space Command.

348
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:52,160
 And so you had the Air Force -- it was basically a vision of the Air Force, and they used it to bolster the military might of the United States.

349
00:27:52,160 --> 00:28:01,160
 The first Iraq war was considered in military circles, the very first space war, because we were using satellites to watch where people were.

350
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:08,160
 Oh, troop movements in this area. Let's just lay them out. Totally changed warfare.

351
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 That first Iraq war man, I was in seventh grade when that happened. Something like that, dude.

352
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,160
 It was over before I graduated to the eighth grade. Over. There was no, like, "Oh, we need to leave troops behind."

353
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:29,160
 It was done. The military might just overwhelm the Iraqi army, push them out of Kuwait. It was over with.

354
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:37,160
 And the big part of that was satellite footage. We knew where everything was. That was because of Air Force Space Command.

355
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:45,160
 There had been people saying, "Listen, we need a dedicated military branch that only does space."

356
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:55,160
 Just like it used to be the Army Air Corps, the Army used to handle all of the planes, and eventually they said, "Listen, air superiority is so important.

357
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:02,160
 We need to have people that only focuses on the Air Force, because otherwise Air Force is simply a tool of the Army."

358
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:16,160
 1982, people started pushing for a dedicated command structure, dedicated resources, dedicated soldiers, 100% focused on space.

359
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,160
 Air Force said, "No." Now, of course, you're always going to say, "No." If you have a job, you really, really like your job, you're doing really well,

360
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,160
 and someone comes in and says, "We're going to cut your job 10%. We're going to create someone else to do 10% of your job."

361
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:37,160
 You might kind of like that, because it gives you a little bit of a break, but you also know that you're basically, they're going to take away 10% of your funding.

362
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,160
 "Oh, but we're also going to cut your paycheck 10%. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa." That's what would happen.

363
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,160
 So Air Force kept saying, "No, we're going to do this. We're going to keep this."

364
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:55,160
 Now, a lot of you may not know this, but American politics is incredibly divisive these days. I know that is a controversial statement.

365
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:01,160
 I know all of you guys thought both parties worked together for the common good of mankind, but it's not.

366
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:09,160
 I must say that as an American, I have seen one or two examples lately of the parties not getting along.

367
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:18,160
 Back in 2017, before Omumwaumwa was discovered, and I know that hurts people's ears every time I mispronounce that I apologize,

368
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:33,160
 but four months before it was discovered, you had Representative Mike Rogers of Alabama and Jim Cooper of Tennessee create a bill in the House of Representatives to create a space force.

369
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:41,160
 Bill fails. The bill fails. They want it to completely separate from the Air Force. It doesn't pass.

370
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:51,160
 Now, the Air Force was pushing heavily against this, heavily against this. Passes in the House fails in the Senate.

371
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:59,160
 You think that's pretty much it, right? There's a lot of bills are constantly being drafted and failing. It's part of the system.

372
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,160
 But then our interstellar visitor pays us a visit.

373
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:15,160
 Eight months after it is discovered, March 2018, Trump publicly begins to push for a space force.

374
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:24,160
 June, just a few months later, 2018, National Space Council, Department of Defense under Trump's directions get this thing started.

375
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:35,160
 February, 2019, Space Policy Directive 4 is drafted and set up to create the space force.

376
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:48,160
 December, 2019, bipartisan vote, House of Representatives and Senate both pass a package deal worth $730 billion in military funds,

377
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:58,160
 and specifically the creation of a sixth branch of the military, US Space Force.

378
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:10,160
 Within two years of Oma Waowau being cited, two years, a sixth branch of the military was created,

379
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:19,160
 something that hadn't been done since the 1940s when the Air Force was created.

380
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,160
 Just, let's get it done.

381
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,160
 Now, it's really, really difficult to get stuff passed.

382
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:39,160
 That's actually one of the beauties of the American democracy. That keeps a bunch of garbage laws from being created. It's supposed to be difficult.

383
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:46,160
 For this to happen, you would have had to have some crazy things going on.

384
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:55,160
 One, you'd have to have both the Republicans and the Democrats agree, well, right there, that's the first one, the Republicans and the Democrats agree.

385
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:05,160
 Two, you'd have to have the Democrats agree with Trump to create and fund with all new money a sixth branch of the military.

386
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:13,160
 You would need conservatives who are very, very cautious about spending money, you know, very libertarian.

387
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:24,160
 You would have to have the Air Force drop their opposition to it, because listen, any senator or representative who had an Air Force facility in their district

388
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,160
 would have been pushed hard to vote against this.

389
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:35,160
 You're a congressman from Texas, and in Texas there is a massive training facility for Air Force personnel.

390
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
 They're going to push you to not vote for this.

391
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:46,160
 You have to overcome the resistance of the Air Force. You have to overcome the resistance of politicians who hate Trump and don't want anything he wants.

392
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:55,160
 You've got to overcome politicians who like Trump, but don't want to keep raising the bill and building government, making it bigger and bigger and bigger.

393
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,160
 All objections pretty much put aside.

394
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,160
 The creation of the Space Force happened in December 2019.

395
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:14,160
 The Space Force is set up for space warfare, and their only focus is space.

396
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:23,160
 Now, of course, all the military branches work together, so they're going to be giving satellite information to the military, to the army and the Marines down on Earth,

397
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:30,160
 but they are looking now for soldiers to serve in space.

398
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:40,160
 And in a time where you have all of these differing political factions, you could go, "That money could go to building the wall," you promised, Mr. Trump,

399
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:48,160
 or "That money could go to helping these people, to rebuilding these schools, to do whatever political aisle you're on."

400
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,160
 You could find a better quote-unquote, better use for that money, depending on your political ideology.

401
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:02,160
 It went to create an army in space. Coincidence? That's the question, right?

402
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
 That's the question.

403
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:13,160
 Is it a coincidence that within two years of citing this interstellar object, that we now are working to having a fighting force in space,

404
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:22,160
 that Trump is pushing to get us on the moon, to begin mining the moon, to then use the moon as a platform to go to Mars?

405
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:34,160
 I mean, the skeptic in you goes, "Yeah, it's a coincidence." All of those things can happen. All of those events are real, and things happen like that, sometimes, right?

406
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,160
 But the timing seems bizarre.

407
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:50,160
 The timing seems bizarre. But again, that's a conspiracy theorist versus a skeptic.

408
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,160
 France? We're not the only ones doing it, which makes sense. I've talked about space arms race.

409
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,160
 I covered space force like on episode 7, when he first announced it.

410
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,160
 It'll create an arms race in space. Russia will want to go up. China will want to go up.

411
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,160
 France? They have a plan in place. They've announced by 2030 we want to have weaponized satellites.

412
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:23,160
 We're going to launch a satellite, and then orbiting it are going to be smaller satellites with guns.

413
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,160
 We're going to have weaponized satellites.

414
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,160
 Now, you've got to wonder how, like, are other satellites coming to beat up the French satellite?

415
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,160
 And they're like, "Ugh!" So they have to have bodyguards? Or is it for something else? Are they building weapon platforms?

416
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:44,160
 And they're not just dreaming about it. They're saying by 2030 we want to have weaponized satellites up in space.

417
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,160
 China's worked on shooting satellites down, but we're talking about having a permanent presence in space.

418
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,160
 Imagine that. Your buddy could be like, "Hey, I'm enlisting." "Oh, really? Where are you getting put?"

419
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,160
 "I don't know, but I'm pretty sure I'll be in space." "What?" "Yeah, yeah, I'm enlisting in the space force."

420
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,160
 "What?" "Yeah, I'm going to do two years floating around the moon."

421
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:12,160
 That will be weird, but that's a reality we're facing. You will see young men and women doing tours of duty in space.

422
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,160
 Now, I don't know if it's two years because, you know, they say your muscle tissue and everything goes down, but...

423
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,160
 Bizarre. Bizarre. You'll have children being created in space, children being conceived in space.

424
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,160
 It'll be a normal thing in the scope of our lifetime.

425
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,160
 But all of that aside, all of that kind of philosophical human evolution stuff aside.

426
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,160
 Was one created by the other?

427
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,160
 For decades, people were talking about having a separate space force.

428
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,160
 And you go, "Jason, didn't earlier you say Trump said he doesn't believe in aliens? Why would he create a space force to fight something he doesn't believe in?"

429
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,160
 He did make the statement in 2019 that he got briefed on UFOs, but he didn't really believe in them.

430
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,160
 But he also said in that statement, I thought this was kind of interesting, he says,

431
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:04,160
 "I think our great pilots would know, and some of them really see things that are a little bit different than in the past.

432
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,160
 So we're going to see, but we'll watch it."

433
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,160
 I think this also goes to the theory that aliens are not among us now.

434
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,160
 But he's saying, hey, you know, people have seen something that's a little bit different than we've seen before,

435
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,160
 which could coincidentally also mean this thing coming into our solar system that we've never seen before.

436
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:31,160
 And we'll watch it. We'll keep an eye on it. We'll see if this thing does anything weird.

437
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:39,160
 Now, every president, every world leader wants to extend their power and wants to extend the grip of their military might.

438
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:47,160
 So it's very likely that Trump's on opening and created a fighting force and space.

439
00:38:47,160 --> 00:39:00,160
 But again, it's just weird that so many chips have to fall on the table the way that they did for this to happen.

440
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,160
 But again, that's the amazing thing about conspiracy theories. They are created from coincidences.

441
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,160
 If we had discovered this probe and 40 years later created the space force,

442
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,160
 or if the space force had been separated from the air force in 1982 and we see this probe today,

443
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,160
 you never would have connected the two. The fact that they both happened within two years of each other.

444
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,160
 And Ori, again, thanks for crafting this. He's the one who put this out.

445
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,160
 The way that these two things happened relatively close to each other is what makes it odd.

446
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:39,160
 So is this a conspiracy theory drafted by a young fan of a handsome podcaster?

447
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,160
 Or is this a puzzle piece that no one put together before?

448
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:52,160
 And now we have a clearer picture as to why so many political and financial hurdles were leaped so quickly.

449
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,160
 So if you are thinking about signing up for the space force, we, of course, here at Dead Rabbit Radio, support you.

450
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,160
 As we support all of our men and women who are in public service.

451
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:11,160
 But just be aware, there is a chance that you may get a cushy job floating around on the moon eight hours a day.

452
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,160
 Kicking your feet up, getting high on moon dust.

453
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,160
 There is also a likely chance that halfway through your tour of duty,

454
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,160
 when you're hitting on that hot enlisted girl in her skin tight astronaut suit,

455
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,160
 that as you're ready to make your move on her, you hear a klaxon alarm.

456
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,160
 [Makes alarm sound]

457
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,160
 You put on your little bubble helmet, and you run in and you're grabbing your space gun.

458
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
 It's just a regular gun, but it's in space.

459
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,160
 You're running out of your base, and then you're like, "Oh no, I forgot there's less gravity."

460
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
 And then you remember to turn on your gravity boots.

461
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:52,160
 And now you're running on the surface of the moon, along with all your other fellow soldiers running on the moon.

462
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
 A bunch of dust is getting kicked up.

463
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
 [Makes alarm sound]

464
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:05,160
 And you look up into that pitch black sky, and you see a little dot of light headed straight for the moon.

465
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
 And then another one.

466
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
 And then another one.

467
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
 Ten more.

468
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,160
 Fifty more.

469
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,160
 You thought you were just going to be one of the first soldiers in space,

470
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,160
 but now you're on the front lines of the first interstellar war.
