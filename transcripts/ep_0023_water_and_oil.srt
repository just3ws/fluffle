 What do you get when you mix water and oil? This episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,760
 [Music]

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,680
 Hey everyone, thanks for tuning back in. I'm Jason Carpenter and this is another episode

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,760
 of Dead Rabbit Radio. It's Monday, July 9th. I think it's July 9th. Actually, I think it's Monday.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
 Took a long nap. I came home from play practice. Only got two hours to sleep last night

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,960
 because my tooth, I'm still having the sinus pain and I couldn't get it. Couldn't get sleep because

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,600
 the pain had to work, had to go to play practice. I came home. I was going to do the podcast

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,040
 and then get to sleep and there's a band once again playing at the ice cream shop right next to my

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,640
 apartment complex and they played for probably about an hour and a half. I just had to take

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,880
 a nap and if I wake up in time to do the podcast, I will. I'd like to keep my daily podcast schedule

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,320
 up and of course I woke up at 1030 so now I'm here recording this podcast. So it all worked out,

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,720
 I guess, in the long run. So here's the thing before we get started on the episode because you know

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,280
 I'm usually so on top of stuff and I don't ramble but I saw last night I was up. This might help

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,440
 somebody. Last night I was up with the worst toothache. I've been having tooth problems for a while now

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:35,760
 and it's gotten much, much worse since the sinus infection because my gums have swelled up so my

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,240
 teeth are moving up against each other and all of that. I have a dentist appointment. I doctor them.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,200
 They put a filling in and it causes some complications or something like that but anyway so I was online

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
 and I'm looking like what are some remedies that I can use because the pain was just imbearable. I

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,280
 couldn't sleep. It's like three in the morning and they're like you know rub a clove and lavender

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,920
 oil across your gums while kissing a salt block and I'm like I don't have any of that stuff and I

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,000
 would make love to a salt block if I thought it would help and I'd been doing salt rinses

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,560
 and that kind of helped. I was using the ambasol and that kind of helped and I just don't have,

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,760
 I'm not a cook so I don't have a lot of stuff here and they're like you know rub

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,880
 turmeric, make a turmeric paste. I'm like I don't even, I don't even know if I'm pronouncing

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,080
 turmeric right let alone have any of it. One of the thing I kept seeing pop up was garlic.

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,800
 Rub garlic on your gums. Rub garlic on your gums. They go it burns but it helps and I'm like well

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,080
 I have some garlic powder because they make you know I get the pre-frozen hamburger patties because

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,960
 I'm a bachelor and I don't actually like make food. I'm like the lowest level of bachelor.

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,040
 I have a lot of friends who are bachelors and they're really really good chefs like they'll come

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,760
 to work and they're like oh yeah I made this hamburger patty and I put like little chunks of

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,080
 cheddar in the middle of it and then I put like a single jalapeno that I released its spirit and

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,040
 and entered the soul of the patty and they make this delicious food and I buy 20 frozen patties

33
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,800
 at a time at Walmart just like a box of patties and just throw them on a George Foreman grill

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,960
 but I you know so that's just a that's just a Jason thing. I've never been that good of a cook.

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,800
 I microwave my spaghetti for crying out loud. I throw spaghetti noodles in a bowl for 15 minutes

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,200
 in the microwave. Opened up a can of sauce and poured on there. Very very low maintenance but

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,600
 anyways so I don't have a lot of stuff but I did have garlic powder and they kept asking for

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,120
 cloves of garlic cloves of garlic and I'm like you know what I have nothing to lose at this point

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,720
 it's three in the morning I have to be to work at five so I grabbed some garlic powder and I

40
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:58,160
 put it all over my mouth and it worked it actually worked. It reduced the inflammation enough for me

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,720
 to be able to get some sleep and so I've been doing that sparingly because I know I you know

42
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,080
 make me smell like garlic and then I actually went out and bought a little clove of garlic from

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,760
 Walmart it was like 18 cents for a clove and I've been doing that too, true in that a bit as well

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,080
 and it does sting but it definitely reduces inflammation the last maybe an hour and you

45
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,000
 can really kind of do it as much as you want as long as you know because you're gonna stink

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,840
 you're gonna be stinky from it but if you're having a toothache and you're not allergic to

47
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,760
 garlic go ahead and give that a shot because you know and I yeah it worked for me. I usually

48
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,200
 poo poo homeopathic stuff well there I guess there's no between homeopathic stuff and stuff

49
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,200
 like this I'm not gonna buy a jar of essential garlic oil that's one drop of garlic in a bottle

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,560
 of water but you know chewing up a clove it worked I mean chewing up a clove of I guess there is

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,360
 something called cloves I guess that's a different plant but then you can have a clove of garlic

52
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,200
 so that's kind of weird I don't get that you don't have like a stalk of corn and then a corn of

53
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:11,440
 tomato it does but anyway so yeah try that if your teeth are hurting I saw the most beautiful

54
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,800
 woman today ever and again don't want the upset to run late so I'm just gonna make this real quick but

55
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,440
 Vanessa that's what I'm gonna call you because you look like a Vanessa if you're out there and

56
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,120
 you're still in Hood River and you want to go hunt ghosts hit me up dead rabbit radio at gmail.com

57
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,920
 or you can hit me up on Twitter @jasonocarpenter gorgeous gorgeous I was with a couple friends

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:46,960
 and we all noticed her right away she's perfect perfect long blonde hair she had that tone to

59
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 her skin where you couldn't tell if she was tan or it was ethnic amazing body and and as she passed

60
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,760
 me I must she must have heard me say something I think I might have said oh my god like I there was

61
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,800
 a I had an initial reaction to her the reason why I think she heard me say something because we

62
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,840
 passed each other I was with Veronica actually and another friend of mine who I don't have a fake

63
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,320
 name yet for so I can't I don't know what to call him but he knows who he is we walked past Vanessa

64
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,800
 Vanessa I must have said something because as we walked past each other I turned around because

65
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 I was like I I I'm usually not like a total creep but I gotta see what she looks like from okay I

66
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,280
 am kind of creepy but I was like I gotta see what I gotta see the rest of her right so she walks past

67
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,600
 me I turn around to check her out and as I'm turning around she's already turning around looking at me

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,920
 and so I had to like just take in like a brief momentary information like how to get as much

69
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,400
 visual information in as I turned back so I didn't she didn't see I was staring at her

70
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
 but she had to know I must have said something out loud there's not a reason why she would have

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
 turned back around unless she because she was when I turned around she was looking at me

72
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,600
 but I don't think it was any sort of like ooh he's hot I think it was like uh is this guy checking

73
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,040
 me out but anyways I could be misreading it Vanessa could be madly in love with me she could

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,840
 be recording her podcast tonight about cooking with garlic and we're separated by miles of darkness

75
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,200
 here in Hoodie River just two podcasts broadcasting through the night if you're out there Vanessa

76
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,520
 I love you okay so let's go ahead and we will get started on the episode right now

77
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
 and we're going to talk about two conspiracy theories today now they're not the governmental

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,680
 type of conspiracy theories where people are trying to take over their science based conspiracy

79
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,320
 theories a little bit of paranormal in one of them but both of them have always kind of intrigued me

80
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,240
 and one of them I'm pretty sure is real and if it is real it I'm totally like I remember hearing

81
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,880
 about it back in the day and I said that's awesome the other one I heard about and thought it was

82
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,520
 awesome did some research and it wasn't so much so we'll see if you can figure out which one which

83
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,040
 one I like so the first one we're going to talk about it's a conspiracy theory about oil now you

84
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:11,840
 know I was going to college back in the late 90s early 2000s and that was a time where you're

85
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,160
 reading a lot about peak oil and that was kind of the big movement at the time there's always one

86
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,640
 there's always like one big ecological social disaster movement at a time this is before 2012 but

87
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,080
 I think for the intellectuals it was peak oil we're going to run out of oil we're going to run

88
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,600
 out of oil someday and you know the end of suburbia we watched that movie in college and I remember

89
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,720
 thinking oh no this is really bad like we're running a oil and it could be like this huge

90
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,520
 disaster thing and they always kind of pitched it as it's not mad max but it's kind of like mad max

91
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,360
 but you know as I got older and I kept looking at stuff and especially when Deepwater Horizon

92
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,480
 popped off if we were at a level of peak oil you'd be like oh this is definitely accelerating the

93
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,720
 you know now we're real but there's just so there's so much oil under the ground it can get harder to

94
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,080
 find and sometimes we need new technology to access it like fracking but the idea of us running out of

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,800
 oil I don't have a I really don't think it's an issue now I especially don't think it's an issue

96
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,600
 because when I was looking into the issue of peak oil and things like that I came across an

97
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:31,280
 interesting conspiracy theory and that is oil is not only plant-based or carbon-based now we are

98
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:38,080
 always taught in school that oil is caused from dead plant matter and dead biological matter but

99
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,800
 you know mostly plants being compressed over thousands hundreds of thousands millions of years

100
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,040
 and it gets compressed down and basically when it breaks down to its parts it can it forms petroleum

101
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,840
 and that's a real kind of dumb down explanation but that's I don't think you're dumb down I'm sure

102
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,560
 you guys may have a more succinct way of putting it but that's that's probably the most succinct

103
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,960
 way for me to understand it it's basically millions and billions of tons of biological

104
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,080
 matter pressed down you got oil over time and pressure makes oil with okay anyways

105
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,240
 there's been this theory that's been going around that that's not the only place where it's from

106
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,960
 so the theory is called a biogenic petroleum a biogenic petroleum and you you think of it as

107
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,280
 in the term asexual where it's like you don't have sexual interest a biogenic petroleum is

108
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,480
 petroleum that does not need biological matter to form so how does it form the earth has it

109
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,560
 inside of it it's almost like the earth's blood so the theory is is that this theory originally

110
00:10:50,560 --> 00:11:00,240
 gained traction in Russia where the scientists were saying it's possible that it doesn't oil is

111
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,560
 a natural resource that's intrinsic to all planetary bodies which would mean that the moon has oil

112
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,440
 that meteors have oil or asteroids that all the planets that have a rocky form have some form of

113
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,520
 oil now the the common understanding was that no oil is biological matter that's compressed over time

114
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,960
 so at first people or other scientists there was a lot of pushback from them what has what's happened

115
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,240
 is that when they've people have done tests in areas where there weren't they shouldn't be any oil

116
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,480
 if it's because of the biogenic thing I remember there was a researcher in Sweden I think it was

117
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,360
 in Sweden or Switzerland or one of oh I have a listener in Sweden hey if you're listening to

118
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,240
 this one maybe you can help me clear this up too there's one of the Nordic one of the high European

119
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,960
 states this researcher was like no there's I will prove there's oil there and he was able to drill

120
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,400
 an area that there shouldn't have been oil and it there was a trickily black substance and the

121
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,840
 scientists were like haha it's not oil and he's like well it's kind of oil so that's been the

122
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:14,720
 complication sciences had to come back and say that okay guys it is possible that there is some

123
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,600
 oil that is a biogenic we just can't access it science can't rule it out completely because tests

124
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,920
 have been done to show that it may exist you'll see some article I'm going to post two articles

125
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
 and as I researched more into it you'll see other articles pop up if you've researched it on your

126
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,880
 own and they're like well it's not that that's not true because it's there's not huge deposits of it

127
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,240
 so therefore it's not true so and and when you really dig into the the meat of it though science

128
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,520
 has to say it's possible it's just the oil that we're pumping out of the ground is definitely

129
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,840
 biological matter because we can find biological markers in it but it's also possible that oil

130
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,920
 in other parts of the planet are are um a biogenic and then the a biogenic people says

131
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,440
 that's all we're asking we're not saying that all oil is from the earth we're saying that some of

132
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,120
 it may be there's the argument too that the biological markers in oil we pump up is enzymes

133
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:21,120
 eating the oil so that was that's going to be our first conspiracy is is oil something that is just

134
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,760
 is it basically the lubricant for the planet could you drill anywhere deep enough and find

135
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:34,000
 oil reserves that's that'd be the question is all oil plant-based matter or is only some oil

136
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,880
 plant-based matter because even the i biogenic the a biogenic people aren't saying no all oil

137
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,360
 absolutely every single drop of oil is um this is this so i think that's an interesting conspiracy

138
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,480
 theory second conspiracy theory and then i'll go i kind of do a quick rundown of the end here the

139
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,280
 second conspiracy theory involves water now water is one of those weird substances that

140
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,480
 we don't really understand i mean we we're surrounded by it but we don't understand on

141
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,600
 the level of that and we i mean we have a basic understanding of it but it's the only liquid

142
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,200
 that it's solid form floats on the top and they'll say you know there's reasons why air pockets and

143
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,480
 stuff in the ice but it's still puzzling it's still interesting because every other form if you take a

144
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,120
 if you have molten lead and you drop a molten if you drop a solid piece of lead in it just sinks to

145
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,080
 the bottom every other um form of liquid if you freeze it or you make it a solid sinks but water

146
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,040
 it doesn't you know surface tension blah blah blah but it is something that's puzzling it's

147
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:45,840
 something that we're surrounded by all the time now one japanese doctor doctor masuro masuro

148
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,600
 emoto some of you people are probably like oh great he's going on this because he's he's fairly famous

149
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,720
 in this field you might be really the only one he's doing this in his field but dr emoto has a

150
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,600
 theory that he he feels that he's proven is that water is sentient water is intelligent it's alive

151
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:16,160
 and we can communicate with it now 70 of the world is water and 75 of our bodies are water

152
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,400
 that's not actually true i found out that men have more water in them than women or vice versa one of

153
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:29,200
 the two anyways anyways i probably should look that up anyways men and women have different volumes

154
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:36,400
 of water in them that being said dr emoto's theory is that you can take water and you can

155
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,880
 communicate with it and if you say beautiful things to it it will form beautiful ice crystals

156
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:52,560
 so if i have a glass of water and i say venessa i love you and i saw you in hood river at rosars

157
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:02,720
 at seven p.m. you're beautiful if i froze that water right when the ice crystals it's this weird

158
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,360
 timing he has so the ice crystals form and then he lets them melt and right when they hit zero

159
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,880
 degrees i don't know celsius or something yeah i guess it'd be zero degrees celsius he's from japan

160
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,960
 right when they the very second they start to melt he takes a picture of them and it'll be this

161
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:26,080
 most beautiful ice crystal in the world now let's say i have water and i go oh my swollen gums you

162
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,960
 are the representation of my swollen gums i just want to rub garlic all over this glass

163
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,240
 and then do the same thing freeze it and then right when it starts to melt it'll be this ugly

164
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,760
 won't be crystallized we'll just be like this ugly doll up and you can do it by saying nice stuff

165
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,520
 to it you can say do it by saying mean stuff to it if you play beautiful classical music the crystals

166
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,760
 are just intricately formed if you play heavy metal it's just like chaotic it's not from the

167
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,400
 vibrations necessarily because you've played the music and they froze it and so he's done all these

168
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,760
 experiments thousands tens of thousands of experiments oh he's dead i didn't know that

169
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,240
 anyways he's just looking at this he does tens of thousands of experiments on this

170
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:19,120
 and he says you know water ascension how we react to water water reacts to us and the reason why

171
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,920
 this is important because not only are we surrounded by water but we're mostly made up of water so the

172
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,320
 way that we think about our own bodies and the way we talk to other people influences the way that

173
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,920
 their water molecules are forming so it's an interesting theory i remember hearing about that

174
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,160
 the first time when i saw that old documentary down the rabbit hole it was the follow-up documentary

175
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,000
 to what the bleep do we know the only reason i watch it because i have a crush on marley mattlin

176
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,720
 and she was the star of that and armin shimmer man was in that too and he was quark on deep

177
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,560
 space nine but anyways anyways in that he they had this theory about water being sentient the way

178
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,640
 that she talked to water determines the water molecules so we see it in that brief moment

179
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,360
 when it's melting but if i every day drink a have a glass of water and i talk about how beautiful

180
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,720
 it is and i drink it i'm basically communicating with the water so again it's an interesting theory

181
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,600
 now i think it's interesting i think what you know going back to the whole water being fascinating

182
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,720
 thing i think water is is fascinating i go on and on about the depths of the ocean but one of the

183
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:30,560
 things that i've observed is humans relationship with water now as far as we know as far as we know

184
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:39,920
 liquid water is the most rare element in the galaxy we have not been able to really detect

185
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,560
 liquid water in i definitely in our solar system we've done those big telescopes and go oh maybe

186
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:56,880
 that planet has some water maybe but liquid water is so rare and we pee in it we poop in it

187
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,520
 we fill holes in our backyard with it we spray it on ourselves when we get wet

188
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,000
 well obviously we get wet we spray it on ourselves when we get hot

189
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,040
 we put it in little bubbles little rubber balloons and throw them at each other it's this

190
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,400
 increase it's more when we look at the galactic scale it is more rare than the most precious metals

191
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,480
 on this planet and we just treat it like it's completely replenishable it's completely disposable

192
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,440
 it's rainy and and it's just everywhere now i know there's countries that have water problems but i

193
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,280
 think you get where i'm going with it is that you know it's that's the most rare we talk about gold

194
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,640
 we talk about diamonds which you know aren't really that rare but we talk about rare earth

195
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 metals that we pull out of africa for cell phones and stuff like that but water when we look at a

196
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,000
 galactic scale water is the most rare thing in the galaxy and we treat it as an afterthought

197
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,360
 we mix powdered colored powder into it and drink it as kool-aid and it's amazing it's amazing when

198
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,680
 we look at it that way so to think that we're on a planet with all this water and not only is it

199
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,160
 here to help us but it's actually sentient and we can communicate with it in some way it I think is

200
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:23,920
 amazing on some level so i looked into both of those conspiracies over the years and both of

201
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,920
 these conspiracies are on the conspiracy theory list that i like to go through kind of the odder

202
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,800
 conspiracy theories the the deeper lesser known ones one of these conspiracy theories is absolute

203
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,440
 garbage pseudo science and the other conspiracy theory i think is possible and i'm really excited

204
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,640
 by the idea of it let's see if you can imagine which one i'm gonna give you a second i'll put some

205
00:20:48,640 --> 00:21:02,160
 little theme music right here okay so we're back i'm sure that you're like oh man which one which

206
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,360
 ridiculous theory is jayceen gonna propose is actually proof is actually possible right now

207
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,480
 is he gonna talk about water because aliens come from underneath it he's gonna talk about oil

208
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:27,840
 i think the idea of water being sentient is amazing but it's absolutely ridiculous and it

209
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,600
 is the height of pseudo science and like i said i watched that documentary and then i was like oh

210
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,480
 i'm gonna write his name down and i went and did some research on it now i i'm fairly skeptical on

211
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,640
 a lot of this stuff and i think i've kind of said in the past like if you show me something that

212
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,720
 proves that it's not true then i'm more likely to believe it that it's not true now when i looked

213
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,200
 into this the basically every skeptical article said listen this is the way that it works you take

214
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,240
 thousands of foot you yell at some water you talk you call water venessa and you say it's the most

215
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,400
 beautiful water in the world you take pictures of thou you take pictures of all these ice crystals

216
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,880
 you're going your premises that when you talk about it the ice crystals are more beautiful

217
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,360
 so what are you gonna do with all the photos you take where they're not beautiful

218
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,320
 will you dismiss those oh i took it at the wrong time oh i'm not gonna assuming he his heart was

219
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
 in the right place he was looking at and goes ah that was taking the wrong time that was taking

220
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,000
 the right time that one's beautiful put that one up that one's beautiful put that one up

221
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,760
 it's selective too selective there's no real control and he did start having a glass of water

222
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,920
 that he didn't say anything to and he's like well look at these photos they're just natural

223
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,680
 crystals but again this actual selection of the photographs and the photographs you're presenting

224
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:54,800
 as proof to us is is the issue if you made access if you said well i took one photo of each and eat

225
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,200
 this was each time like i took one photo just one photo of the beautiful glass of water and it was

226
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,360
 this crystalline form it laid laid more credence to his theory but people have tried duplicating it

227
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,240
 they haven't been able to or they've been able to but they have to take so many photos and

228
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,040
 they just cherry pick the beautiful ones i love the idea to think that water is sentient on some

229
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:27,600
 level i do believe that you know positivity and negativity go out into the world but again i could

230
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,200
 walk around town and be super positive to everyone and then one person be like thank you jason that

231
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,680
 would you gave me like hope that was such a great day and then tell everyone i have i exhibit some

232
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,880
 sort of positive energy i can cure people i can cure their bad moods and you're like well yeah

233
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,880
 you talk to a thousand people and ten people said that you helped them you know and then 50 people

234
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,200
 are like and then you know a bunch of other people just told you to slag off so it's just selective

235
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,720
 it's selective information and then of course as i was doing research for this podcast i did realize

236
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,680
 that i didn't know that he has passed away now but at the time he was selling like again he was

237
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,080
 selling products happy water water that people talk to and said beautiful things to him and you

238
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,960
 could buy it for an excessive amount of money and drink it and feel positive and that's just you're

239
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,160
 just ripping people off just throughout the theory he has some other theories about rice and i actually

240
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,320
 you know people have tried to people have tried duplicating that as well if you're nice to rice

241
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:33,120
 it doesn't spoil or whatever it's pseudoscience it's nonsense the oil thing which again this was

242
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,200
 a story that i heard you know maybe 10 15 years ago and found fascinating and again i had to do

243
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,720
 some more digging on this and as it stands right now the consensus is is yeah i guess it's possible

244
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,160
 it's not what we're pumping out but it's possible and so the scientific community is still more

245
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,760
 divided on on this on the oil issue and i think the idea of the planet actually producing a lubricant

246
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,640
 like oil is a natural substance that exists on every planet is fascinating is a fascinating

247
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:14,480
 thing it's just another layer to how amazing science works now again it's probably not the

248
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,880
 oil that you're putting in your car and even the even the people who are supporters of the

249
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,680
 a biogenetic what it was that you know the petroleum that doesn't have plant matter aren't

250
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,960
 saying that but i just think it's a made like that just shows another layer of mystery we don't know

251
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,520
 anything about this planet we don't know anything about the human body we don't know anything about

252
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,720
 the universe around us or the universe in the microverse or anything like that i find that fascinating

253
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,360
 that new stuff is being discovered stuff that we've taken for granted is being discovered today

254
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,040
 because like i said people have tried dismissing the abiogenic oil and

255
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,320
 the really the best thing to come up with is it's not in huge huge amounts at least huge amounts

256
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:02,560
 that we can access but if that's true if something that is as ubiquitous as oil ubiquitous you i think

257
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,120
 there's a t in there but something that's such a part of our life as oil you know that there's

258
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,600
 we're still discovering stuff about that i find that amazing and i don't believe in peak oil either

259
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,920
 if you believe in peak oil that fit fair enough to you but you know when i was a little kid i remember

260
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,280
 watching a pbs special with tony dan not tony danza who was the guy from cheers not tom selic

261
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:33,200
 ted ted dancin ted dancin he was one of the tea brothers as i call him along with tron and

262
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:42,160
 i don't know tommy keel figure anyways um i forgot his name again um ted dancin was doing a pbs

263
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,680
 special and he's like the african rainforest not the african rainforest the the amazon rainforest

264
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,480
 is going to be gone and this i was like and this is probably the 80s he's like by the year 1992

265
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,040
 the amazon rainforest will be gone and i remember being like super scared i'm like oh my god all

266
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,800
 these parents are going to be gone and we're just gonna and it's not it's not it's not we always

267
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,720
 hear these stories of these ecological disasters if you ever want to and i'm not saying pollution's

268
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,400
 great pollution we need to work on there are things that we do that don't help the planet and we need

269
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,840
 to control them the problem is is that we always seem to go and we go okay so if if we're polluting

270
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,600
 in 20 years the world would be uninhabitable if we're cutting down trees now in 20 years there

271
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,880
 will be no trees there are always this incredibly alarmist behavior with it if you ever want if

272
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,800
 you're like no jason you're an idiot and all this go to a used bookstore go online and buy books

273
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,640
 buy um you can do this with no ceramic books too all right if you want to have a you know a good

274
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,440
 laugh buy a no-strandomist book that was published in the year 1980 and they all say the world was

275
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,000
 supposed to end in 1997 like they're adamant about that fact but if you but you know that's all

276
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,360
 nonsense not stonomous is nonsense anyways he was a half of his prophecies were jelly recipes

277
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,280
 when you look at you can go buy books about ecological disasters um the coming ecological

278
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,560
 disasters buy books from the 70s and 80s and they're like by the year 1992 you know women will

279
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,480
 be barren and men will be half horses as the sun just pierces through the sky and melts everything

280
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,640
 you can watch how many science fiction movies from the 80s and 90s took place in a world where

281
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,920
 there was no more ozone layer this is all it's just this alarmist stuff yes there is a hole in the

282
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,080
 ozone layer yes we're pumping chemicals cfcs and stuff like that but the idea was like oh no the if

283
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,280
 we don't stop this now it's completely reversible and the world will be destroyed you know it's

284
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:50,160
 alarmism it's alarmism it's you're scaring people to sell books to to sell ideas to make money yeah

285
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,000
 that's that's what peak peak oil is in the dustbin of the ecological catastrophes i'm not saying again

286
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,840
 like oh no we need to cut down every tree in the amazon rainforest but go back and read those

287
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,680
 books or watch those specials that were done decades past and what they talked about just

288
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,600
 never happened it's never happened do i believe that climate change is happening sure do i believe

289
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,120
 that man is having a part in that climate change sure but when you but because i've been around

290
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,360
 for so long and i've been watched these ecological prophecies just fail just the same thing how many

291
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,920
 ministers do you have to hear say i've done the calculations and jesus is coming back this day

292
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,920
 like how many times do you have to say that before you start going okay i'm not going to listen to any

293
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,400
 of them so when you oh i people say climate change is really go yeah is your climate yeah sure it's

294
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,520
 you know the climate is changing and do you think man had plays part in well yeah sure i don't think

295
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,280
 i think you know we're having an impact on the planet and then they say yeah and then in five years

296
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,400
 everyone's going to de-evolve into a totes tool okay that's a strawman argument but they'll say like

297
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,040
 you know in in one year or 10 years it'll be irreversible we got to start doing stuff now

298
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:08,400
 otherwise the world's gonna be and i'm like okay guys let's talk on a on a on a smaller scale

299
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,840
 if you take it off to this is going to happen and the world world's gonna end and blah blah blah

300
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
 and the water levels are going to rise and all these cities are going to be destroyed

301
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,960
 just say hey stop polluting you you jason carverner stop polluting stop wasting stuff

302
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,360
 city of hood river stop polluting stop wasting stuff state of orgin stop polluting stop what

303
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:36,320
 that stuff and then you go and your water quality will get better okay let's we can work with that

304
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,280
 when you try to sell it as if you don't recycle the ice caps are going to melt

305
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,800
 you know and then france is going to be wiped off the map that you come on guys

306
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:57,760
 i know that's not true you know that's not true so that's my rant about i guess today is kind of

307
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,560
 like the ecological episode but that's my rant about that i i've just been burned so many times

308
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,040
 about these disaster scenarios that in 30 years you know 20 years from now people are going to

309
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,800
 look back and go oh my god yeah i remember when they were saying that england was going to get

310
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,440
 flooded and blah blah blah because we didn't do the x y and z and then it's not going to happen

311
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,000
 it's not going to happen you can take that to the bank when this podcast is broadcasting its

312
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,800
 five thousandth episode five thousandth episode i'll revisit this i'll revisit episode 23 and we'll

313
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:35,840
 talk about how it didn't happen the earth abides the earth abides it's a big place it's really hard

314
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,720
 for us to do lasting damage to the planet we can do damage to our local areas we can have you know

315
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,800
 damage and Fukushima that's going to be another story coming up but you know but i remember even

316
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,520
 then they're like oh all the fish are going to be gone california is going to be irradiated

317
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,400
 here's these tide you know in five years the yeah it's all nonsense it's all nonsense

318
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,160
 fear cells just remember that whenever someone's trying to scare you they're probably trying to

319
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:13,840
 make money at the same time so that's another episode of dead rabbit radio episode 23 i think

320
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,040
 we're almost at our 25th episode that's going to be a little landmark for me doing it every day

321
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,920
 so that's again this is a really good podcast for me i'm having a lot of fun doing it

322
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,960
 hope you guys are having fun listening to it like i said i'm seeing the downloads all the time

323
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,280
 and that just makes me feel like it's worth it we do have that youtube channel dead rabbit radio

324
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,480
 that is not getting a ton of hits but i think that's just more of the format of dead rabbit oh oh

325
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,400
 and i wanted to do a quick update a couple episodes back i talked about that guy who said his dog was

326
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,480
 spying on him i've kept in touch i've kept looking at that forum and he's hasn't done anything to the

327
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,600
 dog i kind of want that that story i kind of left you hanging i was like this guy thinks his dog is

328
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,720
 spying on him see you later and i was like you know i should retouch on that as far as right now the

329
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,600
 dog's still fine and hopefully the guy gets some help i don't think that anything bad is going to

330
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,520
 happen to the dog so that puts you at at rest then good dead rabbit dot com is our website you can
