1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 A comet from outside our solar system is headed our way, and the signs of the apocalypse have already started.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,500
 And then we travel to South America, to hunt a cryptid who feeds on human fat.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,500
 When the conquistadors came from Spain, did they bring one of their homegrown monsters with them?

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
 And does that creature still exist today stalking the streets of Peru?

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
 *I don't wanna sleep down, actually I'm a walkie-talkie*

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
 Still super sore from my workout yesterday.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
 Incredibly sore.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
 You know, despite my soreness, I've talked a little bit about this.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,500
 If you're a new listener, I started doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which has made me start listening to New Metal again.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,000
 And here's a question. New Metal? There's a lot of really bad New Metal.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And you guys are like, "Jason, that's not... there's no question attached to that. That's a simple statement."

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Here's my thing.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Have you heard that Limpis... I forgot that this song even existed. There's a song by Limpis, kid.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,500
 It was for the Mission Impossible soundtrack.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 And it has that awesome bass line.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 *singing* It's really cool rhythm and the lyrics are awful.

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
 He's rapping about... they're playing the Mission Impossible theme song.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,500
 So you figure that the lyrics should be about like, danger and getting away from stuff or going on some sort of adventure.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 And he's talking about how many fans he has.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 It's almost like the band went into the studio and they're like, "Dude, this is gonna be so kickass."

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,500
 And they're recording this song and then Fred Durst shows up and he's just like, "Yo, all my limo ride over a couple girls sat in my lap."

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
 The band's like, "What is this rap about missions being impossible?"

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,500
 Here's my question. Have they ever done a remake or a reboot of a song?

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 And not like a cover. You have a song with a great beat, awful lyrics.

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,500
 Has a music company, has a studio ever said, you know what, the song was a hit, but it could have been even better.

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 Let's scrap the original lyrics and put new lyrics on top of it.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 You change nothing about the music behind it.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
 Has that ever happened? Because you do it with movies all the time.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 You go, "Hey, Batman's great. People love the guy in the cape. The cape crusader. He's running around. He's running around."

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 But that last two movies sucked. Let's reboot.

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 We'll just keep key elements of the character.

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 And we've seen that with like Predator, all sorts of movies.

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 Have they ever done that with a song?

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
 Same thing with that saliva, there's a band named Saliva.

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
 Same thing with that saliva song, "Click, Click, Boom."

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 Great instrumental, great chorus. The song's about how he doesn't complain about his parents.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 "Click, Click, Boom!" And you're like, "What?"

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 The song's about how he used to sit up and listen to his radio while all the other kids were engaging in social activities.

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 "Click, Click, Boom!" You think it's an action song. They need to remake those songs.

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
 Do they remake songs? I don't know, that's my question to you.

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 Stay something in the comments, like and share, subscribe if you think Jason has officially become an old man wanting new metal remakes.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 Let's actually get started with the episode here, because we surprisingly have a lot of stuff to cover.

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 First thing is very, very brief. I saw in the news today, there's really no story attached to this yet, but I thought this was interesting.

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 December 2019, which is next month, which is well, a couple days ago, I mean away, the time loop, the time loop has already started.

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:48,500
 Oh, and remember, and I just got a notification on my phone, "Tomorrow on Thanksgiving we are doing the Thanksgiving YouTube livestream."

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 I don't know what I'm doing yet, so there you go for that preparation.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 I'm doing something, and I think it's going to start, I think I'm going to shoot for 3pm.

52
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 3pm Pacific Standard Time, Dead Rabbit Radio livestream.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 I have a couple ideas, I'm kind of kicking them around in my head, but join us.

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 You got nothing better to do on Thanksgiving, join us for the YouTube livestream.

55
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 Okay, let's get to the story though. December 2019, there is a comet coming towards our solar system.

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 And I'm telling you about this one, because it's interesting, it's a comet headed our way too.

57
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 It's from outside of our solar system, which is incredibly rare.

58
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,500
 But here's the thing, it was incredibly rare. The first time it ever happened in observable history was in 2017.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 That's when that Omu Mama came through, and some people were like, "Oh, it's an alien probe, it's coming from outside of the solar system."

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 Other people were like, "No, no, it's a big old rock." A lot of times they had drawings of it, and people thought it was the actual photograph,

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 and it looked like it was in trotty warship from Robotech.

62
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 But it just kind of flew through it, and we tried to see if it was an alien probe, if it was giving off any sort of signals.

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 When that happened in 2017, people were like, "Dude, this is the first time something's ever come from outside of our solar system."

64
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
 And now we have another object coming just two years later. So it is a little weird.

65
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 On an astronomical scale, that's a weird coincidence.

66
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 But this guy coming is named Tuai Borisov.

67
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 It's going to pass by us in December of 2019, and it's going to be two solar units away, or AU, I think is the term,

68
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 "astronom," I don't know. It's basically the Earth to the Sun, it's two of those distances.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,500
 So it will probably see it. I don't know if we can see it with the naked eye. Probably.

70
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 If you can see Mars with the naked eye, you can at least see a little dot. You'll probably see something.

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 Now, people are going to be like, "Oh, it's the end of the world. It's going to fly by in December 2019,

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 and 2 plus 0 plus 1 plus 9 is 12, and then 12 plus 12 is 24, and then 2 plus 4 is 6."

73
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 And I forgot to go to the bathroom three times yesterday. Three times six is 666.

74
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 This is the sign of the beat. We're going to be getting all of this doomsday stuff over the next couple weeks.

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 It's going to be absolutely insane. All the numerology.

76
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 Well, if you take all the letters of Borisov and Tournament of Numbers and add them up, it equals out to the eighth number, and all of this stuff.

77
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,500
 So buckle up, because the loonies are coming out for the next month, and then nothing will happen, and they'll come out for some other disaster.

78
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 However, I did find one of the signs of the apocalypse actually happening.

79
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,500
 This comment may actually be the end of the world, because tell me if this story doesn't sound completely unnatural.

80
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,500
 Let's hop in the Carpentercopter and we're flying to Chatham, Ontario.

81
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 The city where the ham never stops chatting. Chatham.

82
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:38,500
 Chatham. There must have been a guy named like Jerry Chatham, because there's no other reason why they would name a city Chatham.

83
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 It doesn't make sense. Now this has officially become a Jerry Seinfelds produced podcast.

84
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 What's the deal with Chatham? Hams don't talk.

85
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 Candle laughter. Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. Whatever that musical key was.

86
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 I never watched that show when it was on. I watched it when it was syndicated, but I never watched it when it was new, because I hated those musical interludes.

87
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 They were just close enough to jazz for me to hate them.

88
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 I think I watched the last episode, the night it aired, but I never watched it while it was brand new, because it was just enough jazz.

89
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 I'm going to make a shirt that just says "just enough jazz," and it's a picture of me clutching my fists, destroying musical notes in my fists.

90
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 Anyways, I got a lot of people who are upset about my jazz rant a couple episodes ago, and "Blay, Blay," I think that's how you pronounce your name,

91
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 sent me a list of recommendations for jazz music, and I appreciate it.

92
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 I'm just not a fan of brass instruments, or jazz in general.

93
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 I'm not a fan of saxophones or trumpets or tubas or any of that stuff.

94
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 I think maybe in a past life I died in a foundry.

95
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 I was killed by the T2. I sacrificed myself. I just don't like metal instruments.

96
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 Anyways, maybe a steel drum. Maybe a steel drum.

97
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 But anyways, so I'm crushing musical notes with my T-shirt.

98
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 We're in Chad Hamm. It's November 2019, so it's this month. The apocalypse is an eye.

99
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 Someone's driving down the road. It's snowy outside.

100
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 That's another sign of the apocalypse. It's snowing, because everyone hates snow, especially me. No snow zone.

101
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 And they see a dog kind of like huddled up in the snow, and they're like, "aww, that's sad. It's a big old puppy. It's a big old two-year-old puppy."

102
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,500
 And they're like, "Wait a second. That's kind of weird. Why is this dog out here, and like, why--it's sitting weird.

103
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 Does it have hymroids? That should always be your go-to whenever someone isn't sitting properly.

104
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 Yeah, you got hymroids? They're like, "No. I just have my wallet in my back pocket." You're like, "Oh, okay."

105
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 But dogs don't have wallets nor back pockets. He is sitting weird, though. So the person glicks a little closer,

106
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,500
 and this big old dog is cuddled over five baby kittens.

107
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 And the person's like, "Oooh." And calls animal control. It's like, "Get down here with your biggest net, and then five little nets."

108
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 We have a situation. So animal control shows up, and they're like, "Oooh." And the dog at this point is like, "Dude, just please help me.

109
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 I'm freezing cold. Freezing cold." And the little kittens are, "Meow, meow."

110
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 So they scoop them all up with just one giant net.

111
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 "Oooh." No, the dog and the kittens all came peacefully. Now, they named it. They don't know who the dog is.

112
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 It was a stray dog, and they don't know where the kitten mom is. The kittens are taken into animal control, so is the puppy.

113
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 And it's adorable. It is a sign of the apocalypse. Cats and dogs living together. The great Peter Vinkman said that.

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 But the story does have a sad ending. No, none of them died. It's not that sad. But the animal control, the shelter says,

115
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 "We have to adopt them out to different families." Because people have said, "Well, the dog was taking care of the kittens.

116
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 Are you going to let someone adopt all of them?" And they said, "Here's the thing. As adorable as that is,

117
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 they want to get the animals out of the shelter as quickly as possible."

118
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 So you want to get the dog into what they call the forever home, which actually sounds like where the Demogorgon lives.

119
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 You go to the forever home. It doesn't sound like a good place, but that's the term they use.

120
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 They don't want to have these dogs. You know there's foster care for animals?

121
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 Where you don't adopt a dog, you just let it chill at your house for a couple of days at your house.

122
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 Your house is how humans are supposed to say it. You let the dog chill at your house for a couple of weeks, and then you give it back up.

123
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 And you have the... So they're saying you can't adopt all of them because the kittens won't be ready to leave the shelter for months and months.

124
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 They're that kitten. Actually, now that I think about it, what if this story isn't as heartwarming as we thought?

125
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 Because where's the mama cat? What if the dog ate the mom and was keeping the kittens warm for future meals?

126
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
 He's like, "Mmm, kitten McNuggets." He's just sitting on them.

127
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 But anyways, these cats were so young, it's going to take months for them to be able to get their forever homes.

128
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 And then the dog is going to get it. The dog's now named Serenity and going to be adopted out soon.

129
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 So maybe they'll have a reunion. Maybe someday they'll have a reunion.

130
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
 Maybe someday the cats will get older. They'll be out at their own houses.

131
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 And then one day they'll remember that bleak night with the dog's Serenity savagely eating their mother.

132
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 And then the five of them will have to team up. They'll each learn a different martial art.

133
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 And then the kittens come up and they start beating up this dog.

134
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 And then nobody... They just find a dead dog one. What is... How did this get so bleak?

135
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 Anyways, James Wan, I know you listen to this podcast.

136
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 It's the reverse of Air Buddies or it's Air Bud colon Snow Buddies underline the revenge.

137
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 So Air Buddies is the title of the series. And then the subtitle is Snow Buddies.

138
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 And then underneath that you'll put the revenge.

139
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 And the cover will be a dog sitting there in like the shadows.

140
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 And he's looking over for five black kittens. Sorry, there's five of them.

141
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 There's five black kittens standing there in the shadows as well.

142
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
 The whole cover is just a black box. You don't see anything. It's all shadows.

143
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 And then you turn the box over. I'm totally describing.

144
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 They even have back of the boxes now that you have red box.

145
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 You turn the back of the box over and it's like a fun family romp says Richard Ebert.

146
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 Richard Ebert. That's a... What is... Okay, never mind.

147
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 I've totally gotten lost. Let's go ahead and just go aww at the sight of five little kittens and a dog.

148
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 As there's plotting their revenge and the dog is like, "I hope no one finds out that I hate their mom."

149
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,500
 "Hope I get adopted to a good house." A good house with lots of delicious kittens.

150
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,500
 We're gonna leave Serenity and the kittens behind. And we are going to Peru.

151
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 Let's hop into Dead Rabbit Rowboat. Let's take the Dead Rabbit Rowboat to Peru.

152
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 We haven't used it in a while. So let's start rowing, dude. All the way from Chat Ham.

153
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,500
 We're rowing. I got a bunch of hams with me and I'm like, "Talk to me, damn it. Talk to me."

154
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 I'm like, "That joke again, Jason? Really? You're gonna end the story on that joke?"

155
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 I'm like, "Yeah, just talk to me." Anyway, so we're rowing off to Peru.

156
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 And a little bit of Bolivia. And a little bit of Bolivia.

157
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 So we're hopping out of the boat. We're walking around Peru.

158
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 And here in these jungles lives the Pish Taco.

159
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 The Pish Taco, despite its funny name, is an incredibly deadly cryptid.

160
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 And oddly enough, it comes from Spain. You see, after the conquistadors came to South America,

161
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 you had the dudes with the muskets and the armor slowly taking over the continent.

162
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 And you had the friars, you had the priests walking around in their big old robes

163
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 and their funny-looking haircuts, preaching, converting the natives.

164
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,500
 But you also had another more deadly creature.

165
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 Now to the natives he was seen as a man.

166
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,500
 A white man, a Spaniard. With a beard.

167
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 A kind of a big brimmed hat.

168
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 A belt made out of something that looks human.

169
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
 Now it didn't actually look like a human. It didn't have two arms, two legs, and a little head.

170
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,500
 The material looked like it was made out of flesh.

171
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 And this white man would stalk through the jungles holding a giant knife.

172
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 And he would find you, a young native, running through the jungle.

173
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 You're just doing track. You're not running from anything. You're just exercising because you got the big track meat

174
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 at the Olympics coming up that don't exist.

175
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 I'm sure they had some sort of Olympics. I know they were throwing heads and baskets and stuff like that over there.

176
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 But I'm sure they did some sort of sports. We'll just assume they were doing track at this point.

177
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 You're running through the jungle.

178
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 You come out of the jungle checking your pulse.

179
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,500
 And then a white man appears with a knife. And you're like, "Oh, this is one of those dreaded Conquistadors I've heard about."

180
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 And he goes, "No, I'm not a Conquistador. Come here, young native boy."

181
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 Or, "Girl, I don't know who's listening. I don't know who's listening to this."

182
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,500
 And you feel mesmerized. You walk over. And before you can even react,

183
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 you're split open with this large knife.

184
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 And you can actually feel.

185
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 And as you fall to the ground on this dirt trail, the middle of the jungle,

186
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 the last thing you feel is lips on your stomach wound.

187
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,500
 And you can feel him sucking the human fat straight from your body.

188
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Have everyone enjoy that turkey tomorrow.

189
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 This guy is human as he is. He's classified as a cryptid. It is a monster.

190
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 It is a fabled legend dating back to like the earliest record they have of him. It's 1574.

191
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 You had these friars talking to these people, these priests.

192
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,500
 I think might be the actual technical word, but talking to these natives.

193
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 And it was only a short time after the Spaniards came over that, which I don't think Spaniard is a racist term.

194
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 I don't think it is in that context. It might be. So I apologize, Spanish people.

195
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 But they would say the natives would not come to a house that had Spaniards in it.

196
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 He's going to keep using the word, isn't he?

197
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 They would not come to a house that had Spaniards in it because they were afraid that they were going to get their fat eaten out of them.

198
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 It wasn't just the fat being eaten out of them.

199
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,500
 The natives of, especially in the Andes region, their great God was known as Veracocha.

200
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 Veracocha is their creation God. It was the dude who was like, "Here's the sun. Here's the moon. Here's the earth."

201
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 It was their great one. Veracocha means sea of fat.

202
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 They considered fat, the human fat, to be a sign of good will, of good luck, of health. The bigger you were, the better off you were.

203
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 And if you were sick, it was because you didn't have enough fat. It was kind of their life-giving essence.

204
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 So when the Conquistadors were coming over here, they brought a tradition from Europe where you would use human...

205
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 This is true. This is historically true. You would use human fat to treat wounds.

206
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 So the natives were watching these people come, these white men come from another country.

207
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 And they'd have a battle, throwing tomahawks and arrows versus muskets and Spanish steels.

208
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 And in the aftermath of the battle, they'd be like, "Hey, Sanchez, bring me some of that sweet, sweet native fat.

209
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 I got this cut on my arm. Give me some of that old school neosporin."

210
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 And they were scooping out fat and rubbing it on their wounds.

211
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 And to a group of people who worship, maybe not worship, but who value human fat, that was absolutely disgusting and blasphemous.

212
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 Now obviously, if you were happening to be in a situation where you saw a guy like fall on the ground and scrape his knee,

213
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 and another guy fall on the ground and die, and the guy who scraped his knee cut the dude open, started rubbing human fat on his knee,

214
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 you'd be grossed out too. But this also had a whole level of religious significance to it.

215
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 There was... I don't know if this part was true. That part was true. I don't know if this part was true.

216
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:38,500
 There were rumors, and it sounds true, there were rumors that because the metal guns and the cannons, the weaponry of the Spanish,

217
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,500
 was rusting out so quickly in this new environment, that they were using...

218
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,500
 They were also using human fat to... not polish, but to lubricate the weapons, especially the cannons.

219
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,500
 You needed some stuff in there to keep those balls nice and glistening, so they look shinies, they're coming at you,

220
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 and also you needed to lubricate them so they don't get stuck in the cannon and kill 30 men.

221
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 The natives said that they were killing the people to use your human fat to make their weapons to kill more people.

222
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 You know the reason why church bells ring so beautifully? Human fat.

223
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 The natives were like, "We don't know, there's no way that you can make this bell sound so, so sweet."

224
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 So they must be using human fat. We already know that they are using human fat for these other things,

225
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 so we can't trust the religious class either. Because see, then the story of the Pistach...

226
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,500
 This is really, really interesting, I really like this story. Then the story of the Pistachos started to change.

227
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 It was no longer just a white man wearing a white-brimmed hat and wearing kind of like this loose collection of clothing.

228
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 Now he was being spotted specifically as a conquistador in the armor, or a friar in monk robes.

229
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 But this creature is not able to be stopped. We look at a lot of cryptids and they're like, "Throw three pennies on the ground."

230
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 And the creature will try to bend over to pick up the pennies, and then if it's noon and the sun hits the back of its neck, it explodes.

231
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 We've seen so many of these cryptids. This one has no weaknesses. And exists as far as we know today.

232
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 Because now the legends are no longer the Spaniards are coming over here. Still using that word, don't know if it's races are coming over here to cut out the human fat to lubricate their weapons.

233
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:37,500
 Mills. You go to the mill, has this sweet machinery that's working like a charm, never breaks down.

234
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:45,500
 Natives believe it's lubricated with human fat. The only reason why jets can fly the way they do, human fat.

235
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Now you go, "Okay, Jason." So a bunch of bumpkins in the middle of the Andes Mountains see a plane fly by and they think that Fat Albert is working for Boeing.

236
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 There is bumpkins living everywhere.

237
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:08,500
 1987. This rumor swept the country. The president, so back in the 80s, they might still be around, but there was a terrorist group.

238
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 As far as I know, they're a terrorist group. I was a kid when this all happened, so I didn't look too much into it. But back then, I think they are considered labeled terrorist group.

239
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 Shining Path was like a group that was trying to overthrow the government of Peru.

240
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 And it was a long running struggle between the legitimate government cut, between the government of Peru and this offshoot, this group, trying to overthrow them.

241
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 The people in the country began talking. A rumor had started. Peru was in economic troubles and the president needed some money they didn't have.

242
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 But he did have an enemy that he wanted to take care of and they had a resource that was worth money.

243
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 So the rumors spread through the cities that the president had found 5,000 pitch tacos to go into Shining Path territory to slaughter them.

244
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:12,500
 They could eat some of the fat, but the rest of the fat would be shipped back to the president.

245
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 He'd get his little scoop. No, they'd be shipped back to the capital and then shipped off to Europe to pay off the debt.

246
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,500
 You can see at this point, now we're in the late 80s, the colonization has been completed.

247
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 You have entire swaths of the country that are half Spanish and half native, which is basically the main population.

248
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 You still have indigenous people there. You still have full blooded Spanish people, but the main population is kind of this mixture between the two.

249
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 So the idea of a white man walking through your neighborhood in the middle of the night is no longer scary because there's white people everywhere.

250
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 They're no longer an anomaly. And at this point, the legend of the pitch taco actually starts to change.

251
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 The pitch taco is no longer a white person. It's a non-local or non-rural person, rural as in farm.

252
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:10,500
 I can't really say that word, but the legend starts. The creature is still there. I mean, he got 5,000 of them.

253
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 I don't think anyone would even think there were 5,000 Bigfoot in America. This is still a real threat.

254
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 This is still a real threat in this country. People believe in this thing.

255
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 Now you go, Jason, it just sounds like a serial killer. This doesn't sound like a cryptid in the sense that it has some sort of powers.

256
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 The thing with the pitch taco is one of those creatures that you either run into and die or you don't run into at all.

257
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 There's more of a level of a vampire type character. The reason why we know about vampires through all the fiction,

258
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 but like a historical vampire, you either died and you never told your story or you survived because you didn't end up running into these ones.

259
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 There is a story I came across that the pitch taco would hold its hand up and its fingers would fall off.

260
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 And then it would start wriggling around on the dirt like worms.

261
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:07,500
 It's completely shocking to you. And while you were taking in the sight of those worms, it would slit your belly open and start eating your fat out.

262
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 And you go, "Jason, you got it told to stand eight minutes ago." I go, "Yeah, yeah, I forgot about that part."

263
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 But anyway, so it definitely does have some sort of cryptid qualities. It's just not a team of serial killers.

264
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 Werner Herzog, the film director, the acclaimed film director, and he's also in The Mandalorian.

265
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 I know bounty hunting is a complicated business. That show is so dope.

266
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 Now, I don't want to oversell it. It is like a Western, but I really, really love that show.

267
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 He got accused of being a pitch taco when he was filming Fitz Carrero? Fitz Corraldo?

268
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 There's this movie, there's a story about a guy who wanted to move his boat over, I think it was the Andes,

269
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,500
 but he wanted to move a boat from one side of South America to the other, so he took it over the Andes and then took it to the other side.

270
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 And Werner Herzog wanted to make a movie about that, but he wanted to be realistic.

271
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:08,500
 So he built the same size boat and filmed them actually taking it over the mountain. The dude's a madman.

272
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 But they also asked if he had seen The Mandalorian, he's like, "I don't watch Star Wars. I don't watch Star Wars movies."

273
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 I'll be in the television shows, but I don't watch that. He says, "I watch WWE because I think it's what the people watch, but I don't watch Star Wars stuff."

274
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 So the dude is a madman. The dude is quite awesome.

275
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 But anyways, he was also in Jack Reacher. That's the most of the things that I know him from, Mandalorian and Jack Reacher.

276
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 He got accused of being a fish taco. 2009. This is going to be a long episode, because I can't really skimp on this part here.

277
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 2009, Lima, Peru. Three gang members are arrested.

278
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 Now, generally, if I don't know how it is in other countries, in America they do it, in Mexico, South America they do it as well.

279
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,500
 I think they do it in Russia too. A lot of times when they do these drug busts, they'll have a table with all the evidence on it.

280
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,500
 And sometimes, they do this a lot in South America and Mexico, they'll have the culprits there as well, the accused there as well.

281
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,500
 They don't really do that in America, because they have to have the trial first.

282
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 But you'll have in Mexico, you had these three dudes, you had this bunch of police, you had a table, and you had two bottles of something called Inca Cola,

283
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,500
 which is like actually a pretty dope name for a soda, because it's where the Incas actually live.

284
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,500
 That's so funny that that actually exists. Sounds like a joke, Inca Cola. What the gods drink.

285
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 But you have this thing down there called Inca Cola. There's two bottles and there's like a yellowish liquid inside these bottles.

286
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 And there's a photograph of a human head. They didn't actually bring the human head out.

287
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 And the police said, "Ladies and gentlemen, we've arrested these three men. They've confessed to over 60 murders."

288
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,500
 What? The audience is like, "That's kind of weird of that. I thought I was here for that new Inca Cola release."

289
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 That delicious flavor, a salty yellow goodness. And the cops are like, "No, no, no. Don't drink that. Don't drink that. It's evidence."

290
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 And you don't want to drink it, even if it wasn't evidence. They've confessed to over 60 murders.

291
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 They've led us to the body of one of their most recent victims. Here's a photograph. Here's a photograph of his head.

292
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,500
 We'll notify the family after this press conference. Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah."

293
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 The reason why they've been murdering people, it's people get murdered in Peru. It's sad. There's a lot of drug dealing, especially where this happened in this small community.

294
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 But these men were not murdering people over drugs or drug deaths or anything like that. These people were murdering over this.

295
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:38,500
 And the police officer picks up the Inca Cola. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a bottle of human fat.

296
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:48,500
 These gang members are Pish Tacos. And everyone's like, "Click, click, click, click, click." Everyone forgot their cameras that day, so they just go, "Click, click, click, click," and move their fingers around.

297
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,500
 But then eventually someone does get a camera and actually takes photos of what was going on.

298
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 These people were labeled by the local authorities as actual Pish Tacos.

299
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 And apparently this gang, this is what they said. They were being paid by these two Italian mafiosos, $15,000 per liter of human fat.

300
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 That they could give to the mafia. And then the mafia was taking it to Europe where it was being used in cosmetics.

301
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 Now, this story, if you think that's weird, it hasn't even started yet. Because at this point, everything goes off the rails.

302
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 The media starts looking at it. I mean, imagine this. Imagine if all of a sudden, the feds, the FBI held a press conference here in America.

303
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 And they're like, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have found out that every sighting of Bigfoot was actually a blood gang member."

304
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 People are like, "What?" "Yes. The bloods have infiltrated the Pacific Northwest, parts of the Southwest United States.

305
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,500
 They are all seven feet tall and have giant feet." People are like, "That's not... Lil Wayne is a blood."

306
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 And he's not saying, "Well, save your questions till the end."

307
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 By the way, every Chupacabra attack was actually a member of the Latin Kings. People are like, "What? What is going on?"

308
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 It would be the equivalent because you have these guys who are arrested, who have bottles of human fat in front of them.

309
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 And they're basically saying that these guys are a mythological creature.

310
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 Now, the DA, or the chief of police came out and said, "We're just calling them Pistachos. We're not saying these are actual creatures of them,

311
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,500
 but they're definitely engaging in Pistacho-like behavior." The two Italians apparently left the country.

312
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 They tried arresting them. They said, "There is a man-wide hunt for these two Italians." We're going to find these guys.

313
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 Now, as the media goes nuts, they start investigating this. And what almost seems like a coordinated effort.

314
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:58,500
 You guys remember Gamergate? You guys remember that where it was just like one day, all of a sudden, every headline to the exact same thing.

315
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 And that was like, "Gain culture is dead." Like, "Fandom is dead," or whatever.

316
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 So whatever your opinion on Gamergate was, it was this weird, like, bam, the next day, Kotaku and Giant Bomb and all these websites basically had the same thing,

317
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 ready to go, the same type of article, ready to go. That's what happened here.

318
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 Because all the articles are up. You had all these articles come out and say, "We talked to someone who worked at a liposuction clinic,

319
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 and they said, 'We have barrels of fat. There's no way you would have to pay $15,000 for fat. People pay us way less than that just to pull it out.

320
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,500
 We just have it sitting here. We got a flush down the drain. No one's paying $50,000, $15,000 for fat. That doesn't make sense."

321
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 And all these articles are like, "This story doesn't make sense. There has to be something else going on. This story does not make sense."

322
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:54,500
 Despite the fact that you have these people, you do have a body. They found a body. You do have the container of human fat.

323
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 Now, the newspapers begin investigating this as the story is not real, which is their right, obviously, but it seemed oddly coordinated.

324
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 The first thing they do is they contact the police department, because this is being held somewhere else.

325
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,500
 This guy got arrested. These three guys got arrested somewhere else. They contact the police department where there's 60 murders supposedly took place.

326
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 And that police department says, "We found out about this on the news. We have not heard anything about these 60."

327
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 And they go, "Yes, there have been a lot of people disappearing in our region, but we're one of the main drug trafficking hubs."

328
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,500
 They also said that what they're saying, $15,000 for a liter of human fat, that's more than coke.

329
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:43,500
 That's more than you and me moving an equivalent amount of coke. So they said, "We just think it's ridiculous. We don't think that's true."

330
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,500
 They start interviewing this expert. This one expert goes, "What are you going to do with human fat?"

331
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 It starts to go bad within 30 minutes. You pull human fat out, it starts to go bad after 30 minutes.

332
00:31:51,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 It's completely useless in any sort of medical procedure. And the idea of extracting it and selling it for $15,000 to a cosmetic company that's on the other side of the planet,

333
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 it's going to lose all of its gooey, gooey goodness by the time it gets to Milan. It's just not going to work.

334
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 And so this is where the story sits right now. This happened in 2009 and it disappeared in a month.

335
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,500
 It was a hoax. This is what the media is saying, it was a hoax.

336
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,500
 And I read that and I was like, "Oh, okay." And I kind of continued on with my research and I thought,

337
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:34,500
 I went back to this whole thing and I go, "And hoax in what way? Were the criminals like just actors? Was this an upright citizens brigade gone wrong?

338
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:46,500
 Was this an improv class gone wrong?" No. So apparently these guys were actually criminals and they did confess and show the location of at least the one body that was all chopped up.

339
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 There's no answer to whether or not the bottle actually contained any human fat. Apparently what they would do is they would cut the heads off the people and like eviscerate them,

340
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:02,500
 hang them up and, "Happy Thanksgiving guys!" Hang them up and then put candles underneath them and it would melt the fat into Inca cola bottles,

341
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:09,500
 which they must be loving this publicity. Inca cola must have been over the moon when all these stories came out.

342
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:17,500
 It would take these empty Inca cola bottles. The human fat would drip out of the body into the bottle. It's a very inefficient way to gather human fat, I would imagine,

343
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,500
 but people said that's stupid, that wouldn't work. But here's the thing, those people were actually arrested. No one was saying those people were fake,

344
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 no one was saying that the body was fake. The only... this story now is known as a hoax, but this is the only reason why they think it's a hoax.

345
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:40,500
 Three days earlier, there was an investigative journalist came out with an article implicating police in the region where these guys were arrested.

346
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:48,500
 So the crimes are apparently taking place somewhere else, in all these little secret shacks around Peru and this other province, but these three guys were arrested in this other area.

347
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 Sorry, I don't have... it was Lima. Lima where these three guys were arrested. They... in this area, the police chief who was in charge of this whole investigation and a couple other people,

348
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:08,500
 this investigative journalist wrote an article saying that the police chief helped cover up 46 murders by the police department.

349
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:18,500
 So the police department was doing extrajudicial killings, basically punisher style vigilante stuff at best, at worst, they're killing drug dealers and taking their money.

350
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:26,500
 But generally extrajudicial means, I can't prove in the court that you're a bad guy. Well, I don't have to prove it anymore.

351
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:36,500
 So this article comes out three days before and then all of a sudden the police chief is walking around with a yellow bottle of Inca Cola, slams it on the table and goes,

352
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 "Any questions?" and everyone's like, "Oh my god, this is the biggest news story. Mythical creatures." And if these guys aren't actual mythical creatures, they're doing stuff mythical creatures do.

353
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:53,500
 That's it. It's known as a hoax simply because of the timing of it. The police chief was removed from office. His superior goes,

354
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 "Can you prove to me any of this is real?" And apparently the police chief goes,

355
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:08,500
 "Other than the bottle of fat, the three suspects and the location of the shop to body, other than the fact that they're saying they did this, I can't prove any of it."

356
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:18,500
 And the guy goes, "Get out. You're fired." I technically fired him, removed him from office. He may be back now because this all happened back in 2009, but I couldn't find any proof of him coming back.

357
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:25,500
 And Interpol said, "International manhunt, we know nothing about these two Italians." So when the police chief goes, "Oh, we're all looking for them."

358
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:34,500
 Interpol said, "This isn't true. As far as we know, this is the first we've heard about this story." So it's such a bizarre...

359
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,500
 A reporter says that these guys are killing people on the slide.

360
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 Three days later, a gang is shown to possibly admitting to committing crimes that are on the level of a mythological creature.

361
00:35:49,500 --> 00:36:00,500
 Sixty murders to sell a human fat. The media immediately goes into, I don't believe that mode, which again is a fair mode to be in because we're talking about a ridiculous situation.

362
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:09,500
 But within days, the whole story comes, it's a hoax. The only reason this is out here is to cover up this story that happened three days before.

363
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,500
 But they can't prove it's a hoax. It's a very, very interesting thing. They can't prove it's a hoax, just the timing is suspicious.

364
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:25,500
 But for a creature that stalks the jungle, that changes shape according to the times that it's living in,

365
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:35,500
 that can be a lone straggler walking through a darkened street looking for a sweet meal,

366
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,500
 or a population of over 5,000 integrated into society.

367
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:48,500
 The best thing they could hope for is that their existence is considered a hoax.

368
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:59,500
 Because then, only the bumpkins believe in them. Only the people out in the fields believe that these creatures exist.

369
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:09,500
 And when you hunt humans, your best weapon is their ignorance of your existence.

370
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:27,500
 A deer that is shot is a deer that does not know what a gun looks like. And a human who is devoured by a pitch taco is a human who believes that they don't exist in the first place.
